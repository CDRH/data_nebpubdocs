Docket No. 21059 t Races on petroleum and its products from Kansas fields to certain cstinations on the Burlington's St. Francis branch. This file covers the complaint relative to the charges assessed on certain shipments of petroiiMim and in which complainants seek reparation. The Nebraska Commission intervened at the hearing, which was held September 17, in Omaha, before Examiner Clark. As yet no decision has been en - tered in this case. I. C. C. Dockets No. 14953, 14750, 17001, 20958 and 21125 lh&lt;!se dockets involve primarily the question of rates on petroleum from the Kansas City groups, the Southern Kansas group and the klahoL'iu group to Nebraska stations. In these cases complainant ontends that the rates to Nebraska destinations were unreasonably ligh. Complainants also sought a more direct route thro lgh Super - or, Nebraska, with the benefit of the shortened mileage rather than le routing through Kansas City as is now in effect. Reparation wat&gt; lso sought in these cases. Hearings were held at Kansas City on ■eptember 10 and 11, which a representative of the Commission at - cnded. The Interstate Commerce Commission has not as yet handed down a decision in these cases. I. C. C. Docket No. 21710 This docket involved the rates on petroleum and its products from points in Wyoming to destinations in Nebraskn. Complainants con - tend that the rate to Omaha should act as a maximum to other sta - tions in Nebraska such as Campbell, Franklin, McCook and Elm Creek. The rate 1o these points varied from 40% cents to 45 cents per on« h indred pounds, whereas the rate to Orraha is 36 cents per one hun - dred pounds. Complainants seek reparation down to the basis of 3fi cents. The Nebraska Commission eontemnlates filing a petition of in - tervention and presenting testimony at the hearing. No date for the hearing has as yet been set. I. C. C. Dockets No. 21605, 21605-1, 21507, 21507-1 and 21753 These cases involved the rates on petroleum and its products from thp Kansas group, the Oklahoma srroun and the Texas group, to primary stations on the ('. &amp; N.

It is ex - pected that hearings will be held on these dockets the early part of I. C. C. DOCKET, 17000 CASES CLASS RATES— I. C. C. Docket 17000, Part II This docket referred to in the Commission's 1927 annual report, was continued into 1928 and hearings were hold at several additional cities. The last hearing was held April 5 to May 2, 1928. in &lt;Jhirag\&gt; nnd the record completed covered 12,513 pages of transcript. The Nebraska Commission introduced additional testimony with relation ship to the terminal costs and other statistical data. Testimony was also introduced regarding the freight and passenger business on th various roads both in Nebraska and the Western Trunk Line dis - trict. Briefs were filed July 16 and it is the desire of the Interstate Commerce Commission to render a decision on the class rate situation in the early part of 1929. Hence, there still remains considerable work to be done in the consideration of this case before final briefs are filed and oral argument heard. I. C. C. Docket 17000, Part 7, Grain Rates In connection with this part of the docket 17000 inve indicated in the Commission's previous report, numeroi have been held before the Interstate Commerce Commis: parts of the Western District, the final hearing being in the latter part of 1928. This case ii structure throughout the entire Western District and it is hoped that the rates in Nebraska will not be disturbed. The Commission quite confident, from tlio testimony introduced by the rate de) artment of the Nebraska Commission, that no increases in rates haw been justified. There were about 55,000 papes of testimony introduced in this record, which includes the local situation, the milling in transit situation and movement, for export. As a matter of fact all phf\-»es of the grain movement have been reviewed before the Interstate Commis - sion ami never before has there been such a comprehensive resume of the grain rate structure. The initial briefs were filed December 31, 1928. It is the hone of this Commission that a decision will be ren - dered by the Interstate Commission in time to take care of the 1929 crop movement. I.

As yet no decision has been handed down by the Commission in connection with the live stock rate investigation. I. C. C. Docket 17000, Part 10, Hay KAs indicated in the Commission's last annual report, hearings on e hay rate situation throughout the Western District with a view of bringing about a more harmonious adjustment, were set for September K, at Minneapolis, and Oetobei 1, at Chicago, with other hearing to be Id in other parts of the country in the early part of 1920. This is also a case where the Interstate Commission desires the cooperation of the various state commissions, and it is expected that one of the members of the Nebraska Commission will sit with the I. C. C. during his investigation. CASES HEARD ON BEHALF OF THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE k COMMISSION BY THE NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Finance Docket No. 6879 was filed with the Interstate Commerce onvnission on the ~th day of May, 1928, by the Yankton, Norfolk and Southern Railroad Company of Yanktor, South Dakota, for a certifi - cate if public convenience and neees=;it\ authorizing the construction of a line of railroad extending from Yankton to Pierce, South Dakota, through Cedar, Knox and Pierce counties to Norfolk, in Madison county. Nebraska. tTlic' Interstate Commerce Commission invited the Nebraska State Iway Commission to conduct the hearing, because of the local na - e of the application. Chairman Randall heard testimony at Yank - , South Dakota, on July 30, 1928 Many interested parties were [1 offered evidence and exhibits as to their views regarding !"•&lt; E' need for the proposed line of railroad. As the Interstate Cominis - n asked this Commission to make recommendations after hearing evidence, the application was taken under advisement. Recommendations of the Nebraska Commission were forwarded to Washington on September 10, 1028. after a very careful review of the testimony, exhibits filed and arguments offered. This Comnvssion recommended that the applicant company be given a certificate of convenient and necessity for the construction of the contemplated line, as there apneared to be ereat neeo for a more direct svstom of railroad transportation facilities between Yankton and northenstern Nebraska. These recommendations annear at length in Part III, of this volume of the Commission's report. </seg>

SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: Now on this twenty-fifth day of June, 1928, this matter came on for consideration before the Commission upon the written statement and application of the defendant suggesting that in lieu of the require - ments of the order of the Commission in this matter heretofore made on June first, 1927, (20 N.S.R.C. 153-156) ; that said original order ie vacated and set aside and that a new order be entered requiring the defendant to refrain from blocking said crossing at Thirteenth Street, NTorfolk, by switching operations in excess of five minutes at a time, so as to not unduly hinder automobile traffic on said highway, and ap- Droving the proposal of the defendant to substitute regular crossing watchman at said crossing from 7:30 a. m. to 11.30 p. m., daily in lieu of having said switching operations over the crossing flagged by the members of the switching crews. The Commission believes that said proposal to install regular crossing flagman at said crossing as suggested by the defendant will be a more satisfactory arrangement than the arrangement outlined in the Commission's original order herein and that said arrangement wili adequately protect the safety of automobile travel on said Meridian Highway over said crossing and, therefore, the Commission feels that tis in the public interest to vacate and set aside its original or&lt;Ur rein.

Hearings on the complaint were held at Commission offices on November 1, 3927, and November 25, 1927.

(Final order of the Commission was withheld pending preparation : statement by complainant as to the exact amount of reparation due ader Commission findings, the same to be submitted to defendant car it and reviewed and to be returned to the Commission by defendant itih its approval or disapproval. Such compilation was prepared by omplainant but included therewith were certain shipments not in ided in the original complaint, some of these relating to the subject tatter set forth in the complaint and others having to do with alleged ivment of freight charges twice. t Defendant has filed with the Commission formal objections to the try of final order awarding any reparations for the following reasons: "First, that the freight charges on said shipments were aseer tained, computed and collected strictly in accordance with the express order, direction and command of the Nebraska State Railway Commission which was in full force and effect el the time and has never been during said time modified or changed. 'Second, it was not alleged in the complaint that the rule of defendant's tariff, providing that the weight of gravel should be ascertained by ascertaining the cubic contents of the load and applying thereto a rate of 3,000 lbs. per cubic yard as ordered by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, was unreasonable or unjust at the time it was in effect and there is no order or find - ing by thik Commission tjiat at the time said rule was in effect and at the time said shipments moved that said rule was un - reasonable, unjust or otherwise unlawful. "Third, that said rule and tariff was published and estab- Eished by defendant in reliance upon the order of this Commission and at the time said shipments moved had not been changed or modified and has not since said time been changed or modified by said Commission with respect to the period in which said shipments moved. 'Fourth, that said rule was by the order of this Commission dated February 15, 1926, cancelled, amended and changed so that thereafter it was provided that the weight of gravel ship - ments should be ascertained by applying the rate of 2,800 lbs. per cubic yard, but said order of February 15, 1920, was not retroac - tive in effect and made no attempt to modify or change said rule prior to said date and said Commission in said proceeding made no order or finding with respect to the reasonableness or un - reasonableness of said rule prior to February 15, 1026, and this defendant respectfully represents that there is no evidence before this Commission that at the time said shipments moved said rule </seg>
            <seg id="p140">140 Before discussing these objections a review of Commission orders relating to the subject matter seems appropriate. In the Commission'-, original order in Application 5702, dated December 15, 1924, 17 N. S R. C. 489-495), upon application of the carriers to publish rule re - garding assessment of charges on carloads of sand and gravel no weighed over track scales, the Commission prescribed certain methods tf ascertaining car contents and provided among other things that "The weight of the contents of a ear will be ascertained in the following manner: 'The cubic yards of sand or gravel contained in the car shall be ascertained by proper measurement and to the cubic yard so found the following estimated weights shall be applied : On Sand 2900 lbs. per cubic yard. On Gravel 3000 lbs. per cubic yard." P, order was to become effective not later than thirty days from date of same. The opinion and finding also recited that, "If it develops that further consideration should be given to the estimated weights herein provided the matter can be set down for further investigation by the Commission." Ehis latter excerpt is set forth to show that in so far as the weights ere concerned there was a possibility of further Commission attention sing necessary and advisable. Supplement Xo. 1 to this order entered under date of January 16, 1925, extended the effective date of the original order to February 9, 1925. h Supplement No. 2, entered under date of February 3, 1925, (18 i.C. 281-283), modified the original order in certain respects but nued in effect the weights to be applied as found in the original E Under date of October 7, 1925, further hearing before the Com - ion was held on the question of the weight of sand and gravel cubic yard. At the time of this hearing studies were presented le carriers with respect to such weight based upon actual handling he commodity. Testimony was also presented by some of the its of sand and gravel. Following this hearing and based upon testimony and studies which were presented at the time, Supple - ; No. 3 to the original order was entered under date of February 1926, (19 N.S.R.C. 237-239), wherein the Commission modified of the original order as to weights per cubic yard of s commodities and provided in part as follows : "(b) In case of a controversy between the consignee or consfi'mor and the carrier as to the weights of the contents of a 'calr billed as per paragraph (a) of the original order, the weight of a car shall be ascertained in the following manner: </seg>

The Commission desires to discuss seriatim the objections raised by defendant as above set forth: "FIRST. Contention of applicant embodied in this paragraph s correct. Freight charges in controversy were collected under tariffs which were published in compliance with Commission order and which order has not been modified or changed in so far as the rule covering the period in question is concerned, except as the opinion and finding originally entered herein so modifies with respect to part - cular shipments. However, to hold that because of this fact a shipper s precluded from seeking reparation, would nullify all reparation iroceedings under the statute (Section 5500, Compiled Statutes of N'ebraska, 1022) since all intrastate rates in Nebraska are by legal •equirement subject to Commission approval before becoming effective. The reparation statute cannot be nullified by that method of reasoning. There is no merit to this contention. "SECOND, while it may be true that complainant did not defin - tely allege in his complaint that a weight of 3,000 pounds per cubic ard for gravel "was unreasonable and unjust at the time it was in effect", it is the opinion of the Commission that such an issue was aised in the pleadings. Complainant does refer to the use by defend - nt of "a unit of 3,000 pounds to a cubic yard of gravel", and does efer to the charges as "in excess of lawful rate". It does not appear that defendant carrier can complain that it was caught unaware and that this was not an issue raised in the pleadings. It is true that complainant, subsequent to the filing of tine original complaint, a - mended the same to make certain that that particular issue was before the Commission. This will be discussed more in detail subsequently. The fact that the Commission has not previously found that this veight "was unreasonable or unjust at the time it was in effect," cer - ainly does not preclude it from giving consideration to this question nder proper complaint in a reparation proceeding. In fact, it ap - &gt;ears that the reparation statute contemplated granting to the Com - mission, autihoriy to hold hearings on complaints, that the very uestion of whether, at the time they were in effect, rates were unjust r unreasonable might be determined and, if found so to be, to make ward accordingly. "FOURTH, the substance of the objection carried in this para - graph has been previously discussed. It is desifred, however, to refer </seg>
            <seg id="p142">142 TWENTY- FIRST ANNUAL REPORT to that portion of the objection in this paragraph which alleges "that there is no evidence before this Commission that at the time said shipments moved said rule was unreasonable, unlawful or otherwise unjust." It is conceded that at the time of hearings on this part - icular complaint no testimony was presented as to the reasonableness or unlawfulness or injustice of what might be called the 3000 poum l&gt;er cubic yard rule. However, as previously mentioned, the t ominiw sion in its original order suggested that further consideration to th question of weights per cubic yard might be found necessary. Cer thinly the Commission is charged with judicial notice of its own pro ccedings and orders. Accordingly, official notice must be taken of th fact that prior to the hearing &lt;&gt;n this complaint, but B&amp;bsequeni to th shipments involved, the Commission modified its original order namin 3.000 pounds per cubic yard a&gt; a weight unit and ordered thai in ap plying the cubic contents of the car to determine weight upon which rates were to be assessed 2,800 pounds per cubic yard for gravel should be used. This modification was made only after hearing 'he presentation of much testimony on tha! particular question and tin- careful consideration of all the fai Accordingly, it would appear that at the hearing on this complaii there was no occasion for the presentation of furthetr testimony vvii respect to this weight matter, particularly on the part of the eon plainant who accepts such finding and order as a basis tor a portion i his complaint. It, of course, is alleged by no one that a cubic yai of gravel, because of any circumstances, weighed more prior order of the Commission in its Supplement No. 3 to Application N 5702 supra, than after entering the order. Certainly there is i merit to the contention now made that, "there is no evidence betoi this Commission" as to the reasonableness, lawfulness or justice &gt; that, portion of the rule which has to do with the weight of the aam&lt; commodity when consideration is given to final order of the Commii sion in its supplement Xo. 3 supra, to the original order which wi entered after a careful and thorough investigation into the particuli Question of how much a cubic yard of gravel weighs. It is desired to discuss a still further objection presented by defendant not above set forth, viz., that the complaint herein was filed with th. Commission on August 3, 1925, asserting' and claiming that cer - tain charges were excessive and unlawful because ascertained, as shown by said complaint, by inaccurate measurements and in violation of a certain tariff. It was not charged in said orginal complaint that the rule requiring the weight of gravel to be ascer - tained by applying a rate of 3,000 pounds per cubic yard was unreasonable or unlawful and that it was not until the second learing on said complaint held by this Commission at Lincoln Nebraska on Xovember 25 1927 ' ■) ' • </seg>
            <seg id="p143">143 Dei i r f con -t time that &gt;aid rule was unreasonable and complainant eived permission over objection of defendant to ataend its complaint and to allege and charge that it was unreasonable to ascertain the weight of gravel by applying a rate of 3,000 pounds yard, instead of 2,'SUU pounds per cubic yard and de- |&gt;LM fendant respectfully alleges and represents that until said "25th day of November, 1927, there was no complaint on file with, this Commission claiming that said rule was unreasonable or unlawful and claiming reparation on account of the application there- rtdant further alleges that in the statement prepared by complain - t'ollowing the finding of the Commission in this matter, setting i the ears on which reparation is sought there . . . are 305 cars tabulated and made a part hereof, the same as though fully set out herein, on which tnc freight charges were fully paid and collected more than two years prior to said November 25, 1927;" that "the total amount of reparation therein demanded on said cars being $1)57.07 and, with respect to such cars and each of them this defendant ob - jects to the entry of any order allowing complainant reparation because of said freight charges, so claimed to be unlawful and unreasonable, were charged, collected and paid by the complain- ant more than two years prior to the filing of said complaint as amended Section 5500 of Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, reads .Hows: "That if, after hearing on a complaint the Nebraska State Railway Commission shall determine that any party complainant has on and after the taking effect of this Act and within two years next preceding the filing of the said complaint paid unjust or unreasonable rates or charges to any defendant railroad or express company in this state on intrastate traffic or has on and after the taking effect of this aort and within two years next preceding the filing of said complaint suffered damages by reason of the maintaining, publishing, demanding, charging, re - ceiving or retaining by such carrier of any rate or rates, charge-;, rules, regulations, services or practices on intrastate traffic which are found by the Commission to be unjust, unreasonable, unjustly discriminatory, unduly preferential or otherwise unlaw - ful, the Commission shall make an order directing the railroad or express company to pay to the complainant the sum to which he is entitled on or before a day named." This section appears to give the Commission plenary power in the ideration of matters involving reparation. Complaint havng filed under this section the ( onvmission has before it the entire </seg>
            <seg id="p144">144 TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT question of whether there has been paid by complainant "unjust or unreasonable rates or charges to any defendant railroad ... in this state on intrastate traffic" on shipments moving "within two years next preceding the filing of the said complaint." Accordingly, it appears that the injustice or unreasonablness of rates for any reason, upon the shipments involved in the com - laint is a matter for consideration by the Commission under the pleadings. It is true as alleged that the original complaint herein referre only incidentally to the weight unit which was used in computing tota lading. The Commission previously referred to this and expressee the thought that pleadings in the original complaint definitely placed iu issue the question of the weight unit used. It is also true, however that at the time of hearing on November 25, 1927, complainant wa. permitted to amend the original complaint over objection of counse for defendant, to definitely include as a further basis for reparation the reduced weight unit on gravel ordered by the Commission; also that if the date November 25, 1927, be used in determining the two yea period allowed under the statute, shipments involved in the complain are excluded from Commission consideration under the limitatio period. The Commission does not find that the statute should be inter - preted so narrowly, or that it should be bound or limited by any such strict rules of pleading as contended for by defendant. The original complaint raised the question of reparation under the statute on cer - tain named shipments. The amendment to the complaint, did not change the issue hut rather added another basis for determinin? damages. The Commission still had before it only the question of whether the rates on shipments named to the complaint were just and reasonable, and to whether complainant, because of possible damages suffered, was entitled to reparation. The authority to amend is in harmony with procedure of the Interstate Commerce Commission in consideration of similar subject matter under somewhat similar federal enactment. The federal agency has consistently held that where complainant in petition seeks re - naration down to a certain basis but at hearing asks that damages be awarded to a still lower basis, objections by defendant that reparation cannot be awarded to the lower basis sought because of the request therefor beinsr made after expiration of the limitation period are not well taken. Omaha Steel Works, et al., v. A. T &amp; S. F. Ry. Co., 87 I. C. C. •404. Shrevecort Creoseting Co. v. Louisiana &amp; Pacific Ry. Co.. et al., 92 I. C. C. 519. Los Angeles Press Brick Co. v. Director General 98 I. C. C. 45. In this connection, the Commission also calls attention to Section VII of its Rules of Practice which provides : </seg>
            <seg id="p145">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 145 "Amendments to any petition or answer in any proceeding or investigation may be allowed by the Commission in its discre - tion, and allegations of new matter in an answer shall be deemed to be denied by the complainant or petitioner." Attention is also directed to Section XVI of these rules which is as follows: "Practice. The Commission will be governed by the practice which obtains in the district courts of Nebraska so far as the same is applicable under these rules." tit seems proper also to refer to Section 8656, Compiled Statutes Nebraska for 1922, reading as follows: "Amendments in furtherance of justice. The court may, eithelr before or after judgment, in furtherance of justice, and on such terms as may be proper, amend any pleading, process, or proceeding, by adding or striking out the name of any party or by correcting a mistake in the name of the party, or a mistake in any other respect or by inserting other allegations material to the case, or, when the amendment does not change substantially tshe claim or defense, by conforming the pleading or proceeding to the facts proved. And whenever any proceeding taken by a party fails to conform, in any respect, to the provisions of this code, the court may permit the same to be made conformable thereto by amendment." It should be noted that the amendment in question in this action ''does not change substantially the claim". All testimony presented as pertinent to the original complaint is also pertinent to the complaint as amended. Neither did the amendment require the presentation of rdditional testimony nor was there any presented. It is the opinion of the Commission that this objection is not well aken: that the amended complaint does not constitute a new cause of action but that it merely sets forth an additional basis for reparation nd that it is properly related to the subject matter contained in the iriginal complaint. T T nder the pleadings the Commission has before t the reasonableness of the rates charged and it is found that the ssue was not enlarged nor was there any new issue presented by the amendment in question. Further objection is made by defendant to certain shipments which, were included in final statement prepared by complainant, some having to do with reparation and some alleging the payment of freight charges twice, the same not having been included in the original complaint, and rot havinsr been presented prior to the expiration of the limitation period. This objection must be sustained. Specific shipments are ietf erred to in the complaint filed within the statutory period, the in - formation therein set forth relating to shipments being supplemented by more detailed information in exhibit form. Additional shipments </seg>
            <seg id="p146">146 which are outside the statutory limitation period at the time they were first called to the Commission's attention cannot now under the law be included. Claims which have to do with the possible payment of freight charges on the same shipment more than once, of course, have no place in a reparation proceeding; Complainant is not without re - lief, however, for recovery of overcharges actually paid can be se - cured through proper procedure. Accordingly, the Commission finds that with respect to those shipments referred to in the original complain! herein, complainant paid within two years next preceding; the Filing of the complaint, un - just and unreasonable rates and charges to defendant carrier in so far as, and to the extent that. :t.000 pounds per cubic yard of gravel exceeds 2,800 pounds per cubic yard: also, to the extern that Midi rates and eharges have been increased as a result of applying 3,000 nounds as the unit of weigh! for a cubic yard of gravel, rather than 2,800 pounds per cubic yard. Complainant in the paying of same has suffered damages to that extent and payment should now be made by defendant carrier to complainant in amount equaling such damages. The Commission will expect complainant to prepare statement of re - i a rat ion due him on the basis above set forth, covering those ship - ments referred to in paragraph three of the formal complaint. Thi~ - statement shall be referred to defendant for such review and check as it cares to make, and unless objections are offered as to accuraej or correctness of such compilation, reparation in amount therein el forth shall be paid bj defendant not later than thirty days from th receipt thereof. The Commission will expect complainant to submi this statement to defendant at his early convenience and not later tha ■s provided in the original opinion and finding the Commis that, under the circumstances existing, defendant should no ed to pay interest on the reparation allowed. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Compaa) bt, and the same is, hereby directed and ordered, within thirty days after receipt of statement to be prepared and submitted by complain - ant, to make reparation to said complainant herein, on these shipments referred to in paragraph three of the formal complaint, in amount equivalent to the difference between the rate and — or charge computed on a basis of 3,000 pounds per cubic yard of gravel, and the rate and — or charge computed on a basis of 2,800 pounds per cubic yard of gravel.

Docket No. 11672. "Inasmuch as there are points without Nebraska that are shipping into this state on the (rates as promulgated in Docket 11672, we believe! it to be advantageous to all concerned that this scale be adopted within the state of Xebraska, so as to have uniformity between competitive points. "We also desire that this schedule be placed into effect for the reason that the provisions of Docket 11672 eliminate any arbitrary change on shipments moving over more than one line, and that under the present scale of rates in Nebraska, the ship - pers are compelled to pay an arbitrary charge of one cent, and we think that this discrimination should be eliminated. "We are aware that the rates in Docket No. 11672 for the shorter distances are slightly higher than the present scale which we have in Nebraska; however, the rates for the longer distances are reduced and we believe that such a change in rates ■would be advantageous to us."

It developed in the complainants' testimony that they were not complaining of the unreasonableness of the rates, nor was any specific complaint made on the unfairness of the rates.

Appearances: For the complainant— E. E. Sandoz, Verdigre; t Frank Sourek. Verdigre. or the defendant — Joe Schwartz, Winnetoon A. J. Miles, Winnetoon : JI. W. Ciainlall, Winnetoon. OPINION AND FINDING CURTISS, Commissioner: Ris action arises upon complaint of Washington &amp; Western •lie Company of Verdigre, hereinafter called complainant, a- Farmers fnion Telephone Company of Winnetoon, hereinafter iefendant, and relates to the distribution of revenue realized srtain toll charges. Hearing upon the complaint was held at ision offices on September 4, 1928. The facts in the case are not in dispute. Complainant operates a telephone exchange at Verdisrre. Defendant eompan; operates a telephone exchange at Winnetoon, nine miles distant froi Verdigre. Defendant owns a toll line between these two points o which is also carried wires serving 1 farm line subscribers of bot companies. Complainant uses this pole line in serving certain of i1 farm line subscribers, one wire being carried thereon for distanc about 3!/2 miles out of Verdigre, payment for the use of the lin being made to defendant. Klie toll charge for service in either direction is ten cents *Y&gt;r i to station calls and fifteen cents for person to person calls, the present basis for distribution of toll revenue between the mpanies, complainant receives twenty-five per cent of the revenue </seg>
            <seg id="p151">151 realized from toll calls originating at Verdigre, seventy-five per cent uiiinir to defendant company. Defendant keeps all revenue realized tiom toll calls originating at Winnetoon. i Complainant alleged that in the past, defendant company had mdered switching service to a farmers company, the Knox County ompany, switching about twenty farmers who lived in a territory tntiguous to both Winnetoon and Verdigre; that upon the payment an additional twenty-five cents per subscriber per month by the sub - ribers of the Knox County Company, free service was given these bseribera to complainant's exchange through Winnetoon, although no venue was realized by complainant company for service rendered. C'lulaiit company admitted that this practice had been indulged in for •ric.il dt time, but stated that for a number of months last past, lair lull charges had been collected from these subscribers for \ erdigre, the flat rate provision having been abandoned. Complainant also alleged that the flow of toll traffic was pre- ponderantly from Winneton to Verdigre. Substantiating this con - tention, complainant presented records which had been kept for a ree-months period. They showed an average of 292 calls a month tun Winnetoon to Verdigre and 143 calls a month from Verdigre to innetoon. If the toll revenue during this period were to be figured on a basis of all calls being station to station, defendant received, $29.20 per month from calls to Verdigre and seventy-five per cent i : s 14.30 on calls from Verdigre to Winnetoon. Complainant received twenty-five per cent of $14.30 or $3.57 per month. It alleged this amount to be entirely inadequate for the switchboard and operator's ~t nice which was rendered on all toll calls, and for time spent on col - lections of those calls originating at Verdigre. [Complainant also stated that it had made proposals to defendant purchase one-half the toll line between these points, following which 11 revenue was to have been divided on an equal basis. These pro - sal- for purchase had been rejected. Witnesses for defendant mpany stated at the hearing that defendant had no desire to sell y portion of these properties. Reference was made to the charge collected from complainant ompany by defendant company, for use of its toll line in carrying trm line wires of complainant. The Commission has always held at such charges are a matter of agreement between the parties of terest, and outside its jutrisdiction. Witnesses representing both companies were friendly and ex - pressed a desire to be fair and reasonable. It was conceded by all that the revenue now realized by complainant was entirely inadequate to (Compensate for sen-ice rendered. The toll charge is a small one and the total gross revenue involved is not of large amount. After some discussion, agreement was entered into by officers </seg>

M. in Seward county, averring that at that point of said crossing a condition exists which is extremely dangerous to person and property. This complaint was accompanied by a plat showing the location of the highway, railroad and railroad crossing. As Seward County has a quasi-government, known as not only commission districts but also township districts, before the case was set down for hearing, an amended complaint was filed on September 1, 1928, by the County of Seward and "M" Township Seward County, collectively. Notice was served on the railroad company on the orig - inal complaint and also on the amended complaint. On September 10, 1928, the railroad company filed an answer to the original and mended complaint and the case was set down for hearing at Beaver rossing to be heard on the twenty-seventh day of September, 1928. Jne of the reasons for the delay in the hearing of this case was in rder to give the complainants and the defendant company an oppor - unity to make a settlement between themselves without the necessity f a hearing. Negotiations were had between the parties, but they ■ere unable to come to any definite understanding; accordingly, the 'ontmission heard testimony on the original date set. Previous to the hearing the county commissioners and the attorney 'or "M" Township, Seward County, the attorney for the railroad ompany and the engineer for the railway company, and the Railway Commissioner made a personal inspection of the crossing in question nd then proceeded to hold the hearing. Mr. Philip Maurer, chairman 1 "M" township board was sworn and testified until the noon hour. )uring the time intervening between the adjournment for lunch and the reconvening of the Commission in the hearing, the complainants and the defendant company, by its attorney and engineer, came to an f-eement, whereby they desired to stipulate a settlement of the case, Commission was willing to accept this stipulation as its judgment the settlement of the complaint. The stipulation was dictated to the reporter of the Commission, &gt;y the attorneys for both parties in the case, in the presence of parties concerned and was unanimonsly agreed to. It was definitely under - stood and the stipulation so states, that the stipulation should form he order of the Commission and should be so considered and should &gt;e carried out by them in the same manner as if the orde* had been written by the Commission in the first instance. The stipulation en - ered into will constitute the finding and order of the Commission.

OPINION AND FINDING CURTISS, Commissioner: tThis action originates upon formal complaint of National Sand Gravel Company, hereinafter referred to as complainant, against </seg>
            <seg id="p156">156 TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quiney Railroad Company, hereinafter referred to as Burlington, or defendant, wherein complaint is made as to the present rate adjustment covering movement of sand and grave from complainant's pit between Louisville and Cedar Creek, locatet on tracks of defendant carrier. Complainant prays for an order directing the establishment of a switching rate of $6.30 per ear from it pit to Louisville, the same to be absorbed where movement goes t&lt; connecting line, the Missouri Pacific. Hearing was held at the Com Eission's offices on June 22, 1928. In addition to parties directly of terest in the pleadings, A. A. Godt, A.G.F.A., Missouri Pacific, en - red an appearance and offered some testimony. The facts in the main are not in dispute. Complainant's pit was opened last spring and shipments were first offered in the fore part o May this year. According to testimony of complainant, the pit is 2.6' miles distant from Louisville transfer and slightly over a mile distan from the station at Cedar Creek. Testimony of defendants showed the pit to be 2.77 miles east of Louisville and 1.21 miles west of Cedar Creek. Approximately 350 cars of sand and gravel had been moved from the pit between the time of opening same and the date of this hearing. As many as fifteen cars a day have been moved from the pit, complainant alleging that under 24-honr per day operation, twenty-five cars a day could be loaded. Across the Platte river in the same section, on the Missour Pacific Railroad, is located a sand and gravel pit owned by the Lyman Richey Sand Company, this pit being 2.14 miles distant from th Louisville transfer. Between one and two miles west of Louisvili on the Burlington tracks is located another pit owned by the Lyman Richey Sand Company, the testimony showing, however, that the mining of sand and gravel at this pit had been abandoned some severa months ago. It seems proper to also point out the location of other industrie in this territory, though they are not in competition with comlplainant The National Stone Company have a plant on the Missouri Pacifi Es the Platte iriver from Louisville, approximately 2.7 miles from oint of Burlington transfer at Louisville. This same eompan . plant on the Burlington between Louisville and Cedar Creel ly more than two miles from Louisville. LThe rate situation with reference to these respective industries is follows: Shipments from the Lyman-Riehey pit located on the Missouri Pacific across the Platte river north of Louisville, move into Louis - ville on $6.30 switchimr rate which is absorbed by the Burlington on shipments moving to Burlington points. b Shipments from the Lyman-Riehey pit located on the Burlington of Louisville move into Louisville on a *2.25 switching rate which </seg>
            <seg id="p157">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 157 is absorbed by the Missouri Pacific on shipments moving to Missouri Pacific points. As above noted, testimony indicated that this pit had feen discontinued and defendant witnesses stated that for that reason, le Burlington contemplated the filing of an application with the Com - ission requesting authority to cancel this particular switching rate, ueh application has not as yet been filed. However, the question of whether or not this particular rate is cancelled now, is unimportant in the consideration of this action. Cancellation of the rate at this time because of abandonment of the pit, is no indication that it was not considered by defendants a proper rate situation at the time of its publication, or even at the present time. Such action furnishes no information as to the proprieties or merit of the rate. Failure to request cancellation of same far other reasons must lead the Commission to conclude that defendants regarded it as a proper rate situation while the pit was being operated. t Shipments from the National Stone Company plant located on the ssouri Pacific across the Platte river north of Louisville, move into uisville on $6.30 switching rate which is absorbed by the Burlington shipments moving to Burlington points. Shipments from the National Stone Company plant located on the Burlington east of Louisville move into Louisville on switching rate of $6.30, which is absorbed by the Missouri Pacific on shipments mov - ing to Missouri Pacific points. Shipments of sand and gravel moving from complainant's pit to Lincoln or Omaha, or points intermediate, take the Omaha-Lincoln 3-cent scale authorized to theise points. To all other points the Ne - jraska mileage scale applies, with joint through rates where the ship - ment moves to connecting lines. There is conflict in the testimony as to whether distance is figured from the pit, or from Cedar Creek. Com - &gt;lainant insisted that, on shipments moved in the past, distance had leen figured from Cedar Creek plus mileage to the pit. Defendant's estimony was that distance had been calculated from Cedar Creek. Xo instances were referred to by either party where the rate would have leen different, when calculated from Cedar Creek, than from Cedar "reek plus mileage to the pit. Because of the zoning arrangement it is relatively unimportant which calculation is used. In an occasion - al instance the additional mileage to the pit, if used, might place the movement in a further zone and increase the rate accordingly. Under requirement of defendant, all billing is done at Cedar Creek station. As stated above, complainant's demand is that it be granted a ; 6.30 switching rate into Louisville, the same to be absorbed by Miss - uri Pacific on shipments moving to Missouri Pacific points. Com - plainant contends that the refusal to grant such a switching rate re - nlts in gross discrimination and makes it impossible for it to contend ! or business at stations north and south of Louisville on the Missouri 'acific, though this is territory which it might properly aspire to serve. </seg>
            <seg id="p158">158 In support of this contention it is pointed out that if the joint through rate were to be applied, a one cent arbitrary resulting in a additional cost per car of approximately flO.OO (plus the mileas charge from Cedar Creek to Louisville) is positively prohibitive; i fact, the additional charge, it is alleged, exceeds the profit in th gravel. Cross-examination by counsel for defendant developed th fact that some shipments had actually been moved by coiuplainai to Missouri Pacific points under the two line .ioint distance scale However, it was claimed that they were movng at an actual loss. E'omplainant alleges that its plant should be regarded as a Loin - industry. Its pit has never been designated as a station. It ; that it is located between Louisville and Cedai Creek, though tini&gt; it is closer to Cedar ''reek than Louisville. Louisville is the on point and a larger city. Complainant's employees are from ville: its telephone service is rendered from the Louisville ex - e and its light and power comes from Omaha through Louisville plant. e Attention is also called to the rate situation existing with r ther industries in this territory, some of whom it is in ; tetition with, the same located on both the Burlington and Mi fie tracks. These have been pointed out previously, being Lrravel pits of Lyman-Richey Sand Company on both the Mi fie and the Burlington, and National Si. me Company plants 01 Missouri Pacific and Burlington, in each instance the nam nan E- enjoying a switching rate to Louisville with ahsc. ■ges. Switching charges from sand and gravel pits at c points iti Nebraska were pointed out. though it was adj ainant was not involved in a competitive way with the Defendant contends that, the pit being closer to Cedar Creek than Louisville, Cedar Creek is the proper station from which to handle the shipments. It is also pointed out that switching -rates are usually established to serve industries located at the service station. It is further alleged by defendant that complainant's proposal defeats the purpose of joint through rates. Defendant also showed that in an instance or two, complainant had been advantaged to the extent of one-half cent per ewt. by billintr from its pit rather than from, Louis- A review of the tariffs of Nebraska carriers shows no uniformity of action in the establishment of switching rates. The carriers have apparently never followed a ireneral rule which could be applied in the determining of what is a proper switching rate. In fact, tariffs would indicate that no individual carrier has been able to adopt for itself a general rule concernimr this matter which it has adhered to in the establishment of switching rates on its own line. Furthermore, this Commission has established no definite precedent which can now be </seg>
            <seg id="p159">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 159 pointed to and used as a positive guide. Witness Drigga of the Burlington conceded that in determining whether a switching rate was proper, distance from the station, while a prominent factor, was not all controlling. Neither did he think the location of the yardboard I as ;i controlling element. It was his opinion that switching privileges Lonld not be irranted to industries outside yard limits and that yard mits should adhere closely to the confines of the municipality. In fnrlnsioii, he expressed it as his opinion that all switching rates on is commodity should be cancelled and that rates should apply from e pit without any origin or destination switching absorption. In the consideration of this matter, the Commission has before it local problem only. Its conclusions herein do not. in fact could not tder the pleadings and the record, have to do with any question other m what is a fair, reasonable and equitable rate for the movement in question. The lack of any well-established principles adhered to by the catrriextB, or previously defined by this Commission, governing the promulgation of switching rates, makes it necessary that the equities based upon purely local conditions. It is the Commission's conclusion that the prayer of complainant hould be granted. The pit is located between stations. Accordingly, switching rate from same to Louisville violates no recognized prin- ciples of rate-making which have to do with the movement of com - modities from station to station. Objections voiced by defendants to it- establishment, apply with equal force, in the main, to other in - dustries in this same territory on the Burlington, and also on the tissnuri Pacific. While it is true defendant has no control over rates the Missouri Pacific, the Commission feels that consideration miisi given to the fact that almost equi-distant from Louisville in the tne sec! ion as complainant's pit, across the Platte river, is located Missouri Pacific tracks the pit of a competitor, and that this com- petitor enjoys the switching rate with absorption privilege, which Kmplainant desires, whereby it is enabled to compete with complainant an eqnal basis at Burlington points. The Coii'iiiission is not at this lime condemning these switching rrangements provided by both the Missouri Pacific and the defendant or other industries in this competitive territory. The fact remains, io\vever. that the practice of both the Missouri Pacific and defendant Arlington, has been to grant to other industries in this territory, •hose plants are located similarly as is complainant's and some of hom are in direct competition with complainant, switching rates into .nuisville. It is only proper that the same switching arrangement lould be granted complainant. {Testimony was presented by A. A. Godt.

            <seg id="p160">160 TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT amount equivalent to the switching charge. The Commission is not impressed with the Missouri Pacific's contention, particularly in view of the fact that it is granting to a shipper on its lines, located under very similar circumstances, the privilege which complainant desires from the Burlington, and the Burlington line is required to absorb, under the tariffs. In view of the fact that the season for movement of sand and gravel will shortly come to a close in Nebraska because of seasonal difficulties, the Commission finds that an emergency exists and that the rate herein ordered should be made effective on less than statu - tory provisions.

COMMISSIONER MILLER, PRESIDING OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This complaint herein was filed by J. F. Moredick, a citizen ol Nebraska and chairman of the Nebraska State Railway Legislative Board of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. As such chairman he was authorized and directed by the order he represents, to file the complaint. The complaint involves trains No. 637 and 638 operated daily except Sunday, by the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company between Auburn and Omaha. Each train consists of a motor car and a trailer </seg>
            <seg id="p162">162 TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT The crew of each train is composed of a motorman, a conductor. ■ joint express messenger and baggageman and a mail clerk. The charge is that the crew is not sufficient under Section 5336, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, in that no brakeman or flagman is carried as a member thereof. The prayer is that the Commission will ordeT the company to desist from the violation of said section of the statutes by employing 1 a brakeman or flagman as a part of the crew. Section 5336, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for- 1922, under which the action is brought reads as follows: "It shall be unlawful for any railroad company doing bus - iness in the state of Nebraska to operate or rim over its road or any part thereof, or suffer or permit to be run over its road or any part thereof, outside of the yard limits, any passenger, mail or express train carrying passengers, whose regular equip - ment consists of more than five cars, with a crew, consisting of less than one engineer, one fireman, one conductor, one brakeman and one flagman; and further provided, passenger trains whose regular equipment consists of five cars or less, may be operated with a crew consisting of one engineer, one fireman, one con- ductor and one brakeman or flagman." The decision of this Commission in Moredick v. Union Pacific Railroad Company, 19 Nebraska state Railway Comm peared that while a trailer was used the baggageman was eompeti and available to do braking and flagging. The is contained in the opinion of the Commissior "The reasons leading to the conclusion thai a motor ear may be operated singly without a brakeman or flagman indicate that where a 'trailer' is used a brakeman or flagman should be employed. As above stated it is shown in all the specific in - stances complained of that a flagman was available, so that under the evidence we conclude there was no violation of the statute and that the complaint should be dismissed Each of the trains, No. (&gt;37 and 038, is a train within the meaning 1 of the statute above quoted. It has heretofore been argued, in connection with other cases, that as the section of the statute above quoted was enacted prior to the use of motor cars in this state, its language is applicable only to steam propelled trains. It is true that there is no duty for a fire - mjan to perform on ffasoline motor propelled trains, but as the object of the legislature in enacting the statute must be deemed to have been to promote the safety of the passengers and the operatives car - ried on the trains, it can hardly be possible that the kind of motive power employed should be a .controlling factor. While a fireman would have no duties to perform and the part of the statute relating 172, is relied upon by the com&amp;lainani herein. In th </seg>

It must be understood in this connection that we do not pass upon the necessity of employing a brakeman or flagman. The leg - islature has already considered and disposed of that subject. Our duty is to ascertain the facts and then determine whether or not there has been a violation of law. If we find a violation to exist, then we must report it to the law officers of the state for action. tit is the contention of the railway company that the law is corn - ed with in this instance because the express messenger on each train qualified to perform the duties of a flagman and is under obliga - tion to do so when ordered by the conductor of the train. It appears that- each express messenger has been directed by the officers of the efendant to familiarize himself with the operating rules pertaining to agging, that the general agent of the express company has directed lim to do flagging in case of emergency, and that the railroad com - nnv pays half of the express messenger's salary, paying the same o the express company. On the other hand, it appears that each spreBB messenger is employed by the express company, that while iere has been a general direction to him to familiarize himself with le operating rules as to flagging, particularly, rule No. 99, of the &gt;ook of rules of the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, there has »een no examination theron and no actual training or experience in n It also appears that there is no requirement that he do flagging xcept when specifically ordered by the conductor, whereas a regular agnian nets on his own motion in emergencies without an order to oceed; that while the railroad company may contribute to the express •in puny a part of the pay, the messenger actually receives his sal - ry from the express company, that he has no seniority rights as a lilway employee and may be discharged by the express company with - ut reference to the railroad company. The express messenger re - eives no additional pay since being directed to do flagging. Xone f the orders given to the express messenger to do flagging is in writing, unless an answer bv the general superintendent of the express nmpany to a letter sent him by one of the messengers inquiring wheth - r or not the latter should do flagging, be considered as an order. t Although general directions to do flagging have been given to ex - ess messengers, no one has examined them on the rules and there no real evidence of their proficiency to perform the duties of igman.

"If my understanding is correct the conductor would, in this case, remain with the car or the motor train and of course if he sent the messenger out to flag we would expect that he see that our interests were protected. In event the messenger had a money run, I would expert him to protect same. However, on these branch runs, such is very infrequent." The book of instructions issued by the express company !&lt;&gt;r the use of its employees, contains the following rules: "Train employees must not leave their cars or safes for any cause, unless an employee of the company known to them, is assigned by the agent to relieve them."

Moredick, a citizen of Nebraska, o is the chairman of the Nebraska Legislative Board of the Brother - )d of Railroad Trainmen. He filed it at the direction of the or - lization which he represents. It is charged in the complaint that the defendant is operating passenger trains No. 109 and 110 over the road between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, each of such trains consisting of more than five cars, with only one flagman or brakeman. It is further ciarged that such operation violates section 5336, Compiled Statutes of Neb - raska, 1022, which reads as follows: "It shall be unlawful for any railroad company doing bus - iness in the state of Nebraska to operate or run over its road or any part thereof, or suffer or permit to be run over its road or any part thereof, outside of yard limits, any passenger, mail or express train carrying passengers, whose regular equipment con - sists of more than five cars, with a crew consisting of less than one engineer, one fireman, one conductor, one brakeman and one flagman; and further provided, passenger trains whose regular equipment consists of five cars or less, may be operated with a crew consisting of one engineer, one fireman, one conductor and one brakeman or flagman." It is prayed that the Commission require the defendant to employ an additional flagman or brakeman on each of said trains. The answer denies violation of the statute and prays dismissal. </seg>
            <seg id="p166">166 TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT The evidence shows that each of said trains is operated with a crew consisting of an engineer, a fireman, a conductor, a flagman or brakeman, a baggageman and a porter, six in all. The baggageman is an employee of the defendant company; he does not handle express. He is required to pass the regular examination given to brakemen and is fully qualified to perform and does perform flagging and braking duties. He receives the same pay as a brakeman and is subject to the same working conditions. The porter is also required to pass the same examination and is also able to perform the services required of a brakeman or flagman and does perform such services when necessity requires.

CHAIRMAN RANDALL, PRESIDING OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This case came on for rehearing before the Commission, by reason the order entered September 17, in which the effective date Sep- tember 1, 1!)'28, as contained in the original order entered dated August 25, 1928, was suspended. The Beatrice Creamery Company wais to intervene in the original hearing. M. A. Rawlings &amp; Son tnpany of Lincoln, was authorized to intervene in the rehearing. The records and exhibits introduced in the original hearing were re-introduced in the rehearing and are to be considered in connection with the final decision of the Commission. The defendants offered farther testimony briefly stated as follows: Mr. Mettlen, train master for the Burlington railroad at Omaha, estified that the handling of ice offered for shipment by the eom - ainants to Lincoln were handled at a greater expense than the rdinary run of cars that are handled in the Omaha yard, because le cars' of ice loaded by the complainant are set to a connecting airier for delivery to the complainant's artifical ice plant: that when le loaded ears are received from connecting lines, the cars have to &gt;e scaled: that the handling of cars loaded with ice requires more aj-e by the switching crew in order to avoid the shifting of the load nd damage to the ears by reason of the load shifting. Mr. Brown, yard master for the Burlington railroad at Lincoln, testified in regard to the necessity of handling cars loaded with ice in a more careful manner than cars are ordinarily handled in the Lincoln tMr. Iloffelder, assistant general freight agent for the Burlington Chicago, introduced an exhibit that showed that by reason of the ,000 pound minimum, provided in the original order entered in this </seg>
            <seg id="p168">168 TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT case and at the rates given in said order, the earnings of the Burling ton would be but a very little bit more than the company would re ceive for shipments of ice loaded during the winter months. II Showed that the earnings on a carload of ice from Omaha to Lincoln during the winter months would have a gross earning of $24 per car that a car loaded to the minimum during summer months according to the Commission's order of the 25th of August, 1928, would have a gross earning of $25. Mr. Van Sant, transportation inspector for the Burlington railroac testified that the M. A. Rawlings &amp; Son Company, the consignee a Lincoln who reveives the major portion of the cars of ice shipped from 'complainants plant at Omaha to Lincoln, had filed claims with th Burlington for a little better than fifty per cent of the total gros revenues received for the transportation of cars of ice shipped b the complainant company to said Rawlings &amp; Son Company, on accoun of the cars being received in a damaged condition: that these claim were largely on account of corner chipping of cakes of ire, which in th estimation of the consignee, made it unfit to sell. It developed o cross examination, that the bulk of the claims filed by M. A. Rawiing &amp; Son Company referred to carload shipments of ice during the Summe months from Omaha to St. Joseph: that no claims had been filed against the shipments made to Lincoln up to the date of his testifying September 19, 1928.

The witness shows in his exhibit according to his computation based on a six per cent return on the investment, a total cost per car loaded with 53,906 pounds of ice on their line haul of $48.67. This study is based upon an average tare weight of the ice ears twenty-four tons per car and an empty return movement of the ear from Lincoln to Omaha. Mr. AVharton, witness for the complainants, asked that the com - plaint be amended so as to provide that — "this complaint seeks reason - able rates for application of ice traffic from Omaha to stations in aside from the St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island for all year around use, up to two-hundred miles distant from Omaha." Additional testimony was offered by this witness in support of this complaint as amended. In his exhibits he compared the rates on carload shipment's of ii-e by applying the Class "E" rate on the Clark scale, sixty-five per cent of the Class E rate on the Clark scale; Class E on General Order No. 1!) and 125% of General Order No. 19 class rates based on differ - ent minimum weights as provided in the different scales. Air. Forsberg, representing the complainants, in this case the 'copies Ice &amp; Cold Storage Company of Omaha, gave further testimony nd showed how the empty ears for ice loading were set in to the ompany's loading docks by the Illinois Central Railroad Company at hnaha; that the loaded cars were usually pulled out of their plant n the afternoon of the date, loaded up before six o'clock in the veiling; that the following cakos of artificial ice were usually loaded l cars furnished bv defendant carriers: [e further stated that the average weight of artificial cakes of ice is round three-hundred pounds; that the average tonnage loaded in ars containing ice varies from twenty-one tons to thirty tons; that was object ional to load ears of ice with more than one tier of ice, le cakes standing on end on account of the liability of injury to em - loyees when loading ice in more than one tier; that his company had ever filed claims against the carriers for damage to ice in transit ince his connection with the company in 1921; that by reason of the installation of the six and one-half cents rate on carload shipments f iee from Omaha to David City there had been a material increase n the amount of ice sold to the David City dealers.

Mr. P. Gilbertson, also testified on behalf of the intervenors, the M. A. Rawlings &amp; Son Company, and introduced exhibits intended to show that the present rates on carload shipments of ice between Omaha and Lincoln during the summer months were unreasonable as compared with rates on ice between numerous points without and within the state of Nebraska and as compared with other commodities shipped in Ne - braska intrastate traffic of greater value than artificial ice; these comparisons were made on a per revenue ton mile per car and per car mile basis. CONCLUSIONS This record clearly shows that there is a demand for lower rat - on carload shipments of artificial ice during the summer months from Omaha to certain Nebraska stations; that the construction of refrigerator plants constructed for the purpose of handling one or two cars of artificial ice and keeping a temperature where the ice will not Kami selling: the same to customers instead of cutting na &gt;ring it in ice houses, is a more up to date plan of (list rib as been in effect for many years. K? record amply supports the contention thai artifici handled daring the summer months at the rates qo\ naha to Nebraska stations within a radius of two-hui uaha. What the Commission said in its decision in Formal Complaii No. 241, wherein a scale of rates was provided I'm- shipment of ic during the months of December to inclusive, clearly shows tli difference in the conditions and circumstances under which iee i handled in the winter months as compared to the summer months The record m the rehearing clearly shows that there has been n change in the method of handling- ice during the two periods tha would justify the Commission in establishing the winter scale of rati for application in the summer months. The quantity of iee offere in volume shipments in the winter months is very much greater tha is generally offered the carriers for shipment during the sumnie months, which would, generally speaking, make for lower costs. Tli expense to the carriers of handling one or two cars of ice from th same consignee on the same day to a single consignor is c-onsiderabl more per car than where a number of cars, ten or twelve in a string can be handled from a loading point to a definite unloading chute. We are not materially impressed with the testimony offered by - defendants as to the greater expense of handling cars of ice in the summer months as between connecting carriers in Omaha as compared </seg>
            <seg id="p171">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 171 with other ears handled in similar service. Cars handled in such service in large cities must be considered in a broad way. The charges for such service by the carriers are generally speaking on a minimum basis. One class of service to a certain industry should not be used as a biisis for the construction of a reasonable rate between points of riL:iii mid destination. I tee is a very low valued commodity, probably one of the lowest at is offered to the carriers for transportation. It is true that arti - ■ial ice is of greater value than natural ice, but in the determination of a reasonable rate on carload shipments of ice, the amount that the traffic will bear and still provide the transportation must be given considerable weight in establishing a reasonable rate. We are impressed, from the record, that there is a growing demand for the transportation of ice during the summer months and if rates can be provided that will reasonably remunerate the carriers for the service performed, such rates should be put into effect. The showing t&gt;\ one of the defendants as to the cost of handling carload shipments Eice between Omaha and Lincoln is interesting, but the figures prc - ntod cannot be accepted as controlling in the establishment of rates rein considered. The establishment of rates on a cost basis has not been developed o a point where the cost of handling the traffic can be used as a ontroDing factor in the establishment of the rates. Interesting and omprehensive studies are being made in numerous cases and it is the lope of the Nebraska Commission that in the near future the Inter - tate Commission and other regulatory bodies may be able to work ut some definite plan whereby the cost of handling different com - lodities in transportation service can be accurately and satisfactorily etermined, but until that time it would be manifestly unfair to single ut carload shipments of ice during the summer months as a commodity which the rate should be established on a cost basis. Several defendants in this case have voluntarily applied to the ommission for authority to establish the winter scale of rates found y us to be just and reasonable in Formal Complaint No. 241, from maba to Nebraska stations. The present rates on carload shipments : ice during the summer months between stations in the state of Ne - raska other than jobbing stations is now on a basis of Class E rates nder General Order No. 19, at a minimum weight of 40,000 pounds. In our order entered herein August 1 T, 1P.2S, we prescribed a scale of rates on catrload shipments of ice from Omaha to all Nebraska stations for the summer months based upon 125% of the winter scale prescribed by us in formal Complaint No. 241, at a minimum weight of 50,000 pounds. The record in the rehearing has convinced us that this scale of rates is too low for the handling of the traffic during the heated season of the year. </seg>
            <seg id="p172">172 The Nebraska Commission in connection with the Interstate Com - merce Commission has now under investigation the adjustment of Ne - braska state and interstate class rates. Until that investigation has been completed and the final order entered, we are of the opinion and so find that the scale of rates that should be applied on carload ship - ments of ice originating at Omaha on the lines of the defendants appearing herein and consigned to destinations not more than two - hundred miles from Omaha is the scale of rates now applying on Class L, General Order No. 19, as specifically mentioned in the order herein entered. It should be the aim of all shippers to load cars to their maximum loading capacity. In our order establishing a winter scale of rates the minimum weight was established at 1)0,000 pounds. The testimon in this case is that the complainants cannot under their present plan of loading cars load more than an average of .50,000 pounds in th car. It appears to us, however, that the consignees could arrang to safely load the longer cars to a minimum of more than 50,000 pounds and thereby give the carrier a greater revenue per ear thai if the car was loaded to only .")(&gt;, 000 pounds. These rates are estab lished largely for the purpose of encouraging the installation of i&lt; - storage refrigerator plants in small cities where the difference betwee receiving a 50,000 and a larger car should not affect the eatablishmen of the refrigerating plants. In order to secure the greatest possibl revenue to the carriers for the service performed, the Commission in this case will establish a minimum weight of 50,000 pounds tor Bumme shipments of ice for cars of thirty-six feet six inches in length insid measurements, and larger cars in accordance with rule :i4 of th current Western Classification.

OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This matter arises on the complaint of Theodore Johns&lt; lie, who originally filed an informal complaint with the Commii alleging, certain unsatisfactory service. In order to brim: the m; before the Commission in a manner that would permil of bei and development of further facts, complainant filed formal eomp designated as No. 610. The defendant, Northeastern Telephone Company, opei telephone system at Rosalie, which the record discloses is of ground* type with toll circuits radiating from lirwilie over metallic circuil owned and maintained by the Northwestern Hell Telephone Compai of Omaha, except that defendant company owns and operates 01 toll circuit from Rosalie to Bancroft, through Walthill. The eon plainant herein alleges that it has been considerably annoyed wi &lt; ross-talk on local and long distance calls, the cross-talk being mi plronounced that conversation cannot be carried on with satisfaction. In reply to the ahove complaint the defendant company, the North - eastern Telephone Company, declares that the Rosalie service is now as efficient as it is possible to render with a grounded telephone system and, further, that recently the plant Iims 1 n rebuilt and con - siderable trouble thereby eliminated. Defendant further alleges that the. public generally has been satisfied with the service furnished since the rebuilding and that no complaint except that heard from the complainant herein has come to the telephone company's notice. I Hearing was held in this matter at Rosalie on the 16th day of st, 1028. Complainant presented throe- witnesses, all of whom ied to practically the same experience in regard to their service, local and long distance at Rosalie. It was the opinion of these sses that the service has been satisfactory since certain rebuild- COMMISSIONER MILLKK. PRESIDING </seg>
            <seg id="p175">175 the city plant in Rosalie had been completed. Prior to that time considerable annoyance was experienced on account of cross-talk, etc. Two of the witnesses testified that they had at times heard cross - talk on the lines, but that the same was not annoying or detrimental tn the service in their particular case. All of the witnesses agreed thai the service had been greatly improved since the recent reconstruc tion above referred to. tThc defendant called upon ten subscriber witnesses to justify a original answer to the complaint, all of whom offered testimony dicating that they were entirely satisfied with the present service d ilid not experience the annoyance and inconvenience complained of the complainant. by The complainant appeared to be the only subscriber at the hear who believed that the service was unsatisfactory at present. E. ('. Hunt, general manager of defendant company, testified i the construction and operating conditions of a grounded system rcuit, which system is employed in rendering service to the subscrib - s at Rosalie. This testimony indicated that the system was proper - engineered and constructed and that prior to the time the plant is rebuilt and particularly the cable portion thereof, that there was Dsiderable cross-talk on the system and that such trouble has BOW »mmi entirely eliminated and that in his opinion the plant now is as ell-constructed and engineered as is possible for a grounded circuit in and that everything has been done to eliminate the trouble. The local manager for the Rosalie exchange had just prior to !■►■ hearing in this matter interviewed a large number of subscribers ndiscriminately in regard to their service and no complaints were to him. The Commission is of the conclusion, after considering the test- !iony of all witnesses appearing, that the poor service condition com - abied of has been eliminated and that the complaint of Theodore ihnson should be dismissed. There is no testimony in the record eept that of complainant which points to poor service at the present ne. There is much testimony, including that of witnesses called • complainant, that the service is satisfactory. The complaint herein will lie dismissed without prejudice.

COMMISSIONER MILLER, PRESIDING OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This case comes on for hearing before the Commission on com - plaint of the Brownville Fruit Growers Association, located at Brown - ville. Brownville is a local station on the Burlington railroad, about twenty-five miles below Nebraska City on the Nebraska City-Beatrice Une. It is located on the banks of the Missouri river and is the largest grape producing territory in the state. Complainants show that the Brownville Fruit Growers Association has between seventy - five and eighty grape growing members; that there was raised by association members last year, fifty cars of grapes: that forty-four of these cars were shipped to state and interstate points in refriger - ator cars from Brownville, about half of the number of cars being shipped to intrastate points. The interstate shipments were widely distributed. Some cars were shipped to Denver, the bulk of the inter - state shipments being to Minnesota and Wisconsin destinations. Com- </seg>
            <seg id="p177">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 177 plainants testified that by reason of the very large increase in the output of grapes from Ozark territory of Missouri, they were having greater difficulty to sell their grapes at a reasonable profit; that grapes are shipped in refrigerator cars for which the regular tariff rates are paid for ice to maintain low temperatures; that the growing ol grapes in the Brownville district was materially increasing; that the industry has grown from a car or two eight or ten years ago, to fifty cars last year; that there is some variation in the annual pro - duction ; that the crop averages between three and four tons of grapes per acre; that there is some place around 150 acres producing vine - yards in the Brownville district; that it takes between three and four years to bring a vineyard into full production; that it costs approx - imately $150 per aer.e per annum to maintain a vineyard at the proper state of production; that the land on which the grapes are produced is valued at some place around $150 an acre. One of the witnesses testified that his ten acres of vineyard had cost him. $300 per acre, land and grapes. Witnesses for the complainant testified that the rates on other fruit from Brownville, such as peaches, pears and packed apples, were approximately one-half the rates charged on carload shipments of grapes; that the transportation of grapes is substantially the same as transportation of other fruits such as peaches and pears. DEFENDANTS Witness for the defendant introduced a number of exhibits to show the conditions surrounding the handling of grapes from the Brownville district. He showed that there were twenty-five cars of grapes shipped from Brownville in August, 1927; nineteen cars in September, total of forty-four cars; that the rates on carload shipments of peach - es, pears and packed apples were established by the Commission on re - quest that the rates be investigated by the legislature, on account of resolution passed by the legislature. Later, a formal complaint was lied before the Commission, bringing in review the rates on fresh fruit, le showed that grapes now move from Brownville on the third class ate with a classification minimum of 20,000 pounds: that carload shipments of peaches from Michigan producing territory move on a commodity rate which is established approximately eighty-five per rent of second class rate: that a large amount of the grapes shipped rom Michigan move into Chicago and other large cities by boat across jake Michigan : that the Interstate Commerce Commission in its de - rision in Consolidated Southwestern cases, 123 I. C. C. 203, had estab - ished the rate of fifty per cent of the first class rate on carload ship - nents of fresh fruit, domestic. This rate will apply from the Ozark district into the territory north of Missouri and Kansas. He showed 'nrther that the Commission has recently established commodity rates on carload shipments of gTapes in the New York grape growing ter - ritory, sixty per cent of the first class rate; that his company was not </seg>
            <seg id="p178">178 willing to reduce the rates on carload shipments of grapes iioiif Brown - ville district to the rates now in effect on peaches, pears and apples. CONCLUSION In our findings and order entered in the fresh fruit investigation. Formal Complaint 210, effective October -■&gt;. L913, we had before us the question of establishing a reasonable rate on carload shipments of bulk apples as a primary object of the complaint. The growii grapes in the Brownville district lias developed until it should be rec - ognized as a major industry in that portion of the state. Quantity shipment has always been recognized as justifying rates at something than the regular class rates that handle the occasional ship - ment. From this record we arc of the opinion and so find that the present rates on carload shipments of grapes from Brownville, are un - reasonably high as compared with the rates on carload shipments of peaches, pears and apples. In the decision of the Interstate Com - mission in the Consolidated Southwestern cases, they have adopted a general policy of relating class and commodity rates to the first class rate in effect in a given territory. We. are in hearty accord with this plan of establishing rates on quantity shipment of commod - ities. By this plan any change in the base or first class rate will auto- matically bring all commodities into line with the eonl class rate. It the present time the Nebraska Commission i- cooper iterstate Commission with the end in view of readj rates, state and interstate, for Nebraska. At the pr iss rates applying from Brownville are the rates provi rder entered in General Order No. 19, which becamn nber 6, 1914. Bi consideration of all of the facts of record, we are of the opil d so find that a reasonable rate on carload shipment-- of grape l» ■the Brownville territory to Nebraska stations, will be a rate ier cent of the first class rate now in effect from Brownville to ika stations. Romplainants showed that they uniformly loaded 4,000 baskets oi i in a refrigerator car: that the average weight per basket was cimately six pounds. Consequently, it would seem fair that a inn Weight on the rate herein established would be fixed at pounds. E Complainants ask that the Commission establish reasonable rates less than statutory provisions, because the 1928 crop is beinsr har - led at the present time. This seems like a reasonable request and be complied with. An appropriate order will be entered. </seg>

The order of the Commission contained a con - dition permitting the company to make a trial operation for sixty days, during which time objection might be made by anyone interested. Tht order contains the following: "The Commission will grant the application with the under - standing that after sixty days trial, if written complaint of a representative number of citizens from the various towns affected is filed with the Commission, hearing will be held and the matter determined from the testimony, wherein it is shown that the change in this schedule and the movement of the trains is detri - mental, to the best interests of the shippers and the traveling public. In case no written complaint is filed with the Commission within the sixty days, this order will automatically become perm - anent." Shortly after the order became effective complaints were made y persons living along the Wynot branch, condeming the new schedule nd urging the Commission to restore the former one. "Within the me limit formal complaints were filed. Thereupon, the matter was et down for hearing and the hearing was held at Wynot, at which umerous citizens testified. The complaints against the new schedule liege that it substantially reduces the passenger service; that the freight service is also impaired and that the mail service is lessened. The complaint concerning the freight service is that under the old schedule stock was loaded early in the morning and reached Sioux City in time for that day's market; that the stock was kept on the ars a much shorter time than under the new schedule Although the original application is given one number and the complaint of the objectors is given another number on the docket of the Commission, they will be considered as one proceeding and not as two proceedings and therefore the burden of proof is upon the railway company, which was the original applicant. Statistical studies of considerable length were introduced by the railway company, but details of such studies are not necessary to discuss. The company claims that the saving that may be affected by the present plan of train operation will amount to $7,370.69 per year. This saving, it is alleged, will result from the abandonment of roundhouse operation at Wynot and having all of the roundhouse work for the Wynot branch performed at Sioux City. Some dispatching will be rendered unnecessary and there will be a saving on coal, oper - ative's time, station agent's time and some saving on overtime. We think that the saving will be somewhat less than claimed because there will be as shown by the figures in the exhibits, a loss in the passenger revenues of at least $1,000.00 on account of the change in schedule. We also think that the saving on coal and wood will not </seg>

They prefer to load their stock early in th ag, as they could do under the old schedule, so that it woul&lt; Sioux City at about 8:00 o'clock and thus be in time for th e day's market. Under the present schedule, stock must be loade Wynot prior to 9:00 p. m. in order to have it reach Sioux City the following day's market. It now arrives at Sioux City at 1 p. m. which requires stock to be kept in the stockyards tl .'I: t longer than formerly. Further, under the old schedule one enuic m any point on the Wynot branch to Sioux City with stock, hav 3 market his stock or transact other business and return hour me day, or make connections for Omaha. Lincoln, Fremont am points south and west. The last train under the old schedul ioux City at 5:05 p. m. and arrived at Wynot at S:"J0 p. m. The passenger service under the old schedule was much belter as one could go to Sioux City early in the morning and have the entire day for the transaction of business and return home in the evening. Under the present schedule the first train out of Wynot is at 2:00 p. m. arriving at Sioux City at 5:00 p. m. which of course is too late for the transaction of business. Thus, one cannot go to Sioux City and transact any business and return the same day. Nor can one l'o to Omaha, Lincoln, Norfolk or Fremont in one day as formerly, with - out going by the way of Sioux City at a substantial increase in fare. It is also shown that the mail service is not as convenient to pat - rons generally as it was under the old schedule. Mail received as late as 8:20 Sunday evening is not distributed until Monday morning. The Saturday train would serve more people in carrying mail than does </seg>
            <seg id="p183">183 &lt; mday train. As it is now Saturday afternoon mail is not re - ceived and distributed until Monday morning. While it would be desirable for the railway company to save $6, - per year that saving must be weighed against the disadvantages which people along the line are under by reason of the change. As above .slated, no exact measure of the disadvantages to the public tamable in money, but light may be thrown upon it by consider- popnlation tributary to this line of railway. According to the nsus, Wynot has a population of 368, Obert ll(i, Maskell 165, castle 500 and Ponca 1,014. Dixon County in which Maskell, castle and I'onia are situated has a population of 11,815. Judg- q the Location of the railway it seems fair to say that eonsider - ire than half of the people of that county patronize this line ilway. Cellar County, in which Wynot and Obert are located, i population of Hi, 22"). It is probable that between 2,000 and .ndii | pie in Cedar County also patronize it. It is safe to estimate hat from 7,000 to 8,000 people depend upon the applicant company ay service When we consider the amount of savins; that the company may ft in comparison with the lessened service to so large a number eople, we have no hesitancy in saying that such saving does not t v the change. We are therefoi-e of the opinion and so find that saving which the company might make by the change in schedule fficient to justify the inconvenience and loss caused to the if the railroad thereby and that the company should reinstate is it existed prior to the order of the Comimission on ORDER IT IS THEREFORE CONSIDERED AXD ORDERED by the Ne - braska State Railway Commission that the present train schedule of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway Company on the Wynot branch be discontinued on January 10, 1029, and that the former schedule, which is as follows: Trains Gi X.i. 33 1 laily Ex.

"IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that paragraph 2 of the original order be eliminated and the following substituted : •IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that if and when peti - tioner's common stock is sold as above described, and sat - isfactory proof is made to the Commission of the sale, and not otherwise, it may sell its seven per cent non- participating, cumulative preferred stock in the sum of $470,000 par value, to net it not less than 85 per centum of par.' " I These orders were predicated on testimony of applicant that the enue realized from the sale of such securities was to be used in construction of a hydro-electric generating plant near Spencer, Boyd County, on the Niobrara River, together with 358 miles of nsmission line and distribution systems within certain towns to Dm current was to be sold. It having come to the attention of the Commission that applicant had abandoned certain of its original construction program, particular - ly that part which contemplated construction of transmission line and town distribution systems, order to show cause was entered under date ot November 23, 1927, being Commission Resolution No. 106 (20 N. S. R.

Testimony adduced at that time showed that the $200,000 of common stock originally authorized had been sold. None of the preferred stock authorized had been issued or sold. Witness Person, secretary of the company, testified that because of changed circum - stances which made possible the sale of electric current at the point of generation, the company had not found it necessary to construct the transmission lines or distribution systems originally thought neces - e&amp;ry. For these reasons, securities originally authorized by the Com- </seg>

His tost imony was also to the effect that it will be necessary to issue and sell additional securities in amount approximately $200,000 in order to produce the further net revenue which will be required to complete the company's construction program. This total figure is made op in a general way, of the following items: $36,000 for additional im - provements. $25,813 notes payable, and $130,000 due K. A. Forbes, president of the company, for cash advanced, secured by note. This makes a total of $191,813. From this should be deducted an item of $17,882 which consists of a cash advance to the Xiobrara Rive Power Company covering project development farther up the river This item consists of a loan to the Xiobrara Company and is to b returned to applicant. Deducting this, testimony would indicate cor porate necessity for net revenue in amount of $173,931.

SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION AND FINDING RANDALL, Chairman: The Chicago, Burlington &amp; Qnincy Railroad Company made ap - plication to the Commission to change the class of passenger service between Red (loud and Hastings, a distance of 41.26 miles for the v ;ison that the passenger business on this line had fallen off to such an extent that the train was being operated at. a considerable loss to the company. The volume of business was so limited that it could lie 1 mulled adequately by gasoline motor car and effect a substantial saving in overhead expense. Exhibits were prepared showing the volume of business handled &lt;m trains Nos. 4 and 11 from August 7 to September 7, 1926. The greatest number of passengers handled on train No. 4 for one day Cthat time was 23, only 10 of these originated at Red Cloud, in Xo. 11 running in the reverse direction the greatest number on at Hastings, with 16 off at Red Cloud. tThe track between Hastings and Red Cloud is of heavy steel and (11 ballasted, so that a motor car would run reasonably smooth over be track and (passengers would not be subjected to any unreasonable nconvenience. &lt; 'n the 8th day of March, 1027, an order was issued by the N"e - braska State Railway Commission permitting the substitution of this service for a ninety-day trial period, subject to objections that might be filed by the patrons along the line and if objections "were entered as tn the service being inadequate, the Commission would give the objectors an opportunity to be heard and make proper finding after the investigation had been made. On March 9, 1928, the Commission received a communication from the superintendent of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company informing us that they had been unable to obtain the ear to be used in the substitution of the service and asked for an extension of the time.

Commission to issue and sell first mortgage bonds in the par it of $600,000; 2,500 shares of first preference seven per cent red stock, of the par value of .^SO.OOO; also, 1,500 shares of per cent preferred stock of the par value of $150,000, to net the ant not less than 93Vb per centum of par. Petitioner has amended its articles of incorporation to provide for one class and kind of preferred stock and not two, as applied for and granted, namely a seven per pent preferred stock. Therefore, this application merely involves the change of the permit for the issue and sale of 2,500 shares of seven per cent first preference preferred stock of the par value of $250,000 and substitute therefor seven per cent preferred stock, in the same amount, to be sold to net the applicant the same per centum of par, the word "preference" being eliminated. None of the first preference preferred stock has been sold. The Commission is concerned with the total par amount of securities authorized to be sold by the applicant and the above class - ification of the preferred stock was made in the original application with the thought that it would operate to the advantage of the com - pany in the disposing: of the securities, having in mind that thr per cent preferred stock would be sold to customers in applican&amp;'s territory: and the first preference preferred stock might be sold out- side of the petitioners field of operations. After the stock is changed to one class and kind, all of the purchasers, whether customers &lt; &gt;r or investors in other territory, will have the same protection in the event of liquidation. Prhe Commission believes and so finds that applicant has complied the law and the prayer of its petition should be granted. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Platte Valley Telephone Corporation of Sootts - bluff, Nebraska, be and the same is hereby permitted to issue and sell 2,500 shares of its preferred stock in the par amount of $250,000, to net the applicant not less than 93H per centum of par.

Wilson Bus Line was notified on April 24, 1928, of the •plication herein and on May 1, 1928, entered formal objection to le establishment by applicant herein of the proposed York-Belleville n. A hearing was accordingly held at the office of the Commission ay 2:&gt;. 1928, to establish the rights of the interested parties. Testi - ony adduced during said hearing tended to prove that the C. T. il&gt;on Bus Line, during the pioneering stage of bus operations between r crk and Hebron, has. without profit furnished bus service between aid points, despite adverse weather and highway conditions; that it ms at no time failed to accommodate the traveling public in this errrtory: that it has at all times, and now is, ready, able and willing establish additional service between said points, when the demand 'or the same seems to warrant it. Iln the light of such evidence and in consideration of all other Bts and data surrounding the case, the Commission is of the opinion d finds as follows: I First: That adequate motor transportation service is now being •ovided the traveling public between York and Hebron by the C. T. ilson Bus Line. Second: That by the establishment of the proposed extension of operations by applicant herein, the patronage of the C. T. Wilson Bus Line would be so materially diminished that the said motor transport - ation company would be operating at a distinct loss. Third: That this York-Hebron territory, pioneered by the C. T. Wilson Bus Line under the most unfavorable conditions, served with - out profit pending a day when highway improvements might repay the effort expended, should not now be invaded by a concern which, the Commission feels, would not only reduce the revenues of the pioneer, but would fail to reap a profit for itself. iead Down A. 11 STATIONS Read Up P.M.

Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this twenty-sixth day of June, 1928. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION C. A. Randall, Chairman. Attest : Mary E. Sheehan, Assistant Secretary. (SEAL) MILLER, Commissioner, dissenting: I find myself unable to agree with my associates as to the power of the Nebraska State Railway Commission to withhold its approval cf the bus service set forth in the application. Such service is con - cededly unnecessary and it must therefore be, in the long run, contrary to public interest. The Constitution provides as follows : "The powers and duties of such Commission shall include the regulation of rates, service and general control of common car- </seg>
            <seg id="p201">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 201 riers as the Legislature may provide by law. But, in the absence of specific legislation, the Commission shall exercise the powers and perform the duties enumerated in this provision." Art. IV, LThe statutes of 1927 relating to the operation of motor buses, &gt; of Nebraska for 1927, chapter 150, page 403, provides as follows: "The Nebraska State Railway Commission shall have general control of the common carriers mentioned in Section 1 hereof and is hereby vested with authority to make reasonable regulations, except the fixing of rates or fares to be charged, governing each motor transportation company in this State; is vested with authority to regulate the service and safety of operation of each such motor transportation company in this State; to re - quire said common carriers to file annual and other reports, containing such information and data as the Commission may re - quire, and to provide uniform accounting systems.'' It appears to me that these sections give full authority to the Commission to grant or withhold its approval, after full hearing, of applications for permission to operate motor buses. The regulation of service and general control cannot be accomplished effectively with ut power to control the number of vehicles. As recited in the majority opinion, if new companies may be organized and a new service undertaken without limit it is inevitable that such competition will so result as utterly to destroy many of those who have establishec nd built up transportation lines. It will doubtless frequently happen lat all of those engaged in such competition will be compelled to uffer great losses and be thrown into bankruptcy. When failur csults the service will undoubtedly be unduly reduced, or if maintained, ie equipment used will be allowed to deteriorate and in any event the ublic service will suffer. There is no reason in my opinion why the ublic may not limit the number of vehicles in use because without imitation too many will undertake the business of carrying passengers. 'he result will be that the service will suffer, as above stated or that, ather than go into bankruptcy, the operators will combine to keep up ares. It would be impossible for the Commission to hold the fares own to a reasonable point. While the first condition above mentioned lay not result, the public may be overcharged and probably be com - nelled to ride in inferior equipment. In anv event, the public will pay he cost of the unnecessary' operation and it will not get the service hat it deserves. kFor an extended discussion of the subject see dissenting opinion ' Commissioner Hall in the matter of the application of the Peoples elephnne Company to sell stock.

GENERAL 1. This tariff covers inter- exchange toll service between the ex - changes shown on pages 8, 9, 10, Exhibit "B." 2. The toll service covered by this tariff consists in estab - lshment of telephone communication between different local service areas and the provision of the services and facilities other than ex - change services and facilities necessary therefor. The exchange services and facilities in connection with toll service are those required o establish connection between an exchange station and the toll loard, or between an exchange station and the toll trunks when such runks are employed to effect connection with the toll board, and such exchange services and facilities are covered by the charges for exchange service. 3. Toll messages are classified into four groups known as: Station-to-Station, Person-to-Person, Appointment and Messenger. On certain toll calls which cannot be completed, a partial arge known as a report charge is made. B. STATION-TO-STATION TOLL MESSAGE 1. The term station-to-station is applied to a toll message where the person originating the call gives only the telephone number of the station desired or the name and address under which the telephone is listed and does not specify a particular person to be reached at the called station. 3. In connection with station-to-station (day, evening and night) oil messages, charges may be "reversed," i. e., collected at the called station, except that "reversal" of charges is not permitted on calls &gt;etween points where person-to-person service is not offered. Where, in connection with a request for reversal of charges on a station-to - station call, the acceptance of charges is refused at the called station and the calling party is unwilling to pay the charges for completing he call, the report charge described hereafter is assessed the calling party. Charges may not be "reversed" on station-to-station messages between points where the regular station-to-station rate is less than twenty cents. C. PERSON-TO-PERSON TOLL MESSAGE 1. The term "person-to-person" is applied to a toll message where the person originating the call specifies a particular person to be reached at the called point. </seg>
            <seg id="p205">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 205 2. When the person originating the call specifies a certain station of a private branch exchange system, or certain department, office, branch, etc., reached through a private branch exchange sys - tem, the message shall be classified as a person-to-person message, even though no particular person is specified. 3. Orders for person-to-person toll messages are accepted only with the condition that a partial charge, known as a "report charge" ■will be made in certain cases where it is impossible to establish com - munication with the specified person, as described hereafter under the heading "report charge." t4. In connection with person-to-person toll messages, charges ly be "reversed" i. e., collected at the called station, if the calling rty desires, and the called party agrees to accept the charges. D. APPOINTMENT TOLL MESSAGE 1. The term "appointment" is applied to a person-to-person toll message where the person originating the call requests that arrange - ments be made in advance with called station for the connection to be established at a specified time. E. MESSENGER TOLL MESSAGE 1. The term "messenger" is applied to a person-to-person toll message involving messenger service or requiring the use of a tele - phone not connected with the lines of this company or its connecting company to bring the called party to a telephone so connected. F. REPORT CHARGE PThe term "report charge" is applied to charges made for cer ills which cannot be completed, owing to circumstances beyon&lt; 1 of the telephone company, and which the company has in "aith and with due diligence by the work of the operators, an&lt; e of its facilities made proper and reasonable effort to complete On such calls, a partial charge, known as the "report charge" is made More specifically, this charge is made in the cases described below. 2. On station-to-station (day, evening or night) messages, where in connection with a request for reversal of the charges, the accept - ance of the charges is refused at the called station, and the calling party is unwilling to pay the charges for completing the oall, the report charge is assessed to the calling party. 3. Orders for person-to-person toll messages are accepted only with the condition that a "report charge" will be made when it is impossible to. establish communication with the specified person due to any of the following reasons: (a) When the called party is not available at the called station, or refuses to talk, or to accept the charges on a call on which a request is made that the charges be "reversed," </seg>
            <seg id="p206">206 TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT and a report to this effect is given the calling: station within the time limit. (b) When the calling: party refuses to talk or is absent at the calling station, or no answer can be obtained from the calling station, provided the connection is ready for com - pletion within the time limit. (c) When the calling party has requested that no reports ex - cept that the calling party is ready to talk be given him or when no answer can be obtained from the calling station, provided that a report was obtained by the operator with - in the time limit for which a report charge would apply under other provisions of this tariff if it were given to the calling station. * The time limit is one hour from the filing time of the call. When orders for messages to the called point are being accepted subject to delay, the time limit is increased by any such delay reported to the calling station within one hour of the filing time of the call. (d) When the calling party has secured information from the called station for which a report charge would be made under other provisions of this tariff if given to the calling station by the operator. E Orders for appointment toll messages are accepted only with ndition that a "report charge" will be made in the following in addition to those described above under paragraph 3 for all -to-person messages. (a) When, after the appointment has been definitely arranged with the called station, the call is not completed. A "re - port charge" is not made, however, if there has been a fail - ure to complete the call within thirty minutes after the appointed time due to delay in establishing the toll circuit or delay in reaching the called or calling station unless such delay is due to the called or calling station not answering. 5. Orders for messenger toll messages are accepted only with the condition that a "report charge" will be made in the following cases in addition to those described under paragraph 3 for person-to - person messages. (a) When, after arrangements have been made to notify the called party to come to the telephone, the call is not com - pleted. G. RATES FOR STATION-TO- STATION DAY MESSAGES. 1. For the purpose of applying rates, where the direct airline distance between points is forty miles or less, distance shall be deter - mined by direct airline measurement. Where the direct airline distance </seg>
            <seg id="p207">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 207 between points is in excess of forty miles, distance is determined as the airline distance between the center of blocks seven miles square, within which the points of communication are located. Where the airline distance (measured between the centers of section thirty-five miles square) exceeds 350 miles, or equals 350 miles in the case of sections located in the same horizontal or vertical line, distance is determined as the airline distance between the centers of the sections. EThe block and section sealing system for the purpose of ring toll rate distance between points more than forty miles t by direct measurement, consists of a grid containing sections thirty-five miles square, each section subdivided into twenty-five blocks seven miles square, so placed on a polyconic projection of a Govern - ment Survey map of the United States that section lines coincide with a line drawn approximately north and south through the center of the United States and with a line at right angles thereto passing through the northwestern point of the international boundary line in the Strait The following rates apply for station-to-station messages for the initial period or fraction thereof between the hours of 4:30 A.M. and 8:30 P.M.

The initial evening rates for station-to-station toll message on which communication is established after 7:00 P.M. and befor 8:30 P.M. are approximately twenty-five per cent less than the initia day rates except that no reduction is made where the initial station to-station day rate is thirty-five cents or less and except that the minimum discount rate is thirty-five cents. 2. The initial night rates for station-to-station toll messages on which communication is established after 8:30 P.M. and before 4:30 A.M. are approximately fifty per cent less than the initial day rates, except that no reduction is made where the initial station-to-station day rate is thirty-five cents or less and except that the minimum dis - counted rate is thirty-five cents.

The report charge applied is covered by Section F of Exhibit B is approximately twenty-five per cent of the day station-to-station 4. When the computed rate is not an even multiple of 5-cents, the rate is the nearer 5-cent multiple, or the next higher 5-eent multiple when the rate is half way between five cent multiples. 15.

On September 20, 1927, general notice having been given to various communities affected by proposed changes, the Commission conducted a formal hearing on said application in the city hall, Arcadia, at which hearing there were no objections. After this public hearing had been held, it was found that the ollowing telephone companies would be affected by the changes pro - osed by applicants : Bartlett &amp; Ericson Telephone Company, Bart - ett; Ericson Telephone Company, Ericson; Kinkaid Telephone Com - pany, Ericson, and Farmers Telephone Company, Taylor, all of which ompanies are common carriers, engaged in the transmission of mes - ages by telephone between points in this state, and as such common arriers are subject to the provisions of the Nebraska State Railway 'ommission Act, approved March 27, 1907, as amended. These com - panies were notified of the proposed changes, and given opportunity and ample time in which to file objections. Objections have not been iled with the Commission by any of the companies so affected. The purpose of this application is to equalize the toll charges &gt;etween points affected, by establishing rates on the basis of the air - ine distance between the originating and terminating points of the messages, as provided in tariff herein set forth. It appears tha u under the tariff which applicants are now applying, that the charges are somewhat irregular, for toll service between different points of approximately the same distances. The basie charge for toll messages referred to in the application, was found by measuring the airline distance between stations. The able showine charges to be assessed from station-to-station initial lay messages on the distance basis, as set forth in page six of the find - ngs hereof, was used in determining the proposed charge. </seg>
            <seg id="p210">210 TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL EEPORT This method of assessing charges for toll messages has been heretofore approved by the Commission in eases of the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company and the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Com - pany, whose toll lines and connections extend to all sections in Ne - braska. A uniform method of assessing toll messages is advisable and in the instant ease, such practice would establish a uniform toll rate in the territory involved. yie changes proposed by applicants, over present toll rates, would e instances increase the rates, while in others the rates would ered. The Commission is of the opinion that the revision, as ed by applicants, will not materially affect the gross toll revenue of the applicants herein, and will not result in sharp increases Applicants were unable to estimate the effect the proposed tarif would have upon its revenue. However, the Arcadia Telephone Com pany pointed out that on the basis of an eight months cheek, the pro posed rates would yield approximately $28.05 additional revenue pe annum to the company. The tariffs proposed by applicants have bee checked as to the distance between exchanges involved, and has bee found incorrect in some respects. In line with the charges requester by applicants for certain distances, the following substitutions shoul« DP mflflfi i Order will be entered approving the tariff as submitted, and authorizing the rates as requested by applicants, after necessary cor - rections have been made as indicated above.

            <seg id="p213">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 213 ging, burlap, gunny or jute, from 30,000 pounds to 40,000 pounds. The application reads as follows: '"1-Advance minimum weight on bags and bagging, burlap, gunny or jute, provided in Item No. 1245-C of Union Pacfio tar - iff No. 3000-E, and Item No. 175 of C. B. &amp; Q. tariff No. 15325-A, to 40,000 pounds. 2-A-Cancel the rates and description in so far as Omaha is concerned, in Item No. 1231-D and in lieu thereof publish the description of this item as an additional description in Item No. 1245-C of U.

Driggs, appeared for the Burlington, and in support of the application read into the record the argument that was made before the Western Trunk Line Rate Com - mittee, which reads as follows: "I would like to read into the record the argument of the pro - ponent of the suggestions that lead up to this readjustment. ■Manufacturers located at lower Missouri River crossing find themselves at a disadvantage in marketing their products at the above point on account of the lower rates in effect by manufact - urers of Omaha. Authority was granted under Western Trunk Line Docket 5466-A for the establishment of rates on bags and bagging from the lower Missouri River crossing to Bayard, Scottsbluff, Gering, Nebraska, and Torrington, Wyoming, etc., of ten cents over the rates effective from Omaha. The rates proposed are on this basis and if same are approved, Lower Miss - ouri Rivor manufacturers will be in a more favorable position to meet the competition of the Omaha manufacturers. With regard to the advance in minimum weights now applicable from Omaha to the basis applicable from lower Missouri River crossing, wish to advise we have received complaints from the Kansas City shippers that the higher minimum weight is a serious competition in competing with Omaha manufacturers and are of the opinion that same should be placed on the same basis as enjoyed by the competitors. Of course, the Commission understands, so does the opposition, that adjustments in minimum weights are in line with the recognized policy by the shipping public to get heavier loading and another thing in connection with this, it is usual in making commodity rates to put the minimum rate somje - ■\vhat higher than the classification minimum, the classification </seg>
            <seg id="p214">214 TWENT-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT minimum being 30,000 pounds. We think it will be a little dis - crimination against lower Missouri River if this minimum, weight is not increased. I think that is all I care to say now." Assistant General Freight Agent C. W. Axtell, appeared for the Inion Pacific and endorsed the testimony given by Mr. Driggs. Mr. J. A. Little of Lincoln appeared on behalf of the protestants and testified that generally speaking, the people whom he represented were largely growers of potatoes in the western part of the state ; that a 40,000 pound car of bags represented in round figures 64,000 bags; that 48,000 bags were loaded in a 30,000 pound capacity car ; that the 40,000 pound capacity car represented an additional investment in bags of approximately $2, 400.00; that generally speaking, all growers of potatoes in the western part of the state could buy their bags in Omaha at the same price as the man who bought a carload; that the buyer of a carload of bags relied on the difference in the transporta - tion charges between less than carload and carload, as representing his profit in the handling of a carload of bags. Mr. Little introduced testimony attacking the reasonableness of the per car charge based on minimum weight of 40,000 pounds. He showed that on a 40,000 pound minimum car of bags the charge from Omaha to Alliance would be $214 and to Hemingford $222 ; that on a carload of 40,000 pounds of flour in sacks, the per car charge would be $102 to Alliance and $106 to Hemingford; that on a ear of agricultural implements loaded to 20,000 pounds, the per car charge would be $145 to Alliance and $149 to Hemingford. The Interstate Commerce Commission, in Con - solidated Southwestern Cases, 123 I. C. C. 203, established a minimum weight of 30,000 pounds on bags and bagging, burlap, gunny and jnte, for a distance of 435 miles a rate of fifty- four cents: that the south - western territory, generally speaking, was in a higher rated territory than the haul from Omaha to Alliance. CONCLUSIONS EThe Commission is not convinced that the applicants have just the advance in the minimum weight sought in this application growing of potatoes in the western part of the state is a new an&lt; developing branch of the agricultural industry and should be red and assisted as much as possible, in so far as freight rate reasonably be established. Sview of the fact that 30,000 pound minimum has been estab - y the carriers and has been in effect for a long period of time, smuch as the Interstate Commerce Commission has established tr minimum weight in other rate territories, we are of the opin - so find that this application shauld be denied.

COMMISSIONER MILLER, PRESIDING OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: Applicant herein, the Davenport and Kiowa Telephone Company, js a common carrier, incorporated under the laws of the state of Neb - raska, and is engaged in the transmission of messages by telephone between points in this state, and as such common carrier, is subject to the provisions of the State Railway Commission Act approved March 27, 1907 as amended. kOn September 10, 1927, this company filed application with the mmission for authority to increase telephone rates. The present d proposed rates are as follows: Present Rates Proposed Rates Net Gross Net Gross Grounded Circuit Business $1.75 $1.90 $2.25 $2.40 1.25 1.40 1.50 1.65 1.25 1.40 1.50 1.65 Residence - town Residence - rural No change is requested as to switching rates, Applicant desires to continue the application of fifteen cents gross and net rule as authorized in Application 3813. </seg>
            <seg id="p216">TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL EEPOET 216 P.ary 6, 1928, general notice having been given to subscri - d by proposed increases, the Commission conducted a Qg on said application at the Wolcott Theatre, Davenport, of applicant's subscribers were present at such hearing, enter objection or protest. E Applicant corporation was organized in 1910. In March, 1919, present rates were authorized by Commission's order in Aoplica- No. 3813. Applicant has one exchange at Davenport from which grounde&lt; circuit service is furnished to twenty individual business, eighty-fiv individual town residence, and to 143 rural residence subscribers. Th rural subscribers are furnished service over twelve farm lines, havin from two to twenty-two parties thereon. Switching service is fur iiished to three lines (twenty-seven subscribers) of the Davenport &amp;. Ong Telephone Company, at three dollars per year for each subserilx and to one line (thirteen subscribers) of the Hamilton Telephone Com pany (blue line), at six dollars per year for each subscriber, three dollars of which is used to maintain said line. All subscribers of ai&gt; plicant company are afforded free service with subscribers of th Deshler Telephone Company at Deshler. Applicant owns a toll lin between Davenport and Ong, jointly with the Davenport &amp; Ong Tele phone Company. About sixty telephones now in service are the pro perty of subscribers who are stockholders of the company. The history of the finances and the results of operation ol th company to March, 1919, are set forth in detail in the Commission opinion and finding under Application Xo. 3813. A complete analys of the investment account was made from the standpoint of liabilitie and it was found that the actual dollars invested, as represented I capital stock outstanding, current liabilities and dividends earne&lt; and reinvested in the plant was $7,800. The Commission authorized schedule of rates which would pay dividends at the rate of eight pe cent on this amount. The above figures, of course, did not inr-luii any measure of donations to plant, nor any elements of appreeiatio The net earnings available for dividends was intended to be $640 annually. However, the net earnings anticipated in the order were not realized for the reason that the amount required for depreciation charges increased and the sum available for this purpose was reduced accordingly. Net earnings invested in plant as reflected by the in - crease in surplus is $2,949.45. When this sum is added to the figure found by the Commission in 1910, namely $7,800.00. we have a total out-of-pocket investment of $10,749.45. This does not include the portion of the return on the investment which was required for dtpreciation. yln the year 1920, the books of the company were set up by the unting department of the Commission, using an approximate fig- Por the plant account and current assets and liabilities, as they </seg>
            <seg id="p217">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 217 were found. Since that time the accounting has been done under the rules prescribed by the Commission but the results in many instances are incorrect becaue of the failure of the company to apply the rules correctly. These errors are not serious as to amounts, but they are sufficiently numerous to leave the final results in doubt. For the purpose of this case the Commission's engineers made an actual inventory in the field of the quantities of the various classes f" property and applied unit costs computed on the investment basis, jpreciation was determined by inspection, with some consideration ven to the age of the property when it was available, with the follow - ing results: original cost of the property new, $14,496.44, the same less depreciation $10,931.52. This does not include any elements of appreciation due to the change in price levels, but does include all of the property, regardless of the source of the funds. value of the physical property cannot be less than the original st less depreciation in the sum of $10,931.52 and when current assets are included this figure becomes $11,625.18. The fair value of the property, for rate-making purposes, would undoubtedly exceed liis figure if proper consideration was given to present price levels, which are higher than those prevailing when much of the property was placed. Xo testimony was offered to show what the cost of the property would be at the time of the hearing. However, the schedule of rates applied for only calls for an increase of revenue in the sum f $800 per annum. The Commission's study of applicant's revenues ikI expenses indicates that it will be unnecessary to find fair value for he purposes of this case. The physical property of applicant company is in fair condition, ervice complaints have not been received by the Commission. The estimony of applicant's chief operator discloses, however, that the ompany has received numerous complaints from subscribers relative o service. It was the opinion of the Commission's engineer, who nspected the property, that interruptions in service were due to de - 'er-tive switchboard and that service was impaired on farm lines be - ause of the great number of subscribers on the same line, in one ase there being twenty-two. It also appears that the lines are up in ood shape but the poles are in such condition that a bad storm would oubtless due material damage. A considerable number of the poles liould be replaced at this time, and the switchboard should be over - lauled. In 1919, the Commission set the sum of $1,450 per annum to be used for maintenance and depreciation. From applicant's record, it appears that considerable more than that amount has been spent each year except 1924 when $1,379.77 was spent, and in 1922, $1,181.13. Having in mind the condition of the plant, and the requirements which will be made herein, the Commission is of the opinion that at least $1,850 should be set up annually for maintenance and depreciation, and that the switchboard should be rebuilt, a number of the poles le- </seg>

After having applied the sum of $1,850 annually for main- tenance and depreciation, if the company finds that this sum. should be reduced, application to modify this order may be made to the Commission. In the past, the annual expenditures have about equaled annual revenues, no dividends being paid since 1916. Due to a severe storm about three years ago, applicant was required to borrow $250 for maintenance, which loan has not been paid. After carefully checking the operations of this company since 1919, the Commission has compiled a statement of the estimated annual cost of operation as follows: ESTIMATED OPERATING EXPENSES Maintenance Maintenance and depreciation $1850.00 Traffic Operators wages 1200.00 Commercial Salary of Officers (Directors} $ 60.0U Salary of Clerks (Secretary) 600.00 Stationery and printing 50.00 Office supplies and expenses 75.00 Heat, light and power (Traffic. &amp; Commercial) 175.00 Other general expense (all insurance included) lio.OO Taxes 125.00 Total _ $4,310.00 The estimated revenues, under rates as proposed by applicant, ere as follows: Per Month Per Year 20 Business phones at $2.25 $ 45.00 $ 540.00 65 Town residence at $1.50 127.50 1,530.00 143 Rural residence at $1.50 214.50 2,574.00 Switching revenue 124.00 Toll revenue 300.00 Total. .$5,068.00 It would appear from the above estimates that the company should have about $758 each year for dividends. It is not contended by the Commission that this is a fair return on the property. How- ever, it is all that can be expected under the proposed schedule of rates and will yield less than seven per cent return on the most eon- </seg>

The Commission of the opinion that an increase in rates, in the amount requested by plicant, is .-justified, and an order will be entered accordingly. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the -Nebraska State Railway Commission, that the applicant herein, the Davenport &amp; Kiowa Tele - phone Company, of Davenport, be authorized, effective February 1, 1928, to charge and collect the following rates for telephone service on its system: Net Gross Business $2.25 $2.40 Residence, town 1.50 1.65 Residence, rural 1.50 1.65 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that prior to the payment of any dividends upon its stock, the company shall appropriate and set aside, rot less than $1,850 per year to be applied on maintenance and de- preciation.

OPINION AND FINDING CURTISS, Commissioner: In this action the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company op - orating extensively in the South Platte Valley in Nebraska, asks authority to increase its schedule of rates at its Endieott exchange. The present rates, rates proposed and number of subscribers in each classification, are set out as follows: The rates proposed involve a drastic increase over present rates. Testimony shows that this proposal for rate increases is presented as an alternative to closing the exchange and serving: subscribers from the neighboring exchanges of either Steele City or Fairbury. U Chapter 144, Session Laws of Nebraska, 1923, page 357 et seq. vides as follows: "A telephone exchange, central office and switchboard shall be maintained where there is an existing exchange by one or more telephone companies operating more than ten exchanges, in every iusiness, one party 'esidence, one party [esidence, four party 'esidence, ten party Residence, ten party &amp; desk iusiness, ten party &amp; desk iusiness, desk extension 'ay Station Present Monthly Rate $2.75 1.50 1.35 1.50 1.75 2.25 1.25 Proposed Monthly Rate $4.50 3.00 3.00 3.25 3.75 1.25 Number of Subscriber: 6 14 4 32 ! </seg>

IThis statute is applicable to applicant in that it operates "more an ten exchanges". Applicant has been unsuccessful in its effort to secure signatures of at least sixty per cent of the subscribers or patrons, consenting to the discontinuance and abandonment of the exchange. As a result, this request for materially higher rates is presented. The Commission recognizes the problem which confronts the com - pany in its continued maintenance of this exchange. In an order dated November 15, 1921, Application No. 4584, (14 N.S.R.C. 458-464), this Commigsion then said in discussing the same problem, in part, as follows : "The overhead expense in exchanges of this size cannot be reconciled with the prospective income for exchanges of this size. Either the Endicott subscribers should be switched through the Steele City exchange, or be taken on to the Fairbury ex - change. The latter would give a more satisfactory service and justify the added expense." Conditions nave not changed materially since that date. Testi - loony indicates definitely that revenue produced under the present rates fails to pay actual operating expenses. Schedule 4 of Exhibit A sets forth a detailed statement of actual earnings and expenses for the last five years, and for eight months of 1927. Summerized the figures are as follows: 8 Months 1922 1923 1924 1925 1926 1927 Total Exchange (red) (red) (red) (red) (red) (red) EThe Commission is still of the opinion that the best interest of all cerned would be conserved by discontinuance of the exchange.

It stated that it is willing to serve the subscribers from either its Steele City exchange to the south, or the Fairbury exchange to the north, at the rates pub - lished for service at the exchange preferred. However, it is not within the province of the Commission to determine the question of closing the exchange. The statute above referred to very definitely sets forth the procedure which must be followed if this be done. The Company has been unable to close the exchange through the medium provided by Nebraska statutes. For these reasons, the problem must be given consideration, having in mind the continued maintenance of the ex- And as a result, the Commission is obliged to determine what is a fair and reasonable rate for exchange service at Endicott. Schedule 4 of Exhibit A discloses estimated annual earnings and expenses under proposed schedule of rates, as follows: Bribers' Station Revenue $2,318.40 Exchange Revenue 5.90 ge Tolls 25% 171.70 ;ee Revenue 16.50 (red) Total Expense $2,209.34 Net Earnings $ 270.16 This provides net earnings in amount of $270.16 available for m return upon investment. Applicant alleges book cost of its Endicott exchange to be $4,647. The reproduction new figure would, of course, be in excess of this amount.

If, in the determining of a fair and reasonable rate, the rights of pplicant were to be the only factor to be considered, undoubtedly le rates which are proposed should be authorized. But it is the 'ommissions opinion that while being charged with the responsibility f authorizing rates which are not confiscatory to the utility, it must Iso provide a rate which is fair and reasonable to the rate-paying ublic and one which is not in excess of the value of the service. In ther words, there are two parties of interest to the transaction, the tility whose property is devoted to the use of the public, and the ate-payin&lt;r public who are desirous of continuous service. in Homestead Company v. Des Moines Electric Company, 248 Fed. 439, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals held: "In the making, regulation, and litigation regarding rates, 'unreasonable rates' are either those that are so low as to be non - compensatory, or those that are so much higher than merely compensatory rates that they are exorbitant." Again in Public Service Gas Company v. Board of Public Utility Commisioners, et al., 84 N. J. L. 463, affirmed 87 N.J.L. 581, the Supreme Court of Xew Jersey held: "The next question is whether the rate fixed was just and reasonable. On the one hand, a just and reasonable rate can never exceed, perhaps can rarely equal, the value of the service to the consumer. On the other hand, it can never be made by compulsion of pnblie authority so low as to amount to confisca - tion. A just and reasonable rate must certainly fall somewhere between these two extremes, so as to allow both sides to profit by the conduct of business, and the improvements of methods and increase of efficiency." Testimony of witnesses for applicant is clearly to the effect that ate schedule which is proposed is higher than the value of service o the subscriber; in fact, is such a rate as will result in a majority f subscribers being unable to continue telephone service at the End - cptt exchange because of its exorbitance. In other words, the author - zation of such a schedule accomplishes through the medium of an xorbitant rate, that which the company has fonnd impossible to do hrough the medium provided by the statutes, i, e., abandon and dis - cntinue the Endicott exchange. The situation resolves itself into this, namely, that a rate which will provide a fair return upon the fair value of applicant's properties at Endicott is a rate which will be so exorbitant as to make it inV - possible for subscribers to continue telephone service, in that it exceeds the value of the service to them. Under these circumstances it is the opinion of the Commission that each of the parties of interest must make some concession. </seg>
            <seg id="p224">224 TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT The rate which will be authorized is much higher than the rate which subscribers are now paying. The Commission is authorizing the schedule of rates which the company publishes and collects at the neighboring city of Fairbury. It believes that this schedule, while higher than the Endicott schedule, is not more than the service is worth in that business and residence subscribers of Fairbury, and farm line subscribers on lines running out of Fairbury, are paying the rate. If subscribers prefer, arrangements can undoubtedly be made with applicant whereby in the payment of the rate authorized, the fairbury service can be secured. This, of course, would involve a willingness of sixty per cent of the subscribers to permit of the aband - onment of the Endicott exchange, and substitute therefor the Fairbury service. However, this is optional with the subscriber. Having in mint the possibility that affected subscribers may desire to work out some such arrangement with applicant, the effective date of this order is being made May 1. This will permit of time for further consideration of the matter on the part of subscribers and applicant company. On the basis of present subscribers, the rates authorized, inclusive of toll revenue, will produce annual revenue of approximately $1600. In other words, earnings under this schedule will allow of no return upon the fair value of the properties ; in fact, will fall somewhat short of taking care of actual operating expenses. However, the courts have held that public utilities may, on occasion, be required to con - tinue the operation, of portions of their property which may be un - profitable, and even though such operation involves a loss, it is not held to be a confiscation of property.

Devoe, chief accountant. COMMISSIONER MILLER, PRESIDING OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This applicant is a very small common carrier telephone com - pany owned and operated by J. A. McNeel of Sutherland. The com - pany serves thirteen subscribers on a farm line out of Hershey, where switchboard service is furnished by the Hershey Telephone Company. Applicant alleges that its present authorized rate of $1.50 net per month is inadequate to maintain and operate its property. The Com - mision's authority is requested in this application to increase the rate to two dollars per month gross, with discount of twenty-five cents per month if payment is made quarterly in advance. tThe property operated consists of one grounded circuit twenty iles in length extending north and west of Hershey. The subscribers vn and maintain their own telephones at present which practice it applicant's intention to discontinue. kThe owner of the company advises that new telephone instruments be purchased and installed, or serviceable telephones now in use be purchased from subscribers at an early date provided permission sceived to increase rates as herein applied for. The following 1 expenses are submitted by applicant as an annual average requirement, exclusive of return on investment: </seg>
            <seg id="p226">226 TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT $238.00 The switching fee of seventy-eight dollars is fixed and not subjec to criticism. The maintenance cost is computed upon the basis of a complete trip over the line, averaging twelve times per year wit! auto, and includes a daily wage for the owner and compensation fo use of his auto, which would average ten dollars per trip. The depre ciation is entirely arbitrary. Under the plan proposed by applicant whereby all telephone in - struments are to be owned by the company, batteries would be fur - nished by applicant and also additional maintenance expense would be realized on account of maintenance of the telephone instruments. The batteries will cost one dollar per pair for each telephone. Applicant estimates that new batteries should be installed every six months, which if true would require an additional out-of-pocket expense of twenty-six dollars per year. This estimate, however, is probably higher than the actual experience of other telephone companies. The applicant also asks for eight per cent return on a value of +1,000. or eighty dollars. ■le additional revenue which would be realized from the proposed te is thirty-nine dollars per annum, or a total revenue of $273 mum. Bothing has been included in these compilations for Bach items tionery, postage, management expense, etc., which arc perhaps mall. The Commission believes that the following annual out-of-pocket expense will be necessary in the operation of this property: Switching expense to Hershey Tel. Co $ 78.00 Auto expense and wages for maintenance 120.00 Batteries and other maintenance materials .... 15.00 $213.00 I addition to the above must be included an item for deprecia- The value of the aerial construction and instruments which are future to be owned by applicant for the purposes of this case nated to be approximately $1,000. If depreciation is computed r per cent additional expense will be realized in amount forty , bringing the total operating costs to $253. On the basis of the ed net rate applicant would realize $273 per annum. ■t is manifest that the proposed rate is not excessive and the will be approved.

Also, with baggage and express compart - ment and the car was to be of sufficient size and capacity to take care of all business that would be offered to the company. Owing to the inability of the company to procure the car within the time limit, the company having been given permission to make such substitution for a ninety-day trial and the time having expired, the company made supplemental application, and as the movement of this car is interstate between Nebraska and Kansas, the Commission required the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quiney Railroad Company to obtain from the Public Service Commission of Kansas its permission for the extension of time for the substitution of the service. |»n May 26, 1928, the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quiney Railroad any received permission from the Kansas Public Service Com - »n for an extension of time for the substitution of the service May 15, 1928, until November 1, 1928.

OPINION AND FINDING CURTISS, Commissioner: This application is presented by the Farmers Telephone Compan; of Dodge County, of North Bend, Nebraska, for authority to issue an&lt; tell its additional stock in amount of $5,000. The application state that the revenue to be derived tnerefrom is to be used in part for payment of additions and betterments made during 1927, and to provid revenue for future additions and betterments. t Hearing upon the application was held November 14, 1927. Wit - ess C. L. Kelly, general manager of the company, presented the ease for applicant. The testimony showed a total fixed investment as of January 1, 1927, of $151,291. On that same date, applicant had its common stock outstanding in amount of $72,570, par value ten dollars per share. This stock is held by something like 500 stockholders, none of whom own more than five per cent of tne total, and the majority of whom are local citizens. Prior to 1920 but one dividend had been paid to stockholders. Since 1920, annual dividends of seven and eight per cent have been paid. Authorizations of the Commision providing for the sale of additional securities, have been exhausted, and this request is presented. Applicant properties are (compactly located in a prosperous erritory, service being furnished to a large number of urban and rural ubscribers in Dodge County. It is contended that in order to properly erve the territory whicn it occupies, it must have available, revenue or additions and betterments, having in mind the continued gradual Towth and development necessary. As an indication of the necessity 'or providing for future growth, a statement ~was submitted showing n increase in plant during the past seven years in amount $44,291. A onsiderable portion of this has been financed through the sale of ommon stock; the remainder has been secured from depreciation eserve. Furthermore, as on indication of constant growth, the in - rease in subscribers from year to year is set forth, showing 1401 subscribers in 1920 and 1708 in 1926. Applicant's general balance sheet shows, on the asset side, certi - ficates of deposit in amount of $10,000 plus, the same being deposits in local banks in territory served, drawing four per cent interest. In - quiry was made by the Commission concerning this item. It was ex - rlained that this was the result of a policy established by the manage - ment of the company in 1920. It was regarded as advisable to build up what might be called a sinking fund, consisting of liquid assets. Tnis was to be available in case of widespread disaster, the company having in mind particularly sleet storms which off-times 'cover con- </seg>
            <seg id="p230">230 TWEN}TY-FIBST ANNUAL REPORT siderable territory, and lay low telephone aerial property. It was stated that applicant had such an experience in 1916 and again in 1922, each disaster involving from $5,000 to $8,000 loss. It waa stated that such a loss might easily involve the company's properties to an amount perhaps even exceeding $10,000. Rather than be depend - ent upon the willingness of local bankers to extend short-time loans, the management of the company have adopted this policy. It was stated that applicant has no intention of adding to this further, except as it may be increased by crediting thereto, the annual interest. Ap - plicant explained that it is an effort to keep a portion of its deprecia - tion reserve in liquid form, and stated definitely that these liquid assets are not under any circumstances, available for dividends. Difference of opinion might readily exist as to whether this policy of the company is advisable; also as to whether the amount set up should be more or less. The Commission feels that it is not of suf - ficient importance to the issues at hand as to cause it to substitute its judgment for the judgment of the company. It can indeed be said that such a practice does not result in wasting the company's rev - enues; furthermore, it places the company in a position to readily restore its properties if widespread disaster should destroy them. k Under the stock and bonds act, the Commission is obliged to find the issuance of securities requested, "is reasonably required for said purposes of the corporation". The record in this application Id indicate such is the ease. There can be no question bnt that icant will have to provide further additions and betterments. These make necessary additional revenue. The sale of further securities the purpose of supplying this revenue appears to be a corporate There is one further item which must be discussed. Through the years, applicant, through economical and efficient management, ha* accumulated a splendid surplus. Its stock is no doubt actually wort more than par. Whatever value there may be in the stock, belongs to the stockholders now of record. In order to protect their right in that value, the Commission will require the company to offer thi future issue on a pro rata basis to the stockholders of record. . ■written notice shall be sent each stockholder advising him of th approximate pro rata amount to which he is entitled, and giving him a reasonable time, and not less than twenty days from date of mailing to exercise his option. The Commission will also require that copv o 6 company's general balance sheet as of January 1, 1928, be en - (d that the stockholders may be fully advised as to the present icial condition of the company. The public notice as required by the constitution has been given. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, that the Farmers Telephone Company of Dodge County, </seg>

            <seg id="p232">232 TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT schedule of rates for telephone service at its Wymore Exchange. The application filed in November, 1927, recites the fact that "applicant's central office equipment in Wymore occupies rented quarters which are both inadequate and hazardous, and the said equipment having served its useful life, applicant is confronted with the necessity of installing new central office equipment to serve its subscribers at Wymore and believes that the new equipment should be housed in a permanent, modern exchange building."' Khe application contemplated the construction of a now modern, Dof exchange building, and the installation of the most modern common battery switchboard equipment, with the very latent s for prompt, efficient service. Subsequent to the filing of this ation. and prior to the drafting of this order, applicant Iki* constructed such a building, has installed therein the switchboa equipment referred to, and has been serving Wymore subscribers f some several weeks, with these improved methods. Hearing upon the application was held in the Comi Room at Wymore, on April 17, 102S. Present rates am posed, are as follows : Present Rates Proposed Rates One party business 10-partA business Business extension Residence one-party Residence two-party Residence four-party Residence ten-party Residence extensions .'. f the time of the hearing, appl classified as follows: Present Number of Stations Business, one partv Business, ten party Bnsiness, company Business, extension Residence, one party Residence, four party Residence, ten party Residence, extension t Applicant's Exhibit T) sets forth details of earnings and expei t the Wymore exchange for a three-year period, the totals lieini follows: ■ exchange revenue expenses Net earnings 1925 1926 1927 SI 6,1 33.04 $16,008.72 $16,636.78 12,535.24 13,923.13 13.713.0!) $ 3,598.70 f 2,175.59 </seg>
            <seg id="p233">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 233 Applicant alleges the book value of the Wymore exchange pro - perties, as of December 31, 1927, to be $43,054. This figure is pre - dicted upon a sale price in 1912, at which time applicant purchased properties in twenty-two counties in southeast Nebraska, including Wymore, the purchase price being approved by this Commission. At that time each exchange was then placed on the company's books at a price which appeared to represent its proportionate share of the tota price, based upon relative value of the properties acquired. In this manner the Wymore exchange was placed on applicant's books, am since that date — for the last sixteen years — additions to the capita account have been made in accordance with accounting rules of the tterstate Commerce Commission. Accordingly, the investment or book .lue of $43,654 seems to be as accurate a figure as can be obtained. It' this figure be used, the company's net earnings in 1925 provide&lt; a return of eight per cent plus; in 1926 of almost five per cent; in 1927 o£ 6.6 per cent. Applicant contends, however, that investment or boo! cost cannot be used as a basis for computing fair return; that the lair value of these properties upon which they are legally entitled to earn is in excess of the above figure ; that as a result, their earnings in the past have been insufficient, inadequate and confiscatory. Wit the additional investment, covering the recently constructed building and improved central office equipment to be considered, applicant i' lieges the inadequacy and confiscatory nature of present rates to be relatively increased. The record contains four measures of the value of the existing plant as of the time of the hearing. The company offered two ap- aisals which show the cost of reproduction new and the same less depreciation, also the book cost of the property. The engineering department of the Commission also presented the cost new and the same less depreciation. One of the appraisals offered by petitioner was prepared by the American Appraisal Company, but no testimony fered to sustain it. The results of the appraisals and the book The American Appraisal Company's figure contains intangibles and indirect construction costs in the sum, of $9,796.00. This amounts to twenty-two per cent computed on the estimated cost of the fixed property. Depreciation was found in the sum of $2,098.00. This means that the plant is in a ninety-six per cent physical condition, notwithstanding the fact that some of the property is still in place, which was in existence prior to the consolidation, and the present are set-out below.

She above findings are excessive and speculative tu the extent lie results of the appraisal will be of no assistance to the Coin - n in reaching its conclusion as to fair value. The company's appraisal was prepared on the hypothesis tha there was no telephone exchange in Wymore and that the propert&gt; would be constructed as it is now and that it would be necessary to promote the enterprise, find an operating organization at som expense, pay for preliminary legal services, engineering and the cos of financing a new company. Deficits of operation the first two year are also included. The company estimates that these items will a mount to $3,070.88. In addition to this sum, interest during con struction, legal expenses during construction, taxes, contingencies etc., were estimated to cost $3,852.21. The total of the intangibles ! $8,719.00 or approximately twenty per cent, computed on the reproduc tion cost of the fixed property. There is no dispute as to the quantities of property a 1 Kual count in the field, nor the unit costs applied. It is a far of the imagination to conceive of a town of 3,000 people without me serxice and the further assumption that an exchange will be icted in one program large enough to supply service for the town. Parallel situations in actual practice could not be cited, fh a few instances where competing properties have been built eferred to in support of applicant's theory. Ielephone plants do not come into existence over night. Exper - shows that they grow from small beginnings and develop with crease in population and demand for service. A theory to be tent, must be in substantial agreement with experience. The one exchange in Wymore began in a small way many years a;. 1 " eveloped slowly to its present proportions. The Commission, from investigations that include a large nutnhe of companies, has found that the cost of intangibles such as super vision, taxes, insurance, engineering and interest daring constructioi and such legal expenses as there may be that are necessary and in cidental to the construction of a property, amount to approximate] fifteen per cent computed on the reproduction cost of the fixed pro party, exclusive of real estate. This percentage in the amount o $6,003.72 will be substituted for applicant's speculative intangibles When this correction is made the company's cost new become The property was depreciated on the inspection basis, no allowance being made for invisible deterioration, or depreciation due to inad - equacy and obselescence.

Inadequacy and obsolescence are also important factors which take place through growth and progress in the art. Applicant tnnot demand the right to charge rates for service which are suffici - t to pay the cost of plant displaced from all causes contributing to ireciation, and at the same time refuse to recognize all these factors in appraisal. The switchboard was installed in 1911 or 1912, and is now found s in a ninety per cent condition, after fifteen years of service, titwithstanding the fact that it will soon be removed. This percentage as based on inspection determined by efficiency of operation. It as conceded that it does not have all of the equipment which has developed in the last few years to facilitate service. The cost ■ i installation alone, which will soon be lost, is approximately $2,000, ml the salvage value of the board will be much less than its depre - ated value in the appraisal. Only $917.19 has been deducted from •■&gt;st new. to provide for all loss of value due to age, obsolescence removal. The company's engineer found the physical property exclusive of real estate, to be in an eighty-seven per cent condition. The Com- mission's assistant engineer found it to be in a seventy-five per cent condition, having accrued depreciation in mind. When this percentage ied to the company's cost new, we find the depreciated value of ed property to be $38, 751.93 including stores and supplies, but working capital. To summarize we have the company's adjusted cost new in the in (if '*50,259.06 and less depreciation in the amount of $38,751.93. issiim's engineer found a reproduction cost new of $52,939.86 reciated value of $40,193.71. The company's book cost in the sum of $43,654.80 originated, as noted above, with the purchase of the properties in Wymore in 1913 and is the result of additions and retirements to plant throughout the succeeding years. No working capital is included in the book figure and $2,500 will be added to the appraisal values and the book cost to provide for this requirement. Therefore, we have the company's appraisal as modified in the sum ..t $52,759.06 cost new and $41,251.93 depreciated, and the cost new of the engineering department of the Commission in the sum of $55,439.86 and depreciated, in the sum of $42,693.71. The company has constructed a new central office building and will provide -a new switchboard and office equipment at cost. When these items are considered, the book cost, giving effect to the changes in plant, and including working capital will be $63,246.20. The com- </seg>
            <seg id="p236">236 TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT pany's valuation becomes $65, 590.3S cost new, and $56,720.17 depre ciated, and the engineering department's corresponding figures o $66,267.19 and $57,279.55. The company's book figure should be sub stantially lower than the cost of reproduction new under present prie levels. It is possible that costs have found their way in the plant ac count on the books which are not represented in the field. The presen price of telephone materials and equipment is approximately fifty pe cent above the pre-war level ; however, the company's building has bee recently constructed and the switchboard will be new. Changes i plant in the last few years would also reflect higher prices. ■laving all of these facts in mind, the Commission believes and so that $60,000 fairly represents the present value of the company's rty used and useful for exchange telephone purposes at Wymore.

Data requested at the time of the hearing; subsequently furnished, shows credit to the reserve for ac- crued depreciation from January 1, 1913, to December 31, 1927, amounting to $29, 812; it also shows realized depreciation for the same period amounting to *18,040. For the last ten years the average annual credit to the reserve has been $2,288 and the average annual realized depreciation has been $484. With the rebuilding program which now confronts t lie company and with plant displaced in amount of $0,178.80, it is, of course, true that the average annual realized de - preciation would be materially increased if consideration were given I the properties after the rebuilding program had been completed. jwever, baring in mind the above actual experience of the company r a period of years, and the expression of applicant's chief engineer, the Commission's conclusion that 2% per cent on building, and .'.•., | &gt;er cent on all other depreciable property will amply meet all company requirements for depreciation. This will provide an annual credit to the reserve in amount of $2,889, using applicant's figure of $60,746 and deducting the value of non- depreciable property. In reaching above conclusions, as to proper percentage to be applied for depreciation requirements, it should be said that the Commission has in mind the fact that applicant, at its Wymore exchange neither owns nor maintains any farm line properties. (Applicant has deducted from earnings a speculative figure of 607, based upon possibility of loss of subscribers due to increased tes. It is the Commission's opinion that deduction from earnings this amount is improper. It knows of no instance where the com - ny has had such an experience, and believes that as the result of y reasonable increase in rates at Wymore, the loss of subscribers 11 be much less than ten per cent — perhaps not to exceed five per Cross-examination developed the fact that Wymore is a toll center nd as a result the operators are required to devote more of their me to handling of toll calls than at an exchange not a toll center; iso, that Wyniore exchange is credited with twenty-five per cent of ic revenue realized from outgoing toll messages, similarly as is any ation not a toll center. It is apparent that if twenty-five per cent reasonable for allocation to a station not a toll center, it is not nough for a toll center. However, some slight additional percentage redit to the Wymore exchange for this reason could not materially ifect the rate schedule. Protestants stressed the economies which they felt might be possible as a result of contemplated consolidation of the Blue Springs exchange with Wymore. Applicant presented an exhibit to show that such consolidation would not result in economy of operation whereby lower rates might be possible. It also stated that such consolidation </seg>
            <seg id="p238">238 TWEN'TY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT ■was a matter of much uncertainty. The Commission pretermits dis - cussion of this question at this time. If and when such consolidation takes place, the question of possible economies resulting therefrom and a lower rate scale, -will be carefully considered. It is noted that company's request involves an increase of twenty - five cents per month on individual residence; twenty -five cents a month on city party residence with an improved service in the change from four-party to two-party; seventy-five cents a month on business, with no rate increases for other classes of service. It is the opinion of the Commission that the increase as pro - posed are necessary execpt that the rate for business service should be increased fifty cents per month rather than seventy-five cents. With the schedule as thus amended, applicant's annual gross exchany revenue would amount to $16,325.49. To this amount should be K $1,997.01 toll revenue, and $413.34 miscellaneous revenu a total annual gross revenue of $18,735.79, with no allowan in revenue due to lns-c in stations resulting from rate increa If the company's annual expenses be revised allowance which the Commission ments, total annual expenses ami irgs in amount of $4,500, plus, return on the fair value of the pn Such net earnings will, of course plicant suffers loss of subscriber a resultant reduction in the rate liar- made for depreciatii unt !o $14,230.44, leavin. in This provides for Parties as found. by the Coi , be reduced to the extent because of the rat of return.

OPINION AND ORDER BY THE COMMISSION: Applicant is a public service corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Delaware. It owns and operates properties in Nebraska used for generating and trans - mitting electric energy for sale to the public. In compliance with the laws of Nebraska, petitioner has applied to this Commission for a permit to issue and sell stocks and bonds for development purposes which have been granted, subject to certain terms and conditions. Under date of June 2, 1924, order No. 5550 was issued by this Commission which contained the following provisions: "That whenever net corporate income shall exceed 5 per cent on the issued and outstanding common stock, plus all preferred stock dividend requirements, applicant shall set aside an amount annually including this mortgage requirement equal to 2% per cent of the average ledger value of the fixed property for the year as shown by the books, such amount to be carried in an account entitled, "Reserve for Renewals of Fixed Property," which shall be drawn upon only for the purpose of paying the cost of property retirements; provided, that in case the net earn- </seg>

On tihe 19th day of September, 1924, order No. 5629 was entered by the Commission which provided among other things the following: "That the provisions of the Commission in its order under ap - plication No. 5550, with respect to a reserve for renewals of fixed property shall apply to the securities authorized on account of the acquisition of the new plant." Blso, on the 18th day of August, 1925, upon the application of mpany, order No. 5993, was issued by this Commission, which among other things provides: "That the provisions in the Commission's order in Application No. 5550, as to a reserve for the renewal of fixed property, shall be made a part of this order." Again on the 29th of January, 1926, upon application by the company, order No. 6113 was made and entered by this Commission which contained the following: "Applicant shall charge the income account of the Hasting division and credit the general depreciation reserve account monthly ratable amount equal to 2 per cent per annum of th &gt;book cost of the depreciable properties acquired from the Bast ings Gas Company, which reserve shall be for the purpose &lt;&gt; making charges for plant retirements in accordance with stand ard accounting practices." B Moreover, under date of March 6th, 1926, upon the application i Water and Light Company of Nebraska City, supplemental No. 5469 was made and entered by this Commission which pro - among other things, the following: "The company shall charge as an expense, or make a de duction from operating income before net profits are determii ed, on a monthly pro rate basis not less than 2 per centum o the depreciable physical property shown by the general ledirt plant accounts at the end of the month, which amount sha be credited to a retirement or depreciation reserve accoun charges against which account shall be made only in acoon ance with the accounting rules of the National Electric Liul Association; provided, that corporate income subsequent t December 31, 1925, in excess of preferred stock dividend re quirements shall be passed to the above reserve until sue reserve shall, cumulative from January 1, 1926, amount to 2' per centum per annum of the average depreciable property i service as shown by the general lodger plant accounts." y Again, under date of July 6, 1927, when application was made ie company, order No. 6759 was made and entered by the Com- Lon, which contained the f ollowin;: : </seg>

The evidence shows that some confusion exists as to the proper amount to be set aside as a reserve for depreciation in connection with the Hastings Gas Company property and the Water and Light property at Nebraska City, under orders issued by the Commission and directed to the Central Power Company. The Commission believes and so finds that confusion may result from the above orders as they may apply to credits to the depreciation S serve on account of the ownership and operation of the Hastings is property and the Water and Light property at Nebraska City. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Commission that the Com - pany shall, whenever net corporate income exceeds five per cent per ajinum on the issued and outstanding common stock plus all preferred stock dividend requirements, set aside an amount annually equal to 2% per cent of the average ledger value of the depreciable fixed pro - perty for the year as shown by the books, less the fixed property accounts of the Hastings and the Nebraska City divisions as shown by the books of the Company, such an amount to be carried in an account entitled. "Reserve for Depreciation"; provided, that in case the net earnings in any year are insufficient to meet these requirements, such obligation shall be cumulative from December 31, 1924.

Hearing i the application was held at the Commission's offices on Wednes- December 28, 1927. The application recites the fact that the stock is to be sold unde the company's so-called Employees Benefit Plan, which plan involve the sale of this stock to employees only, and payment for same on an installment basis. The plan was adopted by the company about te years ago and has received approval of the stockholders repeatedly a the annual stockholders' meeting. It has resulted, during this perioc of years, in more than 400 of applicant's employees becoming stock holders of the company. It is alleged that this is of marked advantag to both the employee and the applicant ; that through this medium th employee has before him a definite plan of savings and thrift ; an&lt; that as a result of his being a stockholder in the company for which he works, he has a greater interest in the company's welfare, with added loyalty and enthusiasm for his work and resultant increased efficiency in the service furnished the general public. The Commission has previously authorized the issuance and sale of common stock, under the plan proposed herein. However, this author - ization has been completely exhausted; in fact, such stock has been over-subscribed by company employees in amount of $211,555. Ap- Bnt is especially anxious that the Commission approve the sale of stock in an amount sufficient to at least permit issuance of stock oployees covering this over-subscription. </seg>
            <seg id="p245">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 245 Applicant is a Nebraska corporation. It has an authorized capital of $23,000,000 of which $10,000,000 is authorized common stock, and $13,000,000 as preferred stock. As of October 31, 1927, there was outstanding $3,134,925 of common stock and $2,798,259 of preferred stock; also $2,000,000 of funded debt. This makes total capital liabilities as that of date of $7,933,184. As of the same date, ap - plicant had gross assets in amount of $12,209,420 of which $10,818,058 is represented as "physical property". This makes it apparent that there is a safe margin between total outstanding securities and the book value of the fixed property, even though the additional $500,000 of common stock herein requested be authorized. The margin would be considerably increased if gross assets were to be taken as the basic figure. Testimony was to the effect that the company's construction pro - gram, for each year, necessitates large amounts of money available for dditions and betterments. Its budget for 1928 provides for $1,200,000 n the rebuilding of plant. It was stated that during the coming five - ear period, not less than $2,000,000 will be needed for these purposes, 'he company's books are kept in accordance with the Interstate Com - merce Commission's system of uniform accounting, and make careful eparation between expenditures for operation expenses, replacements nd additions to plant. The fact was developed that there remains $1,153,500 of preferred tock previously authorized by the Commission, which has not been &gt;sued or sold. Applicant has been making no effort to dispose of Eis class of securities, the only securities issued and sold of recent te, being this common stock, sold, in very limited amounts to the iployees. The Commission finds that the company should be permitted to issue and sell its common stock in amount sufficient to cover over - subscriptions which it has on its books. The order will also provide that authorization covering the sale of preferred stock shall be re - duced in amount equal to the common stock which will be here author - ized, consequently the order carries no authority to issue securities which have not been previously authorized by the Commission, but njerely changes the form of securities in this limited amount, from preferred stock to common stock.

            <seg id="p248">248 TWENffY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OPINION AND FINDING CURTISS, Commissioner: This action arises upon application of Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company for authority to cancel the present rate of three cents on sand and gravel from pits near Fairbury, to Lincoln and in lieu thereof, to apply the Nebraska intrastate mileage scale oi four cents. Hearing upon the application was held at the Commis - sion offices on Thursday, May 10, 1928. The application involves rates which have been continuously before the Commission for its consideration for the last four years. One application has followe&lt; another and scarcely has one rate been published out before further request was received to again revise. CThe Commission's records disclose the following requests on of applicant herein relative to the rates now involved: The rate of three cents from Fairbury pits to Lincoln wa first established by orders of the Commission dated February 20, 1925 and March 2, 1925, in Formal Complaint 521. That complaint asked for a 3-cent rate between these points, th rate then being four cents. The Rock Island volunteered to establish the 3-cent rate, Commission order was entered author izing same and the complaint was dismissed. Application No. 6076, filed November 5, 1925, requested cancellation of the 3-cent rate and re-establishment of the previous 4-cent rate. Commission order entered November 27, 1925, denied the request. Application No. 6134, filed December 28, 1925. requested cancellation of the 3-cent rate and authority to publish 3% cent rate. Commission order entered August 19, 1926, granted the request. Application No. 6480, filed October 4, 1926, requested cancel - lation of the 3 1 2 -cent rate and authority to restore 3-&lt;-ent rate. Commission order entered October 22, 1926, granted the request. Application No. 6693, filed April 12, 1927, requested cancel - lation of the 3-cent rate and authority to restore the 3\' 2 cent rate. Commission order entered September 2, 1927, denied the request. Application No. 70/0, involving the matter now under investi - gation, requests cancellation of the 3-eent rate and authority to publish the 4-cent rate. E Testimony of applicant at time of hearing on this application, oped no new facts which have not been previously presented to the nission in prior proceedings. Its position now is that a 3-cent is out of line with the scale of sand and gravel rates in thr as a result, is a source of constant irritation and complaint from • carriers and shippers at points other than Fairbury. This is </seg>
            <seg id="p249">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 249 Bbtedly true. However, it was just as true at the time the last ation to publish the rate of three cents was filed, and the fact was well known to applicant at the time the application was filed. Witnesses Montmorency of the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R., Choate of the Pi Pacific K. R. and Little, representing miners of sand and gravel, expressed the opinion that the continued maintenance of this rate a menace to the whole rate structure on sand and gravel in the state. The Commission recognizes that the rate is out of line and that it presents an exception to the scale. In its order in Application No. t&gt;07(i, in refusing the request of applicant to publish a rate of four cents — the rate here asked — the Commission stated that "there are two scales of sand and gravel rates in the state, the one to Omaha and Eacoln destination and directly intermediate points — the other one-half lit !&gt;i-r cut. higher, applicable on shipments between other points." its finding therein, it indicated the rule established in previous orders dag rates on sand and gravel "would warrant a rate of 3% cents the three pits adjacent to Fairbury, to Lincoln". t is conceded that the 3-cent rate now in effect is not in harmony the si:ale applicable on the commodities involved. Nor is the which applicant requests in harmony therewith. The present no greater a violation of the scale which the Nebraska Commis - is adopted than is the rate which carrier herein proposes. As above, it is the one exception to the rates under the scale. ie circumstances, the Commission does not feel that its exist - 1 establish a precedent which menaces the entire rate structure applicable to the commodity in question. It might be said with equal • that the 4-cent rate proposed would establish a similar menace. There is another factor which the Commission finds should be onsidcred. At the hearing, objection to the increase was voiced by i. B. Steele of the Blue Valley Sand Company, miners of sand and ravel at Fairbury. It was stated by him that several thousand dollars iad been spent in the development and expansion of this company's and and gravel properties, solely as a result of the establishment of ie 3-eent rate to Lincoln, since under such a rate, this company could, nd did, move large quantities of sand and gravel into Lincoln ; that &gt;eeause of an increased volume of business into Lincoln additional facilities which were necessary had been provided. Substantiating this, it was stated that in 1927, out of approximately 350 ears of sand and gravel moved from this company's pits, 182 ears moved to Lincoln. ■Mr. Steele stated positively that a rate of four cents would preclude his company from doing any business in Lincoln. Applicant recognized this fact and mentioned it very specifically in its Application No. 6480 requesting the reestablishment of the 3-cent rate, which request was granted by the Commission. The Commission qnotes in part from that application, as follows : ". and we are definitely told that 3% cent rate actually </seg>

While it cannot be conclusive and all controlling, it appears that there is merit to the contentions of the Blue Valley company ;md tha their situation is deserving of consideration in reaching conclusions There should be some permanency and stability to a rate structure Constant changes can result only in confusion to the shipper and nn certainty as to business policies to be pursued by him.

A contract for such •en entered into, subject to the permission of this Commission. ed that the companies are competing, and therefore such sought.

            <seg id="p252">252 TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT It is contended by the applicants, that as all of the stockholder of the Sarpy County Telephone Company, which company will go on of business when the properties are consolidated, have consented t the consolidation, nothing further is needed. The question reall resolves itself into this: Does the Constitution require sixty days public notice to stockholders, although the stockholders of the compain the property of which is to be absorbed, have all consented to th consolidation? The expression, "public notice to stockholders", appears in severa state constitutions dealing with consolidations. Our constitution maker evidently considered the subject so important that they specified tlia formal public notice should be given in all consolidation proceedings In many cases, as in the present one, it is not clear that the proviso! would be of any benefit, but that is a matter with which we canno deal. We have no power to revise the constitution. The rule tha statutory provisions, which are appearently not vital to a proceedin may be treated as directory and not as mandatory, does not apply i construing the language of the constitution. The rule is stated thu by Cooley, Constitutional Limitations. 8th Edition, Pages 159, 164: "But the courts tread upon very dangerous ground « venture to apply the rules which distinguish directory ; datory statutes to the provisions of a constitution. Con! do not usually undertake to prescribe mere rules of pr except when such rules are looked upon as essential to to be done; and they must then be regarded in the lighl ations upon the power to be exercised. It is the provil instrument of this solemn and permanent character to si those fundamental maxims, and iix those unvarying which all departments of the government must at all times sha their conduct; and if it descends to prescribing mere oi order in unessential matters, it is lowering the proper dignii such an instrument, and usurping the proper province of ordinary legislation. We are not therefore to expect to find in a eonstii tion provisions which the people, in adopting it. have not re - garded as of high importance, and worthy to be embraced in an instrument which, for a time at least, is to control alike the government and the governed, and to form a standard by which is to be measured the power which can be exercised as well by the delegate as by the soverign people themselves. If directions are given respecting the times or modes of proceeding in which a power should be exercised, there is at least a strong presumption llhat the people designed it should be exercised in that time and mode only: and we impute to the people a want of due apprecia - tion of the purpose and proper province of such an instrument, {when we infer that such directions are given tu any other ena. Especially when, as has been already said, it is but fair to pre - sume that the people in their constitution have expressed them- </seg>
            <seg id="p253">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 253 selves in careful and measured terms corresponding with the im - mense importance of the powers delegated, and with a view to leave as little as possible to implication." I This rule appears to be subject to the exception that limitations on e power of the people to amend their fundamental law should not so construed as to defeat the will of the people, plainly expressed, i account of a slight failure to comply literally with such limitations, the requirements are substantially observed. In State V. Winnett, Nebr. 37i&gt;, an overwhelming majority of the electors had approved constitutional amendment creating the State Railway Commission, vas held that the fact that notice of the proposed amendment was rublishud exactly as required by the constitution was not fatal, general rule was, however, expressly recognized in that ease. See also Baker V. Moorhead, 103 Nebr, 8li. This Commission cannot say that otter failure to publish notice is slight, it cannot say that - ink failure may not result in injury to someone. There is no showing that the stockholders of the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company have given their consent to the consolidation. Even if they had also filed such consent we still should not be justified in saying that the mandates of the constitution might be ignored. Be are, therefore, constrained to hold that the constitutional nn must be complied with as a condition precedent to permission consolidate. An order will be entered in this case authorizing the lation prayed for, the same to be effective upon condition that hie notice be given by publication as required by the constitution and &gt;y the legislative act above quoted. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE CONSIDERED AND ORDERED by the Ne - braska State Railway Commission that permission be granted to the North western Hell Telephone Company to purchase the property of the Sarpy County Mutual Telephone Association, which property is enum - erated in the application and to consolidate such property with its own property. This order shall become effective upon due proof being filed with this Commission showing that public notice for sixty days has l«-en 2iven to stockholders as required by the constitution and by chapter 63, lows 1027, pages 225-226. Should objection to the consolidation be made by any stockholder prior to the filing of proof of such notice, an opportunity to be heard will be granted to such stockholder. The Commission will retain this cause upon its docket until the period for filing objections has elapsed. Marie and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this seventeenth day of February, 1928.

The annual report for 1925 shows that the company had fixed assets at the time of the transfer in the amouat of $15,325.21 and working capital in the additional sum of $2,253.33, which consisted largely of t counts receivable, or total assets in the amount of $17,5 1 8.54. e liabilities consisted of common stock in the amount of $5,000, tes payable in the sum of $1,300 and a depreciation reserve in the 7,820. The surplus was $3,304.98. The report for 1926 that the new owner continued the principal accounts of the company as he found them, with the apparent exception of uncol - lected serviee revenues in the approximate amount of $2,000, which were charged to surplus, thereby reducing this figure to $1,581. It ■ pears that the purchaser did not assume the accounts payable sum of $1,300.

Applicant charged operating- expenses and credited its main - tenance and depreciation reserve for the year 1927, with $3,264, hich exceeds the amount fixed by the Commission in the sum of ap- ximatelv $1,200. It may be noted that the increase in the reserve tr the year above mentioned, is greater than the charge to profit d loss.

These figures were not disputed. For the mrpose of this order, the Commission will construct a new balance heet, using the engineering department's cost figures, including stores nd supplies, and the actual liabilities of the company with the excep - ion of depreciation reserve which will be adjusted to this actual depre - iation found in the property and the surplus charge will be the bal - ancing figure.

The depreciation reserve is the difference between the cost new and the cost less de- preciation. The loss in surplus is the result of writing 1 off the receiv- ables. The charges appearing in the above balance statement are not surprising, as the original figures in 1920 were estimates as stated above and the accounts have been continued for seven years and have been subjected to the errors that naturally creep in as the result of operation. The outstanding fact disclosed by the new appraisal is that the depreciation reserve has grown beyond mi of the company. A large part of the plant was constructed prior high prices of telephone materials and equipment.

When working capital, exclusive of stores an we have a present value of $19,100.

The estimated cost of the property as of the time of placement, we have showi above in the figures of $18,73(5.97. Having these facts in mind, the Commission believes and so finds that the present value of applicant' property, used and useful, for telephone purposes is $18,000. The record shows that the town portion of the exchange is in fair condition, with the exception of the switchboard, which applicant admitted should be replaced. A number of the service complaints re- lated at the hearing were traceable to the switchboard, apparently for the reason that it afforded poor and undependable connections. The testimony shows that the farm lines are not in good operat- ing condition. Several witnesses testified that as many as four poles located consecutively in the farm lines were gone, or broken, and not supporting the wires. In many places the insulators are off the pins or the wire was on the ground and in other instances, the tele- </seg>
            <seg id="p257">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 257 phone wires were touching trees. All these conditions contribute to poor service. A new switchboard will improve the situation, but a good deal of work will have to be done on the farm lines, to put them in good operating condition. kThe new switchboard will cost not to exceed $1,000 installed, will be added to the rate base of $18,000, making a total of DOU.00 on which a new schedule of rates will be predicated. Applicant's revenues and expenses for the year 1927, are as follows : REVENUES This shows the charge of $3,264 for maintenance and depreciation or the year 1927: $2,476.99 of this amount was actually used. In - uded in this figure is $1,500 for the salary of a lineman and local kanager. Approximately $300 additional is included for service per - ormed by the owner of the property, or a total of about $1,800 scpended for labor. The manager also charged $600.00 for super - ision, which appears in the salaries of officers. The books of the lompany were kept by another concern at an expense of fifty dollars &gt;er month or $600 a year. This work is ordinarily done by the local manager, or in many instances by the chief operator. The manager ives some distance from the plant and contends that he should be ompensated to the extent of $900 a year for traveling expenses nd supervision of the exchange. In short, we have charges for mintenanee and officers salaries, including the accounting expenses f $3,000 per annum. It is doubtful whether a small exchange should &gt;e expected to carry this burden. It amounts to approximately ine dollars per year on the 341 stations in service.

In other words, if a pole is displac-eil which '-"at two dollars in place in 1914, and the same size and kind of pole cost four dollars under present price levels, the difference of two dollars should be providede by the rates. This is the wrong principle. The rule which governs replacement is as follows: The cost of the new pole in place, less the loss of the old pole plus the cost of removal, less salvage, should be a charge to capital. Applicant must expect to finance net additions to plant. This is proper, as it adds value to the plant and may be capitalized. It follows, that the duty of the rate-payer does not include any obligation to contribute to the cost or value of the property devoted to his use.

No changes in rates are proposed for rural, supplemental or switching service. Subscribers now receive common battery service. At the time of hearing, applicant served eighty-one individual business subscribers, two hundred and sixteen individual residence subscribers, ten rural business and eighty-five rural residence subscribers. Testimony shows applicant is confronted with a rebuilding pro - gram at its Mitchell exchange. The switchboard is filled to capacity nd additional units must be added. In certain parts of town cable tpaeity is exhausted and for some time past party line service only tas been available. It was stated that there were forty-eight party ine subscribers, and twenty-eight grounded circuits that should be made metallic. Under the proposal the exchange is to be made full letallic and entirely cabled in town. Furthermore, all poles and wire 1 the main street of the town are to be removed and placed under - round. In this rebuilding program, applicant contemplates added nvestment in amount of $10,753. The company now owns a corner lot nd modern, one-story brick building on the main street of the town. ixce.pt for inadequacy, it was contended that the exchange was in a ell maintained condition. No subscribers complained of unsatisfact - ry service, and one of the two subscribers present who were protesting le rate increase stated : "Mitchell gives the best service of any town n the valley".

            <seg id="p262">262 TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT p_er month from rental for use of a portion of the telephone building which should have been included. However, these increases are more than overcome by applicant having used the gross rate as a basis for earnings in spite of the fact that a large percentage of its subscribers pay the net rate. If all the subscribers paid the net rate, the above estimated revenue would be reduced approximately £1200 from the amount shown. Referring to the deficit, it was the belief of applicant that this alleged annual deficit would be overcome gradually through an expected growth of the exchange. The Commissiou has checked applicant's statement of estimated expenses carefully. It is felt that some of these estimates are too high and that under actual operation, with the rate schedule proposed, the deficiency will not assume the proportion suggested. It seems certain, however, that any reasonable revision of estimated expenses could not be of such an amount as to make possible a fair and reasonable rate schedule, less than the one here proposed.

Hearing was held in the office of the Palisade one Company at Palisade, on Thursday, May 17, 1928, a,t ten a. m., that being the time and place specified in the notice to ted parties. The Palisade exchange is located about eight miles southeast o the town of Hamlet and serves about four hundred subscribers, in eluding the switched lines. The Hamlet exchange has twenty-seve subscribers on its exchange. The line between Palisade and Ilamle is owned by the Frenchman Valley Telephone Company and there ar thirteen subscribers served on this line. There is quite a volume o service being given over this line from Hamlet and lines switched b them through the Palisade exchange to other exchanges, includin Hayes Center, tbe county seat of Hayes county. EA count kept by the management of the Palisade exchangi month shows one hundred messages i a:-sing through this exc] i the Hamlet exchange and thirty messages from the Palisai Hamlet exchange.

There is no question but what both the Pa and Hamlet exchanges should have pay for toll service rendered their subscribers and the public, but due to the fact that the Frenchman Valley Telephone Company owns the line between Hamlet and Palisade and it is also a party line, the Commission cannot consider that class of service a toll line. Furthermore, as the Frenchman Valley Company owns the line and the Palisade CompanV has made application to make a charge for the use of the line and retain all of the toll collected and as Section 7091, Chapter 163, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, definitely sets out how proceeds from toll charges shall be divided between companies, the Commission would have no authority to grant the request of the applicant. Testimony disclosed that the management of the Palisade ex - change is negotiating for the purchase of a line to be used for toll, that would be owned by the Palisade company leading from Palisade to Hamlet. There is no question but what the charging of toll for service between Hamlet, Palisade and Hayes Center is a reasonable and justifiable charge. </seg>
            <seg id="p265">265 The Commission is of the opinion that until the Palisade com - pany provides a line between Palisade and Hamlet to be used as a toll line, that the application for charging 1 toll over the Frenchman \ alley line between Palisade and Hamlet should be denied.

The petition is signed by 157 subscribers, which is approxi mately eighty per cent of the total users of service at this exchange and is as follows: "We, the petitioners, whose names are signed to this petition, being subscribers to the service of the Platte Valley Telephone Corporation at its Bayard exchange and realizing that the cost of installing new equipment necessary to render common battery </seg>

            <seg id="p267">267 The petition was presented in person by a special committee eon- Bisting nt Ed. Deuker, mayor, and member of the Lions Club commit - tee. Frank MeCarter, chairman of the Lions Club committee, and J. A. StockweU, member of the Lions Club committee. This action originated by way of resolution passed by the local Lions Club, which is the only - civic club in Bayard, such resolution having for its purpose the secur - ing of common battery service for Bayard, and providing a committee which should circulate the petition above set forth. The committee advised that the petition had been presented in person to each sub - scriber whose name appears thereon, and its purposes and the results hieh might Follow, explained in detail. The eommittee insisted that ie matter be handled expeditiously by the Commission. It was stated tat Bayard is enjoying a splendid growth and prosperity. It serves prosperous trade territory. In line with its development, the com - lunity has been promised a splendid new depot by the Burlington rail - oad. In addition, a paving program is now underway, whereby the a in streets of the city will be paved. The committee urged espe - lally, immediate handling of the application in that on Monday night, unitary 23, paving contracts are to be let. If the rate schedule roposed is authorized, certain of applicant's properties are to be laced underground, and this is a matter of importance in the letting of the paving contract, so it was stated. They stated very emphatical - ly that Bayard is at the moment going through a period of splendid development: that the citizens of this community will no longer be satisfied with what they choose to call the old-fashioned "hand crank" telephone service, and that they are now demanding that the telephone pany be required to keep apace of the times, such demand being Elected by the petition generously signed by affected subscribers. Subsequent to the receipt of the petition, application has been received from the Platte Valley Telephone Corporation, indicating its willingness to provide common battery service at this exchange, ll the schedule of rates proposed in the petition is authorized. Ap - plicant also submits exhibit showing valuation of exchange property, and in a detailed way statement of earnings and expenses after conver - sion to common battery. If the figures in this exhibit are to be accepted, they would show an annual deficit under the rates proposed in the petition, of slightly more than $3,000. While applicant and a large percentage of its subscribers are in agreement as to the proper rate schedule, as is reflected by this application and the petition, this in nowise relieves the Commission of its obligation to determine what is n fair and reasonable rate, having in mind the company's financial requirements and the revenue which will flow from any given set of rates. Accordingly, the exhibit which is at hand has been carefully checked. Page one of the exhibit .shows the following estimate of earn - ings and expenses on the basis of a common battery plant: </seg>
            <seg id="p268">268 TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT Deficiency (red) $3,155.02 Note: Exchange expenses shown exclude all items of toll operating expense, and revenues as shown exclude all toll revenue.

Of this, &gt;21,86b 'consists of plant to be placed as a result of change to common bat tery. The Commission will make no effort to find fair value. careful review of estimated revenues and expenses would indicate that the schedule of rates proposed is not unreasonable. Furthermore, it is in line with the general schedule of rates collected at exck of similar size receiving a similar class of service. It is the general practice of the Commission to hold a hearing upon applications of this sort. However, it is very unusual for peti - tions to be presented signed by so large a percentage of subscribers affected, requesting the authorization of an increased rate. The pri - mary purpose for holding a hearing out in the state is that affected subscribers may be heard. Otherwise, the matter could be considere by the Commission in its offices, with a consequent saving of expense In this instance the generous signing of petitions by affected subserib eis might be an indication of no general desire to be heard furthei However, the Commission has no desire to foreclose any represent ative group of subscribers from being heard in the matter, if it deve - lops such is their desire. It will hold the matter in abeyance until February 1, that they may advise if hearing is desired on their part. If it develops that representative group of subscribers do desire hearing. the matter will be reopened and set down for hearing, at which time such subscribers will be expected to appear, present suet testimony us they may have at hand concerning the matter, and cross-examine Maintenance and depreciation Operating expense Taxes Rent on central office ■Interest — 8% per annum on plant investment (168,969.19) ... f\/\ Total expense $15,314.02 ARNINGS: Etiinated earnings based on telephones service on December 31, 1927, at jposed common battery rates $12,159.00 </seg>

            <seg id="p272">272 TWENTY-FIKST ANNUAL KKPOKT Corporation at its Bayard exchange, suoh petition requesting the Commission to direct the Platte Valley Company to provide ("cnuojn battery service at its Bayard exohange, the signers thereof agreeing to pay a certain schedule of rates set forth therein. The petition was followed by an application of the Platte Valley Telephone Corp - oration consisting of an aqaiescence in the request of the subscribers, agreeing to provide common battery service if and when the Hailway Commission authorized the schedule of rates which the signers of thp petition had agreed to pay. Alter a careful review of the financial requirements of applican the Commission feeling that petitioners represented the attitude of th community with respect to the change in service, authorized the schet ule of rates agreed to, finding that such rates were fair and reasonab rates if common batterv service were to be furnished. Such authoi ization was subject to one condition, however, namely, that if representative group of affected subscribers indicated a desire to b heard in the matter, the order was to be held in abeyance and furthe testimony taken. A petition was presented to the Commission, tl mine signed by a representative group of subscribers indicating a de sire to be heard. Accordingly a supplemental order was entered direc mg that the Commission's original order be held in abeyance am that hearing he held. Pursuant thereto, hearing was held at Bayard, Nebraska, in th city council rooms, on Wednesday, February '2'J. At that lame it wa stated by counsel for protestants that no objection was beiny offeree to the rate schedule proposed if the exchange be made common l&gt;atter\ He stated: "I believe the- rate is satisfactory if we obtain commo battery service. The reason I say that is not from any work that have gone to on these figures, but from, the fact that it has been •approved in other places. I feel that the Commission has worked th rate and the schedules over and are satisfied, and I believe it is a fa rate if we have the common battery service." Nio protest was offeree by any of the subscribers as to the reasonableness of the rates proposei if common battery service were to be furnished. The Commission original order herein carefully reviewed the company's linaneial re quirements and found that the schedule set forth in the petition o subscribers was fair and reasonable, and necessary it' common batter service be established. Under these circumstances it seems un necessary to further discuss applicant's financial requirements, ther being no issue raised at the time of the hearing as to the reasonable ness of the rates, and the Commission having carefully reviewed ap l}licant's financial necessities, and discussed them in the original orde hctrein. E Commission is accordingly, confronted, with only one question, what is the attitude of the subscribers at the Bayard exchange the change from magneto grounded service, to common batterv This must of necessity be the determining factor, since ap- </seg>
            <seg id="p273">273 plicant herein merely acquiesces, and is not an advocate. Quite naturally, a difficult task confronts the Commission. Without a re - ferendum whereby each subscriber indicates definitely his personal opinion in the matter, it is impossible to know precisely, exactly what the attitude of a community toward a community question. It, of tone, becomes an impossibility to hold a referendum or to call before e Commission, each and every subscriber and adduce his or hex stimouy with respect to the question involved. Seventeen witnesses appeared before the Commission at the time ! the hearing. Of these seventeen, five were definitely in favor of the 'oposed change. The majority of these had signed the petition asking »r common battery service. Twelve were opposed to the change nmwiftriring the testimony of those in favor of the change they state&lt; iat they favored a community program for Bayard which was pro - ressive. They stated it as their opinion that Bayard should kee] iace of the times and that the telephone industry should be require&lt; ■ keep in step and furnish the community this higher type of service hich was rendered in other towns in the valley the size of Bayard 'hey also stated that in their opinion, if a referendum on the question juld be taken, that a majority of the subscribers affected would favo le improved service at the higher rate. Some of them referred t le fact that at the present time, sen-ice is highly unsatisfactory. I as their thought that this was attributable, not to the human element ut rather to a system which made it inherently impossible to provid le prompt, efficient, reliable service that is now necessary. Witness tollinger, a member of the committee who circulated the petitions, •stified to the fact that such petitions were circulated under instruc ions from the Lions Club, which is the only civic organiaation in Bay rd. He stated that the question was presented at a regular meetin of the Lions Club and that by an almost unanimous vote, this organ - zation went on record as favoring common battery service at a fair and reasonable rate. As one of the circulators of the petitions, he also stated that it was his purpose to explain carefully to each subscriber npproached by him, just what was involved, i.e., that they were pro - •iisinjr a higher type service for Bayard, and that it involved an in- Teased rate, indicating the rate which would be collected if the change vere authorized. L Protestants were quite unanimous in agreeing that higher rates ere undesirable, and stated that they preferred to get along with he present service at present rates rather than to pay increased rates or an improved service. The majority of them felt that service was not just what might be desired, but several of them expressed it as heir opinion that the unsatisfactory service was more due to indiffer - ent and untrained operators than to the nature and style of equipment tA few found no fault with service now furnished. Some of questioned the rosy future predicted for Bayard, and felt that it conditions were none too fortunate. One or two suggested </seg>
            <seg id="p274">274 that increased rates would necessitate the discontinuance of telephone service. tAt the conclusion, proponents and protestants indicated tint my more witnesses could be called and further cumulative testimony esented indefinitely, which of course is true. Without question tnesses appearing for and against the change were high type, re - esentative citizens, who were sincere in their expressions of wha ey thought was best for their community. They evidenced ever; sire for fairness, and tolerance of eaich other's views. And so the matter comes before the Commission for final ordei The Commission is in somewhat of a Quandary in attempting to de termine definitely, from the testimony, just what the citizenry of Bay urd desire in this matter. The testimony of representative citizens i highly contradictory as to just what the attitude of a majority o the affected subscribers actually is. Accordingly, the Commission must go further before reaching it - conclusions. The following facts, none of which are conclusive, l&gt;ut which, when considered together might lie said to further indicate the attitude of affected subscribers, might be stated: The proposed change has been heartily endorsed in the ed column of the local paper. The major of the town was a member of the special comi appearing originally before the Commission, his presence, hoi being as a member of the committee, and he in nowise presumi speak officially for the city council. proposed change has received the almost unanimous approval the local Lions Club, which is the only civic organization in Bayard. I Petition signed by 15/ of the subscribers affected, asks for th. ange and approval of the rate schedule. The Commission realizes at a petition does not provide conclusive evidence. It was for x\\i- reason that the original order was conditional. However true iat, with one exception, no one appeared at the hearing whose nani vas on the petition, to protest or object. One subscriber, whose nam ppeared on both petitions, testified that he was now opposed to ii Teased rates. It was stated that some eight or nine names in al ppeared on both petitions. Xo one contended that duress was use 1 securing the signatures, or that misrepresentation as to what \va ontemplated was indulged in. Having in mind the conflict in testi iony on the part of the limited number of witnesses which could 1&gt; ailed, it is felt that the above facts are important. Tt is also proper to give consideration to the present telephone system in Bayard and its future status. The service i&gt; now magneto Grounded, sometimes called the "old hand-crank" system. A certain amount of cross talk is inevitable and annoying delays are unavoidable. </seg>
            <seg id="p275">275 Ik ;iiid will make possible a speedier, more satisfactory service. This certain. Furthermore, the company is confronted with an immediate construction program whether the exchange remain magneto abounded become common battery metallic. At the time of the hearing, the vitchboard could accommodate but ten or twelve additional individual bse libers. Alter that, further applicants for service would be ob - imil to take party line service. Again, contracts have been let, and iving is to be placed on the main streets of Bayard. The company ust either now place its wire leads under ground at those points iere they cross the main street, or do so at some later date at much I eater expense. Since the company is confronted with a reeonstrue - m program in the immediate future, which program will properly ntemplate the telephone needs of the community for a number of mis tn come and will determine the class of service which can be ndered during those years; having in mind the further fact that ivnnl through the years, has been a growing, developing city, having tmiiid also the fact that Bayard is the only city of its size in the Hey which does not have the higher type common battery service, fis being an indication, at least, of what Bayard citizens, if not now, flic very near future will be unanimously demanding; the Commission S forced to reach the .conclusion that now is the proper time to direct he change of common battery. The change can be made with greater tonomy now than later and provides a standard of service which no ulit will be satisfactory for many years to come. I In conclusion it is the Commission's opinion that a sufficient mand for common battery service exists on the part of affected ibscribers, to justify directing the company to make the change. It I also the opinion of the Commission, having in mind the demand of c telephone-using public everywhere, for prompt, efficient, high-type lephone service, and the immediate reconstruction program confront - ing the company in either event, that the best interests of all concerned will be inure nearly conserved if the company's reconstruction program foT the future contemplates the furnishing of common battery service for the coming period of years, rather than the continuance of magneto -rounded service.

OPINION AND ORDER BY THE COMMISSION: Applicant herein is a public service corporation organized and eiisting under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Delaware. It was incorporated on the 19th day of November, 1924. It owns and operates utilities exclusively in Nebraska. Its principal properties are the gas plants at Norfolk and Columbus, an electric property at Albion, telephone property at Jackson, and electric transmission lines near Sioux City on the Nebraska side of the river. All of its capital stocik is owned by the Central Wfest Public Service Company also a Delaware corporation which owns the stock of utility corporations which operate in Minnesota and North Dakota. The parent company owns and operates electric utilities in Iowa and South Dakota, where it has no -i diaries. Central West Public Service Company of Nebraska has applied to this Commission for a permit to issue a six per cent, thirty-year, first mortgage in the par amount of $500,000 to be used as collateral by the parent company, which has issued its first lien collateral indenture, dated November 1, 1926, in which the First Trust &amp; Savings Bank of Chicago, is made trustee. This is a combination first mortgage and collateral lien. It is a first mortgage on all of the property owned and operated directly by the Central West Public Service Company in Iowa and South Dakota and a lien on all the securities issued by its subsidiaries, whose stocks and bonds are deposited with the trustee as ( ollateral. Under the mortgage and collateral lien, there is now issued -4,000,000 par value of 5y 2 per cent gold bonds. This is secured directly by property and collaterals in the amount of $8,700,000. The catio of bonds outstanding to the security is approximately forty-six per cent. Additional bonds may be taken down to the amount of 100 per cent of the next $650,000 of property adqu'ired or constructed on n basis of appraisal, or cost, whichever is the less and thereafter bonds may be taken down on the ratio of 75 per cent of the security in property and collateral. This provision may result eventually in bonds outstanding by the parent company in an amount much higher than the present ratio. The indenture further provides that on or before November 1, 11127, the parent company shall deposit bonds with the trustee in an amount not less than 75 per cent of the fair market value, or cost of the properties of each subsidiary as of July 31, 1926, as a sub - stitute for the stock now held as collateral. Pursuant to this pro - w-ion this application is made. </seg>
            <seg id="p278">278 TWENTY-FIRST AK.VLAL REPORT Petitioner submitted a physical valuation ui its property in \"e- Eia. which shows an estimated cost of reproduction new, as of July 926, in the amount of $926,370 and the same less depreciation in mm of $824,509. These figures include working capital, going irn value and a water right in the gross amount of $160,500. The property, exclusive of these items, was appraised at $064,009. may be compared with the purchase price of $652,900. Additions betterments have been made to October 31, 1927, at a cost of +51,000. The above estimate includes the property of the Columbus Gas I any at $139,400, the Albion Electric Light Company at $129,000, orfolk Light &amp; Fuel Company at $284,500 and other utility pro - including the telephone plant at Jackson and transmission lines Dakota City, in the sum of $100,000. The stock of thie above rations was acquired and their indebtedness represented by bonds urrent liabilities in the sum of approximately $370,000 has lieen The common stock now represents the entire equity in the pro- perty. The purchase price and the inventory value, less working capital, are in reasonable agreement. The mortgage runs against the fixed property; therefore, working capital should be excluded and value for going concern, such properties may have, including- the water right, was includ purchase price. The purchases were made at a recent date. The testimony show-; that the generating plant at Albion, which consists of hydro-electric generating equipment and internal tion engines, will be used as a stand-by for future operation, i company is able to buy electric current delivered over a transn Pat a price which is less than the cost of production. The engii be moved to a different location and the use of the hydro eqn t limited to off-peak periods. Two engines have been included appraisal which are located at Valley. They are not connec with applicant's property and will be moved when the company' of operation is more fully developed. These and other changes in the property which may be required in the near future, suggest heavy charges to depreciation and, therefore, suggest a conservative attitude toward the face amount of the mortgage. The Commission believes and so finds that the face amount of the mortgage applied for should be reduced from $500,000 to $400,000. Applicant's gross income is $169,58i and the sum set u|&gt; as available for depreciation and interest is $93,02'). The indenture provides that 12^ per cent of the gross revenue shall be expended for maintenance or credited to a reserve. Petitioner's operating exper - iences with this property is brief and the above results may not re - flect a fair average for the future.

OPINION AND FINDING MILLER, Commissioner: This case came on for hearing by the filing 01 application o the part of the Lincoln Telephone and Telegraph Company, ( Februar (5, 1928) asking for authority to abandon its telephone exchange a Hansen. Hearing was held after due notice had been given, in th village of Hansen on March 20, 1928, which was attended by a vev\ large number of the applicant's subscribers. The basis of thi application will be found in chapter 144 of the Session Laws of N&lt; braska for 1923, pages 357 and 358, which provides as follows: "Section 1, Maintenance and Retention of Existing Tele - phone Exchange — A telephone exchange, central office and switchboard shall be maintained where there is an existing ex - change by one or more telephone companies operating more than ten exchanges, in every incorporated city or village in the state of Nebraska, and no existing exchange, or central office shall be abandoned or discontinued by any company or removed to another &lt;iity or village except by the written consent of at least sixty per cent of the subscribers or patrons who had rental or </seg>

(Ap - proved April 18, 1923)." The applicant company operates more than ten exchanges in the tate, among others the exchange at Hansen. Testimony at the hearing showed that applicant company is now operating at its Hansen exchange, one hundred forty-nine company owned stations, of which number fourteen are town sub - »i-ril&gt;ers and one hundred thirty-four are rural subscribers and one pay station. Attached to the application filed in the case was a petition signed by seventy per cent of the Hansen subscribers giving their consent to the proposed discontinuance of the said exchange an&lt;l their willingness to accept Hastings service, which would be furnished from the Hastings exchange. It was the general under - standing when the petition was circulated that there were two pro- iiiLi'ortanee and they were: P First : That there would be no increase in its rates, and that I "resent chief operator at Hansen would be taken care of as to future employment. The evidence showed further, that the total revenue from the Hansen exchange lacked $341.01 in 1926 of meeting the actual operating expense, not including any return on the invest - ment ; and likewise lacked $692.79 of meeting operating expenses for the yiear 1W27 ; and for the month of January, 1928, the revenues were short $73.19 of meeting the actual expense. b Testimony of the commercial superintendent was to the effect by abandoning the exchange it would mean an annual saving of t $800 in operating expenses per year, these items being made t' operators' wages, rent, heat and light, and such other expenses maintain a central office. The general manager of the company explained that the dis - continuance of the Hansen exchange should result in better telephone service to the Hansen community and by reason of the fact that they would cut-in directly upon the switchboard in the city of Hastings, making available to the Hansen subscribers telephone communication to ihe 4,600 subscribers on the Hastings exchange without having to go to the trouble of going through a central in Hansen. The Commission has had a considerable number of similar applica - tions before it in the past year. The fact cannot be disputed that not only this applicant company, but other telephone companies in Nebraska, have been and are now operating exchanges which are too small to stand on their own feet, so far as paying operating expenses </seg>
            <seg id="p282">282 TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT and giving the owners a return on the investment. In all instances where applications have been made to discontinue or abandon such exchanges, the Commission has been vitally interested in obtaining assurance that tbje community affected would be assured of equally good or better telephone service, regardless of the closing of the exchange, and in the present case it is apparent from the testimony not only of the applicant company, but of the Hansen subscribers who were present at the hearing, that their telephone service will actually be improved by the proposed change. ■here were a number of the subscribers who were very anxious assured that present free service between Hansen and the ex - ;s at Doniphan would be retained. Kbe testimony shows that the Doniphan exchange is owned by iuailton County Farmers Telephone Association and that under contractual agreement the Lincoln company and the Hamilton ,• company have furnished free interchange of service between n and Doniphan for a number of years. The general manager of the applicant company assured th subscribers that the Lincoln company had no intention of diseontinu ing this free service at the present time. Kis apparent, however, that no change in the service bt in and Hansen could be made by the applicant company mission of this Commission, and the question, therefore. her discussion in this opinion. BThe only rate change which le Hansen exchange, would be month for business subscribers, ansen will be served on one line five business phones in Hansen, would follow the discontinuai a reduction of twenty-five eei nr provided the bus hers b month, one paying for individual line service, $4.00 per month. icant proposes to serve these subscribers on one line from Hast - exchange at a rate of $3.25 per month per subscriber. The ten party rate, which includes rural, and likewise includes the nine town residence phones, would be $1.75 per month, the same as at present. I he Commission feels, however, that, considering all of the condi - surrounding the operations of small exchanges, the abandonment ! Hanseii exchange is in line with good business judgment; that arnishing of service from the Hastings exchange will not be lental to the Hansen subscribers; and that, therefore, the appli - i will be granted. ■l the matter of furnishing employment for Mrs. Lyle, the present operator at Hansen, the Commission recognizes that this i- ■ ferial problem over which is has no jurisdiction, but it is the standing, and was so definitely stated at the hearing, that the At the present time the company four of whom pay a rate of $3.50 </seg>
            <seg id="p283">283 Empany would retain the service of Mrs. Lyle and no doubt, the ap - eant company will keep its arrangements in regard to this matter. The rates applicable to the Hansen subscribers, after being in U&lt; the Hastings exchange will be as follows: i $3.25 per month 2.25 per month 1.75 per month mess, six party Business, ten party Residence (rural) ten party ites will be billed as is customary with the company, and the ross and net rate will be continued in full force and effect, From the Tacts determined at the said hearing the Commission, therefore, finds that it is for the benefit of the Hans'en subscribers that the present telephone exchange operated at Hansen be discon- 1 abandoned and that the subscribers be served from the i exchange at the city of Hastings, County of Adams. Xe - il permission to so abandon said exchange will, therefore. a lltlM ORDER THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway n that, effective as soon as arrangements are made by the i;uiv to furnish service from its Hastings exchange, and therewith, the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company may i ?ident mil abandon its operations of its telephone exchange and fice at Hansen, that thereafter the following schedule of Hansen subscribers: Gross Net Busk Bnsii six party ten party i rural) ten party $3.50 $3.25 2.50 a 2.00 .1 s The Commission's standard rule relative to the collection of gross and net rates shall prevail: also its standard rule as to charges for desk sets and for farm line business service.

Mi-Laiiu'hliii, attorney, L. H. Dillie, train master. For the protestants — S. C. Copple, banker. OPINION AND FINDING HAN'DALL, Chairman: Hearing was held on this application in the Missouri Pacific depot at Walton on the 2&lt;th day of April, 1928, at 12 o'clock p. in. The Missouri (Pacific Railroad company made application Ps the station and have the business transacted through the agent incoln. The service furnished by the railroad company at Walton ists of two passenger trains and two freight trains, each way. day. One freight train handling only car load shipments aud twu passenger trains stopping only on flag. Walton is situated 8.63 miles east of Lincoln and 7.32 miles west of Eagle. Jt is an unincorporated village of about eighty inhabit- ants. There are two stores, a garage, a bank, post office and a con bolidated school, one church, an oil company and an implement store and elevator. It is connected with the main highway leading to Lincoln b\ graveled road and nearly all of the less than carload freight and express is being transported to and from the town by trucks. The railroad company introduced an exhibit showing that during the months from June to November, 11)2&lt;, inclusive, that the business transacted by the railroad company at Walton, was as follows : Less than carload freight inbound $118.50 and cream shipments amounted to 2.2 L making a total revenue from less than carload freight, express and cream of $253.57 The expense of maintaining the station at present is approxi - mately $1,000 a year, or $500.00 for the six months shown by the exhibit, and about twice as much as the less than carload, Less than carload freight outbound Dwing to the graveled roads and close proximity to Liineoln, the passeng-er business has fallen off to luring the six months in question. Revenue from, jxpress shipments was i </seg>
            <seg id="p285">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION" 285 passenger, express and cream business amounts to for the same period. The ear load business at the station for the six months period in 1927, amounts to $9,269.18 and for the yeaT the revenue to the company amounted to $14,883.67. As shown by the records in the Commission's office the revenue from car load shipments in 1925 amounted to $13,927.85 and for 1926 the revenue was $20,056.92 lne records in the Railway Commission office show the total less than carload and ticket sales for the years 1925, 1926 and 1927 as follows These figures show that the less than carload freight has fallen. off and ticket sales have fallen off materially during the year I!t27, which is evidently due to the fact that the road from Walton has been graveled and that the less than carload freight business is being taken care of to some extent, by the trucks to and from the station and with the prevalent use of the automobile, the passenger business has decreased over fifty per cent. The Commission records also show that in 1925 there were 39 oars of sand and gravel; in 1926 — 172 cars and in 1927 — 63 cars. This sand and gravel was used for the graveling of the highway and i lie Shrine Playground. These shipments of sand and gravel for the vears 1925, 1926 and 1927 undoubtedly amount to mue,h more than shipments of this nature will in the future. These figures also indi - cate that the car load business outbound at Walton is of quite a con - siderable volume, but as most of these shipments are grain which could bye billed at Lincoln, without added expense to the railroad com - pany, and with very little, if any, inconvenience to the shippers, the Commission is of the opinion that the company could handle the bus - iness of Walton in a more economical manner than it is now being handled. I The Commission is of the opinion that where economies can be ■acticed by railroad companies when it does not materially discom - ode the public, they should be permitted to do so. The Commission is &lt;&gt;|&gt;posed to the closing of the station as prayed for in the applica - tion. There is no question but what the citizens of Walton are entitled to more service than the railroad eompanj' proposed in their application, and the Commission believes that the business can be handled by a custodian, the depot kept open and handled the same M has been in the past where an agent is employed, with the excep - tion of selling tickets, the receiving of payment for freight and the Less than carload freight Tii-ket sales $299.32 252.60 $288.37 248.61 $252J&gt;4 112.72 Total $551.92 ,|536.98 $365.26 </seg>

OPINION AND FINDING RANDALL, Chairman L Hearing 1 was held on this application in the Missouri Pacifi Mynard, Nebraska, on Tuesday, April 24, 1928, at 10:00 n., in accordance with notices sent to interested parties. de The Missouri Pacific Railroad Company made application ti the station of Mynard and have the business of the station tran at Plattsmoutii. or Murray. The service of the railroad coi furnished at Mynard is one passenger train and one freight trail way, per day. The telegraph business furnished the people ii le Bof M\nard is done through ph station. Plattsmouth. Mvnar Ehe company offered an exhibit icted at Mynard from June t s: showing the amouni of bi i November, inclusive, 1" Carload revenue, inbound and outbound Less than carload revenue, inbound and outbound....$164.1] Ticket revenue 17.94 Ihe expense incurred in maintaining this agency for the period in question was $568.38. Mynard is located 4.2 miles north of Murray and 3.51 miles south of Plattsmouth. It is a villace with a population of about thirty in - habitants. There is one store, a harness shop, a garage, two elevators, both being operated by the Wilson Elevator Company of Nebraska City. There is one church, but no school in the town. Mynard is located so close to the city of Plattsmouth that there is no possibility of an increase in population, or business.

            <seg id="p289">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 289 load business constitutes nearly the entire volume of business trans- iti'cl at the station, a&gt; the revenue from less than carload freight liipinents inbound was only $154.41 and outbound $9.70, which would make a total of $164.11 of less than carload freight received and the assenger revenue for the six months only amounted to $17.94; the xpness revenues were $53.70, cream shipments $47.28, which would lake a total of business transacted at the station, other than carload lipments, of $283.03, at an expense of $568.72, so that the expense of inducting the business of the station was twiae as much as the revenue eceived at the station for less than carload shipments, passenger, e.x - ress and cream revenue. The carload shipments could have been illed at Flattsinoiith, or Murray, without any additional expense to le company and very little, if any, inconvenience to the shipper. tWith the expense of maintaining the station at approximately ,200 a year and with an income from less than carload shipments, ket sales, express and cream, amounting to only $506.00, approxi- titelv, the Commission is of the opinion that the railroad company ould bp permitted to make a change in the conducting of the business :t that station, and that the application of the company should not be granted to close the station, but that a custodian should be employed to look after the business of the company at Mynard. This would bring about a material economy without much inconvenit'iicle to the public and the station would be kept open for the accommodation of its patrons. \ custodian could perform all the duties that are being performed I v the agent at the present tinu 1 , with the exception of accepting money tor freight, the billing of cars and less than carload shipments and Belling ticket-. This billing could be done either at Plattsmouth or Murray, by the agent at those stations without anv serious inconven- the shippers and if the business is conducted by a custodian be company could reduce the expenses of the station approximately 800 a year and at the same time give the patrons adequate service. After considering all the evidence and conditions governing th case, the Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the Missour I aeifie Railroad Company's application to close their station at Mynare should be denied, but that the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company should be permitted to substitute custodial service for agency servi&lt;* at the station of Mynard, under the following order.

            <seg id="p294">294 TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OPINION AND FINDING RANDALL, Chairman This application of the Glenwood Telephone Company of Holstein District No. 6, to increase rates from $1.50, net, to $1.~5, gross, per month, making an additional cost to the subscribers of three dollars per year, in order to pay off an indebtedness of the company of $2,500 ■was heard at the opera house in Holstein at ten o'clock a. m. on the fourteenth day of May, 1928, this being the time and place that notice had been given that hearing would be held. There were a large number of stockholders and citizens present and testimony was presented by the company to substantiate the reasons for their application. I he company was not in position to make an accurate statement the value of its property, but it was shown by the testimony that debtedness of $2,500 that had accrued, had been nsed in tl Qg and betterments of the property. In reality, this -r2,500 has nvested and should be charged to capital account, so that rates be based on the investment of the company, which would include i2,500. If this indebtedness had been brought about by. reason smanagement of the payment &lt;&gt;t dividends, when in reality there •€ I it sufficient funds on hand to pay dividends, the Commisi nsider basing rates on a return on any part of thi&gt; an as been clearly shown that the money has been invested the Commission believe- that this $2,500 should be ad ty account. A valuation made by the Railway Commiss M 20, 1926, shows the original cost of the plant as $15,102.09 ai preciated original cost as $10,623.53. Testimony shows that i this indebtedness was invested' in a new switchboard at a co $908.33 and the value of the switchboard removed was approximately $25. which would leave a net additional investment of $803.33. This amount added to the original cost of the plant would be $15,985.42 on which the company would be entitled to earn. It developed in the hearing in the testimony of the officers that, at the time the valuation was made, the company was in possession of some property that they did not disclose to the engineer and it was not included in the appraisal, so that it is safe to sav and reasonable to suppose that the value of the property is really more than is reflected in the valuation figures. It also developed that a number of the stockholders own their own instrument* and the company had been charging them $1.25 per month for service and allowing them a discount of twenty-five cents per month by reason of them owning their phones, while the subscribers who did not own their phones were paying $1.50 per month gross and were allowed a twenty-five cent per month discount from that amount, if paid during the ensuing month. This practice indicates that the eonv - pany has been discriminating betwe?n stockholders and non-stock- </seg>
            <seg id="p295">XEBKASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 295 holders in the charge they have been making for service which is illegal, as service to all subscribers should be the same, in the same class of subscriber service. There is no question but what the man who owns his telepht.nn. instrument should have something for the use of his investment, but three dollars per year for the use of an instrument that cost anywhere from twelve to fifteen dollars is an unreasonable amount tn be allowed. The company is not justified in the allowance of this amount for the use of the phone and it should not be permitted to charge rates to those not owning: phones that would permit of this amount being paid. Applicant asked 1'or a gross rate of $1.75 and a net rate of $1.50 month for all classes of phones. I'he company has ten business phones; sixty residence phones in illage that are metallic, and approximately one hundred seventy tounded farm line phones operated from this station. The company s nut been making any difference in the rate between grounded and metallic service, nor has it been making: any difference between residence amtl business phones. This is an unusual situation and should l&gt;e corrected as the investment for metallic service is much more than for grounded service and grounded service patrons should not be K quired to pay for an additional investment that is made to give n ice to those who have that class of service. It is also obvious that asiness phones should pay a higher rate than a residence or farm rit- subscriber, as these business phones are all given the metallic tr\ ice and arc more extensively used than the ordinary residence or rui line phone. »t experience shows that operating expenses have been approxi - $3,500 per year; whereas, operating revenues at the present ttes amount to approximately •t ; 4,000. This would leave $500, which not a sufficient return on all the property used and useful, in the rvice of the telephone public. r ITlic company is entitled to make a reasonable return on its invest - ;nt. Basing the value of the property on the valuation made by the immission's engineer, adding the increased cost of the switchboard ice the valuation was made, makes a total of approximately $16,000, which the company should be permitted to earn not less than syven r cent, which would amount to $1,120.00 ic company should be required to set aside not less than Ine per cent for depreciation and reserve which amounts to 1,440.00 aerators' salaries amount to 1,380.00 iconnting and managing 300.00 ffice supplies, light, heat and power 118.00 :her general expenses 100.00 aking a total of $4,458.00 There are approximately 170 phones owned bv the stockholders </seg>
            <seg id="p296">296 TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT and while we have no accurate figure as to their value and an estimate has to be made, the Commission believes a conservative estimate of this class of property would be on an averajre of ten dollars per instrument and that the owners of these phones are entitled to seven per cent for the use of these phones which would amount to $119. This expense added to the total operating: expenses would amount to $4»677 and the company should be permitted to make a rate that will raise this amount to meet these expenses as enumerated, as follows . Gross Net 10 business phones 60 residence phones 170 rural phones $2.50 $2.25 2.00 1.75 1.75 1.60 1.35 ■'he net rate would amount to $4,284 and to this should be added toll revenue per year, or a total of $4,65!}. This leaves a de - cy of eighteen dollars, which undoubtedly would be made up from ise in toll charge and jrross payments. The $2,500 indebtedness of the company can be taken care of by the company in one of two ways, first by issuing and selHng stock; second, by forejroinjr the declaring of dividends and offing the undivided profits in paying off the loan. The Commission is leaving the payment of this indebtedness to the judgment of the company. There was no complaint from any of the subscribers service and, as the company has quite a wide-spread territory, the subscribers being given service over the Glenwood Telephone system, the Commission considers that the rates to be charged arc very re able and will raise the necessary revenue to carry on the busines the company, based on the actual investment and cost of operation.

On February 15, 1928, this company filed application with the Commission for authority to discontinue the operation oi' its exchange a&lt;t Tarnov, and to furnish Tarnov subscribers with service from Platte Center. |:tached to said application is a statement signed by thirty-four the forty-seven subscribers of the Tarnov exchange, agreeing e telephone service of applicant from the Platte Center cx - &gt;, at the legally established rates therefor, in lieu of the serv - r received from the Tarnov exchange. Signers of said statement t to the discontinuance anil abandonment of the existing central and switchboard at Tarnov. On March 14, 1928, general notice having been given to subscrib - ers affected by the proposed change, the Commission conducted a formal hearing on said application at the State Bank of Tarn' Tarnov. A number of subscribers were present and testified at the En May 2b", 1928, the Commission received a petition si enty-four of the subscribers of the Tarnov exchange, w n contains the following recital : "We the undersigned subscribers of the Monroe Independent Tele- I phone Company's Tarnov exchange, in the interest of night service, Sunday service and better telephone service, hereby request the Nebraska State Railway Commission to grant the request of the above named company to run our lines into Platte Center instead of Tarnov, Nebraska." The Monroe Independent Telephone Company operates eight ex - changes located at the following points: Albion, Loretto, Newman Grove, Lindsay, Genoa, Monroe, Platte Center, and Tarnov. At the time of the hearing, forty-seven subscribers were being served from the Tarnov exchange, of which number thirty-seven were rural and ten town subscribers. The town subscribers are divided into two classes, seven business and three residence. It appears that two of the residence subscribers are furnished telephone service free, the phones having some connection with a church. This practice of furnishing free telephone service should be discontinued as it is obviously a discrimination against thie other subscribers. The '■&lt;mi - pany will be expected to remedy this stituation. The population of Tarnov, according to the last census, is 128- </seg>
            <seg id="p299">299 The company proposes, it it is permitted to abandon the exchange ;it Tarnov, to construct one metallic line ami one grounded circuit between Tarnov and Platte Center, and with these, render service to the ten subscribers at Tarnov. Subscribers desiring grounded service will be required to pay one dollar net per month for party residence, wall type, and two dollars net for party business, wall type. This is the authorized party residence and business grounded rate of Platte i ciiicr exchange. Applicant desires to charge those subscribers desiring metallic service, the sum of two dollars net per month for party residence, wall type, and three dollars net for party business, wall type. The rural subscribers will be connected with the Platte Center exchange by building new lines to them out of Platte Center exchange. No change in rates or service will be made as to the rural subscribers in any way. The town subscribers at Tarnov at present pay $1.35, net, and f].6O, gross, lor party residence service, wall type, and $2.15, net, and $2.40, gross, party business, wall type, the above being jnrounded service. Under the new plan, subscribers desiring grounded service will receive a slight reduction while those desiring metallic serviee will receive an increase. Private toll service, under the new plan, will be furnished over the long distance toll circuit of the Northwestern Bell Telephone Com - pany, from a booth to be placed in some convenient business house at Tarnov, which place is to be selected by the town subscribers of It is asserted by representatives of applicant that the change will materially improve the service in that night service will le more reliable- and Sunday serviee available and the general service more prompt, as the business on th£ Platte Center board will require the onstant attention of the operators, thus assuring prompt service calls, Applicant alleges that the maintenance and operation of the schange at Tarnov is a burden on applicant company by reason of le fact that the annual expenditure is greater than the annual re - inues. The total income from said exchange, according to the ap - lication, for the year 1927, was $700.80 while the expenses of leration amounted to $1,005.23, or an actual loss of $304.43. Ap - lieant alleges that these sums are arrived at without taking into nsideration any return whatsoever on the company's investment in lephone property used and useful in serving the community of Tarnov. pplicant alleges that the proposed change will result in a saving of 'rom $250 to $300 annually, on the operating expenses.

At the present time magneto metalli service is furnished to &lt;ity subscribers and grounded service to rura subscribers. Applicant serves 604 subscribers ai this time, of \v switched subscribers, the remainer being divided as follows: It rural, 230 city residence, 73 city business and three pay stations. is alleged that piesent rates arc inadequate and confiscatory ; thi for the last number of years the exchange has lacked much i.t paj ing anything like a fair return on the investment. In 1H2G tota ixcluuiye earnings including toll amounted to $11,180 with total opei ating expenses of $11,356, leaving a deficit of $196. In L927 tota exchange earnings including toll were $11,224 and total operating cos were $16,342, leaving $882 for return on investment, or approximate 2.7 per cent on a book value of $32,445. For these reasons applicai found it necessary to £ive consideration to its rate fabric at thi exchange. Finding it necessary to propose rate changes, it was decmc, advisable to propose at the same time an improvement in the type &lt;&gt; service furnished. Accordingly, the proposal from common battery service for citv subscribers and full metallic service for rural sub scribers is presented. Applicant's present central office equipment is housed in rented quarters which are not satisfactory, in that they are not fireproof V [earing was held in the matter in the Community Hall at Syra on March 2, 1928.

Having in mind the fact that eonsider - ble portions of exchange properties have been, or are to be, of recent oustrnetion, and placed during a period of high unit costs, the eom- book cost figure does not appear to be unreasonable. I'nder the schedule of rates as proposed, applicant estimates its ■tal revenue to be $1:3,827.74 derived as follows: $12,618.1!) exchange erviee revenue: $1,064.64 toll service revenue; $205.47 miscellaneous evenue; $120.56 (red) licensee revenue. Its total expenses estimated ii a basis of the changed service are $11,352.84, leaving net earnings I $2,474.90. I sing the book cost figure of $44,446 as a basis for anting, this would provide for return of 5.5 per cent on the book cost r prudent investment figure. This is not an unreasonable return upon vhat the Commission considers is not an excessive fair value of the iropertiee. At the time of the hearing W. H. Anderson appeared for the business Men's Association of Syracuse, and urged the change in city erviee from magneto to common battery. He stated that the improved service at reasonable rates had been endorsed by the Business Men's Association, which is the only civic organization in Syracuse, and that inder its instructions, petitions had been circulated. The petitions •arrying the names of ninety subscribers, representing one hundred and eleven business and residence stations, were presented for the ■ecord, readiny as follows: "In order to improve the service, the undersigned telephone subscribers of the Syracuse, Nebraska, exchange, request the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company to change the service to common battery', knowing that when the change is made it will be necessary for the telephone company to charge the rates for local service listed below, and we agree to the payment of the following rates: </seg>
            <seg id="p304">304 Net Some opposition was voiced to the increased rates, more especially on the part of rural subscribers. They indicated every desire to be fair, but i'elt that present rural service is satisfactory. Applicant stated that with the coming of high voltage transmission lines, the tarnishing of satisfactory rural service over grounded lines was in - creasingly difficult: also, that exclusive of the problem of inductive interference, a higher type rural service with much less of cross-talk can be rendered over metallic rural lines. The ComSmission knows that this is true. It is alsn familiar with the constantly increasing problem of inductive interference and recognises the necessity for rural metallic service, as hiiih voltage transmission lines make their appear - ance in rural Kebraska. If the change be rnaile on rural lines to metallic service, applican ignees to install a recently invented receiver honk device known switch hook latch, which makes possible parties on rural line ng in without interfering with the service.

The applicant is also the secretary and manager. The property was purchased in July. 1920. At the time the property was purchased it was in poor condition and it was necessary to entirely rebuild the property. Applicant paid $6,000 cash for the property. At that time there was $3,050 in stock out - standing, so at the time the property was purchased by applicant, the purchase property was approximately double the value of the amount of stock outstanding and since that time there has been no additional stock issued. Applicant from time to time has loaned the company money for the purpose of reconstruction and rebuilding and each and every time this money has been advanced, the company has issued a note. In 1922, a note for $1,175 was issued: this was partially paid off so that in 1923 the amount evidenced by note was $585. The following year in addition to the expenditure of the earnings of the company in betterments, there was $140 additional; the following year $150, which leaves at the present time a note of $775 that is outstanding against the company, which the company desires to pay out of the proceeds of the stock they have applied for. </seg>

At the time the property was pur- hased the book value- of the fixed property was #6,887. 03. Consider- ing tin; property at that time to be in a seventy per 'cent condition, his would make the approximate value of the fixed property $4,725. There were also working assets of $1,265; this made the depreciated wiliie of the property, plus the working assets $5,990.

The value of the pro - ertj governed the price paid. The net earnings since the purchasing of the property by applicant ave been approximately $6,000. There have been no dividends paid. These earnings of $6,000 and $775, which is evidenced by a note of indebtedness at the present time, have been used to rebuild and improve property. Applicant has made application to issue stock in amount of $3,825. This with the stock already issujed would make amount of $6,875 of outstanding stock. At the time the property purchased the depreciated value of the property and working ts was $5,990. As applicant has used earnings to the amount of approximately $6,000 in betterments of the property, this added to the £5,990 which was the depreciated value of the property at the time it urchased would be -sufficient to warrant the stock issue applied It the application to issue $3,825 additional stock is granted the amount of outstanding stock will be $6,875 which is undoubtedly he fair value of the property at the present time. There is no question but what applicant has actually put more iropertv than the amount of stock applied for. The ommission believes that the applicant should have an evidence of iis investment and as the actual value of the property at the present me is in excess of the total amount of stock issued, in case this tpplieation is granted, the Commission is of the opinion and so finds pplicant should be permitted to issue $3,825 additional stock, but that he note &gt;f $775 held by Mr. Xiemann against the company should be anceled in lieu of the issuance of this stock. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the application of the Palisade Telephone Company of Palisade to issue $3,825 of additional stock be granted, with the understanding that $775 from the proceeds of this stock is to be used in paying off and discharging a note for like amount. </seg>

Bonds have also been issued in the par amount of $40,000. Khas applied to this Commission for a permit to issue and sell it mortgage sis per cent bonds, due in 1938, in the par amount 0,000 to net the applicant not less than ninety-one per centum and 2,100 shares of its common stock in the face amount of )0, to We distributed pro rata over the common stock issued and CHAIRMAN RANDALL, PRESIDING. </seg>
            <seg id="p309">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 309 outstanding. The bonds are payable, at the rate of $10,000 annually tor the first five years and $12,500 annually thereafter, until the Bortgage is due. This matter cam(e on to be heard in the offices of th e &lt; ommission on March 1, 1928. The common stock and bonds above referred to were authorized by the ( 'ommission in the year 1924. The record made at that time &gt;hows the development of the property from a flour milling enterprise Ethe sale of electric energy as a by-product, down to the time of organization of the applicant corporation, and the segregation of electric property from other lines of business, which had been ated together by the owners. The original application shows that petitioner claimed value for its electric properties tangible and intangible, of approximately $164, - 000, as of September 13th, 1924. The Commission found that the company had physical property in the amount of $100,921, exclusive of the value of a water right, which had been included in applicant's figures at a value of $37,500, also certain property which would be displaced the additions and bettferments proposed under the application. Discussing the value of the water right, the Commission said: "The Commission has recognized that water-rights are things of value which can frequently be measured in dollars. Applicant's plant is excellently located and has natural power advantages, not usually found in Nebraska. It has been able to harness the water power at a less cost than could have been done if these natural advantages of location did not exist. The value of the water power would be to a considerable extent, dependent upon the use to whiclh it is put. Applicant is just beginning to develop a market justifying full use of the water power ad - vantages. It might be unfair to attempt to place a value on the water-rights at this time." I In this application petitioner has shown the value of its property ■ three methods. (a) Beginning with the value of the fixed property found by the Commission in 1924 and adding additions and betterments to date. This figure is subject to substantial correction, by reason of the cost nl the plant removed from service, when the additions were placed. The latter information is not available. ri) By an inventory and appraisal of the physical property in les&gt; depreciation with additions and betterments for the year (c) The balance sheet of the company which was taken from the books after they had been audited for the occasion shows the plant </seg>
            <seg id="p310">310 investment corrected to reflect the cost of the property in place and a depreciation reserve to correspond with its physical conditions. The Commission will use the inventory and appraisal to measure the value of the property under the mortgage, as compared with the results disclosed by the books. In the above figures the Commission has included $23,550 in cash on hand, after the proposed financing, which will be invested in plant in order to determine the cost or value of the property, which will be security for the mortgage. The above results are in remarkable agree - ment, considering the widely different lines of approach. The in - ventory and appraisal was based on a careful count and inspection of the property and the units applied were taken from actual costs, in so far as they could be obtained. Much of the property has been con - structed since 1924 and the new central station equipment was installed under contracts which were available, also material prices were at hand for the outside plant. Tlie Commission will use $282,000 as a measure of the fixed investment, exclusive of intangibles and the water right, to which the mortsa.ee will apply. This results in ;i ratio of titty - three per cent, or physical values of nearly twice the bonded indebted- Kplicant's balance sheet as of December 31, 1927. before the d financing, shows liabilities in the amount of $192,940.93 surplus. This includes the capital stock outstanding in the $60,000 and a depreciation reserve in the amount of $10,934.47, liabilities which include the bonds outstanding in the sum of 6.44, which the testimony shows has been expended for plant Appraisal Plant, less depreciation and goina concern, 1926 Additions and betterments, 1!'27 Cash for additions and betterments $196,066 64,375 Total $283,991 Balance Sheet Plant investment Additions, 1927, new Cash $213,741 64,375 23,550 Total ss depreciation reserve $301,666 19,934 $281,782 </seg>

Peti - will receive $136,500 from the sale of the bonds and the re - r of $24,500 will be expended for additions and betterments described in the testimony, which has been included above the cost in the fixed property. Giving effect to the new financing, applicant's liabilities will con - sist of the par amount of the stock authorized by the Commission, bonds in the sum of $150,000 par value and thte depreciation reserve in the sum of $19, 934.47, before surplus, in the sum of $262,213. This originates because of earnings reinvested, as no dividends have been paid. New capital was also invested in plant by the owners of the common stock, which came from other sources of business and the value of the water-right, which is being developed and included at $134,120. Petitioner has included working capital in the sum of approxim civ $40,000. When this is added to th.e cost of the physical pro perty, less depreciation and exclusive of going concern, we have the statement below: Physical plant, less depreciation and going concern $282,000 40.000 Working; capital Total $322,000 LThe following will show the securities outstanding as set forth e application: Common stock, outstanding Common stock, applied for Bonds $ OOyUUO 210,000 150,000 Total Bis clear that the par valtfe of the stock and bonds will exceed st of the physical property and working capital by approximately 00. This requires that the Commission find the value of the right in this amount, if the stock is authorized. The value of the water power was determined by capitalizing the net earnings of current produced with water, as compared with in - ternal combustion engines. This is not the only measure of value of water power and might lead the Commission far astray if all the factors are not considered, also much depends on the underlying as - sumptions used in the comparison and the current delivered at profit- In 1924, applicant supplied Cedar Rapids with electric energy </seg>

The above are amall towns. It has recently contracted to supply the city of Albion, which has increased the gross revenues by approximately $1,200 per month, or a total figure of $50,000 per annum. Gross earnings in 1924 were $17,663.31. Earnings for 1928 will be approximately three times this figure. Further development is planned for the future. How much of the current delivered on the mar - ket can be made with the hydro-electric plant we do not know. Applicant has estimated that it can produce 1,500,000 kilowatts with its hydro equipment, but whether this can be sold depends on the relation ot the water power capacity to the load. The water supply is fairly constant, but the opportunity for storage is extremely limited, while the demand for service fluctuates. All of the current which the Bant i&gt; capable of producing cannot be marketed under existii ig conditions. Neither can the maximum demand for servi lied without the use of stand-by generating equipment. No iratint" conditions for applicant's plant have not been fill Ejped due to its rapid growth. When the period and the characteristics of tl/e load on the genet ■ known, the value of the water right can be n mined. Nevertheless, the Commission will haw - in mind in reaching it&gt; conclusion as to the a applicant may issue I 'he common stock will not be sold to the pul e spread over the stock issued and outstanding and merely represents the stockholders equity the bonds.

In compliance with this application the Commission held, a hearinj at Maywood, Friday, May 18, 1!)28, at ten o'clock a. in. The testimon; in the hearing discloses the fact that the Maywood Carico Telephone Company of Maywood was organized over twenty years ago as i mutual company by fifty-six residents of that community, as stock holders paying into the company fifteen dollars for one share ol stock. It developed, however, that later each stockholder was assessed two dollnrs additional, bo that the actual investment of each stock- holder is seventeen dollars.

The Maywood Carieo Telephone Company also switches a farm line having thirty-eight subscribers, which does not have any interest in any of the property, but are switched by the Maywood Carico Company, and the company receives all of the pay for such switching.

During the years 1924, 1925, 1926 and 1927 the Maywood Carico Telephone Company has rebuilt its lines and made very extensive improvements, especially in the town of Maywood. It has installed a complete metallic circuit and the service it is giving is very satisfactory. The company has been charging subscribers owning their phones three dollars a year less than the man that does not own his phone and does not have any gross or net rates. The testimony also shows that a number of these privately owned phones are old and not very good. That there is a variety of makes and a good many of them. have been in use since the construction of the line over twenty years The company is desirous of rebuilding some of their lines in the utry and expect to put back into property the entire earnings over Eil above operating expenses until the lines are completely rebuilt. lere never has been any dividends declared. Every dollar that ha-i en received lor service has been used in the economical conducting 1 rebuilding of the lines. In order to have sufficient funds with icli to pay olf the ['resent indebtedness incurred by the rebuilding improvement program the company has asked for the increase tes as stated in its application. It is very evident from the rule tat the company has, that no stockholder can own more than one are of stock and that each shar&gt;e of stock only represents fifteen li the company is re -incorporated, as suggested by the man- iit, the articles of incorporation should provide that shares of shall be of greater amount and also that a stockholder would lie right to own more than one share, in order to carry on the vj. business of the company. It may have been sufficient at the he company was organized and the country was sparsely set - nd there was very little demand for the service, but with the settling up of the country and the increased population of the town, conditions have changed and the cost of donstruction and maintenance has greatly increased, so that the needs of the company art- much greater than when is was organized. And in order to take care of the tnei easing demands tin- service more capital is required. There is another practice that the company has been carryin n, since they have taken on other than their own members, which is iscrimination and that is the furnishing of service to a stoakholde t one price and a non-stockholder at another. There is no questio iut that the man furnishing his own instrument should have some onsideration, but that should be paid to him out of rates collecte&lt; niformly from all subscribers and be hasfd on the value of th nstrument.

            <seg id="p321">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 321 Testimony shows that the Naponee Home Telephone Company maintains a station at Naponee with 212 subscribers of its own company and do switching service for fifty-four farm line subscribers. That the subscribers all have, access to all towns in Franklin County, including direct connection with the county seat town of Franklin. That the fifty-four switched subscribers receive the same class of bervice that the 212 subscribers of the Naponee Home Telephone Company do, and the company pays all expenses of maintaining the station and furnishes the poles, cross arms, pins and insulators from the switchboard to a point south of the river, approximately three Testimony also shows that the actual expense of furnishing this ce to the switched subscribers is sixty cents per subscriber, with - iikiiiLr into consideration the service rendered the subscribers in Living- them connection to the 212 subscribers of the company and the additional service they receive to all towns in Franklin County, so if the application of the company to charge sixty cents per month switching the farm lines is allowed, these switched farm lines (1 only lie paying the out-of-pocktet cost to the Xaponee Home Illume Company for furnishing this service. The advantage to the Naponee Home Telephone Company in ing access to the fii'ty-four switched farm line stations is of no erial benefit to the company, but of course is some advantaire to subscribers of the company. However, as the switched subscribers the benefit of connection with all business houses, not only in aee bnt in all other towns in the county, as well as their county town (if Franklin, the switched lines are receiving as valuable ue ;is the subscribers of the Naponee Home Telephone Company receiving and at a very much less cost than the subscribers to Naponee Home Telephone Company are paying f or the same service. the Naponee Hume Telephone Company is at all times obligated tbe prepared to furnish the same class of service to the switched es thai they do to their subscribers, the Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that the application of the Naponee Home Telephone Company to charge sixty cents per month for switching is a reasonable charge and the company should be permitted to charge the switched lines sixty cents per month for rendering switching service at Naponee. The rate is slightly higher than the standard switching rate com - monly authorized by the Commission. This is accounted for by the facts above set forth, which are not ordinary, viz: applicant owns and maintains lines three miles into the country to meet lines of the switched companies.

This worked a gross discrimination and an injustice between the sub- E[t also developed at the hearing that that part of the application e company to collect rentals for a longer period than quarterly been detrimental to the company, as subscribers who paid six hs in advance were allowed two months in which to pay and sub - ers paying one year in advance were allowed four months in which ftke payment. Kie Commission is of the opinion that the six-months and annual nts should be eliminated, and all payments made on a \&gt;-jl - e month, or quarterly period. If, however, a subscriber des ■ six months or one year in advance, he could do su. bat under Ic governing the quarterly payment. The question of gross and net rate is of vital importance to the success of a telephone company. The amounts are small and the subscribers widely scattered. Telephone subscribers arc payii telephone service when they pay their monthly or quarterly payments and in order that the rate may not have to be made gTeater than it is for that service, rules must be made that will make the collecting of the charges automatic, or in other words, so that the company is nut to be put to the expense of making these collections. If subscribers were permitted to pay their telephone rental at such times as they saw fit and at their own convenience, in a great many instances telephone companies would not have money to pay their operating expenses and in some instances the rental would be a loss. The penalty for non-payment should be of sufficient magnitude to cause the subscribers to take due notice and make prompt payment in order to avoid the extra payment, which under the gross and net rule is required. Applicant has no choice in the enforcement of this rule. It is part of an order of the Railway Commission entered upon the request of the company and must be obeyed. It is not left for the president, secretary or directors to decide. That has already been decided and they have one duty to perform and that is to enforce it. </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 7195 In the Matter of the Application of the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs 8 Railway Company to Sell Three Tokens for Twenty Cei Riders of Street Cars on their Lines in the City of Omi OPINION AND FINDING RANDALL, Chairman On December 16. 1924, the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street rtailwaj Company made application for authority to increase passenger rates on its lines in the city of Omaha. Hearing was held the week of March 16, 1925, and drawing was made by the Omaha &amp; Council bluffs Street Railway Company. It was shown that the company was not making sufficient revenue to pay operating and overhead &lt;v:penses, ;es taxes, bond interest and up-keep of its properties and that it was necessary that the company be given permission to charge an increase of fares, in order to provide sufficient revenue to carry on the busi - ness of the company. KPter due deliberation and careful consideration ol all phases of nditions brought out in the hearing on the 10th day of June, the Commission issued an order providing a schedule of rates is as follows: 1. Adult cash fare, 10 cents 2. Adult token fare, 6 tokens for 40 cents 3. Children five years of age and not over t»dve years of age. </seg>
            <seg id="p327">KEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 327 (b) Token, 10 tokens for 35 cents. Children under five years of age carried free. his in the judgment of the Commission would produce sufficient unds to pay operating and overhead expenses, taxes, bond interest sufficient return on the value of the property as found by and ( ommission. Previous to this hearing the company had been selling four tokens twenty-five cents. It was found necessary to increase the price tt lie tokens slightly and the amount was raised to 6 2-3 cents, or tokens for forty cents. Considerable fault was found with the mission for not permitting the company to sell three tokens for t\ cents. However, the Commission's obligation was to keep the lure at the very lowest point for the sake of the riding public; provide a rate which gave the company the revenue to which ntitled under the law and the constitution. It was the Com- npinion that the authorization of three fares for twenty would defeat the very purpose of the order, in that the casual ansient rider would thereby be encouraged to buy tokens at the rather than pay the ten cent charge for the single ride. &gt; fter the order of June 10th was issued, application was made Commission by the city council and some of the improvement of Omaha to reopen the case and modify the original order. The Commission complied with the request to re-open the case, in so tar as the price and number of tokens to be sold was concerned, pro- vided, the applicant could show a better and more satisfactory mode of raising a sufficient amount of revenue to meet the requirements of the traction company. A further hearing- was held in the city hall at Omaha and was at - tended by the mayor and members of the city commission and a lar»e umber of citizens, but no one present could suggest any other mode f raising the desired amount of revenue. Some of the city eommis - ioners desired the Commission to change the order so that three tokens "or twenty cents could be sold. The Commission has always been ■illing to modify this order, as the traction company has now re - uested, but the company has never seen fit to make the request for this modification until this time. Tt was the belief of the Commission at le time the original order was entered, that the plan of selling three okens for twenty cents would reduce the earnings below the amount o which applicant was legally entitled. The Commission is of the pinion now that this plan will reduce earnings. However, a public tility on its own motion can voluntarily do that which this Commission annot under the law require. At the time of entering the order, the Commission advised Omaha citizens that, if the company so requested, would authorize the rule herein requested on the grounds above men - oned. Applicant did not at that time care to make the request, feel- </seg>
            <seg id="p328">328 ing as did the Commission, that such a plan would reduce earnings very materially. The Commission expresses the hope, that the results of this charge will not be disadvantageous and that earnings will not be impaired. Now on this 16th day of March, 1926, the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway Company, by its president, Mr. J. N. Shannahan, filed with the Commission, Application No. 7195, which reads as fol- After careful consideration we have reached the conclusion that if your Commission will approve the change, it would be wise for this company to sell street car tokens on its cars at. the rate of three (3) for twenty cents (20c) and we hereby make appli - cation to you to give us this permission by formal order, whieh will allow us to put this schedule of rates into effect at once. As this is an application that does not in any way affect the rate to the people of Omaha, we do not feel that it is necess - ary for a hearing before making your decision. In order that the people of Omaha may have the benefit of this change, we will ask that the order be written without further process."' After due consideration by all members of the Commission, tl of the opinion and so find, that th.- application of the Omaha A: i Bluffs Street Railway Company to sell three tokens for twenty should be granted.

COMMISSIONER MILLER, PRESIDING. OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: Hearing was held in the above entitled matter at Paxton July 11, at which time and place the Commission received evidence submitted by applicant in support of its application. The hearing; in this matter developed that the manager of the company proposed the increased rates to off-set possible losses and inconvenience in the matter of collections. During an adjournment, taken for the purpose of permitting a further check of the finances of the company, an ajrrement was reached between the officers of one of the farm line companies, which was the principal protestant in the case, and the manager of applicant company, which resulted in the voluntary withdrawal of this application and an application sub - mitted in lieu thereof, asking the Commission to authorize collection of rentals of switched subscribers three months in advance. At least part of the farm, line subscribers pay their rental six months in advance to their treasurer which would permit of a six months advance payment, if the plan could be worked out satisfac - torily with all farm line companies involved. The Commission will, therefore, enter an order denying the ap - plication herein and will at the same time authorize applicant &lt;;ompany to collect its rentals from rural switched subscribers three months in advance, any further advance payments to be collected only upon tup mutual agreement of the parties involved.

For the Commission — B. E. Forbes, chief engineer. OPINION AND FINDING CURTISS, Commissioner: This action arises upon application of the Kearney Telephone Com - pany for authority to make certain changes in its .schedule of exchange rates for service at its Kearney exchange. The application further recites the fact that the rates proposed are not to become effective until the company has placed itself in position to furnish automatic service at this exchange, in the furnishing of this service, applicant also contemplates the construction of a modern, fire-proof telephone building in the retail section of Kearney, of architecture in ki v. ith the spirit of the city, and the installation of new and modern automatic central office equipment. P Hearing upon the application was held in the Crystal Boi Fort Kearney Hotel at Kearney, on Thursday, April 2b', 19' The Commission is confronted with two questions in reviewing the matter. First, the question arises as to whether automatic service is too expensive a service for an exchange the size of the Kearney exchange. At the present time there are but two cities in Nebraska, viz: Omaha and Lincoln, receiving automatic service. It is regarded as a more efficient, speedier, higher-type service and because of greater investment in equipment, and increased maintenance and depreciation charges, requires a higher rate schedule. The answer to the ques - tion ot whether automatic service should be provided in Kearney is probably found in the attitude of the subscribers who pay the charges, and the utility which makes the necessary investment. In the instant case, both the subscribers and the utility are in agreement as to its advisability. Exhibit C, among other things, carries endorsements and approval of the proposed service, signed by the mayor of Kear - ney, the chairman of the industrial committee, the executive commit - tee and the traffic committee to the Kearney Chamber of Commerce. It also sets forth the names of what is alleged to be approximately eighty per cent of all of the subscribers on the Kearney exchange. Testimony is to the effect that each of these subscribers was per - sonally solicited, was carefully advised as to the service which was contemplated and the rate schedule which applicant felt would be necessary if the service were to be furnished. As further evidence </seg>
            <seg id="p333">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 333 i H&gt;] V r k i i tlie fact that the subscribers of the Kearney exchange heartily jrove of the proposal, it might be said that not a single subscriber exchange service was present at the hearing to voice disapproval. illace G.

It allegros the book value of plant and equipment as of Deeembe 31, 1927, plus the estimated cost of net additions and betterments isary to make the exchange automatic, to be $354,530.52. Cross examination developed the fact that this figure was the result of a appraisal of the properties made by the engineering department o tin- Commission in 1916, which appraisal figure was placed on th company's books at that time and additions and betterments - nuent thereto, added.

The territor rsed in east Lincoln was very sparsely settled, so that th pal patronage it received was from Bethany and University Place le territory between those two towns did not give as much patron s would have been offered had the road traversed a more thickly ated part of the city. In 1926 the company thought it could increase its earnings by ea tablishing a bus route between University Place and Lincoln, coverin a part of the city not traversed by its line of road, but nearly parallel ing the same. This experiment proved to be very unprofitable as i v.aa taking business from street cars, and was still running the cars a well as the busses, making a double expense, which proved the oh adage, "That you cannot rob yourself and set rich at it".

L. &amp; B. Company and both companies discontinue bus service to University Place am Bethany, excepting the Lincoln Traction Company would continue the bus service over east "O" Street to Henry Street in Bethany. Owing to the increased number of automobiles business fell off such an extent that the losses continued to pile up so that the deficit or 1927 amounted to $13,744.32. This had to be taken care of by the wners advancing cash and taking notes from the company. Bus- iness has continued to fall off and the deficit has increased to such an extent tli.it the owners of the road refuse to contribute further to- ards the losses, which makes it neessary that the owners make appli - iition to discontinue operation. I net that the city of Lincoln has recently ordered the com - pave between its tracks on Y Street from 18th to 21st, and i expenditure of something like $7,000 would be required to comply rli this order, had brought about the action of the company in ask- the Commission for the right to discontinue service at this time. The O. L. &amp; B. Railway Company does a freight switching business een the Missouri Pacific switch and the town of Bethany at the regular switching rate. As the switching of this freight from the Missouri Pacific to tin- 0. L. &amp; B. Railway Company and by them to industries Bethany, it becomes an interstate movement and is under the risdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission and pot under the .jurisdiction of the Nebraska State Railway Commission. Since the street railway is not now paying even operating expenses, it appears tthe Commission that the abandonment of certain of the track, d discontinuance of passenger service will not tend to prejudice later hearing which involves service to these industries. The testimony and exhibits show that car load freight delivered by the Missouri Pacific to the O. L. &amp; B. Railway Company shows that Ilit'J."} there were 544 cars handled: in 1926 -- 547 cars, but in 1927 ly '250, which shows a falling off of over fifty per cent in that siness. Package freight shows a gradual falling off from 1923 of 1,142.52 to 1927 of only $328.76. Mail revenue shows in 1923 an mount of +1,447.93, while in 1927 the company had lost this entire revenue. The testimony also shows that it was receiving $1.46 per car hour in revenue for January 1928, and the operating expense was -rl^ 1^: in February — $1.44 revenue and $1.83 operating cost, and in March, it was receiving $1.49 and the operating cost was $1.90 per hour.

If the Commission would attempt to fix a rate that would pay the operating expenses, without any return on the investment, the rate would be so high tli.it it would be pro libitive, so that alternative cannot be considered by the Commission. In order that the citizens living tributary to this line, who ha\ &gt;een receiving service in the past, will not be inconvenienced, th 'ommission has taken the matter up with the Lincoln Traction Com &gt;any and have obtained an agreement from them that will praeticall ?:ive the citizens that have been receiving service from the 0.

The Commission's approval of I rural rate of $1.&lt;5 per month and a net rate of $1.50 is also UTO asked, although at present the company serves no rural subscribers over its own lines. An agreement has been reached, however, with certain farmers whereby applicant has agreed to build a telephone line to its farms in consideration of the payment of the above rate for the first year, in advance. Applicant proposes to discontinue two party business and combination business and residence service since no demand exists for same. In so far as net rates are concerned it is observed that the business subscribers are the onlv ones which would be affected by the proposed revision of rates except the pro- spective farm subscribers above referred to. No protests against this application were made to the Commission. </seg>
            <seg id="p348">348 TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT This applicant company is not of sufficient size to warrant the keeping of a complete double entry record of its accounts and expend - itures, and in lieu of a complete financial statement, submitted the following list of monthly operating expenses: Operators' wages (two) * 05.00 Lineman's salary 100.00 Insurance (2 buildings) 10.00 Light, heat, postage, printing 25.00 Automobile expense 40.00 Taxes 5.00 $245.00 Ipon this basis the annual expense would be $2,904.00 exclusive of depreciation on the plant and a return on an actual cash invest - ment of $5,000. Depreciation on the plant was not estimated by ap - plicant and a return of .six per cent on $5,000, or $300 per annum, was requested. I An investigation of the company's operating conditions disclose at the physical property which it is obliged to maintain is confined the property within the village limits of Elsie and Madrid and a trunk line between the two villages over which free service is fur mshed. Applicant employs at this time two operators. One operato serves subscribers at Paxton and the other the subscribers at Elsie These operators receive $35 and $30 per month respectively. Unre stncted 24-hour service is furnished to the subscribers. t Having in mind the above operating conditions, the Commissi of the opinion that the lineman's salary in amount $1.00 per mon greatly in excess of a reasonable wage for actual time si.ent i intenance work. Applicant also has called to the Commission's attention the fact that two operators are on duty practically 24 hours each day for a total wage of $65 per month, which economy is effected only by reason of the owners' family caring for the switchboard. Commission is of the opinion that a reasonable- estimate of licant's annual requirements is as follows: Maintenance and depreciation Operators' wages Light, heat, postage, printing, etc. A-Uto expense (included in maintenance and depreciation) Insurance (2 buildings) Faxes $ 600 780 300 120 60 </seg>
            <seg id="p349">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION' 349 Applicant's testimony as to revenue received under its present rate structure is contradictory. The manager quoted an average monthly revenue, exclusive of toll, from the company's records of $127.75, whereas present rates charged, when applied to present subscribers served, show a revenue of $141. Upon the basis of the latter figure the annual exchange revenue is $1,728. The record si,u»&lt; that the annual net toll revenue is approximately $90 per year, brin?insr the total annual revenue to $1,818. Upon this basis a defi - ciency is apparent to the extent of *42 per annum. Applicant asks a return of six per cent upon $5,000. The Com - n is of the opinion that $5,000 is a conservative value and that Ki per cent is also conservative as a rate of return and, in fact, less an that usually approved by the Commission. Including the six per return upon $5,000 a deficiency is found of $342. The proposed increase in revenue would yield additional annual revenue on the basis of the net rate amounting to ninety dollars per an num. since only thirty business subscribers would be affected, and v. ill leave the revenue still short of annual requirements. Application has been made for authority to cancel the present authorized rate for 2-party business service and combination bus- and residence service which rates are now one dollar and three s per month, respectively. It is apparent that the rate should anoelled or amended to conform to the proposed rate e revision. Applicant testified that there is no demand for the service and at present no such service is furnished. The Commission will &gt;ve ut' the cancellation of these rates at this time. Should there r be a demand for this service in the future, applicant shall be required to make application for a rate for such service. This application proposes a jrross and net rate rule to apply except o switched subscribers, which would provide for twenty-five cents iscount if payment is made monthly in advance before the tenth of le current month billed. This proposed rule is not intended to produce evenue but to insure prompt payment of accounts. The Commission las always held to the theory that such policy is sound and has a endeney to eliminate losses arisimr from collections which must be made up by other subscribers.

COMMISSIONER MILLER, PRESIDING. OPINION AND ORDER BY THE COMMISSION: Petitioner herein has applied to this Commission for its approval of a new schedule of rates for telephone service at Madison. The matter came on to be heard by the Commission at the City Hall in Madison. September 20, 1928. The Madison Telephone Company began operation with a small plant purchased from the Nebraska Telephone Company for $500 in 1904. It was organized with a paid up capital stock of $6,000 and the remainder after the purchase price was paid, was used for improving and extending the system. In 1921 applicant applied to the Commis - sion and secured authority to increase the fixed capital liability to (30,750. An inventory and appraisal was made of the company's property in 1924 and cost units were applied, intended to reflect the K vestment as of the time of construction. The books of the company ?re set up on the Commission's findings. Then the company began a program of expansion. It acquired bstantia] amount of farm lines which had received switching ;c at Madison. A new telephone building' was constructed, and »! reconstruction of the outside plant was begun, in order to provide equate service tor the entire community. Petitioner now has ap- ximately 1,075 service connections in the Madison exchange. In •ii* years the company has also acquired the telephone property Tilden, Neligh, Orchard, Royal and Brunswick. These exchanges te not involved in this application, only ui connection with the alloca - in of the genera] expenses of the company which are incurred in the ineipal offices at Madison. The present and proposed rates for the Madison exchange are set out below. !!u&gt;iii&lt;'ss, one party Business, extension fesidence, one party esidene&lt; , extension Present Rate $2.25 .45 1.35 .45 Propose Rate $3.50 I r arm-metallic business Farm -met al lie-, residence Farm, grounded 1.35 1.35 1.33 i Kxtra over above rates for cradle type telephone .50 .25 </seg>
            <seg id="p356">356 TWENTY-FIKST ANNUAL REPORT The book cost of the property devoted to the public use, as found bj the Commission, plus net additions and betterments as of January 1, 1928, is $88,341.41, working capital, material and supplies amount to $4,881.26 additional, or a total book cost of $93,222. 07, which ap - plicant represented is less than the fair value of the property as of the time of the hearing. Working capital as stated above, is an estimated figure based on averages taken from the experience of the company over approximately a year of operation, as follows: Materials and supplies $2,692.09 1,114.17 1.075.00 Due from subscribers and agents Cash Petitioner presented an appraisal of the physical plant whic shows the cost of reproduction new as of December, 1927, in the sum of £139,337.19 and the same less depreciation in the sum of $103,379. 33. This appraisal was based on present prices of materials an&lt; labor and includes $4,000 for working capital, estimated on the basi of four dollors per telephone in service. The physical condition wa (determined by inspection and does no( include any measure of acerue&lt; depreciation not disclosed by the appearance of the property. In herent disintegration or deterioration which may affect the life anc reduice the wearing value of the various classes of plant were no teasured in the method used. Likewise, obsolescence and inadequac ere disregarded. These are substantial factors "i depreciation ar should be considered. An appraisal submitted by the Commission shows, a reproduction cost new in the sum of $120,283.3 an less depreciation, in the amount of $87, 825. 37. Working capital is no included in these figures, and if this is taken at $4,000 for purposes ol rp Irison, we have a reproduction new of $124,283.12 and a depre - value of $91,825.37. It is apparent that the state's appraisal ade on a some what lower price level than that of the applicant, e two appraisals are substantially the same as to the average ion percent, which was found to be 74 by the company and 73 state. I We have a book value of $93,222.67 comparable with the cost new lown by the company's appraisal of $139,337.19 and the Commis - s engineering department figure of $124,283.12. The book value ivestment is less than the cost new as found by appraisal. This i it should be. Much of the property was constructed before the •d of high prices which resulted from the war and still continues »ugh with a downward tendency. The present price of telephone ■rials, equipment and labor necessary to their placement is ap - imately fifty per cent of the pre-wnr plane. This application is made on the investment basis and not on ap - prasial values, although they appear to sustain investment figure when </seg>
            <seg id="p357">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 357 consideration is given to the difference in price levels. The depre - ciation is important as it reflects the condition of the property and points to the depreciation reserve requirements for future operation. Petitioner's operating revenues and expenses under the old rates for the year 1927 and those estimated under the proposed schedule are set out below: The total cost of maintenance and depreciation in the above state - under the proposed rates, shows an increase of approximately •1-J.000 over the actual experience for 1927. We note that repairs have been reduced in the amount of approximately $700 and the set up for accrued depreciation has been increased approximately $1,500. This constitutes a substantial part of the requirement for increased r; Applicant has been setting up approximately nine per cent com puted on the cost of depreciable property for maintenance and de - preciation. The proposed amount appears to be ten per cent compute! in the same way. The Commission's information covering a wide fiel&lt; of investigation has disclosed that from ten to twelve per cent is necessary for this purpose, depending on the character and location o tne property under investigation. The testimony shows that the com pany's depreciation reserve has declined in the last few years. It i ow $23,000 for the Madison exchange and the per cent condition founc »&gt;• the engineers indicates that it should be near $30,000. The rates hould provide for a depreciation reserve sufficient to pay the cost f plant retired from service, not only because of failure from physical auses but should include inadequacy and obsolescence in order that he property may be kept efficient and modern as required for public se. This fund is not availahle for distribution as dividends. Petitioner pays the Continental Telephone Company, which owns the common stock of the Madison Telephone Company, the sum of $1,440.00 annually for general supervision. This includes engineering, financing and the duties that would fall to the officers of the corpora - tion. The testimony shows Detitioner has borrowed money from the parent company, for which it pays seven per cent interest.

            <seg id="p358">358 TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT these funds could be obtained from other sources at the same expens Moreover, the money borrowed was not for the benefit of the Madiso exchange as it was used to purchase telephone properties in that loca ity. Nevertheless, the holding company does provide a service tha has been rendered by the former officials of the company, which ha cost the applicant as much, or more, than this amount. Engineerin services have also been supplied which will be used in the reconstructio of the outside plant. On the proposed schedule of rates applicant shows that it will have net earnings after all expenses of $5,774.09. This means that applicant will be permitted to earn seven per cent on $82,500. The net earning is found after takinir $1,172.25 for loss in revenue, due to subscribers' stations removed on account of the anticipated raise in rates. Exper - ience has established the fact that such losses occur but they are re - covered to a large extent after a few years of operation. If this figure is reduced to $600 or approximately one-half "1 applicant's estimate, the net earnings would point to seven per cent on $91,000.00, which is in substantial agreement with the investment figure. E.e Commission believes and so finds that the schedule of rates for is reasonably required to pay a fair return on the investnu company as set forth in the application.

RANDALL, Chairman: The Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company on May </seg>

The company ■ers that passenger and express business had decreased from year year, to sucu an extent that it is not warranted in maintaining the present steam passenger train service and that the business can be adequately handled by one of the late gasoline electric motor cars with a trailer at certain seasons, to handle the business when it can not be handled by the car. On May 18, three days after the application had been filed the ommission sent notice to all the towns affected, including both .incoln and Columbus, advising them of the contents of the applica - lon and the purpose for which such application was made and re - uesting that if there was any objection to this substitution of service, lat they notify the Commission within ten days. That time having xpired and no objection having been made by any of the towns af - eeted, the Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that the Chicago, '•urlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company should be permitted to install a gasoline electric motor, of the style and type on file with the Com - mission, in the interest of substantial economy, and without inconven - ience to the public. As this order has been granted without a public hearing, this order will be granted for a period of ninety days, subject to the written omplaint of the public from the towns affected. In case written oru plaint is filed, hearing will be held and this order either modified, eseinded or continued, according to the testimony and facts that are ronght out at the hearing. &lt; &lt; Lin ease there is no written complaint, this order may be continued efinitely.

Edholm is a village located about four miles south of Schuyler &gt;n the Schuyler-Ashland branch of the C. B. &amp; Q. Railroad. The • usiness of the town consists of an elevator, a store and a filling tation. It has a population of between twenty and twenty-five people t is quite a shipping point for car load commodities, lint the less han carload freight business is very limited.

A correction was made and the application amended at the time of the hearing, which had the effect of reducing the amount of bonds applied for from $363,700 to 356,700 par value. The differ - ence between the face value of $356,700 and $335,283.28 is accounted for by the discount on bonds to be sold. The company's statements of additions and betterments from May 1, 1927, to April 30, 1928, is based on the net addition to plant after the cost of property removed from service, by reason of their construction, has been deducted.

The Company has the same class of service between Fremont and Hastings, a distance of 127 miles and the total passenger revenue was $7,492.30. The distance between Arlington, Kennard and Blair is eighteen miles, and the passenger evenue at Blair and Kennard amounted to $2,619.12. This would idieate that there was a very much larger passenger business between Fremont, Kennard, Blair and Missouri Valley, than on either the Super - ior or Hastings lines, being operated with the same class of service and the same price per mile of service. While the Commission has not ci-ii time to figure out accurately and make a comparison of the express and cream revenue, there probably would not be very much lifference in the revenue income per mile. If, however, the difference correspondingly as great in these two items, as it is in the enger business, it would show a much greater earning per mile he motor from Arlington to Kennard, Blair and Missouri Valley an on either the Hastings or Superior lines.

Train Service between McCook and Imperial. OPINION AND FINDING "The Chicago, Burlington &amp; Qtriney Railroad Company here - by makes application to the Nebraska State Railway Commission to substitute a gasoline motor car for steam train passenger ser - vice between McCook and Imperial, for the reason that passenger service has fallen off materially and to such an extent that the passenger train service is being furnished at an out-of-pocket cost to the applicant company. "Applicant further states that overhead expense of running a gas motor car would not he to exceed one-half of the expense of the operating of the present steam train, and will give ample and adequate service for passengers, mail and express. "Applicant agrees to furnish a l&gt;5-foot all steel Edwards Gas Motor Car. The car will be divided as follows: 43 feet for baggage, mail and express; 22 feet for passenger space. The car will be furnished with comfortable seats, with smoking compartment and two toilets, as per plans and specifications attached to this application. Applicant will appreciate authority to make this change for a trial period of ninety clays from the date of the order. L. B. Lyman, general superintendent." During the fall of 1926, owing to the falling off in passenger busi - ness, the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company discontinued running a team train and substituted a gas motor on its branch be - tween McCook and Imperial. This car was short, with inadequate seating, mail and express capacity. The upholstering on the seats was such that they were very uncomfortable and a large number of [hem had straight backs and the car was only provided with one :oilet, which was not in accordance with law. Also, the car was so constructed that the fumes from the exhaust pipe permeated the car and caused the passengers to have headaches from the fumes of the monoxide gas. This car was substituted without permission from the Railway Commission. Formal complaint was made and hearing was held at McCook on the fourteenth day of December, 1926. A large amount of testimony was taken and a personal inspection of the car was made RANDALL, Chairman: </seg>
            <seg id="p394">394 TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT by the Commission. The company was required to discontinue the use of that particular car and restore steam train service. During the hearing it developed that the citizens along the line of road afferted were not adverse to motor car service on the line, pro - viding the car was of sufficient capacity to handle the business and was comfortably upholstered and was provided with the necessary smoking compartments and toilets. The company now makes application to substitute a 65-foot all fteel Edwards gasoline motor car, divided with twenty-two feet for passenger space ; forty-three . feet for baggage, mail and express. This ear is provided with well-upholstered seats, a smoking compart - ment and two toilets and is one of . the company's standard motor oars in service on its branch lines in other localities. The cost of operating a steam train for one year is $19,581.72 while the cost of operating a motor car over the same line for a year is $10,735.92, which would make a saving to the company of $8,782.80, if it was permitted to substitute gas motor for steam train service on the Imperial branch. During the year, 1927, the following passenger revenue was re ceived by the company on the Imperial line: Meeker Beverly Palisade Hamlet Wauneta Zell Enders Imperial Total The cost of running the steam train is $19,518.72 and the total passenger receipts were $9,368.96, showing a loss to the company of $10,149.76 over passenger earnings in maintaining the steam train. If the application of the company to substitute motor for steam trai service is allowed, considering that the passenger revenue of 1(127 wi continue, with the cost of operating the motor as fixed by the eompan at $10,735.92, the loss to the company would be reduced to $1,366.9 which would be taken care of from mail, express and cream, and mak a net saving to the company of $8,782.80. As the car proposed to b substituted by the company is one of its standard motor oars, coin fortable in every respect and will, in the opinion of the Commission give adequate passenger, mail and express service, and as the substitu tion of this service will bring about a saving of $8,782.80 per year, the Commission is of the opinion that the company should be permitted to </seg>

The National Electric Light Association rules of accounting provide that the cost of a unit of property displaced is a proper charge to the depreciation reserve. This raises the question of what constitutes the unit of plant as intended in the rule. The credit to the depreciation reserve as required by the Commission is intended to provide for accrued depreciation as distinguished from maintenance and the line between the two is open to differences of opinion.

OPINION AND FINDING r.v nil-: commission his applicant, the Scotia Independent Telephone Company, on 31, 1928, filed its application with the Commission seeking bority to issue a stock dividend in the sum of $4,110, being 100% it- present paid-up capital. Subsequently on August 8, 19:28, an- ther application was filed by this company asking the Commission's uthority to increase its exchange rates. The Commission held a hearing on the above entitled matters Scotia, on September 25. 1928. Notice was properly given to all erested parties. Xo protesiants appeared at the hearing, to either applications. This applicant company was organized during the year 1907, th an authorized eapital stock of $10,000 divided into one thousand shares at ten dollars per share. Four hundred and eleven shares were during the organization of the company, which capitalization has mained unchanged to date. The company was organized as a stock impany ami according to the testimony offered by the manager, a \&lt;rv small amount, if any contributions were made to its construction by stockholders or subscribers. The territory served by the company id confined to the village of Scotia and the rural territory tributary thereto.

It is further pointed out that the exchange plant has not been maintained to the high degree of efficiency that future plans contem- late and for that reason the additional expense is added. Upon this :i &gt;i^ ~2.771 would be set aside annually for maintenance and depreci- tiou. The portion of the manager's salary, in amount $1,500, which ias been '-harmed to maintenance and plant work, is $1,200 per annum, :i(in per month being charged for clerical expense. The Commission observes that the average maintenance and replacement expenditures i disclosed by applicant's annual reports to the Commission for the past eight years is approximately $2,100. I nder these circumstances, the Commission believes that a sum of t2,771 per annum, as has been indicated as necessary by applicant, s somewhat excessive, even though more money might be spent on the plant in the future. Upon examination at the time of the hearing,. he manager of the company admitted that the previous estimate might mj too high.

This item is slightly below the average experience of the company during the past eight years. The other items of expense in the statement appear to be reason - able and constitute such expenses as are regularly required in the operation of a telephone company the size of applicant company. In the deductions, from income, the credit entry indicated in the amount ol $27.28 is the result of a bookkeeping correction. This item should be corrected for the purposes of the statement and the average mi- - eellaneous charges to income for the past several years inserted in lieu thereof. The Commission finds the annual average of the aeeount during the past eight years to be $58. ■laving in mind the above circumstances, the Commission for the ses of this application finds the following to represent the rea - le requirements of applicant company Kie total operating revenues of the company lor the yea und to represent approximately the average annual re' company for the past several years, and for the purpo atement may be considered as reasonable. Upon tliis ba vailablc for interest and dividends the sum of $569.31. P*ent that this amount is insufficient to pay a fail air value of applicant's property. Applicant's investment account, in amount $24,002.48 directly from a correction entry placed on applicant's books under the direction of the Commission's accounting department, to bring the accounts in agreement with a physical valuation made by the Com - mission's engineering department in July, 1925. The Commission's engineer, at the time of taking the inventory showed the physical condition of the property to be 74%. Since entering the valuation figures on its books, applicant has added to its property approximately $1,200. The depreciation reserve figure, in amount $4,613.80. is probably incorrect, due to debit entries made to the account in 1027 and 1926, totaling $1,657. This debit entry was, no doubt, due to the fact that the maintenance and depreciation allowance used by appli - cant was inadequate. Using as a basis for a calculation, the Commission's valuation ii: 1925, we find an estimated net original cost of approximately Maintenance and depreciation )perators" wages ?otal cominereiaJ expenses (as detailed in applicant's expense statement) 'axes accrued Miscellaneous charges &gt;2,4t)0.00 810.72 164.05 58.00 Total expense $4,432.77 </seg>
            <seg id="p407">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 407 « EThe increase in rates proposed by applicant will yield $837 nun additional revenues, which, if applied to our foregoing e of profits, under present operating conditions in amount . we find a total of $1,406.31 of annual profits available for idends and interest. This estimated profit is approximately ~'-- : c 'c ■on the net original cost of the property as found above in amount 8.802. In explaining the reason for both grounded and metallic farm rvice it was pointed out by the manager of the company that at jne time it was planned to make all farm lines metallic, which policy ■vas never carried out. This plan has been abandoned as too ex- ensive, therefore no rates for metallic farm service is requested. nder these circumstances, the Commission finds the application &gt;r increased rates reasonable and the same will be approved to be - orae effective January 1, 1929, as requested by applicant. The resent plan of collecting quarterly from city subscribers is not the Hial practice and is contrary to the rule on file with the Commission. he Commission will provide that city rentals shall be paid monthly advance, the discount to be allowed if paid on or before the tenth &lt;t the current month billed. This ruling would not prohibit quarterly ■avments. it subscribers so desire. n support of its application for stock dividends of 100%, ap cant contends that the dividend which it proposes to issue is earned [3 shown by its books, and that the surplus is invested in property. pon examination of applicant's annual reports to the Commission &gt;r the past five years, we find profits according to applicant's books in amount $i, 046. 59. We further find that during the same period, depreciation reserve account has been debited in the sum of $3,173.94, being the amount which applicant expended for maintenance and re - placements in excess of the amounts allowed for both maintenance and depreciation. On account of this depreciation entry, it is apparent that profits should be correspondingly amended. Prior to L920, the Commission does not have accurate data from which it can determine the actual earnings of the company. The record of applicant clearly indicates that the original capital stock, namely, $4,110, par value, at present outstanding, was issued for the purpose of purchasing and expanding applicant's plant in the year 1907. We find that since 1907 applicant has added fifty-four sub - scribers stations, and has also replaced considerable of its plant. The Commission has in mind that considerable of the plant renewed and expanded was built at considerably higher price levels than exper - ienced in 1!M)7. Kxamination of applicant's reports disclosed that only seven dividends were paid during the company's existence. Two six per cent dividends were issued in the years 1922 and 1923.

L. B. Lyman, General Superintendent.'' This application of the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Company to change the of passenger service on its line between Beatrice and Holdrege cia las been made by the company owing to the fact that the passenger msiness between these points, and at intermediate points, has fallen f during the last two years and is continuing to fall off rapidly, wing to the improved highways, the extensive use of the busses and nrivately owned automobiles. During the year 1025, passenger busi - »ss at intermediate stations between Beatrice and Holdrege amounted o $18,682.87. This revenue did not pay one-half of the actual ex - &gt;ense of operating the train and the mail and express business did &gt;t amount to enough to make up the loss, so there was a large deficit the revenue produced bv the train over the overhead expense of f o f 't </seg>
            <seg id="p410">410 TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT The revenue received by the company in 1927 at these intermediat stations amounted to $11,659.74. This shows a falling off in th passenger revenue between the year 1925 and 1927 of $7,023.13. Th passenger revenue shows that the company was meeting with a los of over 75 per cent in operating this steam train. As the expense o operating the steam train, as shown by the application is $48,263.6 - per year and the expense of operating the gasoline electric moto over the same line, would amount to $27,131.40 per year, makinsr saving to the company of $21,132.24. It is true that the passenger revenue received by the company on this line, if the volume would continue equal to the 1927 business, would lack $15,472.27 of paying the expense of operating the gasoline electric motor. While with the same amount of revenue the loss to the company in operating the steam train would amount to $36,604.51 per year, and if it is pennitti'd to substitute the nas electric motor, as prayed for, this loss would be reduced to $15,472.27, which would be practically met by the revenue from the carrying of the mail, cream and express and there would undoubtedly be sufficient revenue from these three sourc ■i this deficiency so that the company could operate this gasol c motor without much, if any, of a deficit in the revenue to ny between Beatrice and Holdrege. Bhe car that the company proposes to furnish on this line is oi test up-to-date gasoline electric motors and has power fin it if the business on the line requires it, could haul a trailer indling of express, cream, baggage, etc. There is no ques t» Rhat this car can handle the volume of business offered the com between these points. It is comfortably upholstered and seatc neets all of the requirements in that it is provided with th &lt;ary toilets, smoking compartment, drinking fountains, etc. The Commission has made a personal inspection of this motor am is satisfied that it will give the people along this line of road comfort able and adequate service. The question of overhead expense to th revenue received, in the passenger business on the railroads in Ne braska, is a serious one and the Commission is using every mean in their power to bring about economies so that the loss in this clas of business will not have to be made up by the freight paying public by the increasing of rates on all classes of freight. A useless am uneconomic loss should not be permitted where it can be obviated and the pnblic can be given adequate service and the Commission is of the opinion and so finds, that the application of the C. R. &amp; Q. R. R. Company to substitute a gasoline electric motor for steam passenger train service between Beatrice and Holdrege, for a trial period of ninety days, be approved.

OPINION AND ORDER RANDALL, Chairman This application is made by the Chicago &amp; North Western Rail - way Company which seeks relief in the matter of expense in connection with the operating of its passenger trains Nos. 509 and 510 between Omaha and Oakdale, via Newman Grove and Albion. At the present time train No. 509 leaves Omaha at 12:20 p.m. arriving in Oakdale at 7:35 p.m. No 510 leaves Oakdale at 6:05 a.m. ami arrives at Omaha at 1:30 p.m. Due to the gradual increase in busses and privately owned auto - &gt;biles, passenger travel on these trains has decreased to the point tut the operation is not justified between Scribner and Omaha, in lieh territory there are three main line passenger trains operating each direction daily. A tabulation of passengers on and off of these trains for the month of July, 1928, show that the lines are patronized very- little throughout the entire mileage of the runs between Omaha and Scribner, :.. such an extent that there can lie no justification for the operation oj Nos. 509 and 510 between Omaha and Seribner. For the month of July, 1928, the cost of operating these trains was $40.33. Passenger earnings for these trains for the same period $2,358.18. These costs do not include such items as maintenance roadway and equipment, cost of transportation of fuel, engine expense, water, taxes or return on investment. The officers of the railroad company have made a epreful canvass t' the various tc.wns from Oakdale to Scribner and it was found after hese conferences, that the citizens principal desire was that the rain he run so as to give good mail and express service. At the ■ resent time the mail from the east is carried from Omaha to Oakdale n Xo. 13. This mail is discharged from, that train at Oakdale and is •arried down the branch on No. 510 so that the mail arrives at all tat ions between Oakdale and Scribner in time to be distributed and carried out on the rural routes. The railroad company proposes to make a close connection at Scribner so that No. 509 will leave Scribner upon the arrival of No. 11 and return from Seribner to Oakdale. leaving Scribner at 11:20 a.m. </seg>

The realestate consists of lots and a modern brick bus terminal bctilding in Fremont, also real estate and a modern garage building iu Omaha. The furniture and fixtures consist of general office equip - ment and the fixtures required at the terminals necessary in connec - tion with traffic. Stores and supplies are made up of gasoline, engine oil, repair parts, etc., ordinarily used in operation. Miscull - aneous road equipment consists of official automobiles, emergency rs and other equipment used in clearing the highway in ease ■ stum Phe passenger busses were depreciated on the basis of three cents Lie of actual travel by each vehicle. This method assumed that Unary maintenance had been provided for and is therefore a measure (accrued depreciation only. The testimony shows that the equipment in good operating condition. The three cents a mile is necessarily aii proximate measure. Motor bus transportation for interurban service is new and the average life of the cars has not been determined, neither in terms of years or miles. Moreover, little data has been collected at this time which might provide a basis for an analysis. Bus companies in eastern slates have used three cents per mile for depreciation, but the con - ditions are known to be different in the different states depending on ■the topography of the country and the volume of traffic and the character of the roadway. This also applies to routes in the same state. Tlie type of l&gt;us is also a factor, and changes in design and manner of construction have been made frequently in the last few year-, to provide for more dependable operation and satisfy service requirements. This has caused greater depreciation than may be expected in the near future, as the models are becoming standardized Cost of busses less depreciation $53,893.49 Miscellaneous supplies, repairs, meehinery, etc.. 16,300.00 Total $70,193.48 LIABILITIES Xotes and accounts $17,415.34 Net valuation $52,778.15 tVhen combined the above figures show the following results.

            <seg id="p424">424 TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT So far as experience is available at this time, it indicates that the life of the standard motor bus is approximately 400,000 miles. It costs from $10,000 to $12,000. The record shows that busses are still in service which have as many as 600,000 miles and are still useable and the further fact, that for many reasons a car may be re - tired with much less mileage. Actual inspection of the condition of the busses at the time this rate was applied, pointed to the conclusion that three cents per mile is too high, rather than too low, but in the absence of more definite information, the results derived from its ap - plication will be accepted for present purposes. The road equipment and other items of property were depreciated on the inspection basis, or the market value was taken, whichever appeared to be the less.

            <seg id="p428">TWENTY-FIRST ANNTJAL REPORT 428 OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION Applicant herein is a public service corporation engaged in the generation, transmission and sale of electric energy to the public. It has applied to this Commission for a permit to construct, operate and maintain a new transmission line near Rosalie, in Thurston county. Applicant was unable to secure a written agreement with the one party at interest and hearing was held in the office of the Commission, October 3, 1928, at ten o'clock a. m. The record shows that applicant proposes to construct a new transmission line beginning at the southeast corner of section fifteen, township twenty-four, north, range eight, east, in Thurston county, and extending west approximately one and one-half miles, on the north side of the highway to a point near the center line of section sixteen. The line will connect with a 6,600 volt, three-phase trans - mission line, at the point referred to and be operated as a single phase, sixty cycle, alternating current line, having a potential of the same The new power line will parallel one grounded telephone circuit for a distance of three and one-half miles, two of which are now in parallel with the three-phase line. In other words, the new construc - tion will add one and one-half miles of single phase parallel to this circuit. Two more grounded telephone circuits are also involved for &amp; distance of one-half mile to one mile. The latter parallels are not considered important as a source of inductive interference. Objection ■was made to the one circuit for three and one-half miles for the rea - son that it might interfere with the operation of the signal circuits. The new construction constitutes a single phase tap, which often creates inductive interference in telephone lines where long parallels occur. It is doubtful whether the parallel here is of sufficient length to cause prolonged interference with the signal circuits. The total number of subscribers that may be affected is not to exceed eight or nine. No objection was made to the manner of construction except as above described. I he Commission finds that applicant has complied with the law le prayer of its petition should be granted, subject to the trans - it line rules adopted by this Commission and effective Sep - r 5, 1919. The Commission also finds that six months from ite of this order is a reasonable length of time in which to coin - le proposed construction. EThe Commission will retain its jurisdiction over the service on signal circuits involved in the parallel created by the proposed struction, and in the event that the service on those lines is inter - &gt;d with by prolonged inductive interference resulting from the </seg>

Owing: to the fact that the roads have been improved between these points and a bus line has been established, the public is not using; these trains, the railroad company has been operating them for sometime at an out-of-pocket loss of over $400 per month. The towns served by these two trains are now receiving their mail on trains Nos. 41, 42, 43 and 44, so that there will be no change in the mail service to the towns affected. The railroad company agrees in its application to serve these towns with passenger service on trains Nos. 41. 42, 43 and 44 so there will be adequate passenger service, if trains Nos. 30 and 40 are eliminated. As the eliminating of trains Nos. 39 and 40 will bring about an tconomy of over $5,000 per year, without any material inconvenience to the traveling public and to the towns through which the trains traverse, the Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the application of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company to discontinue trains Nos. :*(• and 40 between Ravenna and Broken Bow be granted, 'fective on and after October 1, 1928, for a trial period of ninety ays, without hearing being held.

Several of these all steel 75-foot modern gas electric motor ears have been put into service by the company on other o: its lines and are giving good satisfaction. Every order that ha been written permitting this substitution has been written subject to u ninety-day trial period and if written complaint from the severs towns through which the road traverses is filed with the Commission hearing would be held and the matter determined after testimony has been taken. Of all the substitutions that have been permitted by the Commis - sion there has not been a single written complaint filed and several of the citizens along the lines where the substitution has been made have expressed its entire satisfaction in the service rendered. The Commission is of the opinion that where economies can be practiced without discommoding the public the railroad company should not only be permitted, biit be required to practice them. An unec - onomic waste should not be tolerated as in the final analysis other ses of service must make up the loss in increased charges for ice that the public has to have. Railroad companies do not teate value, they sell service for value, and if they furnish service at the public is not patronizing, it is obvious that the service is furnished at a loss and this loss has to be made up from some source.

Approximately $1000 oi' that deficit accrued durin the first two months of ownership by the present owners, th period prior to a return of a considerable portion of th former patronage.

            <seg id="p447">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 447 though they are probably setting aside an inadequate reserve and are paying themselves nothing on their investment." Accordingly, except for slight change in the rate for switching service, and except for the period above referred to when higher rates were in effect, and during most of which time subscribers were on a strike and the exchange closed, the rates now in effect are the same rates "hich have been collected continuously since the origin of the oompanv in 1902. LThe present owner, J. T. Coffey, purchased these properties last y. During the interim, it is alleged the lines have been rebuilt and lervice materially improved. The application recites the fact: "That at the rates above referred to (the present schedule) has !)■■&lt; n impossible for complainant at said exchange to earn fair return on the fair value of the property used in rendering service: that said rates are unreasonably low. That complainant estimates and believes that the said sed rates will yield not more than enough revenue to pay thf xpenses of operating said exchange and provide a fair return pon the lair value of the property used in rendering the service; that said proposed rates are just and reasonable." Accompanying the application is a petition addressed to the Corn - on, reading as follows: "Being of the opinion that a slight increase in the rates now harged by the Bloomfield Telephone Co., &lt;k Bloomfield, Ke- braska, will give us better service and will enable the present pany to keep their equipment in better shape, we, the under- signed subscribers and users of the Bloomfield Telephone System hereby agree that the rates may be raised to the following prices: $1.50 per month $2.50 per month Residence and rural phone Business phones This raise in rates was unanimously consented to at a meeting of the Bloomfield Community Club on Thursda3\ October 11, HV28."

Accordingly, six hundred twenty company subscribers, out of a total of seven hundred thirty- -80% plus — have indicated their willing - ness to the increases proposed. Bad weather and unfavorable road conditions made impossible interviewing personally the great majority of those who have not signed. .Applicant submits a statement showing estimated income and estimated expenses for the year 1928, based upon actual operation of the exchange for a six-inonths period Irom May 1, li'JS. This estimate carries totals as follows: If the proposed rates had been effective during this period, ap plicant figures total annual revenue would have been $16,508.80. T annual operating expense above set forth should be added annua taxes in amount of $720, making a total operating expense of $11, 704.56. Deducting total annual operating expense from total annua revenue produced under the proposed rates, it is noted that a net op erating revenue of $4,804.24 results. The Commission does not know definitely just what the fair value of applicant's properties, aj this time, may be. N*o doubt during the years of inadequate rates, the properties have not been maintained in a high standard of condition. However, as noted above, applicant advises that considerable money lias been spent in recent months on the DroDerties in rehabilitate r th Total exchange revenue Total toll revenue Total miscellaneous revenue Per Year $12,451.08 1,715.88 654.72 Total operating revenue $14,821.68 OPERATING EXPENSES Total maintenance Total traffic expense Total commercial expense Per Year $ 5,699.88 2,181.24 3,103.44 Total telephone operating expense $10,984.56 </seg>
            <seg id="p449">449 i t v V Applicant's balance sheel as of October 31, 1928, shows a total bred investment of $74,711.12. This figure, presumably, gives no deration to depreciation. I It is the Commission's opinion that such net revenue as may re - ain alter actual operating expenses arc taken care of, including xi's, and a reasonable amount provided for the depreciation reserve, vill not exceed a fair return upon the fair value of the properties. In act. it appears highly probable that any return which may be paid, a ill be less than that to which applicant is legally entitled. Having in mind previous studies made by the Commission with •espect to rate requirements of applicant, and having in mind the fact hat. in excess of 80% of all subscribers affected have agreed to the schedule of rates which is proposed herein, it is the Commission's con - •lusion that the same can be authorized without the formality of a blie hearinsr The first obligation of a common carrier is to so maintain its properties that a proper standard of service may be rendered. Accord - ingly, it is the Commission's opinion that the order should provide for i definite amount to be charged as depreciation expense and credited be depreciation reserve before any return shall be paid upon the vali f the properties. This requirement will be carefully checked j the Commission's accounting department and if the company's ex - erience develops the fact that the amount that the Commission requires n is too large or too small, it can, upon application of the company i motion of the Commission, he subsequently altered. The Commission's order will provide for an annual credit to de - reeiation reserve of not less than -$5,700 per annum. It is thought hat this amount will properly maintain the properties and provide for reserve to cover accrued depreciation not realized. The Commission appreciates the splendid spirit of cooperation \v manifest by the subscribers of this exchange, as reflected by the Egnatures attached to the petition. In this day and aire. communities re demanding adequate and efficient telephone service. It can only ■ secured through the payment of adequate rates which permit the aintenance of the properties in a proper condition. The schedule E rates herein provided for should at least materially improve the irviee at this exchange and encourage the new owner in the proper aintenance of the properties used and useful in the public service. Applicant requests authority to discontinue present, gross and et rate rule. Prompt payment of telephone bills, whi«h are small in amount, is an important factor in the proper conduct of a telephone business. However, the Commission is not disposed to require a gross a hd net rate rule where, in the best judgment of local management. it is not necessary. Ine request will, accordingly, be granted. </seg>

OPINION AND ORDER RANDALL. Chairman tOn the eighth day of May, 1920, the Leigh Independent Telephone npany made application to the Nebraska State Railway Commission increase its rates from, the amount it was authorized to charge at t time to the following rates: Business service Kesidence service Farm service $2.25 per month 1.25 per month 1.50 per month Switching service .50 per month This order did not provide for a gross and net rate rule, the rates mentioned being the net rates, the company would be permitted to charire. There was no provision in the order permitting the company to charge for line calls either to subscribers, or non-subscribers. Experience has shown that while the rates allowed at that time ve been reasonably ample to take care of the maintenance, depre - ciation reserve and a reasonable dividend to the companj, it has also shown, that there should be some slight increase in revenue, because of t payment of telephone rentals by some subscribers, which makes the bead expense greater in collecting rentals than it would have been there been a gross and net rate. On December 19. 1928, the Leigh Independent Telephone Company by its president and manager, Louis Hahn, made application to the- Commission for a gross and net rate rule to be charged by the company, the net rate to be the same as at present. The application is in the following language to- wit: "At the present time this company has no gross and net rate ride. Owing to the fact collections are in a great many in - stances very slow, it becomes necessary for our secretary to spend a good deal of time in collecting back telephone dues. "We understand that your Commission has granted com - panies a gross and net rate plan which has brought about more prompt payment of telephone rentals. We therefore make ap - plication to you for a gross and net rate. The net rates to re - main the same as at present, but with your usual twenty-five cents </seg>

The rates that were fixed by the Commission in 19-0 are considered reasonable by the Commission at the present time but no matter how much the rate is, if it is not paid promptly, the company does not have the money to do business. As it is required to pay its help and other overhead expenses iii cash, it is absolutely nee&lt; — ai rentals be paid promptly in cash by the subscribers, in order that the company may have sufficient lands to not only pa v overhead expenses, bnt keep its lines in good repair so rliat the service may not be impaired for lack of funds with which to pav the □ The company has nearly 400 stations and the an st subscriber is small, but the as :un&lt; individual amounts arc ~n think as the amount is small it docs not make much d it is paid promptly or not and it beeones necessary for the te ;arv manager or secretary, whoever has that dut lot of time and expense in collecting these small amounts, which makes a double expense that ought ha phone company.

            <seg id="p460">460 Interstate Commerce Commission Recommendations To The Honorable Joseph E. Eastman, Interstate Commerce Comini Washington, D. C. iion Gentlemen : kThe Nebraska State Railway Commission has been asked by you ive its recommendation regarding the necessity and convenience le proposed railroad to run from Yunkton. South Dakota, to Nor- Nebraska. The Commission has thoroughly considered the ques - and has come to the conclusion that a recommendation should be 1 by it in favor of the proposed road. In giving our reason this recommendation we have done so solely on the record and in this way have tried to be entirely fair and impartial to all parties concerned. Regarding the question of necessity, we believe that the record is very clear, and we further believe that it shows that at the present time there is a crying need for direct railroad connections between Yankton, South Dakota, and the surrounding country, and the coontrj in northeast Nebraska. There is a substantial amount of testimony I'm record that shows that at the present time in order to L r et from cton, and surrounding country, into northeast Nebraska, it is ssary to ship by a very circuitous route down to Sioux City and ha, and then back into the northeast Nebraska country. The •t air line distance between Yankton and the first town in Ne - ka, Crofton. is approximately eighteen miles. At the present time ipment of goods by rail from the one town to the other necessit - ates a haul of over one hundred miles. The testimony of various of the witnesses shows this makes for increased freight rates, and lie - cause of these two factors, long hauls and high rates, little business is carried on between these two communities. It is true that a certain amount of business can be, and is, carried on by truck, but this is limited to less than carload traffic. Furthermore, it is not a mere speculation as to whether any business would be carried on between these two localities, but it is an assured fact as shown by the record. The testimony of Mr. Ba^u - strom for instance, on pages sixty-nine and seventy, shows that there Lincoln, September 19, 1928. </seg>
            <seg id="p461">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 461 a necessity at the present time for a more direct rail connection Etween northeast Nebraska and South Dakota. This testimony not ly slinws that there is ;i necessity for such a connection, Imt it also o\\s that it such a connection were provided it would be utilized. 1 lie Nebraska Commission also believes that the northeast section of ii&gt; own state would be greatly benefited by this connection, due the fact that it would have a quicker and more direct outlet for prod acts to northern and northeastern markets, and would be en direct connection with the Union Pacific Railroad at Xorfolk that northeast Nebraska and southeast South Dakota would have K'eess to the entire system of the Union Pacific Railroad and be able obtain Colorado coal which at present they are unable to do. It is a well established fact that the desirability of a farming it rv de| 'ends not only upon the fertility of the soil and the farm- ing methods used, but it also depends largely on its accessibility to l.i rue centers where the produce of the farm can be marketed to the advantage. This Commission feels that the building of this proposed railroad will open up new markets to this country, and will therefore greatly aid in the desirability and value of the land. If a community can be improved, and made more desirable by certain means, then these means e&lt;&lt;mie a necessity to that community and cannot be considered a ere luxury. I The convenience the proposed railroad would provide to both rtheasi Nebraska and southeast South Dakota, and the surrounding mntry, is not questioned by anyone. It would make the transporta- fun of licit li freight and passengers much more rapid and convenient, f course, the transportation of passengers does not need the con - deration that should be given to the convenience of the transportation E freight, because it is a well recognized fact by this Commission at ;ist. that the passenger traffic of the railroads all over the country is ring greatly interfered with by privately owned automobiles and isses. The consideration of the convenience of the transportation . 1 freight, however, is a vital question. Where freight in large quantities at present has to go by a very circuitous route when being shipped between these two localities., it could go by a nuieh shorter straight line route, if this proposed road were constructed. The sav - ing of time alone is one factor that should have weight in the considera - tion of this question. This Commission realizes that the question as to whether such a railroad would pay or not is a mere matter of conjecture and esti - mate. Those who propose to furnish the capital to construct the road have satisfied themselves that it will pay and are willing to make the investment. Much, of course, would depend upon the methods used in the construction and the operation of suich a road, as would also the nbibtv to meet competition and draw business from the adiomin',' </seg>
            <seg id="p462">462 KThis Commission, therefore, is not attempting to &gt;ay whethei road could be made to pay, because such a statement would In one of opinion. Furthermore, there are actual figures ami esti - as well as testimony in the record, that should convince th&lt; ite Commerce Commission on this question. According to the record, the builders of the proposed line oi rail road propose to offer numerous new ideas in railroad transportation such as store door delivery, special services to shippers of live stock and many other such services that arc not offered by railroads .gen - erally. These kind?, of services may prove satisfactory in drawing the transportation to the railroad as against the auto trucks. Wi believe it is well worth the trial. Therefore, in conclusion, let it lie said that the Nebraska Mat Railway Commission, because of the above stated reasons and becaus of the fact that the main connecting link between northeast Ne braska and southeast South Dakota, namely the Missouri River bridg at Yankton, is completed and ready for use as a railroad bridge, here by recommends to the Interstate Commerce Commission that ii gr&amp;i the application of the Yankton, Norfolk A Southern Railroad Corapan Bl a line of railroad between Yankton, South D ebraska.

The defendant tiled an answer denying that the Grejrsr </seg>

Upon the issues joined a hearing was had before the Commission. Elaborate and di-tailed findings of fact and conclusions of law were made, followed b&gt; an order which directed the defendant to construct an overhead dossing at the point in question when, and not before, the county authorities place the highway in a reasonably passable condition. De - fendant has appealed. As grounds for a reversal of the order, defendant avprs that thi Kailway Commission is without jurisdiction or authority to make such a conditional order as that entered in this case, and that the order is not sustained by the evidence, or findings of fact made 1&gt;\ the Commission. Neither party raise- any question as to the correctness of the finding of fact made by the Commission. An independent investigation of the record leads us to the conclusion that each finding of fael is sustained by the evidence. The findings are too lengthy to !&gt;&lt;• set out B opinion. We shall summarize so much thereof ;i or a proper disposition of the case. The defendant's line of railway extends in a southerly direction from Omaha to Bellevue and Fort Crook. It runs nearly parallel wit the Missouri river and, owing to the hills and bluffs, through nun erous deep cuts. There are two main highways running from Omah in a southerly direction; one to Bellevne along the east side, the other t Fort Crook on the west side, of defendant's track. The distance betwd these two highways is from 1,900 to 3,000 feet at different points M hat is known in the record as the "Gregg road" was regularly opene i\ 1888. It is 3,000 feet long, connects the two main highways abo\ mentioned, and intersects the defendant's railroad track and right o vray. The defendant constructed its railway in 1900, Mud at th time provided an overhead bridge to carry the Gregg road over it tracks and right of way. This road was never used to any considei able extent. In 1915 the approaches to the bridge had washed awa and it had become unsafe for any persons who might attempt to us it. Tn May of that year the defendant erected barricades on pith* side of the bridge, to prevent its use. These barricades remaine&lt; until 1917, when the defendant dismantled and removed the bridge. N complaint was made by any individual or by the authorities of Sarpy county, as to the maintaining of the barricades or removal of the bridge, until in 1925. It appears from the findings that there are in the vicinity two other highways which connect the two main highways, above referred to. One of these roads is 1,200 feet north and the other 1,900 feet north of the Gregsr road. The Commission found that since 1915 there has been no travel over the Gregg road, going across or over defend- </seg>
            <seg id="p465">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 465 ant's tracks, and that the portion of the Gregg road lying east of d( fondant's tracks has been restored to cultivation by adjacent farm - er-. Jt found that the two roads to the north of the Gregg road and tnecting the two main highways are shorter than the Gregg road, of them being 2,000 feet and the other 1,900 feet long. It further found that that part of the Gregg road lying west of the defendant's right of way is still open and is used only, or almost entirely, by one Johnson, who lives a few hundred feet south of the road. The Com - in found that the failure to use the road when it was first estab - lished was due to the condition of the road; that defendant's railroad h:it point cuts through the eastern slope of a hill; that the cut on ivesi side is "20 feet deep and on the east side 13 to 14 feet deep; tit there is a Lo per cent grade leading to the proposed bridge from her the east or west: that it is so steep it would be difficult for tomobiles to negotiate the grade, and that to make an overhead due accessible a large amount of grading would be necessary; that • county had not indicated its willingness or intention to do such irk; that if the bridge would be constructed it could be used only mler most favorable conditions and then under great difficulty and in - onvenience; that the other roads connecting the two main highways af- nil ample facilities for the general public to pass from one highway to ■ e other, and that, with the possible exception of Mr. Johnson, none 1 have occasion to use the Gregg road in order to reach the paved jraveled highways. Then follows a discussion of the legal phases he situation, and the Commission finally concludes that it is the 1 duty of defendant to establish and maintain a crossing at the t in question; concluding its findings as follows We are therefore of the opinion that an overhead crossing should Dstrneted. Legally this highway is open. As we have shown, however, without grading it will be physically closed, even if an over - head crossing is constructed. Unless the county authorities proceed to properly grade the highway, any order we make 'will be a vain thing.' I; the crossing is constructed, the public will not thereby secure any relief, because the road will not be in condition to be traveled. Our Older, therefore, will be made contingent upon the county authorities doing the necessary work to make the road passable.'* Section 5534, Comp. St. 1022. imposes the duty on every corpora - tion "owning or operating any railroad, crossed by a public road, to n-.ake and keep in good repair, good and sufficient crossings for such road over their tracks, including all the grading, bridges, ditches, and culverts that may be necessary within their right of way." Succeed - ing sections give the State Railway Commission jurisdiction over all crossings of highways, outside of incorporated villages, towns and cities, over and under all railroads in the state of Nebraska, and au - thorize the Commission to make such regulations for the construction, repair and maintenance thereof as it shall deem adequate and sufficient for the protection and necessity of the public. </seg>
            <seg id="p466">TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT 466 AYhile the above quoted statute apparently makes it the duty of the railway company to make and keep in repair irood and sufficient crossings wherever its tracks are crossed by a public road, we think a proper interpretation of the statute requires us to consider the purpose and object of such legislation. Clearly, it was intended to provide a safe and adequate means for the public to cross the tracks of a rail - road wherever public necessity or convenience would require it. Cer - tainly, it was not the purpose to compel the construction and main - tenance of costly bridges or viaducts where they would be of no us to the public, and where they would not serve the public convenience If any other view were taken, it would require a vain and useless expenditure of large sums of money by railway companies to make ant keep in srood repair crossings of this character. Railroads are entitlec to make such char-res for their services, as common carriers, a will bring in an income sufficient to pay the cost of operation, main tenance and a reasonable return upon the investment. These charge na:&gt;t be borne by the patrons of the common carrier. In the las analysis the cost or expense of such crossings must be borne by the pnbHc. It certainly is not good policy to require the public to pay for socalleil improvements which would be of no benefit to the public. As pointed out by the Commission in its findings, it at this time the bridge or overhead crossing should be constructed, it would be of absolutely no use, nor is there any assurance thai it ever would be of any use, to the public. It would require the expenditure of a larjre sum of money, with m&gt; corresponding bi Fairly interpreted, the statute was intended to require the constru&lt;*- Bf crossings over highways when, and only when, pnbli lvenience would be subserved thereby. I is also a well-settled rule of law that a judgment or order niu&gt;t ed upon a cause of action existing, at least at the time of. the g. Here, there was no right to the relief prayed at the tin the complaint, or at the time of the hearing; nor do we know here ever would be a rigfht to the relief demanded. We think not within the power of the Railway Commission to make stub er as that promulgated in the instant case. Ry this holding we do not mean that the Commission maj an order to take effect at a future specified date, luit it may not such an order to take effect upon a contingency which may never n. It follows that the order of the Commission should be reversed and the cause dismissed, but without prejudice to the plaintiff to institute .mother proceeding, praying for the construction of an overhead crossing when the future conditions exist which would warrant the i onstruction of such a crossing.

            <seg id="p468">468 TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT We have considered the facts as reflected by the record, as well as the law applicable thereto, and conclude that the Commission was nctinjr within the scope of its authority. Sections (5107, (il24, tilJ.s. and 6139, Rev. St. 1913, now respectively sections 54G0, 5483, 5487, And 5498, Comp. St. 1922: Hooper Telephone Co. v. Nebraska Tele - phone Co., 96 Neb. 345; Marquis v. Polk County Telephone Co., 100 Neb. 140. Especially are we led to this conclusion when we consider the above citations in connection with sec. 20. article IV, Constitution q! Nebraska, wherein it is provided: "The powers and duties of such (Railway) Commission shall include the regulation of rates, service and general control of common carriers (such common carriers beinir defined by section 5483, Comp. St. 1922, as including telephone com - panies) as the legislature may provide by law. But, in the absent* of specific legislation, the Commission shall exercise the powers ami perform the duties enumerated in this provision." We further find that there was evidence sufficient to warrant t lie conclusion reached as to the conditions involved, the rate estab - lished, and the necessity for the service sought on each Sabbath day and each holiday, other than those holidays heretofore indicated as excluded. In arriving at this determination we have not been un - rrindful of section 979o, Comp.

The local shall use the acilities of the company located at Oskhosh, Nebraska, in making the elivery of wheat of its members to the Nebraska Wheat Growers' ssoeiation, and deliveries of wheat which shall be made at Oshkosh, ebraska, by the members of the local shall be made through the facili - ea &lt;&gt;f the company. 2. The charges for the receiving, handling, eighing, testing, grading, storing, loading and billing of the wheat o the Nebraska Wheat Growers' Association shall be as follows: 'hree and one-half cents per bushel (3%c per bushel) for all wheat elivered to elevator company. In consideration of this charge, the company agrees to deliver f.o.b. ears, the equivalent number of bushels wheat as represented by scale tickets issued." The above contract presents the difficulty in the case. A good 'aith performance by the parties thereto and with the evident purpose ■erein indicated, in fact, establishes the foundation on which this tivution proceeds. In substance, the State Railway Commission igregaies the acts constituting a part of this incident from the general •ansaetion in which they occur, and of which they form only a part. ■Yom this limited premise it draws the conclusion that, as on all of the •Tain received, only an "advance" was paid, and some of this grain etnained in the elevators of plaintiffs for more than ten days, this Tain so possessed must be deemed "grain held in storage for a period ■ Mirer than ten days," and in view of the fact that only an "advance" "as paid thereon must also be considered as "grain which has been eeeived at any grain elevator or grain warehouse for which payment las not been made within ten days after receipt of the same;" that iaintiffs therefore must be deemed public warehousemen and, as uch. are subject to the regulations and penalties provided by sections 224-7231, Comp. St. 1922. There is little or no conflict in the evidence. It fairly appears lat, under the terms of this contract, as interpreted by all parties to . members of this association hauled the grain produced by them to bis contract elevator just the same as any other elevator, received scale ticket issued by the elevator, and went to a bank and drew le advance on their wheat from the association. The elevator pays o part of the purchase price on the wheat, and enters into no obliga - lon so to do. The evidence also supports the conclusion that shipment by car - load lots is contemplated by all parties to this contract, and th«it wheat delivered to contract elevators is held until carload lots have been ticeumulated : that ordinarily the "average bushel" did not remain in these elevators more than 3, 4, or 5 days, but in exceptional cases, </seg>
            <seg id="p474">474 TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT due to delay in accumulating carload lots, or incidental to shipping and marketing, some of the wheat thus received from the members of the association remained in these contract elevators in excess of 10 days. It further appears that, while the owners of these contract elevat - ors were enployed in the business of buying and selling 1 grain on their own account, they were not engaged in the public warehouse business in any way whatever save and except as the performance of the con - tract with the grain growers' association may have imposed or exacted such services from them. It fairly appears that all parties acted in good faith: that the purpose and intent of the contract and the result intended and accomplished by it is fairly reflected by the terms em - ployed which are hereinbefore quoted; that, as a matter of fact, the contract elevator in each case is and was the local representative of the association as contemplated by the contract before us as well as by the contracts between the members and the association: that the services under consideration, rendered as an entirety, were incidental to and essential and necessary in accomplishing the plan of cooperative marketing, adopted and carried out by the Nebraska Wheat Growers' Association. Bbe fundamental question therefore presented by the record before vhether these acts and proceedings had by the plaintiffs, in view the circumstances of which they formed a part, bring the parties rest within the provisions of sections 7224-7231, Couip. St. 1022. ibject them to the penalties therein provided. K order to determine the meaning of the language of an act of lature, it is proper to examine the course of legislation upon s general subject." State V. Cosgrave. 85 Neb. 187. E'he first legislation devoted to the subject before us was enacted L5 as chapter 243. Laws 1915, and is entitled, "An act to provide )lic warehouse system for handling grain and to regulate the dure thereunder." 7 Section 1 of this act defines a public ware - . Sections 2 to 7, inclusive, provide regulations of the govern - of that business. Section 8 is devoted to penalties for failure lform to the provisions of the act. Rrhe next, in order of time, was the enactment of chapter 155. Laws entitled, "An act to amend sections 1, 2, 4 and 8 of chapter 243, on Laws of 1915, relating to public warehouses, and to repeal riginal sections." This, with exception of one feature, is in force e present time. Section 1 provides: kAny grain dealer, person, firm, corporation, or association, in tate who receives grain for storage or shipment, or both, may himself of the provisions of this act by filing notice of his ice thereof with the State Railway Commission and become iy a public warehouseman. Any grain elevator or grain ware - (other than at terminal points, which terminal points shall be </seg>

In 1921, chapter 4, Laws 1921, was passed, which appears to be omplete within itself and which is entitled, ''An act to provide tarn, urehouses on the farm for storage of grains: to regulate the pro - edure thereof and to provide penalties for the violation of the same, id ti&gt; declare an emergency." Section 1 of this act provided: "That iv landowner, tenant, or manager of any lands in this state may ore wheat or any other grain upon said land in a farm warehouse &gt;uilt and situated thereon and receive a warehouse receipt for the same i complying with the provisions of this act." Sections 2 to 7 in - usive, provided regulations for the government of the business. ■ctinn 8 provided penalties for violation of the act. Section 9 re - ated to the redemption of the receipts issued by such warehouse. &gt;ction 10 provided that the provisions of chapter 76, Rev. St. 1913, thall be applicable to this act whenever the same are not inconsistent rewith." The last legislation relating to the matter under consideration appears to have been enacted in 1925 as chapter 80, Laws 1925, and is entitled, "An act to provide for the organization and incorporation of nonstock cooperative marketing companies and associations: and to define their powers." For the purpose of this case we summarize the provisions of this last named act as follows: "Any number of persons, not less than five, engaged in the production of (or) two or more nonprofit cooper - ative associations of producers of agricultural products may from a nonprofit cooperative association without capital stock for the purpose of producing, handling, processing, preparing for market, warehousing 1 , preserving, . . . utilizing, and marketing . . . agricultural E)ducts of its members,"' and enable itself to engage in any activities ■ its membership of any of the thing's enumerated, including the rchasinsr or securing for its members of equipment, machinery, etc. Laws 1925, ch. 80, sec. 2. The corporation thus authorized to be organized is expressly ested, by the terms of the act before us, with the following powers, n addition to others not herein enumerated: "(2) To buy, lease or lold any real or personal property necessary or convenient for the onduct and operation of the business or incidental thereto. (3) To uy and sell agricultural products including live stock for itself and its lembers and stockholders and others, and as agents on commission. 4) To enter into contracts with its members for periods not over five ears requiring them to sell or market all or a specified part of their </seg>

(7) To act as agent or representative of any member or members or of non - members in carrying out the objects of the association. (8) To receive and employ warehouse receipts or other written instruments covering 1 products of members stored on farms or elsewhere under suitable conditions issued or executed by any warehouseman, warehousin association, or other entity, which products may or may not have bee inspected by inspectors licensed or authorized to inspect, sanipl classify, grade, or weigh agricultural products under state or federa laws and which warehouse receipts or other written instruments may o may not be accompanied by the certificate or certificates issued b such by such inspectors on such products. (10) To do each am every thing necessary, suitable or proper lor the accomplishment of an_ one or more of the purposes or the attainment of any one or mor of the objects herein enumerated or the objects or purposes tor whic formed, . . . and to contract and net accordingly : and in additio to exercise and possess all powers, rights and privileges necessary o incidental to the objects or purposes for which formed or to th activities in which it is engaged or which further tho aceomplishmen of such objects or purposes or the conduct of such activities: and i addition any other rights, powers and privileges granted by the law of this state to ordinary corporations, except such as are inconsisten with the provisions of this act: and to do any such thing anywhere. Laws 1925, ch. 80. see. 5. We have thus before us three separate and distinct legislativ acts, each evidently intended to be exclusive and complete within itselt so far as persons and transactions to which their terms apply. True if any provisions appear in the earlier acts which are repugnant to th provisions incorporated in the last one in point of time, they ar necessarily repealed by implication. But a careful examination o these enactments with reference to the transactions here involved, how ever, convinces us that as to it there is no necessary conflict betwee the provisions of any of them, and especially no conflict between th exercise of the "power of warehousing" conferred on the nonstoc marketing association created by the act of 1925 and the restrictiv and regulative provisions of the act of 1915, as amended in 191" applicable solely to the business of public warehousing. Each ac occupies and covers a definite sphere, and within that sphere is suprem and controlling. They do not overlap. A transaction properly withi the purview of any one of them is not subject to the requirements o either of the remaining enactments. If we are in error in arriving at this conclusion, so far as it applies to any of the legislation mentioned, there can be no question as to the correctness of the conclusion as applied to the act of 1925. Sub - paragraph (8) above set forth serves no purpose except to express the legislative intent to render the cooperative agency created by it wholly free from, and independent of, the restrictions and regulations therein </seg>
            <seg id="p477">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 477 Ped to which were established by previous legislation. In addition s, by section 14, eh. 80, Laws 1925, it is further expressly pro - that, "Any provision of law which is in conflict with this act not be construed as applying to any association herein provided So far as matters fairly within the scope of its powers are tneerned, this act therefore must be deemed as exclusive and con tiling. The act of 1915, as amended, is occupied with a definition and regulation of an ultimate public business, public employment, a public vocation. Its purpose is the creation of a public warehouse system therein provided for. It has to do with the storage of property of I hers. Whatever may be said as to the option it, in terms, confers, a mandatory enactment its sanctions are not concerned with the urage of the private property of the owner of the elevator or ware - &gt;iise therein. In fact, public storage of grain is the sole, ultimate id controlling object of the public relation it assumes to define and gulate. In view of the foregoing, the facts of the record sustain but one conclusion. All of the acts which the plaintiffs performed, as shown by the evidence, were within the terms of the contract under which they were employed; were acts authorized to be performed by the Nebraska Wheat Growers' Association by the terms of its constating act : were acts essential and necessary to be performed in order that the legislative intent disclosed by the terms of this legislation might be upheld, the business contemplated carried on, and the benefits in - tended for agriculture realized. Nothing was done by any person con - nected with the transaction as a colorable device to evado the penalties of the act of 1015. as amended. Neither is this conclusion as to the relation of the parties modified because the terms of the contract involved the use of property belonging to plaintiffs as such agents and employees of the corporation. This organization, it is to be remembered, is a cooperative corporation. It ran act and perform only by agents and employees. Unless' the state, by law, has established some distinctive police regulations appli - cable to agents and employees as distinguished from the corporate employer, in the performance of an act authorized to the latter, such agents in that connection must be deemed authorized by the legislation of 1925. We find no such provision in the laws before us now under consideration. By the terms of the law of 1925 the corporate entity it created was expressly empowered "to do each and everything necessary, suitable or proper for the accomplishment of any one or more of the purposes or the attainment of any one or more of the objects herein enumerated or the objects or purposes for which formed, . . . and to contract and act accordingly; and in addition to exercise and possess all powers, rights and privileges necessary or incidental to the objects or purposes </seg>

Laws 1925, ch. 80, sec. 5 subd. ( 10). Indeed, this act, viewed as an entirety, must be deemed, not only as author - izing'the formation of &lt; perative corporations, but also as declaratory of the public policy of this state on the subject of cooperative market - ing of .uraiii (including all business and the details thereof related and forming a part thereof.) As a remedial statute this court is warranted in .uivinu it a liberal and effective construction. There can be no question l&gt;ut what the terms of the contract quoted at the commencement of this opinion may be properly constructed onh in the light of the principles above sei forth. When the rule is appli the LTain of others, as such "grain Keither does the fact that only an "ail time of the receipt of the grain operate t" chanffi a cooperative transaction, and the eooperators, ii contract, contribute grain to ;i going business in only parties in interest but actual proprietors.

He was then in fact one of the proprietors of a i{T business, and. in event of successful termination thereof at end jool year, would receive his pro rata share in the results of the I.

The line portions appear as sections 841S and 8419, Compiled Stat - 1922. They read as follows: 8418. "Irrigation works — repair. Every person managing, own - ing or controlling any irrigation works for the storage, carriaf diversion of water, except irrigation districts, sliall keep its headgates, diversion dams, canals and laterals in reasonable and proper repair for the delivery and diversion of water to the appropriators under its canal, and the regulation thereof shall be under the control and direc - tion of the State Railway Commission." </seg>

The penalties provided for the violation of the rules, regulations and orders of the State Railway Commission in matters relating to common carriers, shall be in force as the rules illations with reference to this article." Th«' first ground of attack upon the jurisdiction of the Commission seems to be based upon the use of the term "appropriation,"' that the Beetion of the statute above quoted refers only to actual appropriators and does nor refer to those who have the benefieal usa of the water. It appears to us that such a construction is unduly narrow. In fact, tin- statute itself uses the term "appropriator" as meaning those who have the benefioal use of the water. The terms "canals" and "laterals" would l&gt;e meaningless unless they were used with reference to those ting to apply the water to the land. The right to the use of the water for irrigation purposes is ached to the land to be irrigated. Farmers Canal Co. v. Frank, 72 Nebraska L36. Dundy County Irrigation Co. v. Morris, 107 Nebraska E. Section 8418 must refer not only to the diversion of the water, t also to its application to the land through canals and laterals. The power of the State Railway Commission to fix rates provided ;ection 8477 is reeognized in McCook Irrigation &amp; Water Powter t. V. BurtleSS. (IS Nebraska 141. The power to fix rates would be little value if there were no means of requiring irrigation works e kept in such repair as to insure proper delivery of water. The mission has heretofore required irrigation companies to keep their properties in order. Bartley v. Gothenburg Light &amp; Power Company, Nebraska State Railway Commission Reports, 122 It is dear that the State Railway Commission has no power to ispnted property rights or to determine the ownership of irriffa- works. McCook Irrigation &amp; Water Power Co. v. Burtless, supra. It may also be true that the State Railway Commission lacks jurisdic ti"ti to determine what lands are within, and what lands are withou the area covered by an appropriation. A mere denial, however, tha the several complainants own the lands described in the complain does noi of itself defeat jurisdiction. A justice of the peace ha jurisdiction of forcible entry and detainer actions, but has no powe to determine cases involving titles to real estate. The mere denial o ownership, however, is not sufficient to divest the justice court o justice. Stone V. Blanchard. 87 Nebraska 1. Under suCh circum stances, the justice should proceed sufficiently far to ascertain whethe or not there is involved a substantial question as to the title of rea estate. tThe State Railway Commission should hear the complaint and if finds there is a substantial controversy as to whether or not the nds described in the complaint are within the area covered by appro- </seg>

K&gt;n, it should probably refrain from further action. The parties then have to resort to the district court of the proper county determination of such question. If there is no substantial eon - 5v upon this subject, the Commission should proceed with the j and determine the complaint upon its merits. Lincoln. July 2i . 1928 E Charles A Randall. State Railway Commisa e. Lincoln Xebraska. Dear Sir Il'oui- attention is called to the fact that this department ha - ilted by Mr. Sprairne of the law firm of Corcoran and S] rard to the effect of the decision of the Supreme Court in Lea &gt;. S. R. C. Part IV) upon the grain warehouse law. Mr. Si that certain public grain warehouses were refusing to handle t! grain of the Xebraska Wheat Growers Association, and requeste State Railway Commission to require them to do so. He was ail that the Commission could do ii"thintr about it. ■he opinion of this department is that the decision in the above case, for all practical purposes, set aside the grain ware] ad that further attempts to enforce it would only result in a of time and money. It has already been explained to the Com - n that under the holding: of the court serious discriminations arise if the law were attempted to be enforced. If the Commission desires it, a formal opinion will br prepared. Very truly your? 0. S. Spillman, Attorney General, By Hush LaMaster, Assistant Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p489">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 489 Lincoln. August 11, 1928 Mr. Leonard D. Densmore, Secretary, Nebraska State Railway Office. Commission, Dear Sir: Your letter of August 6th inquiring as to whether or not alfalfa ■eel has been classed as grain under the public grain warehouse law, ily received. There has been no ruling either of the Railway Commission or Attorney General's department upon the subject up to this time. hority has been found although careful search has been made. When the word is used in fire insurance policies it has ii given wide import. It has been held to include broom corn, Reavis v. Farmers Mutual F. I. Co., 78 Mo. App. 14, and com and millet hay, Norris v. Farmers Mutual Ins. Co., 65 Mo. App. 632. Flax seed ts also been held to be grain in a prosecution for larceny as bailee, ate of Minn. v. Cowdery, 81 N. W. 750 ? 48 L. R. A. 92. these decisions it would seem, in veiw of the fact e law contains penal provisions and that the handling of alfalfa st be more expensive than the handling of grains generally, irobable that the legislature intended to include alfalfa seed Leaning of the grain warehouse law. It must also be it grains are handled in a manner entirely different from [• in which seeds are handled. It is more reasonable to nt the legislature considered only the leading cereals, corn, rye and barley, in enacting the statute. nded warehouseman accept alfalfa seed and issue his ehouse receipt therefor, his bond, as a common law obligation, Id presumably cover such seed. In order to avoid all doubt about te matter however, if seed is to be covered by the bond, it should ntain a direct statement to that effect. The Commission should not undertake to enforce the provisions of the grain warehouse law in cases involving the storage of seeds. As pointed nut heretofore to the Commission, the recent ease of Lexington Mill &amp; Elevator Company v. Browne et al. renders the grain warehouse law, for all practical purposes ineffective. Very truly yours, O. S. Spillman, Attorney General, By Hugh LaMaster, Assistant Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p490">490 TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT Lincoln, September 18, 1928 Mr. Charles E. Matson, 502 Federal Trust Building, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Your favor of the 12th duly received. As I have heretofore advised you, 1 have been very busy and have not had opportunity until this time to answer. Your question is as follows: E write to inquire whether or not, in your judgment, a railroad r to protect the vested, property rights of an established grain with elevator on its right of way, can legally deny another cars for grain which is purchased and shovelled into the cars setition with the established grain dealer." It is the opinion of this department, that a railroad company ( cannot legally deny a dealer cars for gTain which is purchased and shovelled into the cars. The shipper has an absolute right to equal - ity of treatment and the carriers cannot discriminate as between the owner of an elevator and a shipper who shovels grain into the ears. II have not time to prepare a formal opinion on this subject, anc I will simply call your attention to the statutes relating thereto anc to a few of the many authorities dealing with the subject: Sections P3 of the Interstate Commerce Commission Act, being U. S. Code 9, sections 2 and 3. The Elkins Act, as amended, being U. S 9, section 41. Roberts Federal Liability of Carriers, see. 160 324, et seq. Union Pacific Railroad Co. v. Goodridge, 149 17 , 37 L. Ed. 896. New York, New Hampshire &amp; Hudson Railroad Interstate Commerce Commission, 200 U. S. 361, 50 L. Ed. 515 Armour Packing Co. v. United States. 209 U. S. 56, 52 L. Ed. 681. United States v. Koenig Coal Co., 270 U. S. 512, 70 L. Ed. 709. I am enclosing a carbon copy of this letter as I thought you might wish to forward this to your client. Very truly yours, 0. S.

            <seg id="p491">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 491 Lincoln, November 28, 1928 Mr. Leonard D. Densmore Secretary Nebraska State Kailway Commission, Office. Dear Sir: In answer to the inquiry of Haley-Neeley Company as to whether or not an election day is added to the free time under the demurrage rules, I have this to say: The statutes of Nebraska do not refer to election days in connection with demurrage. Freight Tariff No. 4-H. effective January 15, 1928, B. T. Jones, Agent, National Car Demurrage Rules and Charges, item 5, rule 3, makes provision for the days to be added. Election days do not fall within the list of added days. Mr. Powell's conclusion on the subject is correct. Very truly yours, O. S. Spillman, Attorney General, By Hugh LaMaster, Assistant Attorney General. Lincoln, December 20, 1928 M1S5, Mary E. Sheehan, Assistant Secretary Nebraska State Lincoln, Nebraska. Railway Commission, Dear Miss Sheehan : In response to your verbal inquiry as follows yMay a member of a partnership conducting: a public grain ware - become a surety on the warehouse bond given by such partner- No. A partner is, by operation of law, liable for the entire in - debtedness of the concern. His signing the bond would be an attempt to become his own surety. The sureties on such a bond must not be partners in the business. Very truly yours, 0. S. Spillman, Attorney General, By Hugh LaMaster, Assistant Attorney General. </seg>
