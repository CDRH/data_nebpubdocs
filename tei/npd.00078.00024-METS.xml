"' SUMMARY Except for alfalfa seed originating from a few old fields of Turkestan and Ladak, all varieties and strains now grown for commercial seed production m the United States, so far tested, have proved susceptible to wilt. All seed lots tested from South America (Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay), Europe (France, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Roumania, and Ukranian S.S.R.), Africa (Morocco, Algeria, and Abys - sinia), and Asia (Palestine, Manchuria, China, Korea, and Chinese Turkestan) were found to be susceptible to wilt. All seed lots of Turkestan origin so far tested are as resistant as Hardistan, or more so. Seed samples from the following districts of Turkestan, m order of combined wilt and cold resistance, ranked thus: Khiva, Chimbai and Alma Ata, Tashkent, Samarkand, and Chardzhui. Seed from the Bukhara, Ashkhabad, and Ferghana districts while wilt resistant lacked sufficient hardiness. Similarly several seed lots from Persia and one from India, although wilt resistant, lack sufficient hardiness. </seg>
            <seg id="p003">The Relative Susceptibility of Alfalfas to Wilt GEORGE L. PELTIER For the past three years the writer has been testing seed assembled from many alfalfa-growing regions of the world by Mr. H. L. Westover, Senior Agronomist, Division of For - age Crops and Diseases, U. S. Department of Agriculture, for their susceptibility to bacterial wilt (Aplanobacter insidiosum L. McC). The object of this publication is to present the re - sults of these tests and to assign a relative rating to the more promising sorts. A number of papers on the susceptibility of alfalfas to wilt have appeared within the past three years (1, 3, 5, and 6). All of these are agreed that alfalfa originating from Turkes - tan is resistant to wilt, as well as Ladak, also of Asiatic origin. Hardistan (2) and Kaw (7), probably strains of Turkestan alfalfa, are considered promising because of their resistance to wilt and cold. METHODS Alfalfa plants ranging m age from three weeks to three months have been generally used for the susceptibility tests. All seed was started m the greenhouse, either m plant bands (5), or m flats. The seedlings were carefully lifted and the soil thoroughly washed off the roots before inoculation. They were then transplanted m rows, either m the field m early May or m the greenhouse beds during the winter. Susceptibility tests were conducted m the field during the summers of 1930, 1931, and 1932, and m the greenhouse dur - ing the seasons of 1930-31 and 1931-32. Usually 100 plants of each lot were inoculated, and one month after transplanting a recovery count was made. Once a month thereafter notes were taken on the plants and at the end of five months all plants were lifted and the percentage and severity of infection determined from top and root symp - toms. The percentage of infection at the conclusion of the experiments was based on the number of plants living one month after inoculation. A new isolation of Aplanobacter insidiosum was obtained prior to each infection test from diseased alfalfa growing m the field. A two-weeks-old test-tube culture of the organism on potato-lactose agar was placed m one liter of water and the bacterial mass washed from the medium. Two methods of inoculation were employed. With the larger plants the roots were lightly scraped for a distance of one centimeter near the crown with a sharp scalpel while the plants were </seg>

The ends of the roots of the younger and smaller plants were severed under the suspension with a razor blade upon a block of wood. The latter method is to be preferred, especially with the young plants, since it is more rapid and the plants can be more uniformly inoculated. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS Replications of Grimm and Hardistan were used through - out the wilt tests as inoculated controls, since the one is very susceptible and the other fairly resistant to wilt. The re - sults are reported m Table 1, and serve as a basis for compar - ison of wilt susceptibility m the many lots of alfalfas tested. The results obtained from the field tests during the dry summer of 1931 are listed solely to indicate that under such conditions very little wilt developed, even m Grimm, and only an occasional plant of Hardistan became slightly in - fected. Thus the 1931 tests were of no value for compar - isons and have been omitted from the averages. To amel - iorate this condition the following season, the plants were watered by means of an overhead system. Sufficient mois - ture for the rapid growth of the plants and the development of wilt was thus available.

            <seg id="p005">Susceptibility of Alfalfas to Wilt 5 DOMESTIC ALFALFAS Ever since wilt investigations were undertaken in Nebraska in 1927, county agents and growers have been sending in seed from old fields in the hope of finding resistant sorts. A number of samples were thus obtained and their susceptibil - ity determined. Samples from seven old fields in Dawson, six in Buffalo, and three in other counties, taken from fields ranging from 15 to 36 years of age, have been grown and tested for wilt susceptibility. All but two have proved to be highly susceptible to wilt. From their growth characters the susceptible lots appeared to be Common alfalfas. Plants from each of the two resistant samples showed many of the growth characteristics of Turkestan alfalfa, and un - doubtedly were previously introduced from Turkestan. Seed from one of these fields has proved not only wilt and cold resistant but productive as well, over a period of years. This alfalfa has recently been named Hardistan (2) because of its hardiness and Turkestan origin. Seed of Hardistan is being increased as rapidly as circumstances permit so that com - mercial quantities will be available within a few years to growers in Nebraska and other states in the Great Plains area, adapted to its culture. Unfortunately only a small amount of seed was obtained from the second old field and further attempts to get a seed set in this field have failed, so that the only seed now on hand consists of progeny from selfed lines. A large part of the alfalfa seed grown in Nebraska is raised in Sioux, Dawson, and Sheridan counties in the northwestern part of the state. Many of the fields are old and of unknown origin. It has previously been shown (3) that wilt is a negligible factor in the loss of stands and productivity in this section. In order to determine whether seed from this district was actually resistant to wilt or whether climatic factors were such as to inhibit the spread and development of wilt, seed from six individual fields distributed over this section was tested in comparison with a bulked lot of seed for the commercial trade obtained from the same region. The tests showed that all six lots were susceptible in slightly varying degrees (Table 2). Apparently the com - mercial lot was slightly less susceptible, while the percent - age of healthy plants from both the individual and the com - mercial seed lots did not differ greatly from those obtained with Grimm. A higher percentage of slight infection and a lower percentage of severe infection resulted than with Grimm ; this distinct difference in severity was characteristic and uniform, not only with northwest-Nebraska seed but also </seg>
            <seg id="p006">Nebr. Exp. Sta. Research Bulletin 66 6 With other hardy Commons. Under comparable field con - ditions stands of northwest-Nebraska and other hardy Com - mons will usually outlast Grimm stands m wilt-infested areas m the Platte River valley. A number of fields sown to seed from the original Hardis - ten field have been found m Dawson county and seed from five such fields has been tested. These fields vary m age but average about Bto 10 years old. For the most part they still have good, productive stands. Some are isolated, while others are close to other alfalfas; m fact three fields are im - mediately adjacent to susceptible alfalfas. Seed obtained m 1929 from the original Hardistan field, which was isolated was planted m 1930 for increase at the North Platte Sub - station and m northwest Nebraska. Seed samples from these plats were obtained m 1931.

It can be noted from Table 3 that seed from these fields was quite variable m wilt resistance, the percentage of healthy plants ranging from 12 (Field No. 1) to 56 (Field No 8) per cent, whereas 46 per cent of the plants from the orig - inal Hardistan seed were healthy.

Seed-increase plats of resistant strains or varieties, therefore, have to be isolated from susceptible alfalfas m order to insure purity. About a dozen old fields, up to 40 years of age, have been located m the Platte River valley. Unfortunately no seed could be obtained from them ; therefore individual plant selec - tions have been made and progenies of self ed selections have been carried on for four generations. The results of this phase of investigations will be presented m a separate publi - cation. Since the issuance of a preliminary report (5) on wilt susceptibility additional domestic alfalfas have been tested. With few exceptions they have proved to be susceptible. In this group can be included the following alfalfas: Arizona (Maricopa Co.), California F. C. I. 15889, 1 Colorado (La Junta), Idaho F. C. I. 19297, Kansas F. C. I. 15940, New Mexico F. C. I. 15877, New Mexico (Cimarron Co., old field), New Mexico (Eddy Co., old field), New Mexico (Union Co., 42-year-old field, supposedly resistant to wilt), South Dakota F. C. I. 15870, Utah F. C. I. 15815, and lowa F. C.'l. 17399. A supposedly more hardy Grimm (F. C. I. 19291) from New Brunswick, Canada, was also extremely susceptible. The search for wilt-resistant alfalfas now growing m the United States has therefore narrowed down to a few old fields of Turkestan and Ladak (Table 4) . Hardistan and Kaw •The letters P. C.

A third old field, the seed of which is wilt and cold resistant, has been reported from South Dakota (F. C. I. 19299). This field was originally seeded to imported Turk - estan. No doubt other old resistant fields of Turkestan can be found in the Great Plains area of the United States, but, as will be shown later, they may not be any more wilt resist - ant than many recently introduced lots of Turkestan seed. It is of interest to note that Kaw (7) is derived from plants seeded with the same original seed of Provence (F. P. I. 34886) 2 as that seeded in the varietal plats of the Agronomy Department at the Nebraska Experiment Station in 1922 and reported as resistant by Peltier and Jensen (3) and later by Peltier and Tysdal (5). Remnants of seed from the orig - inal lot when tested showed a high resistance to wilt. Seed obtained from these plats in 1931 produced plants with as high a resistance as did the original seed (Table 4). The original and 1931 open-pollinated seed is apparently more re - sistant than Kaw. Progeny from a number of single-plant selections made in 1927 from these old plats shows a high resistance to wilt, Ladak, on the basis of three years' tests, can be considered resistant. This variety may find a place in wilt-infested re - gions naturally adapted to its growth habits. It has been noted in the tests that Ladak (F. C. L 1 15988), obtained from Montana, consistently gave a slightly higher percentage of wilt than Ladak (F. C. I. 14135). raised in South Dakota. On inquiry it has been learned that the Ladak seed grown in ' Seed waa purchased by the Office of Forage Crops and Diseases for Provence alfalfa. A recent examination of the weed seeds contained in the original lot in - dicates rather definitely that the seed was of Turkestan origin. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">Susceptibility op Alfalfas to Wilt 9 Montana, while originating from Ladak F. C. I. 14135 m South Dakota, was obtained from field plats growing adjacent to Grimm and other susceptible sorts. Except the alfalfas originating from a few old fields of Turkestan and Ladak, all varieties of alfalfa now grown for commercial seed production m the United States and so far tested have proved to be susceptible to wilt. In general the infection and field tests show that nonhardy sorts go out most rapidly, followed by the hardy variegated varieties. Stands of hardy Common alfalfa persist for a longer period than those of Grimm, because usually a lower percentage of severely infected plants is present. The decrease m stands of hardy resistant sorts is relatively slow. SOUTH AMERICAN ALFALFAS In all, nine seed lots 3 from Chile, two from Argentina, and one from Uruguay were included m the wilt tests. All lots proved to be as susceptible to wilt as Grimm. For example, the Chilean alfalfas averaged 6 per cent healthy, 26 per cent slightly infected, and 68 per cent severely infected. Previous tests have shown that the Argentina and Peruvian alfalfas were susceptible (3, 5). EUROPEAN ALFALFAS Because of the confusion regarding the origin of Provence F. P. I. 34886 * (5, 7) it was thought that perhaps wilt-resist - ant sorts might be found m the alfalfa-growing districts of Provence, France. In all 15 lots collected by Mr. Westover m several of the seed-growing districts of France were in - cluded m the wilt tests. Twelve of these proved to be highly susceptible, averaging 4 per cent healthy, 26 per cent slightly infected, and 70 per cent severely infected, practically the same percentage as obtained with Grimm (Table 1). The three remaining lots, though somewhat less susceptible, were not sufficiently so to be considered promising. These results further substantiate the opinion that Provence F. P. I. 34886 did not originate m France. Sixteen seed lots obtained m the several seed-growing sec - tions of Spain and one from Portugal were tested for sus - ceptibility. The average of all lots showed only 3 per cent healthy and 82 per cent severely infected. Similarly, two lots from Hungary, two from Italy, one from Germany, and one from Roumania all proved to be susceptible to wilt. 4 See footnote, rage 8. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">Nebr. Exp. Sta. Research Bulletin 66 10 Two alfalfas widely grown in the Ukranian S. S. R., the one an acclimatized Grimm, the second a variegated alfalfa, reacted to wilt like Grimm. On the other hand two lots of seed from Trans-Caucasia gave a resistance comparable to some of the Turkestan alfalfas. They may have originally been of Turkestan origin. Of four other lots of seed from the European part of the U. S. S. R., three proved to be sus - ceptible, while the fourth in its resistance and growth habits resembled Turkestan alfalfa. So far as the results show the various seed lots obtained in Europe all proved to be sus - ceptible to wilt, with one or two exceptions. These excep - tions resembled Turkestan alfalfa in wilt resistance and growth habits. AFRICAN ALFALFAS Twenty-two seed lots originating in Morocco, two from Algeria, and one from Abyssinia were all found susceptible, averaging 4 per cent healthy and 80 per cent severely in - fected. ASIATIC ALFALFAS — OTHER THAN TURKESTAN It has been previously determined (1, 3, 5, and 6) that alf - alfa originating in the Turkestan S. S. R. exhibits resistance to wilt. Ladak, a variety of alfalfa described by Westover (8), also had its origin in the foothills of the Himalayas, in India. Therefore additional seed lots from Asiatic countries were tested in the hope of finding other resistant sorts. A fairly comprehensive collection of alfalfa seed from China, Manchuria, and Korea was procured from the Division of Forage Crops and Diseases for the wilt tests. In all, over 60 seed lots were included. They all proved to be susceptible to wilt. The great majority were as susceptible as Grimm. Only an occasional lot, showed 20 to 30 per cent of healthy plants. No seed lot was considered sufficiently resistant for retention as a promising alfalfa. This was even true of several lots originating in Chinese Turkestan. For the most part these alfalfas were short and decumbent and had other undesirable growth characteristics. A recent introduction from India, F. P. I. 91588, has shown a high resistance to wilt in the 1932 trials. Its resistance to wilt and its growth habits indicate that it may be an especially promising sort. This lot will be given further trials. Of the ten seed lots from Persia, five proved decidedly re - sistant, three somewhat so, and two susceptible. The five most resistant sorts were F. P. I. 86353, 86354, 86355, 86356, and 86362. Most of these produced a good leafy growth. From field results they seem rather nonhardy and may not be adapted to Nebraska conditions. Further tests for wilt </seg>
            <seg id="p011">Susceptibility op Alfalfas to Wilt 11 and cold resistance are necessary. Two seed lots from Pales - tine were as susceptible as Grimm to wilt. TURKESTAN ALFALFAS A number of miscellaneous seed lots of Turkestan alfalfa were procured in this country when it was first determined that Turkestan seed was resistant to wilt. These lots repre - sented remnants of alfalfa seeded at the Nebraska Station in 1922, on hand in the Division of Forage Crops and Diseases, together with a few samples of Turkestan alfalfa from seed companies. The origin of the seed was, of course, unknown except that it came from Turkestan. It is of interest to note the average resistance of 14 such seed lots and the slight variation in the percentage of infected plants (Table 5). Apparently any Turkestan planting still remaining in Nebras - ka is resistant to wilt, since the wilt resistance of the above - mentioned seed lots is relatively consistent. While there are in Turkestan numerous more or less isolated districts that produce varying amounts of seed, the samples collected by Mr. Westover have been grouped by him as coming from nine districts, representative in a general way of the soil and climatic conditions in that country. These districts are: Tashkent, Alma Ata, Ferghana, Khiva, Chim - bai, Samarkand, Bukhara, Chardzhui, and Ashkhabad. 5 The first five districts lie north of the fortieth parallel of lati - tude, the other four to the south. The fortieth parallel of latitude also forms the boundary between Kansas and Nebraska. Roughly speaking, the Chimbai and Alma Ata dis - tricts lie in the same latitude as southern North Dakota; Tashkent, Ferghana, and Khiva in the same as northern Nebraska and southern South Dakota; Bukhara, Chardzhui, and Samarkand in the latitude of northern Kansas; while the Ashkhabad district lies in the same latitude as Okla - homa. According to the sparse climatic data available, Turk - estan has a climate characterized by rapid and abrupt changes in temperature and a low and variable precipitation with usually a lack of snow cover during the winter — conditions more adverse for alfalfa culture than those prevailing in Nebraska. In the susceptibility tests, both in the field and greenhouse, seed lots from the Samarkand district have consistently ex - hibited the highest percentage of resistant individuals and the lowest percentage of severely infected plants (Table 5). Thus from the standpoint of wilt resistance alone, seed from this district rate* high. In cold resistance, however, it ranks * Personal letter. </seg>

The origin of this seed is unknown except that it came from Turkestan. • See Table 1. about with Nebraska Common, but considerably lower than Hardistan (5). Under Nebraska conditions alfalfa from this district grows fairly rapidly and is quite uniform and leafy, but in some years the spring growth is quite susceptible to leaf spot (Pseudopeziza medicaginis (Lib.) Sacc), yellow blotch (Pyretnopeziza medicaginis FckL), and in the fall to rust (Uromyces medicaginis Pass.). While the growth char - acteristics of all lots are fairly uniform, F. P. I. 84388 is apparently outstanding. The 40 seed lots from the Tashkent district represent 16 different localities including local districts, marts, villages, and individual farms, so that a rather comprehensive test of wilt susceptibility was made of seed grown in this district. In general throughout the various tests, seed lots from this district have consistently ranked a close second to those from Samarkand in wilt resistance. Somewhat larger variations in the resistance of individual lots naturally occurred, since the origin of this seed was more diverse. In cold resistance they ranked somewhat higher than seed from Samarkand and were only slightly less hardy than Grimm (5). Alfalfa from the Tashkent district is, under field conditions, a fairly good grower and quite leafy, but somewhat susceptible to leaf spot, yellow blotch, and rust during some years. While there was </seg>
            <seg id="p013">Susceptibility of Alfalfas to Wilt 13 some individual variation m behavior, F. P. I. 86588, 86641, 86445, and 86658 were the most outstanding. During the spring season of 1929 two carloads of a com - mercial shipment of Turkestan seed assembled at Tashkent were seeded m the Platte River valley. Two infection tests of this seed lot showed 55 per cent healthy, 24 per cent slightly infected, and 21 per cent severely infected. In the fall of 1932, after a thorough search, wilt-infected individuals could not be found m one such Turkestan field, while an adjacent field of Grimm seeded at the same time was severely infected, approximately only a 50 per cent stand remaining as com - pared with a perfect stand of Turkestan. Only three seed lots from the Chardzhui district were tested and naturally a greater variability occurred. When only the percentage of severely infected plants was considered, they ranked with Tashkent alfalfa, but a somewhat lower per - centage of healthy plants was reported. In many respects the growth habits and cold resistance of alfalfa from Chard - zhui are comparable to those of alfalfa from Samarkand. The most promising lot appears to be F. P. I. 84412. Although the seed lots from Alma Ata show a resistance about like Chardzhui, they had a cold resistance comparable to Grimm (5). Among the seed lots from the remaining five districts a variation m the percentage of healthy plants of only 8 was found. It is apparent that so far as resistance is concerned there is not much choice between seed from any of these five districts. They do show, however, a much more pronounced difference m cold resistance. Seed lots from Khiva (including Chimbai) had the highest average cold resistance of any alfalfa from Turkestan (5). Seed from Bukhara had a cold resistance somewhat lower than that of Nebraska Common, while seed from Ferghana and Ashkhabad is decidedly lower m hardiness (5). : On the whole the alfalfa from the Chimbai district is fairly good, uniform, and leafy. Perhaps F. P. I. 84430, 84437, and 84443 are the most promising lots. The seed lots from Khiva, on the other hand, produce a more diverse, shorter alfalfa, with more decumbent and slower-growing individuals. No outstanding lot was recognized m the group, although F. P. I. 84420, 84422, 84423, and 84424 appear to be better than the others. All of these lots originated near Kunya-urgench, located midway between the cities of Khiva and Chimbai. With one or two exceptions the growth habits of the seed lots from the Alma Ata district are somewhat similar to those reported for Tashkent. The two most outstanding lots are F. P. I. 84367 and 86696. No promising seed lots were noted </seg>
            <seg id="p014">Nebr. Exp. Sta. Research Bulletin 66 14 from either the Bukhara, Ferghana, or Ashkhabad districts. Seed from these localities is rather low m cold resistance and is no more wilt resistant than other hardier alfalfas from other districts, so that seed from these districts is not con - sidered of sufficient merit for further trials m Nebraska. All individual lots of seed from Turkestan, irrespective of their origin, have proved to be as resistant to wilt as Hardis - tan, or more so. Peltier and Schroeder (4) have recently pointed out that wilt resistance m Turkestan alfalfa is asso - ciated with certain morphological features, particularly m the root, which inhibit rapid development and invasion of the vital tissues by the bacteria. As yet no lot of seed has been found as hardy as Hardistan, although seed from the Khiva district ranks high m cold resistance. For the present it may be stated that seed lots from the Tashkent and Samarkand districts were the most resistant but have a cold resistance akin to that of Nebraska Common. Seed lots from the Khiva, Chimbai, and Alma Ata districts, while slightly less resist - ant, proved more cold resistant, especially those from the neighborhood of Khiva, although on the whole their growth habits were less promising. Seed lots from the Bukhara, Ferghana, and Ashkhabad districts have shown a lower cold resistance than Nebraska Common and are not recommended for planting m Nebraska. Field tests for wilt and cold resistance, for susceptibility to leaf spot, yellow blotch, and rust, and for productivity are needed before it can be stated definitely which seed lots are superior and which districts m Turkestan will yield alfalfas best suited to the needs of the growers m Nebraska. Where wilt is a primary factor m rapid decrease of stands, there - fore, it is recommended for the present that, when available, Turkestan of known origin be seeded m preference to Grimm and the other highly susceptible sorts.
