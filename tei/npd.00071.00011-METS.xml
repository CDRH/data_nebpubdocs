In case of corresponding fallow areas, however, the plats that were merely scraped to control weeds proved slightly less effective in conserving moisture than did the plats receiving normal cultivations. There was some indication that normal cultivation is conducive to a somewhat increased nitrification rate as compared with mere scraping to prevent weed growth. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">Tillage Practices in Relation to Corn Production T. A. KIESSELBACH, ARTHUR ANDERSON, AND W. E. LYNESS It has been the purpose of these investigations to compare various methods of seedbed preparation, planting, and culti - vation used in raising corn. Data have also been secured con - cerning the effects of intertillage and of cropping upon the moisture and nitrate contents of the soil. The tests have been made on the Experiment Station farm at Lincoln, and have varied from 6to 12 years in duration. The most suitable cultural practices may naturally be expected to vary some - what with local conditions, and local experiences should be considered in applying the results obtained in these compar - isons at Lincoln. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE All comparisons were in multiple-row plats and the outside rows were discarded because of possible border effects. The plat areas ranged from 1/40 to 1/10 acre in size. All tests except those pertaining to seedbed preparation were in dupli - cate. The standard spacing of 3.5 feet between rows and hills was maintained for all checked corn. Corresponding rates were secured with the drilled corn by proportionate spacing of single plants within the row. In the wide-row spacing tests, only alternate rows were planted. This resulted in a stand of one-half the normal number of plants per acre, except where the full number was provided thru restricting the distance between hills to 21 inches. Comparable stands were obtained in all of these experiments by planting the corn at a double rate and thinning in the seedling stage to the desired rate. This eliminated the uncertainties of stand dis - crepancies. The grain yields are on the basis of air-dry shelled corn per acre. Field-cured stover yields were also determined for the seedbed and intertillage experiments. SEEDBED PREPARATION In farm practice corn usually follows a previous crop of corn, small grain, or a legume such as clover or alfalfa. The seedbed is commonly prepared either by plowing or listing and may be accompanied by one or more supplementary treatments with the disk and harrow which are designed to destroy weeds and provide a good physical condition of the soil. The period of such preparation may extend from the preceding fall up to the time of planting in the spring, or the work may be done entirely in connection with the planting. </seg>
            <seg id="p006">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 232 During a 6-year period, 1922-1927, 13 different methods of seedbed preparation were under comparison at the Experiment Station. In 7 of these practices the corn was surface planted in hills on land that was plowed either in the fall, early spring, or late spring, as specified. In the other 6 practices, the seed was drilled in open furrows. These were made either by furrow-opener attachments to the corn planter on early spring plowing, or by listing on land that had had either partial preparation in the fall or early spring or else no previous preparation. A 3-year rotation of corn, oats, and winter wheat was followed. In the years intervening between the corn crops the tillage and cropping practices were alike on all plats. The seedbed was prepared for the oats in this rotation by double disking the corn stubble, and for the winter wheat by plowing the oats stubble 5V£ inches deep in July, with subsequent disking and harrowing. In preparation for the planting of corn, the treatments under comparison were as indicated in Table 1. As an average for the period, all fall treatments were completed on October 2 and the early and late spring treatments on April 2 and May 7, respectively. The corn was grown at the rate of 2 plants per hill, or its equivalent in the case of drilling, and the average planting date has been May 9. SURFACE PLANTING Varying with the soil preparation, the yields from surface - planted corn have ranged from 31.3 to 36.4 bushels per acre as an average for 6 years. (Table 1.) Plowing early in the spring to a 4-inch depth yielded 31.4 bushels, 5^2 -inch depth 32.8 bushels, 7-inch depth 36.0 bushels, and 10-inch depth 36.4 bushels. With the exception of 1926, which resulted in almost a total failure due to drought, there has been a consistent increase in yield of grain as the depth of plowing was increased from 4 to 7 inches. This increase was sufficient to justify plowing at a depth of 7 inches, whereas the additional yield increase from the 10 - inch depth was so slight as to make it impractical when the greater labor cost is considered. Early spring plowing (April 2) 7 inches deep yielded 5 per cent more than late spring plowing (May 7) at the same depth when preceded by early spring disking, and it yielded 12 per cent more than late spring plowing which was not preceded by disking. These results suggest that early plow - ing is more desirable than late plowing even tho the weeds are controlled by early disking. Early spring plowing, 7 </seg>

            <seg id="p008">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 232 of pronounced moisture shortage. This tendency is indicated in these tests by the fact that the total fodder yield from fall plowing was only 5 per cent less than from the spring plow - ing, compared with a 13 per cent reduction for the grain. It is considered that on relatively infertile land where overstimu - lation of vegetative growth is improbable, fall plowing would not be at such disadvantage. It should be borne in mind that fall-plowed ground is more or less unfavorably subject to soil blowing during the winter. FURROW PLANTING Two devices were used for opening furrows: a furrow - opener attachment for the corn planter, and a lister. The furrow openers were used on land plowed 7 inches deep in early spring. There were five different styles of listing: (1) double listing in which the first listing was done in the fall and the ridges were listed out in late spring at the time of planting; (2) double listing in which the first was done early in the spring, followed by splitting the ridges at the time of planting; (3) single late-spring listing on 7-inch fall plow - ing; (4) single late-spring listing on early-spring double - disked ground; and (5) single late-spring listing on ground that received no other preparation than the listing. As a 6-year average the extreme difference between these 6 methods of planting in furrows was only 2.0 bushels per acre. The average yield of these treatments was 33.6 bushels, which is 2.4 bushels less than that from surface planting on land that was plowed 7 inches deep early in the spring, and 0.2 bushel more than the average of all surface-planting prac - tices. Double listing in the spring and single listing preceded by early-spring double disking gave the highest yields and are recommended practices. Compared with single listing in hard ground, the double listing yielded 1.4 bushels more, and the combination disking and listing yielded 0.7 bushel more per acre. Such seedbed treatment supplementary to single listing should proye especially effective in destroying early spring weeds and in improving the physical condition of the soil. The comparative effects upon succeeding crops have not been established. As a 6-year average the best plowing and surface-planting practice has yielded 1.7 bushels more than the best listing practice. In view of the fact that listing can generally be done with a lower labor requirement than plowing and sur - face planting, it appears that the slight decrease in yield from the listing would be offset by the decreased labor cost. </seg>

            <seg id="p010">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 232 weeas are not a serious factor. One decided advantage of checked corn, however, is that it permits cross cultivation, which facilitates more efficient weed control and may be expected to increase yields under weedy conditions. The corn planted with a lister and that planted with a furrow-opener attachment to the corn planter yielded 6 per cent and 9 per cent less respectively, than did the surface planting on early spring plowing to a depth of 7 inches. Corn grown in double-spaced rows, 7 feet apart, with the normal number of plants (3-plant hills every 42 inches) per row, thereby providing half of the normal number of plants per acre, yielded 28.6 bushels per acre. The grain and stover yields were 77 and 71 per cent respectively of those of normal checked corn. In the case of double-spaced rows in which each row contained twice the normal number of plants (3 - plant hills every 21 inches), thereby providing the normal number of plants per acre, the corn yielded 32.1 bushels per acre. The grain and stover yields were 86 and 88 per cent respectively of those of the normal checked corn. Under eastern Nebraska conditions the planting of corn in alternate rows only, even tho the normal number of plants per acre is maintained, will result in a materially lower acre yield and may be regarded as impractical. In a similar test during a 6-year period at the North Platte substation, corn planted in alternate rows yielded 1:3 bushels or 6 per cent less than normally planted corn when the num - ber of plants per acre was the same in both cases. Where alternate-row planting contained only one-half of the normal number of plants per acre, the yield was 5.1 bushels or 24 per cent less than that of normally planted corn. Since the most profitable yields of winter wheat are commonly obtained in central Nebraska following corn, it would seem that double spacing of the rows, as a possible means of facilitating the drilling of wheat, merits further trial in that region. THE RELATION OF STAND TO YIELD RATE OF PLANTING PER ACRE Experiments have indicated that there may be considerable range in the planting rate of corn or the number of plants grown per acre without materially affecting the acre yield of grain. The spacing of plants, in so far as possible, should be governed by the environmental limitations and the type of corn grown. For example, a small or early maturing type of corn which does not utilize the entire growing season should be grown at a somewhat thicker rate than a full-season type. Under eastern Nebraska conditions 3 plants per hill </seg>

Considering the increased labor of husking the greater number and smaller ears produced by an unnecessarily thick stand, it would seem wise to strive toward the minimum stand which will yield satisfactorily As summarized in Table 3, the differences in planting rate affected but sightly the stalk and ear heights, the dates of silking and ripening the shrinkage of ear corn, and the SS2F per , centa S e - O? «» °ther hand the increases in per - centage of lodging and barren plants and the decreases in percentage of 2-eared stalks and suckers were striking and consistent with increased rate of planting. siriKin » ana UNIFORMITY OF STAND Due to various causes, such as irregularly shaped and im - perfectly germinating seed, mechanical imperfections of the planter, unfavorable seedbed, rodent and worm damage and injuries during tillage, it is impossible to acquire a? kbso lutely umform distribution of plants in the field under fSS conditions.

In these experiments 4 cultivations seemed fully effec - tive in the control of weeds. In 1922 two and three cultiva - tions and in 1925 three cultivations were practically as effec - tive as four. Continued cultivation after the " laying by " of corn did not increase the yield in a single year and as a 6-year average yielded 2 bushels per acre less than the 4 normal cultivations. Some benefit might be expected, however, should there be considerable weed growth following the last normal cultivation. These data suggest indirectly that continued late cultivation does not result in additional conservation of soil moisture as has often been assumed.. The effect of the frequency of cultivation on plant develop - ment is also summarized in Table 5. Increases in ratio of gram to stover, stalk height, suckering, lodging, and a decrease m barrenness were found to be rather consistent with increase in the number of cultivations up to 3 or 4 normal cultivations. Weed growth resulted not only in a lower acre yield of fodder but also in a very marked lowering of the grain-stover ratio, shorter stalks, fewer suckers per 100 plants, and a marked increase in barren stalks. MANNER OF CULTIVATION • In comparison with the average yield of 37.2 bushels per acre resulting from 4 normal cultivations at a medium depth, the plat that was merely scraped without actual stirring of the soil yielded 35.1 bushels, while the shallow, deep, and close cultivations yielded 35.8, 38.1, and 36.2 bushels per acre, respectively. It appears from these data that some tillage m addition to the mere control of weed growth thru scraping is advantageous. This may in part be due to reduction in the amount of run-off. The increases of 1.4 and 2.3 bushels per acre from medium and deep cultivation respectively over shallow cultivation indicate that medium to deep cultivation, as done with a 6-shoyel cultivator, is good practice Cultiva - tion as close as possible without destroying the plant yielded 1 bushel less per acre than a medium or normal distance and required greater exertion on the part of the operator. Deep cultivation as done in these tests with a 6-shovel cultivator did not seem injurious to the plant in any respect, as meas - ured by yield. It is a matter of common observation that very deep tillage with a 4-shovel cultivator after the corn has grown to a considerable size is injurious thru excessive root injury It is evident that considerable latitude may be permissible m the adjustment of the cultivator, according to local con- </seg>

With the exception of a slightly increased amount of suck - ering on the scraped plats and somewhat more lodging in the case of close cultivation there appeared to be no relation between the manner of cultivation and the vegetative develop - ment. EFFECT OF CULTIVATION UPON THE MOISTURE AND NITRATE CONTENT OF THE SOIL In order to measure the effect of various tillage treatments upon the moisture and nitrate content of the soil, the percent - age of soil moisture and the parts per million of nitrate nitro - gen (phenoldisulphonic acid method) were determined 4 times annually for both cropped and uncropped portions of those duplicate corn plats that received (1) no cultivation, (2) 4 normal cultivations, (3) 4 normal cultivations with continued late cultivations, and (4) mere scraping. The uncropped portion of each plat was an area 8 hills long by 4 hills wide from which the corn plants had been re - moved in the seedling stage. In the cultivated and scraped plats a thoro fallow was thus obtained during the entire grow - ing season. In the case of the plat receiving no cultivation, however, the weeds were permitted to grow on the uncropped as well as on the cropped areas. Soil samples were taken in one-foot sections to a depth of 2 feet for soil nitrate determinations and to a depth of 5 feet for soil moisture determinations. Composite samples for each of the first 2 feet were made up of 16 systematically distri - buted and rather centrally located cores, 8 in each of the dupli - cate plats, compared with 8 such cores for the third, fourth and fifth feet. The first sampling occurred early in June soon after the plants came up, and the results obtained at this date from both the cropped and uncropped portions are aver - aged to represent the soil moisture and nitrate content at the beginning of the season. Subsequent sampling was done in July, August, and September. The results for the 6-year period, 1922-1927, are summarized in Tables 6 and 7. Annual and monthly rainfall for this period is shown in Table 8. Soil Moisture Content. — The soil moisture content of the upper two feet of soil in June averaged approximately 24 per cent (Table 6) , compared with 21.5 to 22.6 per cent in the third, fourth, and fifth feet. As an average for the 5 feet the moisture content was approximaely 23 per cent. As the season advanced there was a rather gradual decrease in the soil moisture content of the cropped area of all plats during July, August, and September. The average moisture content </seg>
