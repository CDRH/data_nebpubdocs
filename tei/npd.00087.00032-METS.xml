         <seg id="p003">SUMMARY 1. The utilization of nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus was studied with two lots of growing chicks by means of growth and body -analysis experiments. One lot had calcium added to the ration in the form of sulfatc and the .second received calcium carbonate, the additions beinj,' made on an equivalent calcium basis so that the cx - jK-rimt-ntal variable was the source of the calcium. 2. The percentage rate of gain and the gain per grain of nitrogen led were identical in the two lots. .i. ,Vo significant differences were found in the utilization ot nitrogen, calcium, or phosphorus by the birds of the two lots. </seg>
         <seg id="p004">The Utilization of Food Elements by Growing Chicks 111. A Comparison of Calcium Carbonate and Calcium Sulfate as Sources of Calcium C. W. ACKERSON, M. J. BUSH, AND F. E. MUSSEHL . The general field of calcium and phosphorus metabolism has been re - viewed recently by Schmidt and Greenberg (1), the problem as it relates to the calcium requirements of man by Leitch (2), and the mineral nutri - tion of farm animals by Mitchell and McClure (3). A recent review of the calcium phase of poultry feeding is that of Tully and Franke (4). Bethke, Kennard and Kick (5) compared the availability of calcium from various sources and concluded that no differences existed when the various salts were fed to growing chicks at the same calcium intake but on a minimum requirement basis. ..." • In unpublished work at this Station it was found that the growth of young turkeys was slightly but uniformly better when calcium was added as the sulfate than when fed as the carbonate. In view of the fact that in. some localities.gypsum is available at a lower cost than limestone or oyster shells it seemed desirable to test the substitution of calcium sulfate for calcium carbonate in the ration fed to growing chicks. If the sulfate will produce as good results in chick feeding as the carbonate, then it may be substituted for the latter with some saving to the poultryman. The purpose of this study was to observe the effect on the utilization of nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus of supplying the calcium added to the ration as the carbonate to one lot and as the sulfate to another lot of growing chicks. The method of feeding was the same as that used in pre - vious work (6). Conclusions were drawn from food intake, body growth and carcass analysis at slaughter for nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus. PREPARATION OP THE RATIONS The ration used was almost identical with the animal concentrate ration used in earlier work (6). In this instance the difference between the rations fed the two lots of chicks was in the source of the calcium added to the ration, the base and the concentrate portions being the same. Ninety-six and five tenths parts of the ration were mixed with 3.5 parts of calcium sulfate to form the CaSO 4 ration, and with a mixture of 2 parts of cal - cium carbonate plus 15 parts of corn starch tb form the CaCCte ration. The rations were mixed as follows: / . /";-.¦ </seg>

They were hatched trom eggs weighing 58 grams as this weight of egg yields chicks weighing close to 37 grams which is the standard weight of chicks used in these feed - ing experiments. Thirty-six of the chicks, weighing 37±2 grams each, were divided into two lots of 18 each. Three chicks were lost from the CaSO 4 lot during the first few days of forced feeding, but the deaths were attribut - ed to accidental losses due to feeding technique. There were no losses in either of the groups which could be assigned to the rations fed, or the brooding conditions. These lots were fed from November 29 to January 10, thus involving a feeding period of 42 days. The chicks from both lots, identified individually by leg bands, were fed equal amounts of their ration daily. The controlled intake made possible by the pelleted ration fed in the manner described in the earlier papers of this series has been found to reduce the individual variation with respect to gains to a very low value, and eliminates the problem of variable intake of birds. Conclusions drawn from the experimental data are based on growth data and analysis of the entire chicks at the end of the trial. Newly hatched chicks contain, on the average, 0.95, 0.15, and 0.11 gram of nitrogen, cal - cium and phosphorus respectively. These values are substracted from the amounts (ound in the chicks at slaughter which gives the composition of the gain. Knowing the analysis of the ration and the amount fed, the percentage retention of the elements can be readily calculated. Initial, interval, final and net body weights of each chick were recorded.

Analysis of the data by means of weighted squares.of means (Table 4) shows no indication of significant differences. The value of 'F' is 3.69 in the primary analysis of the net body weights, which value falls below the five per cent point of 4.18. Application of the V test for significant differences likewise fails to show any difference. The coefficient of variation with respect to net weight is 4.0 per cent.

The experimental data have been averaged for each lot by sexes and presented in Table 5. Differences in the growth of males and females are apparent, but as was shown in Tables 3 and 4, differences were not found between diets. Jn considering the percentage composition of the chicks and gains it is noted that the values agree in practically all cases. This is likewise true of the percentage rate of gain, and the gain per gram of nitrogen fed. The data of Table 5 are nearly comparable with those of the lot fed the 'Animal Concentrate' ration in a previous study (6), and a comparison shows that the values are in substantial agreement. The retentions of nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus show no differences at - tributable to the variation in the source of calcium.

         <seg id="p008">Utilization of Food Elements bw Growing Chicks 7 CONCLUSIONS I 1 1. When fed at a level of 15 p.ct. of the ration calcium as calcium sul - fate and calcium carbonate were equally efficient in supplying the needs of the chick for calcium. ; jj 2. Thelrate of growth was not affected by the source of the calcium. 3. The i retentions of nitrogen, calcium ajid 1 phosphorus were not in - fluenced by the source of the calcium. | 4. Calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate may be used interchangeably as a source of calcium in the ration for growing chicks. Because of the difference in the calcium content of the two salts itj takes 1.75 pounds of cal - cium sulfate to replace one pound of calcium carbonate in the ration. This fact must not be overlooked in figuring costs andj mixing rations. 1 ¦ . . LITERATURE CITED : 1. Schmidt, C. L. A. and Greeniierg, D. M. 1935. Physio!. Rev. 15:297-434. |. 2. Lgitck, I.
