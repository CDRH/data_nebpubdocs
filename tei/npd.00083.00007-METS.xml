            <seg id="p007">1 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL i ■ ■ '-.■'■.■■ I. ■ • ' j I December 23,1938 To His Excellency, R. L. Cochran, Governor of the State of Nebraska Sir: I have the honor to transmit herewith the biennial report of the attorney general for the biennium from January 7, 1937 to January 5, 1939. The work of my office for this biennium has been as suc - cessful as that of the administration of any attorney general. I want to add that we have not lost an important case. For in - stance, at the beginning of my term of office until December 1, 1938, we disposed of 67 cases in the Supreme Court of Ne - bi^ska. We have won 49 of these cases and lost 7. 11 were disposed of otherwise than by final decision. 22 cases are pend - ing in this court, most of which have had considerable attention. This work has been of a varied and comprehensive nature, and has been of vital importance to the interests of the citizens of Nebraska. My staff has worked efficiently and with devotion to the interest of the state. Onthe average, the members of my staff have taken one-half; of the vacation time allowed to them. The most important work of the office has been the ren - dering of opinions, as these opinions have undoubtedly pre - vented a large mass of litigation. This office has rendered more than 3,000 opinions, some of them requiring extensive legal research and frequent consultations of several members of the staff so that the one who prepared the opinion would </seg>
            <seg id="p008">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL have the benefit of the counsel of the whole staff. We have not been influenced by political considerations in rendering service to the state. This fact is generally recognized. Legislation enacted at the last session of the legislature required an additional volume of work. We have been able to meet all of the demands made upon us and the work of the office is now up to date. We have made every effort to support the validity of the legislation enaced at the last session of the legislature. None of that legislation has been held unconstitutional, except certain parts of Legislative Bill No. 137, where the Supreme Court held in the case of State ex rel English v. Ruback, that : Section 3 of said act relating to sales below cost was indefinite and void. We feel that this legislation can be corrected so as to con - form to the requirements of law. _ My staff has cooperated in every way with the Liquor Control Commission in administering the liquor laws. This has been done with signal success and a minimum of dissatis - faction on the part of opposing parties. Our office has rendered the Secretary of State and Real Estate Commissioner every possible assistance in administer - ing the real estate broker's law and in prosecuting violations thereof. We believe that this law is very salutary and has resulted in a proper regulation of real estate brokers in -Ne - braska. 1 The heaviest work of the office has been in connection with irrigation problems. Many hearings of the interstate litigation between Nebraska and the states of Wyoming and Colorado have been had. The State of Nebraska has almost completed its case. About fourteen thousand pages of test - imony have been transcribed and approximately 563 exhibits have been prepared and introduced on behalf of Nebraska. Last spring the United States of America applied to the Su - preme Court of the United States for leave to intervene as a party. The proclaimed object of intervention was to protect the interests of the United States and various reclamation pro - jects in Scotts Bluff County and in Wyoming. After a hear - ing before the Supreme Court it was ordered that the United States be- permitted to intervene as a party defendant, the </seg>

            <seg id="p010">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. Cochran and Mr. A. C. Tilley.ihead of the Department of Roads and Irrigation, together with the Farmer's Irrigation District of Scotts Bluff County, wherein it claims ownership of return flow or seepage water originating from reclamation irrigation projects in Wyoming and Scotts Bluff County. This is a claim of a very radical nature and of extreme importance to all irriga - tion interests. It is directly violative of the concepts regard - ing return flow heretofore recognized. The trial of this case was had at North Platte last summer but the issues were so important that the court has not decided the case as yet. Ex - tensive briefs were submitted following the trial and the case is at present under advisement. It will undoubtedly be finally decided in the Supreme Court of the United States on appeal by the losing party. Another vitally important case was instituted by the Central Power Company against the Department of Irrigation, and this case was also tried last summer at Kearney in the District Court of Buffalo County. This company has the earliest ad - judicated water right for power and irrigation and the suit was designed to require the irrigation department to make such orders as may be necessary to see that the water rights of the company are complied with and water furnished regardless of the tremendous loss of water in transit, especially during the dry and heated parts of the year. After a lengthy hearing issues were submitted to the court upon written briefs but no decision has been had as yet. Another case of great importance to the irrigation in - terests of the state involved the right of the state to limit the application of irrigation waters to three acre feet per year per acre. After a lengthy trial in the District Court of Scotts Bluff County the state's contention prevailed. Opposing irriga - tion interests appealed the case to the Supreme Court of Ne - braska, where it is now pending. Many other matters involving the administration of the waters of the state for irrigation have been attended to. In fact, a large part of the work of the office has been in respect to irrigation matters-. This office has continued to make every effort to pre - vent the unauthorized and unethical practice of law. We be - lieve that we have disbarred more attorneys for violations ot rules governing the practice of law than has any other admin- </seg>

            <seg id="p012">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL of all elective state officers. This would only be a measure of fairness and will equalize salaries. I strongly endorse the recommendation of my predecessor, William H. Wright, that some provision be made by the legis - lature for revising our statutes. It is very embarrassing to this office in giving advice to find irreconcilable provisions of the statutes on the same subject. I agree with Mr. Wright that a complete revision of our statutes is advisable. One of my chief concerns has been the work of the Board of Pardons and Paroles. J attempted, during the first months of my incumbency, to investigate in advance the cases of pris - oners asking for executive leniency. I found this too great a burden, and especially in view of the fact that the files did not disclose sufficient information, in most cases, and also in view of the fact that the board has no funds with which to secure the services of a psychiatrist who could examine the prisoners and inquire particularly into their prison record and report his tindings. The board has had to rely largely on the recommen - dations of those in charge of our penal institutions. While I feel that we have been justified in so relying; I do not feel that this is a proper system and that the board should have the advantage of the report of an expert. Other states pro - vide for such reports and I believe that if our board had such information it would prevent the liberation of many prisoners who become parole violators. The board should have the benefit of expert knowledge as to the psychological condition of applicants, and this condition is frequently concealed from the keepers of our institutions and cannot be determined by the board in viewing and talking with the applicants. % Together with my staff I have, from the beginning of my term, been greatly concerned about the growth of what I might term a gambling mania among our people. This is not pecul - iar to the citizens of Nebraska, but is prevalent throughout the world. It is largely a moral question. Shortly after assuming office, we had many complaints regarding the operations of a lottery plan called "Bank Night". About 800 moving picture theatres in Nebraska had adopted the plan. The basic principle was being adopted by other lines of business and was also pro - moting this gambling mania I mention, among classes of people who would not otherwise have let the temptation to gamble affect them. This plan was also objectionable because it pro - moted sales of tickets and of commodities on a false basis, and </seg>
            <seg id="p013">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. induced patronage by an appeal to the cupidity of oun citizens rather than because of the intrinsic merits of the commodities sold or the entertainment furnished. We commenced two in - junction actions which have been finally decided in our Supreme Court in favor of the state. At various times many schemes for promoting business by the offer in some form of a reward for patronage has been submitted to me. Some I considered lawful under our laws. Subsequent to the "Bank Night" litigation, I concluded that it was my official duty to suppress illegal race track bookmak - ing, inasmuch as the city council of Omaha had in effect licen - sed such violations of law. We instituted an injunction action in the District Court of Douglas County against 476 defendants. This was in February 1938. 76 bookmaking establishments were operating in the City of Omaha. Anyone who will read the reports submitted to this office regarding race track bet - ting in Omaha will conclude that no other course was possible than to exert the authority of the state to protect our citizens from the encouragement of gambling, apparently sanctioned by the local authorities. This office expended unlimited energy and considerable money in prosecuting this case to a success - ful conclusion in the District Court of Douglas County. We have had cooperation from the County Attorney of Douglas County and from the City Attorney of Omaha. Many heavy fines for violation of this injunction have been inflicted and I feel that this race track gambling is largely suppressed in Douglas County. As a result such form of gambling has large - ly disappeared throughout other localities in the state. Con - stant effort, however, will be necessary to preserve the results already accomplished. Not only is that true but the pending appeal of the original "bookie" injunction case must be presented to the Supreme Court in such a. manner as to affirm the judgment of the District Court of Douglas Count}. A clever attempt was made at the last election to delude the voters of Nebraska into sanctioning slot machines. My office exposed this attempt and when the voters voted on last November 8, the wording of the proposed constitutional amendment was plain and as a result the proposed amendment was defeated by a tremendous vote. It is my hope and belief that I, together with my staff, have accomplished results which will tend to diminish the gambling mania which was de - veloping among our citizens. </seg>
            <seg id="p014">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL This- office has collected $5,529.60 for the general fund, largely as a refund of costs. We have paid out $4,302.00 of our appropriation for Costs and Judgment of $6,805.00. It should be noted that although it appears that the costs and judgment appropriation is depleted, it is more than counterbalanced by funds collected and paid into the general fund. Examination will show that there are substantial favorable balances in all of our funds. I assured you and the last leg - islature that I would exercise strict economy in my use of the appropriations and the results confirm that assurance. Under authority of the Board of Educational Lands and Funds I appointed John G. Tomek to serve the board as special attorney. Aside from doing a large amount of other work for the board, Mr. Tomek has instituted 46 suits for the purpose of collecting delinquent rentals on school lands. To date he has collected $8,746.08 from this source. I consider this an excellent record. Space will not permit my referring to other vitally im - portant litigation conducted by this office. Some of it is now pending. I feel that the citizens of Nebraska have a very in - sufficient knowledge of the work of the office. One has to be a member of the staff to comprehend the volume of work and responsibility. It is not generally realized that the at - torney general must not only attend to a tremendous amount of legal work but also, at times, must exercise his independent judgment in making vitally important decisions. I wish to acknowledge with most sincere gratitude the valuable cooperation of my staff, including Mr. Barlow Nye, Mr. Francis V. Robinson, Mr. Bert L. Overcash, ' Mr. Edwin Vail, Mr. Harry Grimminger, Mr. George W. Ayres and Mr. Paul P. Massey ; also, the assistance of Mr. C. G. Perry, Special Assistant in charge of Irrigation, Mr. Clinton J. Campbell, Counsel for the Real Estate Commissioner, Mr. Robert Flory, Assistant Attorney General, doing the legal work of the Liq - uor Control Commission and also the services of Mr. Milton C. Murphy and Mr. Paul P. Chaney, who for short periods were Assistant Attorneys General. My office has had excellent cooperation from the 93 county attorneys in Nebraska. On our part we have endeavored to render them every service they have asked of us. </seg>
            <seg id="p015">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL • In conclusion I wish to express my gratification in having had the opportunity to be associated with you and the other officials in the state house who have conducted the state affairs of Nebraska during the last two years.

            <seg id="p028">REPORT OP ATTORNEY GENERAL POWER TO APPROPRIATE FEES COLLECTED BY LICENSING BOARDS June 19, 1937 Mr. Henry J. Walker, Secretary Board of Barber Examiners. Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Mr Walker: You request an opinion of this office as to whether L.B. No. 562 is constitutional in appropriating and remitting to the general fund of the state ten per cent of all fees collected by various state boards, bureaus, and commissions, including funds received in such manner "by the State Board of Barber Examiners." You call attention to section 71-2023. Comp. St. Supp. 1935, providing that the "salaries and expenses" and all funds necessary to administer the act relating to the examination and licensing of barbers must be paid from the funds received by such agency and no other state money may be used for such purpose. It would appear from the nature of the "act to regulate the business of barbering" (H.R. 37. ch. 163, Laws 19271 that fees col - lected thereunder are regulatory fees, imposed under the police power of the state and not fees assessed for revenue purposes. Rosenbloom v. State, 64 Neb. 342; State ex rel School District, Lincoln v. Aitken, 81 Neb. 490; State v. Boyd 83 Neb. 829; Gerard v. State, 64 Neb. 468: 37 C.J. 169. So long as regulatory fees are reasonable in amount and not "disproportionate to the cost of issuing the license and the regula - tion of the business to which it applies," no constitutional objection thereto can be raised by licensees. Littlefield v. State, 42 Neb. 223, State v. Standard Oil Co., 100 Neb. 826. In determining whether a regulatory fee is reasonable, the "leg - islature has considerable latitude" in j fixing the amount thereof. Nash-Finch Co. v. Beal, 124 Neb; 835. ■ '•" i ■■ ■_■■■ ■ ■■ It is common knowledge that the salary and expenses of those directly concerned in administering an act, such as the barber act, aoes not comprise all the expenses incurred in connection therewith.

            <seg id="p029">OPINIONS eral government may properly be allocated In part to the enforcement of a specific licensing and regulating act. This is apparently what was attempted to be done by L.B. No. 562 and In so doing we are of the opinion that the legislature acted within the provisions of the constitution. It is also our opinion that the appropriation of ten per cent of such fees by such act does not indicate that fees being received by the various state boards and bureaus are excessive and therefore no objection thereto can be raised by those paying the fees. It might also be pointed out with reference to any further pos - sible constitutional objection to said act that Art. VII, sec. 5, of the Constitution, providing that all "fines, penalties, and license money" shall be used and devoted exclusively to the support of "common schools," has no application to license money derived by a state gov - ernment and such constitutional provision applies only to "license money Imposed by a county or some minor municipal corporation." State ex rel Stevens v. Nickerson, 97 Neb. 837; School District, Omaha v. Gass, 131 Neb. 312. Furthermore, we are of the opinion that the fees provided In said barber act are not "license" fees within the meaning of the constitutional provision just mentioned, but are in the nature of regulatory fees. State v. Wlggenjost, 130 Neb. 450. You also ask, in the event that we believe L.B. No. 562 to be constitutional, the effective date of said act and the Ifunds subject thereto. Said act being passed with an emergency clause became in effect May 7, 1937. With reference to the funds applicable to said act, section 1 thereof provides that the state treasurer shall apply ten per cent of all fees remitted to him by said boards to the "general fund of the State" If and when "appropriated or reappropriated" there - to. Section 2 of said act provides that "all money now In the state treasury to the credit of" said boards and "all moneys hereafter col - ected by each" of said boards during the next biennium "except said ten per cent to be credited from each and deposited in the general fund of the state" are available to said boards "if and when specific - ally appropriated" thereto. From the foregoing provisions of said act, it is apparent that the legislature has made available to the boards and bureaus covered by said act, not to exceed ninety per cent of the money to the credit of said boards on May 7,1937,and thereafter remitted, to the state treas - urer to the account of said boards. Accordingly any and all funds on </seg>

' •.-■•'• BERT L. OVERCASH, Assistant Attorney General. POWER OP STATE TREASURER TO PURCHASE WARRANTS October 18, 1937 Walter H. Jensen, State Treasurer, Building. Dear Sir: We have your letter of October 13, in which you say: "Section 77-2501 provides that the State Treasurer may Invest not more than 60% of the money of said funds in warrants of this state. "Does Article XIII, Section 1, of the Constitution effect the paragraph above?" The provision of Section 77-2501 Compiled Statutes, Supplement 1935, to which you refer is as follows; "*** Provided, that the State Treasurer may invest not more than 60% of the money of said funds in warrants of this state or of any county, or of any Irrigation district situated in the State of Nebraska thereof at par whenever he deems it proper, and carry the same at their value as cash.***" In our judgment, the Section of the Constitution to which you refer, does not affect the provision in question. When the state treasurer, in vests the state's money in warrants, the state is not bor - rowing this money from the owners of the warrants, and does not, thereby, contract a debt. It is, instead, advancing monies to the owners of the warrants and, thereby,' becomes invested with their cl; lims against ' the treasury to be discharged when monies are avail - able. :•■ EDWIN VAIL, Assistant Attorney General </seg>

Dear Sir: You have called to our attention the $1509.00 voucher of the Lincoln Construction Company against the Game, Forestation and Parks Commission for 'remodeling the newly assigned office quarters of that Commission. In view of constitutional and statutory restric - tions against the allowance and payment of claims in the absence of specific legislative appropriations therefor, you ask whether or not the appropriation of funds for the use of the Commission is sufficien - tly broad to authorize the approval of this claim. We think it is. By section 48 of L.B. No. 70 an estimated amount of $320,000.00 has been appropriated to be used by the Commission for certain speci - fic purposes. The appropriation is very broad in its terms. How - ever, as one of the specific purposes mentioned, it includes a provision for payment of items for "maintenance" of the office of the Com - mission. It is necessary that the Commission have suitably arranged offices. Such offices are to be located in the Capitol Building. Space in the building for office purposes having been assigned to the Com - mission, any necessary remodeling or reconstruction work within such space is properly embraced within the term "maintenance", es - pecially in view of the fact that the legislature has not seen fit to break down the appropriation and to allocate a certain specific part of it to be used for the purpose of remodeling/the offices of the Com - mission. . In this connection, we refer you to State v. Iiewis, 119 N. W. (No. Dak.) 1037, a case in which the Supreme Court of North Dakota, relative to a "maintenance" appropriation, had this to say: "Just what the legislature intended to include within the term 'maintenance' is not clear, but it does appear that the same was not intended to cover employees' wages and sal - - ■ arles, fuel and lights, school, supplies, incidental expenses, drugs and. medicines, repairs, beds, and bedding, furniture, and the other items for which specific sums were appropria - ted. There being no specific appropriation for food and clothing of the inmates, it follows that the same was in - tended to be covered by the $11,500 Item appropriated 'for maintenance,'***." • ■ '.«• • So In this case it may properly be said that there being no specific allocation of a separate fund for necessary remodeling of </seg>

EDWIN VAIL, Assistant Attorney General. TRUST COMPANIES— NATIONAL BANKS DOING TRUST BUSINESS July 28, 1937 Mr. B. N. Saunders, Superintendent of Banks, Lincoln, Nebraska. Bear Mr. Saunders: We have your letter of the 26 th in which you call attention to sections 8-215, 8-218, 8-219, and particularly to sections 8-209 and 8-212-B, Comp. St. 1929, as amended, and you inquire whether or not the Department of Banking is authorized to receive from national banks doing a trust company business securities whicE other trust companies operating in the state of Nebraska are required to deposit with your department. It it our opinion that when a national bank assumes to do the general business of a trust company, as contemplated by the federal statutes, in the state of Nebraska that such bank is "organized to do business under this article" and is required to deposit with the de - partment "cash or approved securities in the amounts" specified by statute. Accordingly the Department of Banking should issue its certifi - cate or certificates to each of the national banks in the same manner as certificates are issued to trust companies organized under the laws of the state of Nebraska. Concerning your second question. Is the department authorized under said article to make an examination of national banks doing business as trust companies? There is considerable doubt, for cer - tainly the Department of Banking could not make an examination of the bank as such. It may be that the Department of Banking could make an examination of the trust department in reference to the trusts administered by it and which come within the meaning of </seg>
            <seg id="p034">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL '■[.':■:, ■ y •'-.■■••■■•. the statutes above referred to. However, the statutes have never been so interpreted by any of the officers heretofore administering the Department of Banking and we are inclined to give considerable weight to the interpretation placed upon the law by former officers authorized to administer it and are therefore of the opinion that the Department of Banking has no such power. BARLOW NYE. Administrative Assistant LIQUIDATION OF BANKS BY F.D.I.C. January 24. 1938. Hon. Ben N. Saunders, Superintendent of Banks, Building. Dear Sir: I /■■■■...■;. , . We have your letter of January 19 in which you state that there is a possibility that certain state banks whose "deposits are now guar - anteed by the F.D.I.C. will have to be taken over by your department for liquidation through a receiver. You call attention to Chapter 8 of the 1933 statutes as amended, which provides for the liquidation of state banks by the Department of Banking as receiver, and also to an amendment in 1935 which apparently provides for the appoint - ment of the F.D.I.C. as receiver of any banks in which the deposits have been guaranteed, calling particular attention to sections 8-401 to 8-411, inclusive of the 1937 Supplement, and 8-109 of the same. You inquire concerning the language used in reference to the F.D.I.C stating that it may be appointed receiver by "the appropriate state authority, having the right to appoint a receiver or a liquidator of a banking institution." The F.D.I.C. is empowered to act as receiver. Title 12, sec. 264, sub. j of the U.S.C.A. There is an apparent conflict between the statute which provides that the Department of Banking shall be receiver of banks and the provision providing that the F.D.I.C. may be appointed as Teceiver by the appropriate state authority. However, it is our opinion that the legislative intention as expressed was that the F.D.I.C. may be appointed as receiver and that the rights of the Banking Department to art as receiver are subordinate to the rights of the F.D.I.C. How- </seg>
            <seg id="p035">OPINIONS ever, we call attention to the fact that the Banking Department has no power to appoint the F.D.I.C. as receiver. Nor does any other agency of the government, except of course a court of equity, have such power. This being true, it would be necessary to file a petition in the court of equity having Jurisdiction, praying to have a banking institution adjudged to be insolvent and for the appointment of a receiver. Upon filing of the petition in the- court of equity, that court would have jurisdiction not only to appoint the receiver but to complete the liquidation of the bank through a judicial receiver. This being true, the court would not be bound by the provisions of 8-403 to 8-411 in selecting the receiver, and could, of course, appoint a receiver of its own selection. State v. State Bank of Minatare, 123 Neb. 109. Likewise the Department of Banking would lose all juris - diction over the liquidation of the bank, and the sections of the statute providing for an administrative liquidation would not apply. Title 12, section 264, U.S.C.A. seems to provide for a form of administrative liquidation by the F.D.I.C. which might or might not be adopted by the court of equity having jurisdiction over the judic - ial receiver. Ordinarily, in the absence of statutory requirements, the common law would apply and the court might make such rules as it deemed advisable for the complete liquidation of the bank. BARLOW NYE, Administrative Assistant. CAPITAIi NOTES AND DEBENTURES March 18, 19 8 'i B. N. Saunders, Superintendent, Department of Banking, Building. Dear Sir: We have given your letter of February 19 quite thorough study, and have since been favored with an opinion from Honorable Francis P. Matthews, Omaha Counsel for the R. F. C, of date March 2. We will, therefore, in this letter attempt to take up the different matters proposed to us for attention. The issuance of capital notes or debentures is authorized under Section 8-411 Compiled Statutes, Supplement 1935. It would, of </seg>
            <seg id="p036">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL course, be necessary to provide for the same by amendment to the articles of incorporation of the individual banks which may desire to take advantage of this statutory provision. Although such capital notes or debentures may be issued for the purpose of retiring pre - ferred stock, they would not, in our judgment, constitute capita] stock, although they would form a part of the capital of the insti - tution. This distinction should be kept clearly in mind, as the proper interpretation of the other sections of the statutes depends largely upon this distinction. The first question presented is, as to what effect will be pro - duced when capital notes or debentures take the place of preferred stock. There is no question in our mind but what this will operate to reduce the capital stock of the bank, and this brings up for con - sideration the proper construction of Section 8-153 Compiled Stat - utes, Supplement 1935. This section provides: "Reduction of capital shall be discretionary with the Ee - partment of Banking but shall be denied if granting the same would reduce the capital below the requirements of this article or would impair the security of the depositors." This again brings up the proper construction of Section 8-122 Compiled Statutes, Supplement 1935, which is the only statute in the banking laws which contains any provisions whatsoever as to requirements for capital stock for state banks. Section 8-122, by its terms, applies only to banks organized after its enactment. It was last amended and re-enacted in 1935, and we are quite strongly of the opinion that its provisions were in - tended at that time to operate prospectively. However, since there is no other statute which deals with the matter of requirements for capital stock, and the clause which we have quoted above, from Section 8-153, must have reference to some other section of the banking law, it seems to us that the only pos - sible method of construction would be to construe these statutes to - gether and, therefore, to consider Section 8-153 as prohibiting the reduction of the capital of any bank below the limits set out in Section 8-122. The remainder of your letter has to do with various sections regulating the banking business, and placing restrictions based gen - erally upon the amount of either capital or capital stock. The questions presented are, generally, as to what affect would be pro - duced by a reduction of capital stock effected by the retirement of preferred stock, 4 and substitution of capital notes or debentures. </seg>
            <seg id="p037">OPINIONS There are two provisions in Section 8-122 which were inserted therein by amendment in 1935, the first of which is as follows: "Provided, that each commercial bank hereafter organized, having a paid-up capital stock of less than twenty-five thousand dollars and until its paid-up capital stock is In - creased to twenty-five thousand dollars, shall, in January of each year, file with the Department of Banking upon blanks furnished by it a sworn statement of its average daily deposits for the preceding calendar year; the De - partment shall thereupon Issue an order to each such bank, whose average daily deposits for the preceding calendar year was more than ten times its combined paid-up capital and surplus, to increase its paid-up capital stock to an amount which, together with its surplus, shall equal ten per centum of such average daily deposits; within sixty days after receipt of said order such bank shall, by ap - propriate proceedings, increase its paid-up capital stock to said amount and file with the Department of Banking a sworn statement of its compliance with said order." The second, which was likewise inserted in 1935, is as follows: "♦**A11 commercial banks hereafter organized, having a paid-up capital stock of less than twenty-five thousand dol - lars and until the paid-up capital stock has been increased to twenty-five thousand dollars, shall not accept deposits from any one person, firm or corporation in the aggregate amount of more than fifty per centum of its paid-up capital stock.***" In our judgment, these provisions were intended to operate pro - spectively, and would affect only banks organized subsequent to the date the 1935 amendment became effective. Section 8-122, as amended, also contains a provision that banks with less than $25,000 capital shall not invest in excess of 30% of their paid up capital stock in banking house, furniture and fixtures. We are inclined to the view that this would be a limitation merely upon the original investment. We do not think it would follow that if the amount of capital stock be reduced, the bank should be compelled to dispose of its banking house, furniture and fixtures and acquire other property of less value. The statute does not say so. The purpose was to prevent too large an investment in the first in - stance and not to prevent continuance of the investment as made. </seg>
            <seg id="p038">REPORT OP ATTORNEY GENERAL As to the proper construction of Section 8-136 Compiled Statutes, Supplement 1935; while a capital note or debenture Is by way of being a bill payable, we do not think it comes within the purview of the statute in question. In other words, we do not think capital notes or debentures are such bills payable as are referred to in that section, and in this we are supported by the fact that this section has existed for many years, whereas the statute authorizing the Issuance or capital notes and debentures was not passed until 1935. r We are further of the opinion that in determining the aggregate amount of rediscounts and bills payable under this Section, capital notes and debentures may be considered as a part of its paid up cap - ital, and surplus. In like manner, we think capital notes or debentures may be considered a part of the paid up capital and surplus of the bank under Section 8-150 Compiled Statutes, Supplement 1935, for the purpose of determining the limit of loans made to customers of the bank. We have tried to cover all the sections which are mentioned in your letter, but if we have overlooked any we will be glad to have you call same to our attention. We may add that we concur both with your department and with Mr. Matthews in the advisability of the plan proposed, and be - lieve it will be a benefit to the state banks of Nebraska. We feel that the terms "paid-up capital and surplus" as used in Sections 136 and 150 were not intended to be restrictive, but rather to embrace all capital assets and since the passage of Section 8-411, Compiled Statutes, Supplement 1935, are to be taken and understood as including capital notes or debentures.

Eubank, Board of Control, Lincoln, Nebraska Dear Mr. Eubank: You ask our opinion as to whether a Civil War Veteran's widow, formerly living at the Old Soldiers and Sailors Home, but who remov - ed therefrom and married another Civil War Veteran, whom she has divorced, is entitled to reenter the home as the widow of a deceas - ed veteran. ■■'■.'- The rights of this party to reenter the home in question arises from and is covered by section 80-301, Comp. St. Supp. 1935. This section provides that any widow of any deceased civil war veteran shall be entitled to live in the home in question, if she is in dependent circumstances as therein set forth. There is nothing contained in said statute that conditions such widow's right to reenter this home upon her remaining unmarried. Accordingly it is our opinion that she is now entitled to be ad - mitted to said home for the reason that she continues to be and now is the widow of her deceased husband, notwithstanding her second marriage and divorce, as above stated.

            <seg id="p041">OPINIONS EMGlBn/TY OP WIDOWS TO SOLDIERS AND SAILORS HOME November 23, 1938 Board of Control, State House. Gentlemen: Answering yours of October 25, I believe the admission of mothers and widows of deceased service men to Nebraska Soldiers and Sailors Homes 1b governed by the provision of Section 80-301 Compiled Statutes, Supplement 1937. No limit is placed on the ex - tent of the marriage of the widow whose husband died in the service or was honorably discharged and subsequently died. The ten year limitation applies to wives of service men admitted. Section 80-304 Compiled Statutes 1929 simply prevents a wife becoming eligible to care in the home unless previously eligible. Widows are also sub - ject to the provision in Section 80-301 as to residence, age and de - pendency on charity. I would incline to the view that the Commandant at Grand Island is right and the widow he speaks of should be admitted. EDWIN VAIL, Assistant Attorney General. FEES IN WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COURT CASES January 20, 1938. Mr. Ira H. Moss, Clerk of the District Court, O'Neill, Nebraska. Dear Sir: We have your request for an opinion as to what fees are prop - erly chargeable by a clerk of the district court in workmen's compen - sation cases. You of course appreciate that we are permitted to render official opinions only to state officers and in certain matters to county at - torneys and therefore the views expressed herein are those of the writer only. </seg>
            <seg id="p042">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL There are a few provisions In the Workmen's Compensation Act passed in 1935 specifically authorizing the charging of fees for defin - ite services. These include section 48-177 providing that a fee ot ?1.00 may be charged for the filing of a transcript of judgment in such cases, and section 48-140, providing that a fee of $1.00 may be charged for filing, docketing and j indexing an application for a lump sum settlement. Both of the above sections are in the 1937 Sup - plemont. With reference to other fees, it is my opinion that the language in section 48-175, Comp. Stat. Supp. 1937 is controlling wherein it states "No filing fee shall be charged by the clerk of any court for any service required by this act." It seems to me that the decision of our Supreme Court in the case of Scott v. Dohrse, 130 Neb. 847, supports the conclusion that except as otherwise specifically provided In said compensation act, no filing fees are to be charged by the clerk of any court for any services in workmen's compensation cases. The Scott decision also contains dictum that under our com - pensation law, no costs are chargeable by any district court clerk for any services rendered in a compensation case except as specif - ically provided therein and whether or not such costs comprise what are technically described as "filing fees." In this connection said decision states: "The legislative enactment which is quoted above piovlded that no costs be charged by the clerk of any court for ser - vices rendered in a compensation case, and it clearly in - - • dicated a legislative intention to relieve the parties of the payment of costs except as noted above in a specific pro - vision for one dollar for filing a transcript of a judgment in the office of the clerk of the district court.*** "It is apparent throughout the act the the legislative In - tent and purpose was to furnish a quick and sure method of adjudicating compensation claims without expense to the injured workmen." Following the language of the Scott decision, it is the opinion of the writer that no fees should be charged in a compensation case other than those specifically authorized in said act. BERT L. OVERCASH, Assistant Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p043">OPINIONS CONTINUANCE OF REHEARINGS. January 26, 1938 Hon. Frank M. Coffey, Presiding Judge Nebraska Workmen's Com - pensation Court, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Judge: You request our opinion as to whether the compensation court L U^ D COntinUe a renearln S beyond the period provided for in section 5 (48-174. C. S. Supp. 1937) of the Workmen's Compensation Act. Said section of the statutes provides that when rehearings are requested by either party, the court shall immediately serve upon the opposing party a copy of such application for rehearing and "within thirty days thereafter shall proceed to hear said cause de novo, and a shorthand record shall be made of all testimony and evidence sub - mitted in such proceeding." You advise that the practice has been for you to set down cases for rehearing within the specified thirty days and when it is im - possible to hear same at the designated time, you obtain a stipula - tion of the parties, if possible, for a continuance. You ask whether or not the court is dispossessed of jurisdiction if it becomes imposs - ible to hear such a case with in the specified time and the same is continued without a stipulation of the parties. It would appear that in order to disposses the court of juris - diction in such a situation, the statutes would have to clearly indicate that such was the intention of the legislature. Ordinarily no error could be asserted by either party because of such a continuance. 4 C. J. 961. It has been held that provision in a workmen's compensation act, as to the time and place of trial, must always receive a reason - able and not an- arbitrary interpretation. 71 C. J. 1145. In our opinion It is significant that said act does not specifically provide that the court shall hear the case upon rehearing within the specified time. Instead the act provides that the court "shall pro - ceed" to hear the case within that time. The word "proceed" is de - fined in our standard dictionary to mean "to go on or forward" In 50 C. J. 426 this term is defined as follows: "To act by method; to begin and carry on; to begin and carry on a series of acts or measures, according to certain methods; to carry on some series of actions; •*• </seg>
            <seg id="p044">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Where matters of procedure in courts or actions are invol - ved, to conduct; to begin and carry on an action or pro - ceeding, to begin and carry on a legal action, to commence and carry on a legal process." In several compensation cases, it has been held that the term "proceed" means to "begin." Tocci v. Maryland Casualty Co. 168 N. E. (Mass.) 744; 67 A. L. R. 236; Brabon v. Gladwin Light Co., 167 N. W. (Mich.) 1024. It is our opinion that said act is to be interpreted as requiring a .rehearing of a compensation case to be set for trial within the spec - ified thirty days, but as authorizing the compensation court in a proper case to continue such rehearing upon its own motion. Any other interpretation, in our opinion, is contrary to the letter and the spirit of the act and would tend to create an unnecessary hardship upon both the compensation court and its litigants. With the in - creased volume of cases to be reheard by said court, it is evident that it may become absolutely impossible to begin the actual re - hearing of all cases within the specified thirty days. It is evident that in order for the compensation court to handle rehearings in an expeditious manner, it is necessary for such court to have the right to continue cases upon its own motion in a proper case. This follows since the length of trials upon rehearing cannot definitely be forecast. We are further supported in our conclusion by consideration ot the inherent right of courts to regulate the continuance of matters before them and the discretion which they possess with reference to the setting of cases for trial. In 12 C. J. 828 this principle is stated as follows: "The legislature may prescribe the terms of court at which cases shall stand for trial and forbid a continuance, a dis - continuance, or a nolle prosequi, without cause shown and only with the consent of the court, but the legislature may not fix the time for the trial of a cause in such terms as to exclude the exercise of discretion by the court." It has been held that the Workmen's Compensation Court has exclusive original general jurisdiction in all workmen's compensation matters. Zurich C. v. Walker, 128 Neb. 327; Mclntosh v. Standard Oil, 121 Neb. 92, 71 C. J. 959, 963. It is our opinion that the Workmen's Compensation Court comes within the scope of the rule above quoted from Corpus Juris. </seg>
            <seg id="p045">OPINIONS In our conclusion we have not overlooked the well settled rule that where jurisdiction of a court is specifically provided to exist for a limited time only, Buch jurisdiction is lost on the expiration of such period. 15 C. J. 826. We do not think that this principle applies in the situation presented herein. We further recognize that our supreme court has never passed upon this question and that it would be advisable m the public in - interest for it to do so at the very earliest convenience. While we are confident that the court will sustain the principles herein expressed, we trust that your court will do its utmost to dispose of rehearings within the time stated until our court has had an opportunity to make a definite ruling in this situation. BERT L. OVERCASH, Assistant Attorney General. NEBRASKA WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COURT— PLACE AND TIME FILINGS ARE TO BE MADE May 22, 1937 Hon. Frank M. Coffey, Presiding Judge, Nebraska Workmen's Com - pensation Court, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Judge Coffey: We have your request for an opinion as to where filing of pleadings and papers in the Nebraska Workmen's Compensation Court must be made. You also ask our opinion as to whether pleadings and papers are to be dated as having been filed the day same are received by the clerk of such court in the office of the court in the state house. There does' not appear to be any statutory provision designating a specific location for the Nebraska Workmen's Compensation Court. Section 15 of the act, creating the court (Session Laws, 1935, chap. 57, Sec. 48-176, Comp. St. Supp. 1935) provides that disputed claims when heard before a single judge are to be heard "in the county" in which the accident occurred. Section 26-108, Comp. St. Supp. 1935, provides that the county shall provide "suitable rooms and offices" for the various courts of the state including the "com - pensation court." </seg>
            <seg id="p046">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL The absence of a statute fixing a definite location for the Work - men's Compensation Court is to be contrasted with the statutes def - initely fixing a situs for county and district courts and the supreme court of Nebraska. Sections 2,7-205 and 27-5D1, Comp. St. 1929. and Section 27-303, Comp. St. Supp. These statutory provisions con - stitute a judicial limitation upon the power of such courts to act and function. Shold v. Van Treeck, 82 Neb. 99. We note that the act creating the compensation court provide? in section 7 (48-168, Comp. St. Supp. 1935) that the clerk "shall keep a full and true record of the proceedings of said court, Issue all necsssary notices, and writs, superintend the clerical business of said court, and perform such other duties as the said court may prescribe." This provision would indicate that the legislature con - templated a definite situs being fixed for the compensation court to take care of the (records pertaining thereto. We also observe that section 6 of said act (48-167, Comp. St. Supp. 1935) provides that the "Nebraska Workmen's Compensation Court may adopt all reasonable rules necessary for carrying out the intent and purpose of this act." It has been stated as a general rule that where no specific place for holding court is specified by the constitution ox statutes, court "may be held, at the discretion of the Judge or Judges author - ized to hold it, any where within his or their territorial jurisdiction." 15 C. J. 896. In the case of Uerling v. State, 125 Neb. 374, our court said: "Subject to conformity to constitutional and statutory lim - itations and provisions, courts have inherent power to make reasonable rules for the regulation of. their practice and the conduct of their business. 15 C. J. 901-915." "■■.. ■ ' ; ■ ' It is our opinion that under the statutory provisions creating the Nebraska Workmen's Compensation Court and the authorities above reviewed it is within the power of said court, by its own rule, to fix a single or multiple situs for the maintenance of its own records and for the filing by litigants and others of pleadings and papers therewith. i With reference to the question as to when pleadings and papers are to be recorded as filed in the Workmen's Compensation Court, the following principles from 49 C. J. 651 are controlling: "Handing a paper to the clerk outside his office and ob - taining his indorsement of filing thereon does not consti- </seg>
            <seg id="p047">OPINIONS tute a filing in his office. When a pleading is mailed to the proper officer for filing, the date of its receipt and not the date of mailing is the date of filing, apd if he never receives it there is no legal filing." BERT L. OVERCASH. Assistant Attorney General. SECTION 8, ARTICIJE X, NEBRASKA STATE CONSTITUTION October 5, 1938 The Central Public Power and Irrigation District, Hastings, Nebr. Gentlemen: We beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of August 27 relative to the proper construction of the above section of our state constitution. Section 3, Article X, provides as follows; "No public utility corporation or common carrier shall con - solidate its stock, property, franchise or earnings in whole or in part with any other public utility corporation or common carrier owning a parallel or competing property without permission of the Railway Commission; and in no case shall any consolidation take place except upon public notice of at least sixty days to all stockholders, in such manner as may be provided by law. The legislature may by law require all public utilities and common carriers to ex - change business through physical connection, joint use, con - nected service or otherwise." Previous to its amendment by the Constitutional Convention of 1920, it provided as follows, being then Section 3, Article XI of the Constitution: "No railroad corporation, or telegraph company, shall consolidate its stock, property, franchises or earnings in whole or in part, with any other railroad corpor - ation or telegraph company owning a parallel or com - peting line; and In no case shall any consolidation take </seg>
            <seg id="p048">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL place except upon public notice of at least sixty days, to all stockholders, in such manner as may be provided by law." The object and purpose of the amendment is thus set out in the text of the "Proposed Amendments to the Constitution of the State of Nebraska, as' adopted by the Constitutional Convention, 1919-20", Issued as an official statement of the proceedings of the constitutional convention. - - '-■'■..■ - . ■ ,*■ ' '■ . - - . Explanation: •■.'■■ i "Amended Section 3 permits consolidation of all public service corporations when authorized by the Railway Com - mission and further provides that the legislature may re - quire all public service corporations to exchange business. "The present Section 3 forbids the consolidation of Rail - roads and Telegraph companies only." i In Volume II of the proceedings of the Constitutional Convention, pp. 1859 and 1867, may be found a discussion of the amendment which was proposed to the old' section of the constitution, which was proposal No. 277. It would appear that the consolidation of rail - roads, telegraph or express companies was entirely forbidden by the old section of the constitution. The purpose of the convention seems to have been to remove ' this condition and to permit such consol - idations, but to provide ' for regulation. The term "public utility corporation" was advisably used for the purpose of including corpora - tions other than common carriers doing business affecting the public interest. Nowhere, however, in the discussion is it indicated there was any intention to cover any class of public utilities other than private corporations. That seems to be assumed in the discussion and the only mention there Is of publicly owned utilities is the ap - parent assumption that they are not covered by the amendment. For example, it is stated on page 1864: "Mr. Peterson: I would like to call the Committee's at - tention to one group of utilities that would be outside of the scope of a constitutional restriction. For instance, a lighting company that serves a group of municipalities, reaching into several cities desiring to consolidate with other companies of a similar character or a public utility. No municipality would have jurisdiction over all of it, and if any consolidation should take place at all, it should be sup - ervised, and if supervised this would be the tribunal where it should be." i </seg>
            <seg id="p049">OPINIONS It is also stated on page 1865: "Mr. Votava: The gentleman from Custer, Mr. Taylor, has said that we are giving control over common carriers as to rates, etc., to the Railway Commission, but we have said in that section that there may not be other powers which might be given this Railway Commission. Is there any - thing to prevent the legislature from giving control over rates, capitalization and other things to the Railway Com - mission of other public utilities? "Mr. Taylor: Only as to those publicly owned, and we specifically say they shall not exercise this supervision over these utilities, and we leave privately owned public utilities to the mercy of the legislature." There has never, to our knowledge, been any attempt to invoke this section of the constitution as to municipalities or public corpor - ations. Further, as you point out in your letter: "The public power district which I represent, ari3 other districts of the same general type in Nebraska, were, as you know, organized under the Enabling Act known as Senate File No. 310 (Section 70-701, et seq., C. S. Supp. Neb. 1935). Under this Enabling Act these districts were defined and described as a 'public corporation or political subdivision of this state." "In 1937 certain amendments occurred to the Enabling Act (Section 70-701 et seq., C. S. Supp. Neb. 1937), and in the amendatory Enabling Act the districts when created 'shall be a public corporation and political subdivision of this state.' This Act, as you know, was upheld .in toto in State ex rel. Loseke v. Fricke, 254 N.W. 409. *•♦ "A reading of the foregoing section (Sec. 3, Art. X, Con - stitution) together with the other sections in pari materia, expressly indicates that the legislature was dealing with private corporations issuing stock which was privately own - ed. Section 75-1302 C. S. 1929 defines public service cor - porations. 14 C.J. 91 says 'A "public service corporation" may be defined as a corporation which" although organized «md controlled by private persons and for private profit, is for the purpose of serving the public generally in con - sideration of which it is given the power of eminent domain or granted other special power or privileges.'**'*" </seg>
            <seg id="p050">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL We are, therefore, of the opinion that the Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District, which is a public corporation and a political sub-division of this state, organized under Section 70-701 and following, Compiled Statutes, Supplement 1937, commonly known as Senate File No. 310, is not a public service corporation within the intent and purview of Section 3, Article X of the Con - stitution.

ROBINSON, Assistant Attorney General. LEGISLATIVE BILL NO. 245, COUNTY BUDGET ACT January 8, 1938 Honorable William H. Price, Auditor of Public Accounts. State House. Dear Mr. Price: We have received transmittal of certain letters received by you with reference to the above act. The questions Involved in thest, letters are summarized and answered as follows: 1. Are fees collected by various county officers on and prior to December 31, 1937, to be recorded separately from such fees received during 1938?. Yes. Section 4 of the Budget Act requires that the "means of financing the budget for the current year" shall be "contrasted with the corresponding figures for the last completed fiscal yea* and the year in. progress." As we interpret this provision the term "current year- for which the budget is provided, refers to the same year as the "year in progress." Apparently it Is contemplated that in bud - geting for the whole of the year in which the budget Is prepared, the experience of the months already past during such year is to be set forth in the budget and considered. 2. If the 1937 levy has been expended up to eighty-five per cent and there still remains 1937 claims unpaid, may the county issue general fund warrants after the estimate is made In 1938 for county officers' salaries and actual operating expenses of the county officers? Ordinarily warrants cannot be drawn if there is no cash in the fund until after the actual making of the levy in August. However, it is our opinion that warrants for the purpose stated may lawfully be issued monthly even though there be no cash in the fund prior to the August levy. </seg>
            <seg id="p052">REPORT OP ATTORNEY GENERAL i 3. May a road dragging fund be opened for each supervisor and funds be pro rated by the county treasurer to each of the seven funds so created instead of continuing one fund for all supervisors? Also, if such can be done, may gasoline tax money be included therewith? Legislative Bill No. 158 (Session Laws, 1937, page 565) pro - vides that certain gasoline tax receipts become a part of the county road fund. That fund is provided for in section 39-206, Compiled Statutes, Supplement, 1937. Said section specifically provides that all funds in the county under township organization for such road purposes shall be paid "to the county and shall belong to the said county and shall constitute a county road fund," and shall be "ex - pended by the county board for the benefit of all the county roads." It is our opinion that separate supervisor accounts for such road funds cannot be created. While the county board may use their own system of expending these funds, the law contemplates that all such money will be spent where needed and where it will do the most good. There is nothing in the law that will justify a division of any such money by the supervisor districts. 4. If the county general fund at the time of the county es - timate in January has an unexpended balance of $40,000 and the estimated expenditures for the ensuing year will total $75,000, will the actual levy in August be the difference between said sums or $35,000? Assuming that the said unexpended balance of $40,000 is not en - cumbered, it is our opinion that the levy made in August in the sit - uation stated would be such as would be calculated to raise the sum of $35,000. We are returning herewith letters forwarded to us. BERT L. OVERCASH, Assistant Attorney General. LKGAMTY OP COUNTY TREASURER CARRYING WARRANTS IN CASH ACCOUNTS August 10,1937. Hon. William H. Price, Auditor of Public Accounts, Lincoln, Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p053">OPINIONS Dear Sir: You advise that the county treasurer's office of Keya Paha county is carrying in its cash fund warrants drawn upon the county road fund in the amount of $4,265.47; county bridge fund, $1,997.43; and county general fund, $2,258.25, a total of $8,521.15. You advise that these warrants are dated from December 17, 1919, to January, 1923, and that these warrants have been wholly disregarded in mak - ing subsequent tax levies. You ask whether this practice is legal and, if not, who is liable therefor, and whether a judgment may be secured upon these warrants as a basis for levying a special judg - ment levy. Tt is clear that under our statutes the general and special funds of counties are separate and distinct and warrants in payment of valid claims are to be drawn upon, paid from, or registered against the "proper fund" therefor and no other fund. Sections 77-2401, 2402, 2403, 2404, Comp. St. 1929. There is no duty or right on the part of the county treasurer to use general funds to pay or take up warrants drawn upon special funds. Hall v. State, 54 Neb. 280. Furthermore, warrants can be paid out of the specific funds upon which drawn only when payment therefor is budgeted and provided for in advance, and a "county warrant issued against the general fund of a certain year is not payable out of the general fund of a Bubsequent year." Mann v. Clark, 79 Neb. 263. It is the duty of the county treasurer, specifically enjoined by statute, to handle the funds of the county in the manner above de - scribed. Section 26-1301, 1302, Comp. St. 1929. The official liability of the county treasurer and his bondsmen has been defined as follows: "For all wrongful acts or omissions of a public officer within the limits of what the law authorizes or enjoins upon him as such officer his sureties are liable." State v. Moore, 56 Neb. 82 Blaco v; State, 58 Neb. 566 We are of the opinion that the fiscal practice above described is unlawful and that the officials responsible therefor and their bondsmen are liable in an appropriate action. </seg>
            <seg id="p054">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL, We do not think that the county is in a position to obtain a judgment against itself upon either of these warrants ' in order to thereby make a special judgment levy. Whether the payment of such warrants can be made otherwise will depend upon the fiscal situation of the county, which is not adequately disclosed to us at this lime. BERT L. OVERCASH. Assistant Attorney General. POWER OF COUNTY ASSISTANCE BOARDS TO APPOINT PERSONNEL August 17, 1938 Mr. Neil C. Vandemoer, Director, Department of Assistance, State House, Lincoln. Dear Mr. "Vandemoer: Reference is made to a letter received by Mr. Eubank, a member of the State Board of Control, dated August 4, 1938, from Frank Bane. Executive Director of the Social Security Board. Mr. Bane called attention to the fact that section 2 (a). Title I, of the Social Security Act provides in subdivision (3) that a state plan for old age assistance must either provide for the establish - ment or designation of a single state agency to administer the plan, or provide for the establishment or designation of a single state agency to supervise the administration of the plan. In submitting this state's plan, the opinion of the attorney general was submitted in support thereof and in said opinion, dated August 11, 1937, the following statements were made: "I. That the State Assistance Committee is authorized to formulate manuals of instructions and to establish rules and regulations for the supervision of county assistance com - mittees in respect of all essential details of procedure and administration. This, in our opinion, would include the right and duty to make reasonable rules for the purpose : of the establishment of personnel, standards to be observed In the selection of employees for the purpose of the admin - istration of the laws in question within the counties, but </seg>
            <seg id="p055">OPINIONS it is not within the province of the state assistance com - mittee to select personnel for the counties, nor to re - quire the counties to appoint persons whom they may des - ignate. "2. The standards prescribed by the state assistance com - mittees must be reasonable and not arbitrary. They should have some regard to the differences In situation between counties as to the amount of population and number of relief cases to be served, and the amount of funds which will be distributed. The purpose of the .regulations should be primarily to promote efficiency rather than to require any arbitrary standard in the individual." Mr. Bane says in his letter, "The Attorney General has now in - terpreted sections of the law which provide that a county assistance committee 'may employ Buch clerks and assistants as may be nec - essary to enable it properly to administer Its duties,' as not limiting a committee in the selection of its employees 'to persons who have beeu certified by the Board of Control as competent to perform such duties.'" Mr. Bane further says, "We think this opinion is at variance with the Attorney General's opinion of August 11, 1937, which up - held the o-ight of the Board of Control to enforce compliance by the county agencies with rules and regulations established by the state agency." Reference has also been made in conferences with representa - tives of the Social Security Board and your office to a letter written by the attorney general to Mr. E. F. Margaret, Director of Assistance of Douglas County, dated July 27, 1938, in which the opinion was expressed that the county board might exercise its independent judg - ment according to any standards that it might adopt in selecting its employees. We have been asked to clarify these opinions to the end that a satisfactory response may be made by you to Mr. Bane. We think the difficulty, which has arisen, arises largely from the fact that the controlling consideration in the letters of June 30th and July 27, 1938, was to make it clear that the selection of per - sonnel in the various counties lay exclusively with the county boards and that the law did not contemplate that the State Assistance Board should interfere with the free exercise of that right by the county boards. This, of course, was wholly covered in our '.etter of August 11, 1937, in which we expressly say: </seg>
            <seg id="p056">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "it is not within the province of the state assistance com - mittee to select personnel for the counties, nor to require the counties to appoint persons whom they may designate." We take it that the Social Security Board has no quarrel with this statement, inasmuch as it was contained in the opinion upon which the state plan was approved. Further in subdivision (5) of section 2 (a), Title I, of the Social Security Act, the matter of selection, tenure of office, and compensation of personnel is expressly excluded from the require - ments for the state plan, which are required thereby to be submitted to the Sbcial Security Board for approval. It is undoubtedly true, however, that it was the intention of the Social Security Act that the Social Security Board should have a single agency to deal with in each state, to whom it might look to see that the personnel standards within the counties were properly maintained. In like manner, as we pointed out in our letter of August 11, 1937, our own legislature has given the State Asslstan e Committee general superintendence and direction of the Social Secur - ity acts effective in Nebraska, and, as we stated therein, we think that the State Assistance Committee may prescribe reasonable qualifica - tions for personnel and that th&lt;i counties in making their selection may be required to conform to those standards. This does not mean, however, that the State Assistance Com - mittee shall select the personnel or that they may establish a register or list of eligibles and compel the counties to select their help there - from. If the counties through voluntary cooperation agree with the state board to abide by such method of selection, the same would, of course, be unobjectionable; but if any one or more counties see fit to pursue some Independent method whereby personnel is selected, having the qualifications prescribed by the state board, we think they are well within their rights. We believe our conclusion; to be altogether logical. If the county boards select personnel which is inefficient and incompetent, the state committee should and does have the right to Insist upon the dismissal of such personnel j and the employment of competent persons to the end that the state and federal laws may be fairly administered. However, so long as the committee selects competent people, who comply with reasonable standards, which the state board ■ may establish, we think they may do so in any way they choose. Stated more concretely, the system which the state board is seeking to put into effect) whereby a register of eligibles will be </seg>

We did not know that the same was in effect until after it had been placed in operation. It has been represented to us that nil except three or four counties are voluntarily cooperating in such system. If so, we would see no objection to their continuing to do so. As to the counties which do not desire to cooperate, we think they have the right under our law to select their personnel by any means they may see fit, subject to the right of the state board to prescribe reasonable qualifications, which the personnel employed must satisfy. We believe that thus interpreted and applied our state plan con - forms to the requirements of the Social Security Act. We trust that we have clarified the opinions in question to which reference has been above made. EDWIN VAIL, Assistant Attorney General POWER OF COUNTY BOARD TO FIX BOND OF DEPUTY COUNTY TREASURER , December 17, 1937. Mr. Farley Young, Deputy County Attorney, Lancaster County Court House, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Young: You recently inquired of this office relative to the power of the county board in Lancaster County to determine the amount of bond to be posted by the deputy county treasurer in Lancaster County. Section 12-120, C. S. Nebr. 1929, provides as follows: "Deputies shall, except as otherwise specifically provided, give bond in the same manner and for the same sum as their principals." it would appear ' from the above, inasmuch as deputy county treasurers are not specifically mentioned in other sections of the statute, that such deputies must give the same amount of bond as </seg>
            <seg id="p058">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL thie county treasurers. It would therefore seem that the county board is without discretion to fix a bond In a different amount than that already fixed for the county treasurer. HARRY GRIMMINGER, Assistant Attorney General. RIGHT OF COUNTY JUDGE TO CONTRACT WITH COUNTY February 16. 1937 Mr. Frank Fischer, County Judge, Valentine, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You ask for an opinion from the attorney general's office as to whether you, while you are county judge, have a right to enter into a contract with the county for the burial of those whose funeral charges are to be paid by the county. in answer to your question, I will say that in my opinion the statute makes it unlawful for you to enter Into such a contract with the county. Sec. 26-130, Comp. St. Neb. 1929, reads as follows: "No county officer or county surveyor shall In any manner, either directly or indirectly, be pecuniarily Interested in or receive the benefit of any contracts executed by the county for the furnishing of supplies or any other purpose; neither shall any county officer or county surveyor, furnish any supplies for the county on order of the county board, with - out contract." You will observe that the statute says that no county officer shall be directly or indirectly interested in or receive the benefit of any contract for the furnishing of supplies or any other purpose. The phrase "or any other purpose," It occurs to me, would clearly cover a contract for the burial of those persons whose funeral charges are to be paid by the county. I think it was intended to emphasize the fact that a county of - ficer could not contract with the county for the furnishing of sup - plies or for any other purpose and it makes the inhibition just as strong against the making of a contract with the county for any other purpose as it does against the making of a contract with the county for the furnishing of supplies.

            <seg id="p059">OPINIONS PARTICIPATION OP COUNTY IN CONSTRUCTION OP HIGHWAY (STATE) March 23, 1937 Mr. Carl E. Peterson. County Attorney, Hayes Center, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Peterson: You say that a part of the highway No. 68, in your county, which was graded a number of years ago, is lower in the center than the abutting property because of erosion. You also say that negotiations are pending 1 between the county commissioners of Hayes County and the Department of Roads and Irrigation for the permanent improvement of this highway. You ask our opinion as to the legality of your county and its officials par - taking iu the project of improving this highway. Road districts are not political entities and have no corporate or property rights or powers. The authority relating to matters of public highways devolves upon the township and counties. Town of Denver v. Myers, 63 Neb. 107. A road overseer, under chapter 39, article VI of the Compiled Statutes is subject to the supervision of the county board. It would seem, therefore, that the essential question presented by you is whether the county has the right and power, acting through its proper officers, to enter into the arrangement suggested. Article XIV, chapter 39, of our statutes, as amended, deals with state highways, their construction and maintenance. These statutes, as shown by the decision in Saltzgarber v. Morrill county, 111 Neb. 392, formerly provided that the counties themselves were to main - tain the whole of the state highway system under an arrangement with the state for payment for work done. This arrangment was later changed by a series of amendatory acts, reviewed in Porter v. Lancaster County, 130 Neb. 705, to place the duty of maintaining the whole of the state highway Bystem upon the Department of Public Works. It is to be noted that notwithstanding the shift in responsibility resulting from these amendatory acts, a number of old statutes relat - ing to the discharge by counties of its former duties in this regard, remained upon the statute books and have never been superseded. For example, sections 39-1406 to 39-1411, Comp. St. 1929. </seg>
            <seg id="p060">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL " ■•■■ ' \ The present duty of maintaining the whole of our state high - way system is fixed upon the Department of Roads and Irrigation by section 39-1404 of the statutes as amended In 1933 and 1935, which contains the following provision: "provided further that nothing in this section shall be con - strued to mean that the Department of Roads and Irriga - tion shall be liable for maintenance caused by repairs or replacements to water mains, sewers, gas lines, or other street or public improvements which are placed beneath surface of the streets or pavement thereon, or for snow removal or for any other maintenance except that repair caused by the natural wear and tear of traffic thereon." Prior to the 1933 amendment to the above section, it also con - tained a provision expressly authorizing the counties to enter into agreements with the Department of Public Works for the maintenance of state highways. Repeal of this part of such statute appears to be of no signific - ance in our present inquiry, since the question presented is not with reference to a matter of maintenance only but with reference to a matter of construction and Improvement of state highways. With this view, section 39-1412, Comp. St. 1929, v.hich reads in part as follows, is in point: "Funds for the construction of the state and federal high - way systems shall be derived from such state revenues as may by law be provided. Counties may, if they have funds available, assist with such funds in the construction of any part of a state or federal highway in such county and when such county funds are used, bids shall be received and con - tracts awarded." It is observed in this connection that the funds paid by the state to the counties from gas tax (Sec. 66-411, Comp. St. Supp. 1935) are paid to the counties with no strings attached that would prevent Buch fund, or any part thereof, from being used for road construct - tion or improvement. The broad powers of the county board is reflected in Sec. 39-101, Comp. St. 1929, which reads as follows: "The county board has a general supervision over the public roads of the county with power to establish and maintain </seg>
            <seg id="p061">OPINIONS them as herein provided, and to Bee that the laws In relation to them are carried into effect." The foregoing indicates quite clearly to our mind that your •county has legal authority to participate in the improvement mention - ed, under the arrangement suggested. In arriving at this conclusion we have not overlooked the case ■of Lynn v. Kearney County, 121 Neb. 122, holding that counties are without power, express or implied, to contract with townships, where - "by, for an agreed consideration, the county will construct and main - tain township roads. The principle and reasoning of this decision is not inconsistent with our conclusion herein. We feel that the work contemplated herein by your county is not strict maintenance work within the definition thereof in the quoted language from section 39-1404, and that, therefore, such work may properly be done by your county and its funds used there - for in conjunction with the suggested work of the Department of Roads and Irrigation.

Are we, Valley County, stuck in accordance to law to help rebuild or repair it, since there was no agree - ment between Valley and Custer counties when this bridge was put in. Please advise soon."

These ,cases uniformly hold that one of two adjoining coun - ties may call on the other to contribute to the repair of such bridgt. They further hold that a county failing to enter into a contract for such repairs, upon specific notice, is subject to suit for Us share of the neessary costs. These case* hold that such bridges are a parl of the public road system and the question of equal use by the citizens of the counties, or which county originally built the bridge., has not been treated as material. Jt is, therefore, our opinion that Valley County is, upon proper notice, liable for its proportionate cost of such repairs even though Custer county originally paid for the construction of the bridge in question.

Section 26-2111 Compiled Statutes, Supplement 1937, provides as follows; "The county board may, during the fiscal year, make addi - tional appropriations or increase existing appropriations to meet emergencies in case of unexpected court costs or ep - idemics, floods, fires or other catastrophies, and funds, there - for to be provided from unappropriated revenues, if any, or from temporary loans.*** It will be noticed, however, that the emergencies covered by this section are confined to certain specified catastrophies or others of like nature.

Dear Mr. Davis: We have your letter of the 7th in reference to section 26-119, as amended, found in the Compiled Statutes Supplement for 1937, which reads in part as follows: "•** within ninety days from and after a time when any materials or labor, which forms the basis of the claim, shall have been furnished or performed* •*." </seg>

The service was performed for one patient and was a continuous service. The second claim to which you refer is that of a lumber dealer for -lumber furnished periodically, the last item purchased being within the ninety day period. It is our opinion that the statute means that the claim must be filed with the commissioners at a time within ninety days after the last item of material was furnished or after the last item of labor was performed, where the materials furnished were part of the gen - oral running account or where the labor performed was a part of the continuous piece of work performed for the county.

Dear Sir: We have your letter of the 28th in which you inquire whether an instrument which has been presented for filing 1 and recording but which has not actually been recorded, can be withdrawn by the person presenting 1%, prior to the indexing and recording of the same. As we understand the law, the filing consists of the certificate of filing being placed on the instrument by the register of deeds.

However, the pur - posoa sought to be accomplished by the law in this regard have been accomplished when the instrument is properly filed. Therefore, we do not understand how the instrument may be withdrawn.

NO. 499 — DAIRY ACT. June 3, 1938. Mr. A. L. Haecker, Chief, Department of Agriculture, Lincoln, Nebr. Dear Mr. Haecker: This refers to our recent conversation pertaining to violations of the dairy act and the availability of the remedy of revoking and can - celing licenses for such violations. It ie recognized that the welfare of the dairy industry of this state demands strict and uniform compliance with our laws pertain - ing thereto. The benefits to our producers possible under the higher standards specified in the above act can be (realized only by full and complete cooperation by everyone and by the entire removal from the dairy business of those who selfishly attempt to sacrifice the public interest. After some consideration we are convinced that the power be - stowed upon you as chief of the Bureau of Dairies, Foods and Drugs under said act to revoke licenses issued thereunder offers the most expeditious and effective method of dealing with violations of this act. Section 3 of thiB act provides that you may "withhold a license" where individuals applying therefor are unable to pass an examination, or where such a license should not be Issued for other just reasons. Said section also authorizes you to cancel and revoke licenses, as pro - vided therein, upon failure to comply with £he requirements of said act. You may also instead of completely revoking a license, place certain Individuals upon probation for a period of six monihs for violations. In addition to the powers provided In section 3 of said act, you are given broad powers under section 1 of the act to promulgate </seg>
            <seg id="p068">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL •fauch reasonable rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary to enforce promptly and effectively the provisions of this act." The power to revoke and cancel licenses, given under acts of this nature, have been uniformly sustained by the courts. Only a few weeks ago, the supreme court of Kansas, in the case of R. H. Limpp, doinjs business as the Liberty Cream Station v. H. E. Dodge, State Dairy Commissioner, 146 Kan. 948, 73 Pac. (2d) 1001, sustained the right of the said dairy commissioner to cancel cream station li - censes for violations of the dairy laws of Kansas, which in substance are identical to ours. We, therefore, suggest that you bring to our attention any viola - tion of our dairy laws justifying revocation or suspension of license, «}nd we will promptly prepare and serve the required notice upon such individual, as provided in said act. In connection with the enforcement of said act and obtaining ev - iience of violations thereof, we think your department should con - tinue to exercise the authority bestowed upon you by section 4 (81 - 3 010) empowering your inspectors to examine all the records, equip - ijaent and products kept in connection wfth the operation of any cream buying station. This section also grants authority: "(2) To examine, under oath or otherwise, any person whom he or they may believe has knowledge concerning the un - lawful operation of any creamery, butter factory or place where such milk, cream or butter is produced, stored, bought, sold or kept for sale or transportation. (3) To issue sub - poenas requiring appearance of witnesses and the produc - tion of books, papers, reports and records, and to administer oaths with like effect as is done in courts of law in this state. Any person who hinders or prevents such access or ■who refuses to sell or deliver to such authorized agent shall be deemed guilty of a violation of this Act. Any district or county court shall have power, upon the application of said Chief of Bureau to issue any necessary writ to compel such witness or witnesses to appear before the Chief of Bureau of Dairies, Foods and Drugs to give testimony upon such matters as shall be lawfully required by such" Chief of Bureau and said court shall have power in case of -refusals, to punish for contempt, as in other cases of refusals to obey the orders and process of the court."

Dear Mr. Kelly: In your letter of May 3 you ask whether or not a candidate for public office who has filed for an office or who is expected to file for the office can lawfully give away such Items as blotters, advertising pencils, matches, tally cards, score pads, baseball score pads, oil change reminders, key cases for car keys, reflector plates, metal and paper signs, rulers, whistles, cloth caps, arm bands, calendars and other items of such nature for campaign purposes, all of which bear advertising of a political nature. It has been held that one may be a candidate for office although he has not yet filed for the office, and that the word "candidate" does not necessarily apply only to one who has made a proper filing as a candidate in the election. We call your attention to section 32-2001, Comp. Stat. Neb. 1929, which makes it unlawful for a candidate for any public office to pay out, give or contribute any valuable thing for the purpose of promoting his nomination or election. In deciding whether or not the items specifically mentioned in your letter violate the terms of the statute, you would have to ascertain whether or not any one of these items waB a valuable thing. Obviously pencils, matches, tally cards, score pads, baseball score pads, oil change reminders, key cases, reflector plates, rulers and cloth caps are valuable things. Whether or not a blotter or an arm band or a whistle is a valuable thing is questionable. Calendars are perhaps not valuable things within the meaning of the statute. </seg>

Section 2 of Article VI of the Constitution of Nebraska pro - vides in part that: "No person shall be qualified to vote who***has been con - victed of treason or felony under the laws of the state or of the United States, unless restored to civil rights." To the same effect is section 32-103, Comp. Stat. 1929, which provides in part that: "No person shall be qualified to vote who* ••has been con - victed of treason or felony under the laws of the state or of the United States, unless restored to civil rights." Section 2 of Article XV of the Constitution is as follows: "Any person who is In default as collector and custodian of public money or property shall not be eligible to any office of trust or profit under the constitution or laws of this state; nor shall any person convicted of felony be eligible to office unless he shall have been restored to civil rights." Section 29-112 C. S. 1929, provides in part as follows: "Any person sentenced to be punished for any felony, when sentence shall not have been reversed or annulled, shall be deemed incompetent to be an elector or juror, or to hold any office of honor, trust, or profit within thiB state, un - less**'restored to his civil rights and privileges:***." When the foregoing statutory and constitutional provisions are taken into consideration In connection with the present status of Mr. Jurgensen as adjudicated by the Supreme Court of Nebraska, it is apparent, first, that Mr. Jurgensen has been convicted of a felony, second, that said conviction has not been reversed or annulled, and third, that so long as Mr. Jurgensen's present status remains un - changed and so long as he is not restored to his civil rights, he is neither a qualified elector of Nebraska nor is he eligible to hold any office of honor, trust or profit within the state. The word "eligible", when used with respect to aspirants for public office, relates both to the aspirant's capacity to be elected or. chosen to office and also to his capacity to hold office.

We quote the language of the court, taken from page 78 G of the opinion: "The term 'eligible,' as employed In the constitution, should be given its plain and ordinary signification, and when so construed there is no escaping the conclusion that it means capable of being elected or chosen. Neither the framers of the constitution, nor the people in adopting it, intended i to permit a person to be elected to a public office who, at the time, was disqualified from entering upon the duties thereof, and run the risk of removal of the disability be - tween the day of election and the commencement of the official term." ■■'•'. ■ ' "■'''.''" ' i It is therefore our opinion that Mr. Jurgensen is disqualified for filing for the office of Lieutenant Governor, that you should reject his tendered filing, and so advise him, and that you should not certify his name as one of those entitled to be voted for for that office to the county clerks of the state as contemplated by section 32-1127, Corap.

Dear Sir: You inquire as to the proper method of selecting candidates to county conventions of each political party. Section 32-1110, C.

It is also made the official canvasser's duty to deliver to the temporary secretary of the convention the roll, properly certified, showing the name and address of each delegate to such convention. Section 32-1173, C. S. 1929 provides that if any precinct should fail at the primary to elect its quota of delegates to the convention, then the convention itself shall have power to select such quota of delegates from the voters of said precinct, and in like manner to fill any vacancy that may occur. These statutory provisions, we believe, point out clearly the proper manner for the selection of delegates to such conventions. You also ask whether or not' an individual who makes a per - sonal filing as a candidate for delegate to the county convention must pay ihe $5.00 filing fee prescribed by section 32-1123, C. S. 1929 for aspirants for county, legislative and city offices. It is our opinion that a delegate to the county convention is neither a county nor a legislative nor a city officer, and that there - fore there is no provision in the statute which requires that he pay any filing fee at the time of his filing.

Perry, Assistant Attorney General, Bridgeport, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Perry: I have your letter of September 12 in which you advise that a write-in candidate on the Democratic ticket for county treasurer in the recent primary election failed to file. his acceptance of such nom - ination within the proper time, and that the! County Democratic Com - mittee may decide to fill the vacancy by naming the write-in candi - date. You Inquire as follows: 1. May the write-in candidate file his acceptance after the ten day period, as provided in Section 32-1164 Compiled Statutes of Ne - braska 1929? </seg>
            <seg id="p075">OPINIONS ?•. May the county committee nominate a candidate for county treasurer in view of the fact that there is a vacancy on the ticket? 3. If the county committee can fill the vacancy, can such com - mittee name the write-in candidate who has failed to accept within the proper time? Relative to one above, it is my opinion that the acceptance of nomination must be filed by the successful candidate within the time prescribed in Section 32-1164 Compiled Statutes of Nebraska 1929, and that such period cannot be extended for any reason. As to question 2 above, it is my opinion that a vacancy on the ballot has arisen on account of the failure of the write-in candidate to file his acceptance within the period provided by law. and that that vacancy may be filled by the County Democratic Committee as is provided in section 32-1132, C. S. 1929. The. last sentence of said section, to the effect that when a political party fails to nominate a candidate at a primary, the place shall thereafter remain unfilled unless filled by petition, is not applicable in the case referred to It cannot be said that the party failed to nominate a candidate at the primary. A candidate nominated by write-in votes at a primary Is Just as much the nominee of the party as is a candidate so nom - iated who had filed for the office and whose name appeared on the ballot. Section 32-1162 provides in substance that the person receiving the greatest number of votes at a primary, if that number equals o% or more of the entire vote cast by his party in his district at office^ mary eleCtiOn&gt; " Sha11 be the « an &lt;"date of that party for such As to your third question, it Is my opinion that, if the County Central Committee so desires, it can fill the vacancy on the ballot by nominating as its candidate the individual who was nominated by write-in vote at the primary and who failed to accept such nomin - ation in the proper time, or by naming any other individual it may select, provided such individual affiliates with the proper political party and is otherwise qualified to assume the office for which he is nominated. This is true notwithstanding the language of sectiou 32-1108, C. S. S. 1937. providing in substance that a person who has been a candidate for an office at a primary and defeated, may not be a candidate by petition or certificate of nomination for the same office at the ensuing general election. That language cannot be construed as applying to a person whose name has been written in on the ballot at the primary. He cannot be said to have been a candidate at the </seg>

'•.•..,'.' ■ .''■■'.'' '.''■ .■.':'• '■&lt;■' In reply to your letter of June 9 in reference to the application for nomination for state office in the name of and filed by "Roy L. Marsh", 3172 Dodge Street, Omaha, Nebraska, in which you state that through business transactions and dealings with this party cov - ering several years' time, your office knows the name of the party to be "LeRoy E. Marsh", and that you have caused the records of the Douglas County election commissioner to be investigated, and that these records show that he is now and always has been registered under the name of "LeRoy Edwin Marsh." You inquire whether or riot your office will be justified, in refusing to accept this filing. From the statute it is obvious that the name of the candidate must be given in the petition or application filed for or on behalf of the candidate. The Question then arises as to what is a name within the meaning of the statute, jr It has long been considered by the courts that a name consists of two parts: 1. That given at baptism or after birth, commonly called the Christian name, and 2. The family name or name common to the parents. The Christian name is in law denominated the proper name, and a. party. can have but one and the middle name or added names may be disregarded except where, by long usage, such middle name or initial has become a part of the; Christian name by which the individual is commonly known. </seg>
            <seg id="p077">OPINIONS t It has been held that while a middle name or initial is no part of the name, yet for purposes of identification the middle name or initial may be very important, especially where the question of which of two men by the same name, except for middle name or initial, was intended, or named in an Instrument or the like. / It has also been .held that where an entirely different name was presented on the ballot than that properly belonging to the candidate, that the votes cast before the mistake was corrected could not be counted for the candidate. In view of the above, and in view of practices which have be - come quite common among certain candidates at primary elections to use names which tend to mislead the voters and prevent the people from making their proper selection among the candidates, we believe that the practice of changing names by a candidate solely for the purpose of using a particular name upon an election ballot is contrary to public policy and that your office should not accept such filings, either by petition or application of the candidate.

The office of judge of the district court is created by Section 10, Article V, of the Constitution. Section 21, Article V, provides for the filling of the office of any judge of the district court which has become vacant before the expiration of the regular term for which he was elected by appointment of the governor for the unexpired term. Section 23, Article III, of the Constitution, provides that all offices created by the constitution, shall become vacant by the death of the Incumbent, by removal from the state, resignation, conviction of a felony, impeachment, or becoming of unsound mind.

EDWIN VAIL, Assistant Attorney General RE: SHORT TERM — OEUTENANT GOVERNOR. July 8. 1938 Hon. Harry R. Swanson, Secretary of State, Lincoln. Dear Sir: In yours of July 5th you state that on June 30, 1938, one Nate N. Parsons filed in your office nominating papers in proper form for his nomination on the Democratic ticket for the office of Lieutenant Governor to fill the vacancy now existing. You ask whether or not a vacancy in said office now exists; whether or not such vacancy, if it does exist, should be filled at the November election; and whether or not you should accept said nom - inating papers and certify Mr. Parson's name to the county clerks as a candidate for said nomination. Since March 7, 1938, when the then Lieutenant Governor was convicted of a felony in the district court of Lancaster County, Ne - braska, the office has been vacant. It remains vacant at this time. Generally speaking- "the law abhors vacancies in public office, and courts generally indulge in a strong presumption against a leg - islative intent to create, by statute, a condition which may result in an executive or administrative office becoming, for any period of time, wholly vacant and unoccupied by one lawfully authorized to exercise its functions." (46 C. J. 971). The office of Lieutenant Governor is an executive state office. (Sec. 1, Art. IV, Constitution of Nebraska). "It is the general policy of the law to fill vacancies in an elective office at an election as soon as practicable after the vacancy occurs." (46 C. J. 974). However, "In order to escape the inconvenience resulting from an interregnum, the power to fill vacancies is usually granted to some executive or administrative authority which is always capable of acting." (46 C. J. 975). The firmly entrenched policy of the law against permitting the existence of vacancies in office has </seg>
            <seg id="p080">REPORT OP ATTORNEY GENERAL prompted our own supreme court in Praiher v. Hart, 17 Neb 598 to nay that: ' "Where it appears prima facie that acts or events have occurred subjecting an office to a judicial declaration of being vacant, the authority having the power to mi such vacancy, supposing the office to be vacant, may proceed before procuring a judicial declaration of the vacancy to appoint or elect according to the form of law a person to h« rn™?/^^ constitutlonal V* statutory provisions which must be considered in arriving at an answer to your question are clear and concise. Sec 23. Art. Ill, of the Constitution, first provides that all offices created by the constitution shall become vacant upon the V happ en ng of certain things. Anlng those things is the convict on of the incumbent of a felony. The section then provides further that* "the legiBlature shall provide by general law for tfie filling of such vacancy, when no provision is made for that purpose in the constitution."

C. S. 1929, provides as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p081">OPINIONS "Appointments under the provisions of this chapter shall be in writing and continue until the next election at which the vacancy can be filled, and until a successor is elected and qualified***." Sec. 32-1704, C. S. Supp. 1937, provides that: "Vacancies occurring in any state, judicial district, county, precinct, township, or any public elective office, thirty days prior to any general election, shall be filled thereat.*** Any person so***elected under the provisions of this section shall hold his office for the unexpired term." There being no special constitutional provision for filling of a vacancy in the office of Lieutenant Governor the foregoing general statutory provisions are controlling. Such was the rule announced by our court in State v. Purse, 89 Neb. 652, where an incumbent railway commissioner died less than thirty days before the general election in 1910, and the governor appointed Mr. Furse to fill the vacancy. The court held such appointment good at least until the November, 1911, election. We quote from the court's opinion, at page 659: "It must be conceded that no provision is made in the con - stitution for the filling of a vacancy in the office of railway commissioner; it being silent upon that subject. The case is therefore brought within the provisions of the constitu - tion last above quoted (Art. Ill, sec. 23, supra) and must be governed by it, and the general law (Sees. 32-1703, 1706, 1704, supra) applied." The caso of State v. Coleman, 91 Neb. 167, is another case of interest because there the vacancy, unlike the one considered in the Furse case, occurred more than thirty days prior to the general elec - tion. That is the situation with reference to the vacancy now under consideration. In the Coleman case the court, applying the general statutes aforesaid, had this to say. We quote from page 169 of the opinion; "It therefore seems clear that, wh*n the relator was ap - pointed to fill the vacancy caused hy the resignation of his predecessor, his appointment held good until the next gen - eral election, which was in November, 1911, and *** the person chosen at that time would hold his office for the unexpired portion of the term." </seg>
            <seg id="p082">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. Our conclusion is, therefore, as follows: ' First, a vacancy in the office of Lieutenant Governor has existed since March 7, 1938; second, that vacancy may at any time be filled fay appointment by the Governor; third, irrespective of whether or not such an appointment is made, since the vacancy occurred more than thirty days prior to the November election, it may be filled at that election. You should, therefore, . accept the filing made and certify the name to the county clerks. In making up the ballot at the primary and general elections respectively, separate places should be provided for voting for Lieutenant Governor for the full term and for Lieu - tenant Governor for the unexpired term.

April 5, 1938. Honorable William H. Price, State Auditor. ' ' ■ ■ I ■ ! '■'■■■'■■■■. Dear Sir: You ask what disposition should be made of the voucher filed in your office on March 28th, 1938, for the payment to Walter H. Jurgensen of the amount claimed to be due him for salary as Lieu - tenaiit Governor of Nebraska for the first quarter of 1938. On February 9th, 1938, a verdict finding said Walter H. Jur - gensen guilty of embezzlement of the sum of $549.71 was returned by the jury in the district court of Lancaster County, Nebraska, in the case of The State of Nebraska, plaintiff vs. Walter H. Jurgensen, defendant. On March 7th, 1938, the District Court of Lancaster County, Nebraska, overruled the motions of said Jurgensen for a new trial and to set aside said verdict, and entered its final order and judgment in said case, adjudging the guilt of said defendant and sentencing him to the Nebraska State Penitentiary for a term or not less than two nor more than five years and ordering him to pay the costs of said prosecution. . . ■■;"'; </seg>
            <seg id="p083">OPINIONS Upon the entry of said judgment and sentence on March 7th, 19 38, it is our opinion that the office of Lieutenant Governor of the State of Nebraska immediately became vacant within the meaning of section 23 of Article III of the Constitution of Nebraska, which provides in part that: "All offices created by this Constitution shall become vacant by*** conviction of a felony." That Mr. Jurgensen has appealed to the Supreme Court from said conviction and that his appeal has not yet been determined by that court do not change the situation. The term "conviction" as used in the constitution imports only a verdict of guilty by a jury and a confirmatory judgment thereon by the trial court, without respect to appellate affirmance. The robe of innocence with which the law invested Mr. Jurgensen during trial was stripped from him by the verdict of the jury. A legal presumption has now arisen that his conviction is just. It is essential to government that public officials have the confidence of the people. That confidence cannot extend to an official under conviction for a felony. His rights are subordinate to the public weal. The possibility that his conviction may ultimately be reversed cannot weigh against the public interest which demands that public affairs be administered by officers upon whom rests no stigma of conviction of infamous crimes. An innocent man unjustly convicted of a felony is doubly unfortunate, but the fact that he may, by means of an appeal, ultimately succeed in establishing his in - nocence, does not entitle him in the meantime to hold onto a public office which has been forfeited by his conviction. You should therefore allow Mr. Jurgensen's claim only to the extent of the amount due for salary of the Lieutenant Governor up to March 7, 1938, the date when the office became vacant. Any claim for salary after that date should be disallowed. RICHARD C. HUNTER, Attorney General. RE: LEGISLATIVE BILL NO. 97 — OPERATION OF GASOLINE TRANSPORTS •' ! ' ! November 20, 1937 Edward A.

            <seg id="p084">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. Dear Sir: You have asked us as to the proper construction of Section 9, Legislative Bill No. 97, Legislative Session 1937, which provides as follows: i . ■ . ■ "No vehicle for which. a permit has been issued under the provisions of this Act shall be operated while loaded in part or in whole with motor vehicle fuel, Kerosene, dis - tillate or other petroleum products of a highly inflammable character on the highways of this state between the hours of six o'clock A.M. and midnight next following on the following days, towit; Sundays, Independence Day and Labor Day: Provided, that if such vehicle shall at said six o'clock A.M. on any of said days be not more than fifty miles from its final destination it shall proceed immediately to such final destination, and such movement shall not be a violation of this section: Provided, in case of a break - down on the highway, the movement of the disabled vehicle to the next point where repairs can be made shall not be a violation of this section." The impression seems to prevail amongst some operators that they may leave the point of origin within the State of Nebraska and proceed into another state between the hours of six A.M. and midnight next following on the prohibited day, and then load up with gasoline and return into the state, and that they will be allowed to proceed to their destination if they be not more than 50 miles from their destination when they enter the state. As we construe this section, it would not, of course, be a viola - tion of the law for these vehicles to be operated from their point of origin to the point of loading, since they would be operated without any load. However, on the return trip they would be loaded and would come within the prohibition of the statute. We do not think that the proviso would excuse such vehicles, because, as we construe the Btatute, we think it applies only to vehicles where the load was taken on before six A.M. Stated differently, we believe that it was the intention of the legislature, where a vehicle is proceeding loaded with petroleum pro - ducts, to forbid that vehicle to proceed after six A.M., provided it does not have more than 50 miles to go to arrive at its final des - tination. To forbid a vehicle to proceed in the manner above suggest - ed, and to take on a load of petroleum products after six A.M. would, in our judgment, be a manifest violation of the statute.

Dear Mr. "Willard: You ask whether or not a product known as Butane is subject to the motor vehicle fuel tax provided for in section 66-401, C. S. Supp. 1937. You advise that this product, known as Butane, is a gas under ordinary atmospheric pressure and conditions, which may be liqui - fied by the addition of pressure or by the lowering of temperature with a boiling point of thirty-one degrees Fahrenheit. We understand that it is proposed to use this gas lor operating stationary engines in connection with drilling operations in place of natural gas. The said section of our statute in defining motor vehicle fuels provides that such shall include those products commonly known as gasoline and "any other liquid and such other volatile and inflam - mable liquids" as may be used for operating and propelling motor vehicles. It would seem that the language of our statute, as it now reads, contemplates that only those products, which are liquid in their nat - ural form, are included within the meaning of our statute and sub - ject to taxation as motor vehicle fuels. Furthermore, as stated above, the product. Butane, involved herein, 1b to be used exclusively in stationary engines and no attempt is to be made to use this product as a fuel in any motor vehicle propelled upon any highway of this state. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the product, known as Butane, referred to, is not subject to motor vehicle tax.

The section to which reference is made provides "all sums of money received under this act by the State Treasurer shall be placed.jby him in a fund to be known as the Gasoline Tax Fund." -,„_. , It .then provides further "until June 30, 1939, ten percent of said fund shall be credited and shall inure to the State Assistance Fund***." There may be some doubt as to whether the language used is sufficient to specifically appropriate moneys covered Into the treasury under the excise tax provided for in the act, for the benefit of the various activities dependent upon the State Assistance Fund. How - ever, resolving the doubt in favor of a specific appropriation, we find that Legislative Bill No. 158 became effective March 24, 1937, upon its approval by the Governor, with the emergency clause.

Secondly, it is an enactment complete in itself, and capable of re - pealing contradictory enactments by implication.

EDWIN VAIL, Assistant Attorney General. SAIiE OP UNIiAWFtTL ICE CREAM June 29, 1938. Mr. A. L. Haecker, Chief, Department of Agriculture, State House City. Dear Mr. Haecker: I 1 You request our opinion as to whether the practice and product hereinafter described, violates our statute providing minimum butter - fat requirements for "ice cream and/or dairy products made in the semblance of ice cream". .. Th ?. product ref erred to is commonly termed "malted milk mix" or "mix". It has the same appearance and consistency as ice cream, is manufactured and maintained in frozen or semisolid form and is kept in containers similar to those used for ice cream. The principal chemical difference between this product and other ice cream is that the percentage of butterfat contained is very low, running as low as 3% and below, whereas, vanilla ice cream, according to our law, musi contain 14% butterfat finish, and fruit flavored ice cream 12%. The product sometimes contains malted milk powder which is omitted from the manufacture of regular ice cream.. We are advised further that this product is being used at foun - tains in the preparation of malted milks, Ice cream sodas and foun - tain drinks and dishes in place of ice cream containing the legal amount of butterfat. We are also advised that this product has been used to fill cones and paper cupb and has been sold and served as regular ice cream. </seg>
            <seg id="p088">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL It is our opinion that this product is merely a low-grade ice cream and in illegal under the laws of this state. In the recent case of State v. McCosh (May 20, 1938) our supreme court used the fol - lowing language in defining ice cream: "In this connection, it may be said that 'ice cream' as de - fined) by Webster's New International Dictionary (2d ed.) is: 'fA frozen food containing cream, or butter fat, flavor - ing, sweetening, and, usually, eggs; specif., such a food made smooth by stirring during freezing; — distinguished from parfait and mousse." In that case our court held that a product designated as "Frozen Luxury" was a dairy product made in the "semblance" of ice cream and illegal, saying: "In view of the public policy evidenced by the terms of the statute, immunity cannot be established by substitution of a mere trade-name for a product which its constituent el - ements fairly identify as one embraced within the terms of the regulating statute. The right of the state, under the police power, to enact laws which are designed to provide a minimum amount of nutri - tional elements and prevent fraud and deception in the sale of foodstuffs extends to ice cream, and such enactments are not arbitrary, excessive, or unlawful exercises of the police power, and do not violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, nor transgress section 3, Art. I of the Nebraska Constitution." The language of our supreme court Just quoted is particularly applicable to the product involved herein. The public certainly ex - pects to receive the same kind and quality of ice cream in drinks and dishes prepared at a soda fountain as contained in purchases of ice cream for consumption off the premises of the fountain. The inclusion or exclusion in the product above described of malted milk powder, in our opinion, does not alter the conclusion as to the illegality of this product. Under section 81-910 (C. S. 1929) it Is unlawful for any person to "manufacture for sale" within Ne - braska or "have in his possession with intent to sell" such product. We do not think, however, that liquid drinks, including "milk shakes" or "malted milks", necessarily constitute dairy products made in the semblance of ice cream. It is common knowledge that these </seg>
            <seg id="p089">OPINIONS drinks are ordinarily prepared at fountains upon the order of the cus - tomer. But, in such preparation, it is our opinion that where ice cream is an ingredient of the mixture the ice cream so used must contain the required butterfat content of ice cream and the product above described as "malted milk mix" or "mix" cannot be used for that purpose. We are further of the opinion that "milk shakes" and "malted milks" prepared in quantities prior to sale in liquid form, and so maintained, are not products made in the semblance of ice cream and need not contain the requirements for ice cream. But, it is our opinion, that if such products are manufactured or maintained in » solidified and not a liquid state, they simulate ice cream and must conform to the legal butterfat requirements for ice cream. BERT L. OVERCASH, Assistant Attorney General. APPLICABLE TO VACUUM CLEANER SALESMEN LEGISLATIVE BILL NO. 50. June 14, 1937. Mr. Maynard Grosshans, County Attorney, York, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Grosshans: We have your inquiry of June 9th with reference to L. B. No. 50, asking our opinion as to whether or not It is applicable to a state agent selling vacuum cleaners manufactured by a wholesaler. You advise that such agent sells his vacuum cleaners from house to house and transports same by motor vehicle; and that there is only one model of such vacuum cleaner and it bears the manufact - urer's trade-mark. In answering your question we assume that this person does not have an "established place of business" as provided in said act. That being true, it would appear that such individual is subject to the licensing and regulations under the provisions of said act, un - less the exemptions therefrom in subdivision C of section 2 is applic - able to him. This exemption reads as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p090">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "Those using such vehicles for the transportation, sale, and delivery at retail of any particular group of products hav - ing a common trade-mark, trade-name, or brand, as agents, employees, or retail dealers of the manufacturers or whole - sale distributors of such products through whom they mar - ket the same." In order to come within the exemptions just stated, the articles so Ld must comprise a "particular group of products, having a common trade-mark." It is ouir opinion that a -manufacturer of a single model of a vacuum cleaner cannot be held to have manufactured and through his agents sold a group ol r products having a common trade - mark. To otherwise construe the exemption above quoted, would necessarily enlarge the exemption to cover the manufacture arid sale of any article that has a trade-mark. Such does not appear to have been the intent of the legislature. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the person referred to in your question is subject to the provisions of L. B. No. 50 in the sale of the vacuum cleaners above described. ■ You also ask whether or not such person is subject to said act byj reason of the resale of trade-ins, taken in connection with the sale of new vacuum cleaners. We are of the opinion, also, that such person is subject to said act by reason of such sales, since in the sale of used vacuum cleaners it could not be said that the person was engaged in selling any "pai - tlcular group of products."

Dear Sir: We have your letter of June 2d, inclosing certain inquiries with reference to L. B. No. 50, (relating to the licensing and regulating of Itinerant merchants. From the inquiries submitted we have ab - stracted certain questions, which are answered hereafter. </seg>
            <seg id="p091">OPINIONS 1. Does this act apply to farmers or gardeners who market at wholesale or retail products grown by them? No, it Is specifically provided In section 2 of the Act that there "shall be exempt from the provisions of this Act, "those using vehicles" for the transportation of grain, fruits, vegetables, hay, livestock, or other agricultural pro - ducts produced by them." 2. Does this act apply to a trucker or other person who pur - chases fruits and vegetables from wholesalers, producers, or other persons and delivers and sells such products, from his truck to re - tail stores or to individuals? Yes, unless such trucker has an "es - tablished place of business owned" by him, as defined in the act, and such transportation is merely incidental to the conduct of such business. 3. If an itinerant merchant's license is obtained from the di - rector of the Department of Agriculture and Inspection of the State of Nebraska, does such license permit the licensee to do business as an itinerant merchant in any city or village and anywhere within the state of Nebraska? Compliance with all of the requirements of the act and possession of a license duly issued by the director of the Department of Agriculture and Inspection entitles such an itinerant merchant to conduct his business anywhere within the state of Ne - braska. However, in order for such itinerant merchant to operate his business within cities and villages, he must also comply with the valid municipal regulations relating to such business, including the payment of occupation tax, if such is exacted. We trust that the foregoing answers the inquiries submitted to, us, which we are returning herewith for direct answer from your office. BERT L. OVERCASH, Assistant Attorney General. L.EGISLTAIVE BILL NO. 60 OUT STATE TRUCKERS. November 29, 1937 Mr. Edwin Moran, County Attorney, Nebraska City, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Moran: You ask our opinion as to whether a person coming Into this state from Missouri and selling a load of grapefruits, walnuts, and potatoes at wholesale to a local store is subject to said act. </seg>
            <seg id="p092">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL You refer to subdivision "b2 of section 2 of said act (sec. 77 - 1451, C. S. Supp. 1937), which exempts from said act those persons transporting products as an incident to an established place of bus - iness. It would be impossible for us under the facts submitted to say whether this individual has an established place of business as defined in said act. What constitutes an established place of business is more particularly set out in section 3 of the act (sec. 77-1452). In determining whether individuals, such as the one referred to by you, are subject to said act, you will not only have to determine whether the individual has an established place of business, as there - in defined, but also whether or not the goods involved constitute in - terstate commerce. If the goods being transported and sold con - stitute interstate commerce, then it is our opinion that the licens - ing and regulating provisions of the above act have no application. In the ordinary case of peddlers, it is probable that no question of interstate commerce will arise. BERT L. OVERCASH, Assistant Attorney General. L. B.

Dear Mr. Gewacke: You ask our opinion as to whether certain attempted evasions of the above entitled act are subject to the terms thereof. You first refer to the case of a roving buyer who purports to act for persons in the purchase of goods under general instructions to obtain certain goods for a certain buyer and deliver them to the purchaser. You ask whether such an agent is within the terms of said act if he does not acquire title in his own name and merely acts for a buyer of such goods. It is our opinion that su,ch individual is subject to said act for the reason that the exemption provided in section 2 is applicable </seg>
            <seg id="p093">OPINIONS only when such an agent does "not act for any party In acquiring, purchasing, selling, or disposing of the cargo transported." You also refer to the case of an individual who does not own a truck but purchases large quantities of vegetables and employs a trucker to transport them to his residen.ee. From that location he employs truckers to haul these goods and he rides along with such truckers and makes sales to various individuals. You suggest that such an individual does not own the truck himself and you ask whether or not he or the trucker must obtain a license under said act. Section 2 of said act provides that it is applicable generally to any one using a "motor truck or trucks or any other vehicle or vehicles" upon our public highway for the purpose of merchandising articles therein provided. : There is no provision in said act that requires an individual to own the vehicle being used in order to become an itinerant merchant. We are of the opinion that both the driver of the truck In the case suggested by you and the owner of the goods therein are itinerant merchants under said act in the using of the vehicle in question and must obtain a license therefor.

Dear Doctor Anderson: You recently forwarded to us an inquiry received by you from Mr. Kenneth S. Wherry of Pawnee City, Nebraska, with your request for our opinion In the matter. The Inquiry presented by Mr. Wherry's letter was whether or not a bondsman for an auction house can be held for auctioneer ser - vices or for any expense Incurred in the operation of a sales ring, such as light, water, rent, etc. under the provisions of L. B. No. 55. </seg>
            <seg id="p094">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL In our opinion a bondsman for the operator of a livestock sales ring under L. B. No. 55 assumes no such liability. His obligation under the bond is to pay to the rightful owner or owners of live - stock, consigned to the sales ring, money due such owner or owners from the operator of the sales ring in the event the sales ring oper - ator fails to pay the same. Section 4 of L. B. No. 55 specifically defines the conditions to be included in the bond given by a sales ring operator. None of those conditions impose any liability upon the bondsman except as afore - said. The bondsman's liability can be only a liability to owners of livestock. The bond is not given for the protection of the auctioneer or for the protection of a light company or for the landlord or for the public service agency that may furnish water to the sales ring operator. FRANCIS V. ROBINSON, Assistant Attorney General LIVESTOCK SALES RINGS— ACTIONS ON BOND. January 27, 1938 Hr. Dwight Griffiths, Attorney at Law, Auburn, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Griffiths: We acknowledge receipt of your inquiry relative to the livestock 1 sales ring bill enacted by the recent legislature. In your letter you refer to that part of this act which provides hat an action at law may be brought in the name of the state upon the bonds given under the requirements of the act for the use and benefit of the person who has suffered damage by violation of the terms, of the act. You state that it is your impression that such action must be brought by the county attorney but that your county attorney is of a contrary opinion and you ask our advice in this matter. It is the personal opinion of the writer that the language of the statutes does not necessarily contemplate that such action must be brought by the county attorney. Such official may, of course, bring the action if he desires to do so. Inasmuch, however, as the action Is solely for the benefit of the injured party, .it is not our </seg>
            <seg id="p095">OPINIONS opinion that the county attorney should or 1b required to provide legal services in prosecuting and maintaining an action for the bene - fit of a private citizen. It seems to the writer that it was the in - tention of the legislature to authorize the damaged party to bring his action in the name of the state upon his relation. I would, there - fore, entitle a petition In such a case about as follows: "The State of Nebraska, ex rel, John Doe, Plaintiff, v. Richard Roe, Defendant." In this connection may I refer you to the following language found In 59 C. J. 326: "A suit in the name of a state may properly be brought upon the relation of the official authorized to institute the action; or upon the relation of one for whose benefit a contract has been made to the state, as trustee." In such a case as you men - tion, it seems that the bond given by the operator of a sales ring is a contract made to the Btate as a trustee for the benefit of any one who may be damaged through violation of the act on the part of the licensee. FRANCIS V. ROBINSON, Assistant Attorney General BANK NIGHT Lincoln, Nebraska, February 25, 1937. To the County Attorneys of Nebraska: Under date of January 16, 1937, an opinion was given by this department which read in part as follows: "Since the original opinion was expressed by this department on this question about two years ago, the courts of last resort of sev - eral jurisdictions have been called to pass upon the validity of bank night. A careful study of these opinions is now being made by this department for the purpose of assisting us in the preparation of an opinion dealing with bank night. When the opinion Is prepared, proper notice of our conclusion will be made. Until such time as you receive notice to the contrary, the opinion heretofore expressed by this department, and holding that a bank night conducted in ac - cordance with the copyrighted plan is not a lottery, stands as the opinion of this department." We have now completed our study of the decisions of courts of other states and find that in the District of Columbia, Kansas, </seg>
            <seg id="p096">REPORT OP ATTORNEY GENERAL Massachusetts, Washington, Circuit Court of Appeals 10th Circuit, Virginia, Michigan and an early English case, the plan of "Bank Night" has been declared to be operated in violation of their lottery laws. The courts of Iowa, New Hampshire, California, New York, Texas, Tennessee and Alabama have held the plan not to be a lottery. In view of the fact that the courts are divided on the question, we investigated the actual workings of "Bank Night." We are now satisfied that the plan is an attempted subterfuge to escape the stigma of being a lottery and that the subterfuge, although ingenious, is not convincing. Therefore, we believe the plan is in violation of the lottery laws of this state. Inasmuch as the plan is in operation in nearly all counties of the state, it is right and proper that this office take the initial steps to end the practice. It is our plan to do so in the near future. We are asking your cooperation to the end that evidence of continued operation of the plan be gathered and preserved for future reference. RICHARD C.

Bear Sir: In your recent communication you describe a certain device being used in your vicinity, and inquire whether or not the operation of the same in our opinion constitutes a violation of the Nebraska lottery and gambling laws. The scheme described in your letter consists of a shooting gallery wherein the target is a small pasteboard card which has in each of its four corners a small figure or letter. The player pays ten cents for four shots. He shoots at one of the figures or letters in the corner of the card. If he is successful in shooting out all of the figure or letter with the four shots he receives the jackpot. Otherwise Tie receives nothing. The jack-pot is started by the operator putting up a prize of $15.00. For ea.cn target that is used, representing a receipt </seg>
            <seg id="p097">OPINIONS of forty cents by the operator from the players, the operator adds the sum of five cents to the total amount In the jack-pot. You say that the jack-pots on occasion run as high as $40.00. In our opinion a scheme so operated does constitute a violation of the Nebraska gaming laws. If the scheme is examined from the standpoint of the essential legal elements required to constitute an unlawful enterprise, to-wit: the elements of prize, chance and con - sideration, we find that the element of prize is present in the jack - pot. The element of consideration is present in the ten cents which each player must pay for the privilege of shooting four shots at one of the figures in the corner of the target. The question arises, however, as to whether or not the element of chance is present in this scheme. Is it purely a matter of skill or does the element of chance predominate in deciding whether or not a player wins the jackpot? Under the law games do not cease to be games of chance because they call far the exercise of skill by the players. The true test is not whether the game contains either an element of chance or an element ol skill, but which of the two elements constitute the dominating element that determines the result. The writer has seen similar shooting games in operation. The range from which the shots are fired does not exceed more than a few feet. If sTcill were the dom - inating factor in such an enterprise, then no operator could con - tinue to operate the scheme and start each new jack-pot with a prize of $15.00, and certainly players with a reasonable degree of skill in the use of a rifle could soon be able to win the jack-pot with almost every try of four shots. The very fact that the scheme can be suc - cessfully operated by offering such a large jack-pot before any re - turn is received by the operator is almost conclusive evidence to the writer that chance rather than skill predominates in determining the winner. It is therefore our opinion that such a scheme, so operated, does constitute a violation of the gaming laws. FRANCIS V. ROBINSON, Assistant Attorney General. AUCTION NIGHT December 7, 1937 Mr. Lloyd E. Kelly, County Attorney. Grand Island, Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p098">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL, Dear Mr. Kelly: By yours of the 30th, you 'submit for our consideration a certain trade stimulating scheme being used by merchants at Grand Island, which you describe as follows: . ■ . "A group of local merchants, when purchases are made in their store, give to each purchaser what is known as 'script,' and at a future date at the theater, certain articles of mer - chandise such as refrigerators, electric stoves and other valuable merchandise is offered at auction, at which time the holders of the script can bid on the same, offering as payment therefor the 'script' which is designated as 10 votes or 25 votes — no monetary value being set out on ' them whatsoever. The article up for auction will go to the bidder having the highest number of votes." You term this a "gift enterprise" and ask whether or not in our opinion its operation constitutes a violation of the Nebraska gift en - .erprise statute, section 28-965, Comp. St. 1929. There is no question but that this scheme comes definitely with - n the prohibitions of section 28-965 of the statutes of Nebraska, as that section appears in the statutes. However, it must be remem - bered that that section of the statutes was held unconstitutional in the lease of State v. Sperry and Hutchinson Company, 94 Neb. 785, the green trading stamp case, in so far as it is purported to relate to enterprises, which do not embody the three essential elements of a lottery, -chance, prize, and consideration. We see no essential distinction between the "auction night" scheme and the green trading stamp scheme. The element of chance is not present. For each twenty-five cent purchase at a participat - ing store the customer receives twenty-five votes of script. Every - body is treated alike. No customer, by any chance drawing, may receive more votes of script than his purchases entitle him to. When the auction is held at the theatre on "auction night" the merchandise is not distributed by any chance drawing to the prize winner, it is sold at auction, and the highest bidder gets it. Chance does not enter into the scheme at all. If a bidder has obtained enough script and bids high enough for the merchandise, he gets it. We must, therefore, conclude that this enterprise does not con - stitute in any sense a violation of the Nebraska lottery or gift en - terprise laws. FRANCIS V.

Dear Mr. Morris: We thank you for yours of June 14th, giving us the synopsis of the manner in which "Money Day" is being conducted by merchants in Central City, and asking our opinion as to whetner or not this constitutes an unlawful chance enterprise under our statutes. As we understand it, certain merchants are operating this scheme. They maintain registration books in their places of business, offering prizes to registrants each week. In order to win one must HTlr , T ° C the regIstratlon bo °*s at one of the stores at nil™ , 1 g eaCh WGek - Then ° n Sa t«niay. a chance drawing is held and the registrant who holds the winning number is entitled to a prize of $25.00. if he calls at the bank to obtain it before the ™m, J? ° n that day - The P arti *Pant need buy nothing to be registering. "*"" "" he P&amp;y any moa^ for the P^ge of ™, | WM i e . the questIon is not entirely free from doubt, it is our opinion that, under the constitution and laws of Nebraska, this con - stitutes an unlawful lottery or scheme of chance. In arriving at this 7 take lDt0 con8ideratI °° the fact that the Nebraska constitutional and statutory provisions are much more comprehen - sive and ail inclusive than are those of any state whose laws we have propo O s C i C «ons n eXamIne# " Wh ° Se C ° UrtS bave Pa88ed UP0n simllar lottofir 6 tT* haVe n ° con8tltutlonal inhibition whatsoever against I£ .m.

St Upon an analysis and comparison of our statutes and constitution- </seg>
            <seg id="p100">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL al provisions with those of other states, Judge Messmore of Beatrice in his recent opinion made the following observation: "An examination of the constitutional and statutory provis - ions of other states in which the courts have had occasion to pass upon identical or similar schemes to that involved in this case clearly reveals the fact that the Nebraska con - stitutional and statutory provisions are much more inclu - sive, more comprehensive, and broader than are those ot most of the other states." Our statutes contain no definition of a lottery or scheme of chance; but our court has defined a lottery as "a scheme for the distribution of prizes by chance, and where the winner must give something of value for the chance." Retail Section of Chamber of Commerce v. Kieck, 128 Neb. 13. • It will be noted that the court, with reference to consideration, says that the winner must "give" something of value for a chance, not that he must "pay" for a chance. The element of prize and chance are present without question in the "Money Day" plan. The question is, of course, as to the ele - ment of "consideration." I ..;/.■ One of the strongest cases favoring the legality of such a plan is State v. Eames, 183 Atl. (N. H.) 590. The New Hampshire stat - utes, defining a lottery, definitely required that "payment" must be made by the participant for his chance. The supreme court of New Hampshire, referring to that statute, made the observation that "al - though signing one's name in a book, or appearing at the theatre within five minutes of the time of the drawing might be regarded as consideration, it cannot be called 'pay' without warping that word out of all recognition." We do not think that "consideration," as an element of a lot - tery, necessarily requires, under our statutes, the payment of any money by the winner for a chance to win. The participant in this "Money Day" scheme must be inside one of the stores to register, he must sign his name in the regis - tration book, he must be present in town on the day of the drawing and call for the prize before the bank closes. These things, we be - lieve, constitute "consideration" moving from the participant to the operator. Supporting this idea, reference is made to the decision of a New York federal court in Brooklyn Daily Eagle v. Voorhies, 181 F. (N. Y.) 579, where the court said: </seg>
            <seg id="p101">OPINIONS "It is only necessary that the person entering the competi - tion shall do something or give up some right. The ac - quisition and sending in of labels is sufficient to comply with that requirement." The New Hampshire case, aforesaid, also supports this reas - oning. In Maughs v. Porter, 157 Va. 415, 161 S. E. 242, the scheme under consideration was one where a person conducting an auction sale, in order to attract a crowd to his sale, distributed numbers among the persons present and conducted a drawing, proposing to give to the holder of the lucky number an automobile. The court held that the attendance at the sale was sufficient "consideration." An Iowa federal court in Central States Theatre Corporation v Patz, 11 Fed. Supp. 566, a bank night case, made the following statement, which we think is very applicable to this "Money Day" scheme: "While the registration book may be open to the public generally, it is within the foyer of the theatre, and very few people would be presumptuous enough to enter the theatre, register, and not buy a ticket for the entertain - ment. The very purpose of the registration book being in the foyer of the theatre is to induce people to enter the theatre." So it might be said with reference to the "Money Day- scheme while the registration books may be open to the public generally they are within the places of business of the operating merchants and very few people would be presumptuous enough to enter those stores register, and not buy something. The very purpose of the registra - tion books being in those stores is to induce people to enter the stores and buy merchandise of some kind. It is not necessary, however, that we depend solely upon the conclusions that "consideration" exists in the signing of the regis - tration books and attendance in town on the day of the drawing to claim the prize. Many courts have held positively that the benefit derived by the operators of such a scheme through increased patron - age and business is "consideration" in itself; that those persons who do, as a direst result of the advertising scheme, buy merchandise from the participating merchants, in truth and in fact pay, through that increased patronage, an actual monetary consideration for whatever chance those who do not buy merchandise have to win; and that the </seg>
            <seg id="p102">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL registrants collectively contribute money to the fund from which the prizes are paid. Among- the cases so holding are the following: Willis V.

Likewise the Colorado federal court in General Theatre v. Metro- Goldwyn Mayer Dlst. Corp., 9 Fed. Supp. 546, made the following observation with reference to a similar scheme: "It appeals to the cupidity of the public and is opposed to public policy and good business ethics." We believe, particularly in view of our comprehensive constitu - tional and statutory provisions, that this "Money Day" scheme like - wise appeals only to the cupidity of the public. It is contrary to the public policy of our state as manifested by the constitution and statutes. It is contrary to good business ethics and not, in our opin - ion, a plan that can be lawfully adopted by merchants as a trade stimulant. FRANCIS V.

Dear Sir: This will acknowledge receipt of your inquiry of November 2d relative to the proposal of a certain merchant in your county to raffle off a Ford automobile on December 24th, 1938. </seg>
            <seg id="p103">OPINIONS The plan outlined in your letter contemplated that numbered tickets or coupons be issued to customers of the merchant for each $1.00 paid to him for merhandise or on outstanding accounts beween now and the time of the drawing. The stubs of these numbered tickets are to be placed in hamper on December 24th and a number is then to be drawn therefrom. The holder of the ticket, as we un - derstand it, is to receive the prize. Such a scheme is clearly an unlawful lottery within the meaning of the gaming laws of the state of Nebraska. It involves the ele - ments of a chance for a prize for -a price. It comes clearly within the holding of our supreme court in the Bank Night cases and in the case of State ex rel Retailers Section of the Chamber of Commerce v. Kieck. Consideration or price, as an element of a lottery, in this scheme is to be found in the fact that the customers when paying an old account or when buying new merchandise pays not only for credit on his account or for new merchandise but also pays in part for a chance to receive the automobile. FRANCIS V. ROBINSON, Assistant Attorney General VEHICIiE IilCENSE— RIGHT OF BANKRUPT TO HAVE LICENSE RESTORED April 16, 1937. Mrs. M. G. Tracy, Chief Clerk, Motor Vehicle Division, State Capitol Building. Dear Mrs. Tracy: We have your letter of March 29th with reference to section 60-603, Comp. St. Supp. 1935, relating to the suspension of automo - bile-driver's license, when judgment is obtained against licensee and remains unsatisfied. You say that an opinion was given by the attorney general's of - fice April 3, 1934, that a bankrupt who furnishes proof of financial responsibility for future accidents may have his license restored to him. You also say that on March 25, 1936. another opinion was </seg>
            <seg id="p104">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL rendered by the attorney general's office at variance with the prior opinion, and you ask whether of not your department should revoke a license heretofore restored to a bankrupt under the former opinion. i This matter is of considerable public importance and deserves a careful reexamination. A number of states now have provisions in their statutes sim - ilar to our 60-603, above referred to. These statutes have uniformly been sustained when attacked as unconstitutional. In holding these acts valid the .courts have quite ' frequently referred to the purpose of such statutes as being to encourage safe driving and attempt to reduce the' casualties being sustained from automobile accidents. Watson v. State, 298 Pac. (Cal.) 481 State v. Price, 63 Pac. (Ariz.) 653 Munz v. Harnett, 6 Fed. Supp. (N. Y.) 158 The broad police power of the state to regulate "the circumstan - ces under which automobiles may be operated" upon its highway was upheld in the recent case of Commonwealth v. Fundk, 186 Atl. (Pa.) 65. In that case the opinion refers to several decisions of the sup - reme court of the United States sustaining such regulations by the states. Analysis of our statutes, section 60-603, shows that it pro - vides that if any person "fails to satisfy any judgment rendered against him" on account of the operation of an automobile, his op - erator's license shall be suspended and remain suspended until he furnishes proof of financial responsibility for future accidents and "while any such judgment remains unsatisfied and subsisting and until every such judgment is satisfied or discharged." The question presented is whether a judgment of that character is subsisting and satisfied or discharged by bankruptcy proceedings. It appears that a similar statute was enacted in the state of New York and specifically provided that such a judgment should not be considered satisfied or discharged "by a discharge in bank - ruptcy." In the case of Munz v. Harnett, supra, suit was brought by a bankrupt against the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles to require the latter to issue him a license, on the ground that the statute of New York was unconstitutional and the discharge in bankruptcy entitled </seg>
            <seg id="p105">OPINIONS the bankrupt to a restoration of his license. In denying the con - tention of the bankrupt the court said: "It is argued that the effect of the act is to supply the judgment creditor with a remedy to compel the debtor to pay the judgment, despite his discharge in bankruptcy. This argument leaves us unconvinced. The New York Legisla - ture has not undertaken to say that the judgment creditor may compel the debtor to pay in spite of the discharge in bankruptcy. The act no more gives an additional remedy to collect a civil judgment than does a revocation of a license for driving while intoxicated impose an additional punishment for a crime.* ♦♦ "The statute has to do with motor vehicles on the highway. The same reasons that support this legislation against at - tack on general constitutional grounds support It against this attack; namely, that it may well tend to cause oper - ators and owners of automobiles to take pains so as not to have a judgment growing out ' of negligent driving 1 en - tered against them." We are impressed with the reasoning of the case just quoted. It certainly was not the intention of the legislature that the provision of the act in question could be avoided by bankruptcy. A discharge of debts received in bankruptcy proceedings does not con - stitute a satisfaction of those debts. As stated In 34 C. J. 687, a judgment can be "satisfied only in money," unless there is a specific arrangement of the parties for some other consideration. Although a discharge in bankruptcy, as applied to a judgment, relieves the bankrupt of all personal liability, the lien of such' judgment may not be destroyed and it cannot be said that such judgment ceases to have any existence. Donahue v. Kohler, 254 P. (Colo.) 989, 7 C. J. 395. 410. The holding in the Munz case coincides wffh the general rule that an obligation is satisfied only when there Is a full and complete termination of liability. Lawrence v. Goodwill, 186 P. (Cal.) 781. We are, therefore, of the opinion that a discharge in bankruptcy does not entitle a bankrupt to a restoration of his motor vehicle li - cense, and that any restoration heretofore made to any such oper - ator should be revoked and annulled.

            <seg id="p106">REPORT OP ATTORNEY GENERAL AUTHORITY OP COURTS TO MODIFY ORDERS SUSPENDING DRIVERS' LICENSES. October 16, 1937. Mr. R. W. Culwell, Chief, Motor Vehicle Division, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Culwell: You inquire of us as follows: "Do the district, county or municipal judges, oiice they have passed a sentence upon a defendant, suspending or revok - ing his operator's license and privilege to operate a motor vehicle within the state of Nebraska for a given period of time, have the authority thereafter to suspend the sen - tence as originally entered against the defendant?" In answer to your inquiry please be advised that in our opinion neither district, county, or municipal judges have authority to set aside or modify any judgments of conviction, including orders for the suspension of drivers' licenses entered in criminal cases under the motor vehicle laws, after the final sentence has once been pronoun - ced and been placed in execution. In a criminal case, after sentence has once been pronounced, courts are without further power in the premises, except on statutory grounds to grant a new trial or, upon the same grounds and in accord with the statute, to suspend the sentence for the purpose of per - mitting a review by an appellate court. A district court has power to grant bench paroles but such paroles must be granted before the imposition of sentence. It is also true that a district court has power during the term at which a sentence is imposed and before it has gone into operation to correct it in furtherance of justice so as to make it reflect the actual facts proved and the law applicable. However, after the original sentence has gone into operation, no court has power to vacate it or set it aside and impose a new or different sentence. Therefore, a court, after once having revoked or suspended a driver's license cannot, in our opinion, vacate its order of revocation or suspension and issue a new or different order in the premises.

Dear Sir: You inquire as to what use an automobile dealer may make of his No. 1 license plates. It is our opinion that, with respect to the use to be made ot dealer's plates, the statute recognizes no distinction between the No. 1 plates and the duplicate plates. Section 60-319, C. S. S. 1937, concludes with the following provision, to-wit: "♦♦that no "in-transif cards or dealer's license plates shall • be issued or used for any purpose other than in (conjunction with the bona fide purchase or sale of motor vehicles by dealers regularly engaged in such business within this state and regularly maintaining a place of business for such pur - chase within this state." That proviso', in our opinion, applies alike to both the original dealer's plates, which you term the No. 1 plates, and also to the duplicate plates, and unconditionally restricts the use of all such plates to a UEe in conjunction with the bona fide purchase or sale of motor vehicles by dealers regularly engaged in the automobile bus - iness in Nebraska and regularly maintaining a place of business with - in this state.

Must a dealer furnish proof that taxes have been paid on all vehicles upon which he is assessed during 1937 before he can secure a dealer's license or dealer's plates for 1938?" In answer to your inquiry please be advised that in our opinion this part of section 60-302 does not apply at all with respect to auto - mobile dealers' licenses, and therefore, upon applying for a dealer's license, it is not necessary that the applicant furnish proof that all taxes have been paid upon all vehicles upon which he was assessed during the preceding year before he can secure his new dealer's plates.

Dear Mr. Weller: You refer to section 39-1174, C. S. Supp. 1937, and ask our opinion as to whether any of the provisions of said section of the statutes authorize prosecutions of operators of motor vehicles when operating during the daytime without proper lighting devices. Subdivision (a) of said section provides that vehicles "upon a highway within this state" during stated hours when there is insuf - ficient sunlight "shall be equipped" with certain lighting devices. In our opinion the provision in this subdivision does not require the lighting devices therein specified to be upon motor vehicles during the hours not governed by the language thereof. In other words that subdivision merely provides that a vehicle shall not be upon the </seg>

The lighting requirements, in said subdivision (b), in our opinion, applies at all times to all motor vehicles. ; BERT L. OVERCASH, Assistant Attorney General. INSPECTION OF MOTOR VEHICLES OP STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS. April 5, 1938 Mr. II. F. Weller, Captain, Nebraska Safety Patrol. Dear Mr. Weller: You ask our opinion as to whether an inspection fee may be charged for the inspection of vehicles owned by state and federal governments, carrying either a Btate license, for which no registra - tion fee is paid, or a federal license. Section 40 of the Motor Vehicle Inspection Act provides that every "resident owner" shall "cause his vehicle -or vehicles to be inspected" as provided therein. Section 41 provides that it shall be "unlawful for any person to drive or move or for the owner to cause or knowingly permit to be driven or moved on any highway in this state any motor vehicle" not having a "certificate of inspection," Issued under said act. The language of the inspection act would indicate that the legislature Intended no vehicle could be driven upon the highway of this etate without being inspected In accordance with safd act. Clear - ly motor vehicles owned by the state and other governmental sub - divisions are subject to the terms of this act and an inspection fee can be charged for the Inspection of such vehicles. However, as to vehicles owned or operated by the federal gov- </seg>
            <seg id="p110">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL eminent, a serious Question would arise as to the Jurisdiction of the state to exercise its policy power- with reference to them. In Johnson v. Maryland, 254 U. S. 51, the supreme court of the United States held that state laws as to the issuance of operators' licenses upon an examination for competency as to driving could not be enforced as against employees of the postal department of the United States. In this case the court in an opinion by Justice Holmes said: "It seems to us that the immunity of the instruments of the United States from state control in the performance of their duties extends to a requirement that they desist from performance until they satisfy a state officer, upon i examination, that they are competent for a necessary part of them, and pay a fee for permission to go on. Such a requirement jdoes not merely touch tBe government ser - vants remotely by a general rule of conduct; it lays hold of them in their specific attempt to obey orders, and re - quires qualifications in addition to those that the govern - ment has pronounced sufficient. It is the duty of the department to employ persons competent for their work, and that duty It must be presumed has been performed." It would seem to follow if states cannot prevent incompetent persons of federal government from operating motor vehicles for the government, then states cannot prohibit improper and unsafe motor vehicles of federal government being operated in a similar capacity. It is, therefore, our opinion that in view of the Johnson de - cision, the state cannot require motor vehicles operated by or for the federal government in the discharge of its governmental and constitutional functions to be subjected to inspection and licensing under said act.

            <seg id="p111">OPINIONS Dear Sir: We acknowledge your letter of October 25, enclosing copy of letter of John Hopkins, sheriff of Douglas County of October 20, together with your reply to him of October 25, in which Mr. Hopkins asks you this question: "There is considerable difference of opinion as to the duties and responsibilities of the state road patrol (meaning the highway safety patrol) in matters of law enforcement, par - ticularly having to do with preventing or interfering with traffic and preventing disturbances on the highway during the present truck drivers' strike." You quote in your opinion section 60-421, of the 19~37 Cumula - tive Supplement to the Statutes of Nebraska, and we agree with your conclusion based thereon, namely: "Based upon the foregoing, it seems clear that the Nebraska Safety Patrol is required to assist in enforcing all laws regulating the operation of vehicles or the use of highways.'- To this may we add that the Nebraska safety patrol is empow - ered by the statutes to which you refer to enforce the laws pertain - ing to operation of vehicles and use of highways, and these laws only; that the patrol may not be used for the purpose of strike breaking ex - cept in so far as strikers may violate such laws. The act creating the safety patrol was not intended to and does not change the duties of local police, county sheriffs or other peace officers. The patrol is merely an added arm of the law created to aid and assist the other law enforcement agencies' of the state in the particulars referred to. BARLOW NYE, Administrative Assistant.

Con - iS! nS B i h ?K eCtlOn ' the Nebraska Su P reme Court said in Rlckley v. State, 65 Neb. 841, 847-848: "This statute gives to the county attorney full control of the case, and while the complaint Is. in a sense, rep - resented by counsel— the county attorney— he is given no </seg>

He calls such wit - nesses as he pleases; he controls all offers of evidence; he saves an exception to the rulings of the court, or not, at his pleasure; the interests of the complainant are wholly at his mercy, and are protected or left to suffer as he may choose;" In Nebraska a justice of the peace in criminal cases is depen - dent for compensation for his services upon collection of the court costs taxed in each particular prosecution. This is what is known as a fee office. If he convicts, the accused pays the cost, and the magistrate collects his fee. If he acquits, there is no way provided for the magistrate to collect his fees or costs unless the county at - torney shall have authorized the institution of Ihe prosecution or have given his approval in writing of the institution of the same. Such is the express provision of section 29-2709, C. S. 1929. Section 29-2703, C. S. 1929 .provides that no costs shall be paid from the county treasury in any case of a prosecution for misde - meanor except as provided in section 29-2709, supra. Unless, therefore, the county attorney institutes a criminal pros - ecution or approves in writing of the institution of the same, the magistrate can only obtain compensation for his fees by convicting the accused. This gives the magistrate such a direct pecuniary in - terest in the outcome of the lawsuit that our courts have found It necessary to hold that he is disqualified to act as a judge in such a case. For instance, the Supreme Court of the United States, in Turney v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510, 523, said this: "It certainly violates the 14th Amendment and deprives a defendant in a criminal case of due process of law, to sub - ject his liberty or property to the judgment of a court the judge of which has a direct, personal, substantial, pecuniary interest in reaching a conclusion against him in his case." Therefore, when we consider the Nebraska statutes supra, and when with them we take into consideration the many judicial decis - ions holding that judges having a pecuniary interest in the outcome of a prosecution are disqualified to act, we can arrive at no other conclusion than that the "nearest or most accessible magistrate" re - ferred to in section 39-1188, C. S. S. 1937, aforesaid, means that </seg>
            <seg id="p114">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL i- : ..•;.■ . . nearest or most accessible magistrate in whose court the county attorney has authorized the institution of the proposed prosecutions. Should a complaint be filed without previous authorization, the mag - istrate is disqualified to hear and determine the case unless, after the filing, the county attorney approves in writing of the commence - ment of the action. In all instances, therefore, your patrolmen; should contact the county attorney in each county and if the patrolmen desire to file complaint with a justice of the peace, they should first obtain the county attorney's consent to such action in accord with the require - ment of section 29-2709, C. S. 1929. In this regard, you further inquire whether or not the appro - priation of the motor vehicle driver's license fund for use for the administration of the highway patrol act is sufficient to authorize a use of said funds for the purpose of guaranteeing court costs in justice of the peace courts in prosecutions for violation of the traffic laws. By -this question we take it that you have in mind the provis - ions of section 29-405, C. S. 1929, which purport to authorize a magistrate, at his discretion, to require the complainant in criminal prosecutions to give security for costs when the prosecution is not instituted by the county attorney. The appropriation of the fund mentioned for administration of the act is not broad enough to au - thorize any such use of any part of this fund. Furthermore, even though such use of this fund were authorized by the appropriation, the giving of such security would not we think qualify a judge other - wise disqualified on account of his pecuniary interest In the outcome of the lawsuit. In this connection we refer you to the case of Ex Parte Hatem, 38 Fed. (2d), 226, decided in 1930 by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the 6th circuit of the United States. In that case, under similar statute provisions, the justice of the peace, in order to avoid disqualification because of his pecuniary in - terest in the outcome of the prosecution, required a constable at - tached to his court and a state prohibition enforcement agent to give security for costs. Commenting- upon that requirement, the court said: "It is sufficient that these officers were connected with the court, that no bond was required of them by statute, and that, by bringing their cases In that court, they served to increase an otherwise lower earning capacity of the magis- </seg>
            <seg id="p115">OPINIONS trate. The bond was Obviously required only to provide a colorable means of avoiding the effect of the Tumey case. It is not therefore irrational to assume that the bond was given as by a friendly volunteer, by whom no ultimate li - ability was contemplated, and upon whom the justice of the peace might well hesitate to impose such liability for a kindly act of evasion." There seems to be considerable logic in the reasoning used by the court as expressed in the language quoted above. We would not therefore be inclined to advise that you undertake to have your patrolmen give security for costs, even if we felt that the appropria - tion for administration might properly be considered broad enough to authorize such use of moneys in the motor vehicle driver's license fund.

Dear Mr. McCarl: We have your letter of February 7, with reference to whether a car owned by the Federal Land Bank of Omaha, and operated by an employee thereof exclusively for the purpose of furthering the business of the said land bank, is subject to taxation and registration.

Art. VIII, sec. 8, Constitution of Nebraska; sec. 77-202, Comp. St. 1929. "For the purpose of determining whether an automobile may be exempt from taxation under the constitution and statute, it is im - material who owns such automobile and who uses it. The crucial and decisive test is whether such automobile is used exclusively for the purposes stated in the exemptions. House of Good Sheperd v.

That is, as evidence that it is used exclusively for ed - ucational, religious, charitable or cemetery purposes. Second, the only test to be applied is one which will determine whether such automobile is used exclusively for fhe purpose stated in the exemption, namely for "educational, religious, charitable or cemetery purposes." If the automobile is used exclusively for one of these named purposes, it is exempt from taxation without regard to the name in which the title of the automobile may be carried. If, on the other hand, the automobile is a family automobile and is used for family purposes, as well as for educational or religious purposes, it cannot be said to be used exclusively for one of the purposes named </seg>

RE: NEPOTISM. September 28, 1938. Mr. William J. Moeschler, Omaha, Nebraska. Dear Sir: We acknowledge receipt of yours of September 27 in which you inquire whether or not it is proper for a public official elected or appointed under the laws of the State of Nebraska, to employ his sister as a helper in his office and to pay her from public funds. In 1919 the legislature of the State of Nebraska enacted a law which by its terms prohibited such employment by public officers in the State of Nebraska. Subsequent to the enactment of that law and under its terms an action was brought by Wayne County against its county treasurer, seeking to recover from the county treasurer a sum of money which it was claimed he had unlawfully paid from public funds to his sister who had been employed by him in his office as a clerk and helper. That case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Nebraska and on June 19, 1931 the Supreme Court handed down its opinion finding against the county and finding further that the 1919 anti-nepotism law above mentioned, was void because it had been enacted in contravention of section 14 of Article III of the Ne - braska constitution. The case mentioned is reported in 121 Nebraska Supreme Court reports at page 438.

You have called our attention to the rule governing the extent to which boards and commissions, as agencies for the administration of various governmental functions, may go in adopting rules and reg - ulations to carry out the purpose for which they may have been con - stituted. The existing rule seems to have been well stated as follows: "It is generally recognized, .however, that, while such agen - cies are governmental, they have no powers, but such as are expressly delegated to them by the organic or statutory law of the government of which they are a part, or such as are by implication essential to the full and adequate ex - ercise of such express powers." Huffman v. State Roads Commission, 152 Md. 566; 137 A. 358, 365; 59 C. J. 112, se.c. 119. This rule has been adopted in the case of State ex rel Woolridge v. Morehead, 100 Neb. 864, 161 N. W. 569, L. R. A. 1917D 310, 59 C. J. 112. We believe that we can say at this time that the courts are con - stantly taking more liberal views relative to the powers such boards ought to be permitted to exercise, and for a statement of liberal </seg>
            <seg id="p119">• OPINIONS construction we refer you to 2 Am. Bar Assoc. Journal, page 749, and to the dissenting opinion of Justice Rose In the last above cited case. - ' However, construing sections 71-1501 to 71-1507, C. S. Supp. 1937, under the rule laid down in the Woolridge case, above .cited, It is our opinion that the division of registration has the power to fix a minimum age requirement and that in the exercise of that power such board In fixing the age of eighteen years has exercised such power in a just and reasonable manner, and that the ruling is not arbitrary nor discriminatory. In support of this opinion we call your attention to section 71 - 1504, in which It is provided: "The bureau shall adopt and promulgate such rules and regulations, not inconsistent with law, as it may deem nec - essary to properly carry out the provisions of this act and to effectuate its purpose;" Referring to section 71-1514, the requirement is set out that the practice of nursing may not be entered into until the applicant for a license has attained the age of twenty-one years. Referring to section 71-1503, we find that the course of train - ing must cover a period of three years. It is, therefore, apparent from the context of the statute itself that the board has been granted power to effectuate its purpose and that a student could not be licensed under the law prior to the age of twenty-one years. In attempting to ascertain whether an eighteen-year minimum is arbitrary, we believe the board has the power to take into considera - tion the duties of a student nurse,-the fact that she is called upon to care for patients who may be seriously ill, requiring somewhat mature judgment and certainly a certain amount of physical maturity. Such maturity may not be present in a student who has graduated from a four-year course in high school and we, therefore, do not believe that such requirement as set out In section 71-1502 governs in any way the minimum age to which a student may enter upon nurse's train - ing. As stated above, we conclude that the board has the power to fix a minimum age of eighteen years. HARRY GRIMMINGER, Assistant Attorney General </seg>
            <seg id="p120">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL UNAUTHORIZED PRACTICE OP IjAW BY COLLECTION AGENCIES. October 4, 1937 Bureau of Adjustments, Inc., Sharp Building, Lincoln, Nebraska. Gentlemen: You advise that you operate |an incorporated collection business under the above name, take assignments of certain accounts and other indebtedness, and when necessary institute suits thereon in justice of the peace courts. Your contract for performing this service, as shown by copy thereof, submitted to this office, contains the following stipulation with reference to the service to be rendered and the charge therefor: "For valuable consideration the following unpaid accounts, claims, notes, judgments and other forms of indebtedness legally due the undersigned are assigned to you for the purpose of collection, subject to fifty per cent commission, whether paid to you or to us. You are authorized to use your discretion in the settlement of same and to Institute suit, levy execution or garnishment when in your judgment it is necessary, and for the purpose of collection, to endorse all checks, drafts, money orders, and accept cash sent to you in our (my) benefit by debtors. We agree to furnish item - ized statements or proofs of claim on request by you, and report promptly all payments made direct to us, comply strictly with all terms set out upon both sides of this sheet." You ask whether or not you are engaged in the unauthorized practice of law in bringing suits in your own name upon accounts received for collection under the above arrangement, when such suits are prepared and filed by an officer of your company in such court and if necessary are tried by him without the employment of any duly licensed attorney. It is the opinion of this office that under the rule in State v. Barlow, 131 Neb. 294, the question of whether you are practicing law is to be determined exclusively by the nature of the services performed and without respect for the particular court or place in which the acts incident to such service are committed. In that view it is wholly immaterial whether the suits filed by you in your col - lection matters, as outlined aforesaid, are filed in justice courts or in other -courts, and in all cases "the preparation of pleadings to be </seg>
            <seg id="p121">OPINIONS filed In court" and the "trial of causes In court" constitute the prac - tice of law. As stated by this office In an official opinion rendered June 5, 1937, upon this subject: "anyone, who, while appearing for another, prepares and files pleadings in a justice of the peace court, must, of nec - essity, engage in the practice of law. Likewise, one who appears at the time of the trial for any party to the suit, and engages in the trial of the case, engages in the prac - tice of law. Therefore, a layman is not authorized to per - form these acts." In arriving at the above conclusion, with reference to your case, it is unnecessary to determine whether lEe assignment included in your contract authorizes you to institute, maintain, and control legal proceedings in your own name. If such assignment gives you such right and you thereby become "the real party in interest" and can under the statutes initiate and maintain such proceedings, such right does not carry with it any privilege to engage In the practice of law or any immunities from the consequences of unauthorized and illegal practice of law. While an individual may represent himself in any court without the assistance of a duly licensed attorney a corporation manifestly must act only through agents and officers and cannot directly or In - directly engage in the practice of law. Therefore, even if your cor - poration owned such claims absolutely, it is our opinion that it would not thereby be entitled to have any of its officers, who are not li - censed attorneys, represent it in legal proceedings. 105 A. L. R. 1364. We think, however, that if it was necessary to determine whether such assignment vested an absolute right in your company to initiate and maintain suits in its own name, our court would follow the rule laid down in State ex irel. Freebourn v. Merchants Credit Service, 66 P. (2d) (Mont.) 337, and would hold that such assignment was only "legal title" for collection and no more. This conclusion is further substantiated by reference to another paragraph contained in your contract form which reads: "Accounts upon which suit has been started or which are in judgment, are subject to withdrawal after the expira - tion of sixty days written notice to us and the payment of all accrued court costs to date, and a minimum service </seg>
            <seg id="p122">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL charge of ?10.00 or ten per cent of the principal amount if over $100.00. Accounts canceled during process' of col - lection without complying with the above are subject to the regular commission charge." We think that an examination of your contract with creditors with reference to the collection of claims indicates without question that you are essentially engaged in a service business and not in the business of purchasing claims outright, and that your right and ob - ligation must of necessity be determined with reference to the service involved in your business. In this light, we think that there is presented for out opinion a most serious question independent of the question raised by you with reference to the right to initiate and try suits In courts of the justice of the peace. The additional question necessarily raised in this matter is your right to engage in the business and profession in - dicated by the service to be performed under your contract. The business of collecting claims itself does not constitute the practice of law. However, when coupled with such business an ajgeny attempts collection by threatening buH and holds itself as rendoring service and assistance in the legal enforcement of claims, it is generally held that such agency is engaged in the unauthorized and illegal practice of law. Richmond Ass'n of Credit Men, Inc. v. Bar Ass'n, 189 S. E. (Va.) 153., The statement just made is supported by a number of recent decisions by courts of the various states. Among these is In Re Ripley, 191 At. CVer.) 918, where the following rule is found in the syllabus of the .court: "Respondent who was not a licensed attorney held guilty of contempt of supreme court for unauthorized 'practice of law' where he contracted with creditor for a fee to enforce claims against debtor, wrote debtor and threatened him with suit, caused suit to be| brought, and caused debtor's wages to be attached by trustee process." ' " ■■ '. ■ ' . . ■ ■ ■ In the opinion in the Ripley jcase the court quotes from a Mis - souri decision as follows: "We therefore conclude that the respondent has the right to collect debts for others provided it does not employ an attorney or promise to employ one, or threaten the debtor with suit if he does not pay. If collections cannot be made </seg>
            <seg id="p123">OPINIONS without the services of an attorney, the respondent should return the claim to the creditor who should be free to select and employ his own attorney." The decisions of the various courts with reference to the ques - tion of what acts in connection with the operation of collection ag - encies constitute the practice of law are reviewed in 84 A. L. R. 749. Reviewing the decisions the following rule is stated: "In most of the cases the corporation or individual in ques - tion, engaged in the collection business, has been held to have been practicing law. However, it will be observed that the cases do not support the broad doctrine that the business of collecting claims amounts in itself to the prac - tice of law. Generally there have been other features in - cident to or a part of the business of making collections, such as threatening to bring suit, offering to give free legal advice, etc. which doubtless have been the controlling factors." From the foregoing it is the opinion of the writer that you are not only engaged in the unlawful and unauthorized practice of law in filing and trying cases In jcourt, but as well in the solicitation and accepting of accounts for collection under the arrangement hereto - fore indicated. It follows from the conclusion just stated that it is improper for you to mall to debtor any instrument designated as "Legal Notice of Suit," whether or not such instruments simulate legal process. The instrument you have been using in this connection, as shown by a copy that has been forwarded to this office, is objectionable we think upon the ground that it simulates legal process; but inas - much as you have no right whatever to threaten suit in any manner as part of your collection service, we do not think it is necessary to advise you as to the particulars in which said instrument simulates legal process.

            <seg id="p124">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Dear Sir: .' We have your letter (requesting an opinion on certain matters in connection with justice of the peace .courts. Your inquiries have been summarized and answered as follows: 1. May an individual, corporation, or partnership prepare and file suit upon a jclaim or debt owed to him or it without employment of an attorney? An individual 'person may file and handle himself any suit he. desires to maintain, and prepare all pleadings in connection there - with in any, court of our state providing he is acting solely for him - self and protecting his own private interests. He need not employ an attorney and this office has so ruled consistently and uniformly. A corporation being an artificial and not a natural person can only act through officers, agent), and attorneys and legal proceed - ings for and on behalf of a corporation must in every case be filed and tried by. a licensed attorney. An individual partner may properly represent himself as can any individual. , However, he .cannot authorize any employee ' not a li - censed attorney to act for him in any court. 2. May a justice of the peace prepare notices to vacate etc. or fill out other forms which may be filed as pleadings or used as evi - dence in his court? No. A justice of the peace is a judicial officer and as such should have no part in the preparation of any instruments which he may have to pass upon as to effect and sufficiency while performing his judic - ial duties. In the case of business forms etc. which will have nothing to do with any matters' before him as a judicial officer, a justice of the peace has the same right as any layman to prepare such instruments for other persons, but then onlyj if the nature of the instrument is such that legal knowledge is not required to prepare it. 3. May a justice of the peace keep on hand and sell blank legal forms of all kinds? Yes, providing he makes no representations as to the legal effect of any such instruments and does not advise as to how they should be filled out. &gt;" : ■•'.'■■ </seg>
            <seg id="p125">.: opinions V 4. Is It proper for a justice of the peace to accept employment by those holding judgments rendered In his court for the collection ol\ such judgments after they have been rendered? We do not think such employment is ethical or proper since the justice of peace is a judicial officer and as such should maintain an impartial position with reference to all litigants involved in his court. In the situation stated the ordinary remedies of execution are available to judgment creditors. When such remedies are pursued conflicts may arise that will require determination by the justice in his judicial capacity, and he must therefore remain in a neutral position so as to be able to discharge his duties in such event. 5. What did our supreme court hold in the recent opinion In State v. Kirk? Our supreme court held that the filing and trial of suits in justice courts by one acting for other persons is by its very nature the practice of law and that only those persons licensed by the sup - reme court as attorneys can engage in such activities. This office solicits the cooperation of all justices of the peace in conforming to the standards of practice and conduct laid down by the courts in this matter. The rules which have been adopted have for thein object the maintenance of high ethical standards which are necessary to the public welfare. BERT L. OVERCASH, Assistant Attorney General. RELEASE OP PRISONERS TO COUNTY SHERIFFS TO ATTEND TRIALS. November 3, 1937 Mr. Joseph O'Grady, Warden, State Penitentiary, Lancaster, Nebraska.

The statutes pertaining to the operation of the penitentiary and </seg>
            <seg id="p126">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL i luties of the warden and other officers are contained in ch. 83, Art. 9. Domp. St. 1929. Section 83-909 with reference to the duties of the warden reads as follows: "The warden shall attend constantly at the penitentiary, except when performing some other duty connected with his office; he shall exercise general supervision over and give necessary directions to the keepers, guards, and other employees; examine whether they have been vigilant in the discharge of their respective duties; examine daily into the health of the prisoners, and take charge and properly care for all personal estate, belonging to or connected with the penitentiary." Section 29-2401, Comp. St. 1929, provides that a convicted pris - oner is to be conveyed to the penitentiary and there "safely kept until the term of his confinement shall have expired, or he shall be par - doned. '■ We find no statute authorizing you to release prisoners to county sheriffs for their appearance as witnesses at trials. It is our opinion that in the absence of a subpoena for you to produce a prisoner at a specific place for trial, you should not allow a prisoner to be released from the penitentiary. BERT L. OVERCASH, Assistant Attorney General. TRANSPORTATION OF PRISONERS RELEASED OR DISCHARGED. April 5, 1938 Mr. Joseph O'Grady, Warden, State Penitentiary, Lancaster, Nebraska. Dear Mr. O'Grady: You ask our opinion as to the obligation of the state to provide transportation for prisoners released or discharged from the peniten - tiary. Section 29-2627, C. S. 1929, reads as follows: "Upon the release of any prisoner from the penitentiary, the warden shall provide him with suitable clothing, with ten </seg>
            <seg id="p127">OPINIONS dollars In money, and shall procure transportation for him to his place of employment. The warden shall make the same provision for any prisoner discharged from the pen - itentiary by expiration of his maximum sentence, save that he shall procure transportation to his home if within the state; if not, to the place of his conviction or to some place not more distant selected by the prisoner." The above section is a part of the indeterminate sentence law passed by our legislature in 1921 (Laws of Nebraska for 1921, page 692). It is noted that the above statute contains two distinct provisions; the first provides that transportation shall be procured upon the "release" of any prisoner. The term "release" as used therein would seem to mean "to set at liberty, to let go." 53 C. J. 1196. Apparently this provision would be applicable when a pris - oner is paroled but would not seem to be applicable when a prisoner is allowed to make a specific trip in any emergency. The other provision in said statute obligates the state to pro - vide transportation when a prisoner is discharged. The term "dis - charge" implies that there is not only a "release" but an ending of confinement. 18 C. J. 1048. Under this provision it is our opinion that a prisoner would be entitled to the transportation therein pro - vided when he has served the maximum sentence assessed against him less any good time allowed. It would not, however, be applicable where a prisoner had merely served his minimum sentence less good time allowance. BERT L. OVERCASH, Assistant Attorney General. PAYMENT OP POST-GRADUATE TUITION OUT OF COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL FUND. June 22, 1938 Mr. Eldon P. Cunningham, Superintendent of Public Instruction, Grand Island, Nebraska.

This student 1b a resident of a rural school district . which does not maintain high school grades."

AYRES, Assistant Attorney General I •'. ■• - . ■ ■ . '■■ . ' ■ ■ ' SCHOOLS — COMPENSATION INSURANCE August 4, 1938 Mr. Lloyd A. Shepard, Supt. Lewiston Consolidated Schools Lewiston, Nebraska. Dear Sir: : In answer to your letter of inquiry of the 3rd instant, I will say that a school district Is not required by law to carry compensation insurance on its employees, but it is liable to pay compensation to any of its employees who are injured in discharge of their duties an such employees. I have asked the Clerk of the Compensation Court to send you a copy of The Workmen's Compensation Law of Nebraska, and am told that it will be sent. The board members will not be personally liable, in my opinion, in case they do not take out workmen's insurance for the district. The district is legally liable to pay workmen's compensation to its injured employees, whether it takes out workmen's compensation In - surance for them or not, but if it takes out insurance and the insurer pays, then the district is not required to pay. If, however, the com - pany in which the insurance is taken out becomes insolvent and does not pay, then the district will be required to pay. A school district is not liable to pay any one for damages caused by the misconduct or negligence of its officers or employees, unless the law makes it liable in such a case. </seg>
            <seg id="p129">OPINIONS The Workmen's Compensation Law only applies to Injuries to employees. It is not applicable in the case of injuries to pupils or patrons. If a teacher should fall at school and break her leg while engaged in the performance of her duties, the district would be liable to pay her compensation in conformity with the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Law. The compensation would not nec - essarily be the actual damage to her, caused by her loss of wages and her doctor's bill and other expenses. If a pupil injures himself in any way in a shop connected with the school, or in any of the school activities, the school district will not be legally liable, for the law does not say that the district shall pay damages in such a case. The school district would not be liable if a patron attending a Play should faint and fall and injure himself in falling, or if he should be injured in any other way on or about the school grounds. It is said on pages 528, 529 and 530 of 56 C. J. that; "Inasmuch as school districts and other local school or - ganizations are agencies or instrumentalities of the state, and considered as corporations, are public or quasi municipal in character, it is the generally accepted rule, although there is some authority to the contrary, that such a district, or Its directing board, as such, like other municipalities and the state itself, is not liable to persons injured by its nonfeas - ance, nor is it liable for injuries or loss resulting from its negligence, as for a failure properly to construct a school building or to keep it in repair, or to maintain the school premises or equipment in a proper and safe condition, or to furnish safe and suitable means of conveyance for the transportation of pupils to and from school, or safely op - erate such conveyance, except where liability is imposed by statute."

            <seg id="p130">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Dear Sir: We beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of January 12, In which you enclose copy of a letter from Mr. Geoffrey May, As - sociate Director, Bureau of Public Assistance, Washington, and ask us to answer same direct, with copy to you. Mr. May in his letter says: "As previously requested, we should like to be informed as to whether 8 per cent or 10 per cent of the gasoline tax fund inures to the benefit of the State Assistance Fund, and we should like to be furnished with an explanation of the apparent discrepancy between Legislative Bill No. 70 and Legislative Bill No. 158 of the Laws of 1937. Ypu have previously stated that the suggestions of the Attorney General of the State | of Nebraska were requested In con - nection with this situation, but to date his reply, . if any, has not been received by this office. You have stated that it was the intent of the Legislature to appropriate the en - tire 10 per cent gasoline tax, but, due to a clerical error, only 8 per cent may be used for State Assistance purposes: and that this will result in the accumulation of a fund amounting to about $440,000 for the biennlum, as to which the Governor and the State Auditor have agreed under pro - visions of state statutes to permit the use of these additional funds for State Assistance, with the expectation that the / Legislature will correct the 2 per cent in Legislative Bill No. 70. If the Attorney General has considered the ques - tion involved, we should like to be furnished with a copy of his statement, together with an opinion as to the validity and effectiveness of the agreement of the Governor and State Auditor outlined here. If the Attorney General is of the opinion that this agreement is yalid and will accomplish the purpose for which it is designed, we should like to be furnished with a copy of each agreement." Legislative Bill No. 158 imposes an excise tax of 5 cents per gallon upon the use of all motor vehicle fuels and directs that the monies received under the act by the state treasurer shall be placed by him in a fund to be known as the "Gasoline Tax Fund", and fur - ther provides that until June 30, 1939, 10% of said fund shall be credited and shall inure to the State Assistance Fund. Under Legislative Bill No. 70 the Legislature made a specific appropriation of said funds as is required by the Constitution. ■ In </seg>
            <seg id="p131">OPINIONS the enrolled bill there appears in Section 49. an appropriation of "8 per cent of gasoline tax fund, arising under Legislative Bill No. 158". This particular provision was by virtue of an amendment made in committee of the whole, which the printed journal shows to be, as stated in the enrolled bill. We cannot go beyond the legislative journal, under our law, in order to correct an error in the enrolled bill. However, we have had exhibited to us by the secretary of the legislature, the original amendment as presented in the committee of the whole, and this shows that as originally typewritten, it read; "appropriation of a per «ent of gasoline tax fund, arising under Legislative Bill No. 158". This was changed by an employee of the legislature, who wrote the figure "8" over a with a red lead pencil. The discrepancy was not noticed when the amendment was adopted. The net result, therefore, is that the tax will be collected on the 10% basis, but only 8% will be available for state assistance fund purposes until the legislature again acts. The error is so palp - able and the Governor and other authorities feel so sure that the leg - islature will take steps to correct the same, that they have adopted the following measures: Under our law an appropriation is available to be drawn against, to the amount of i/ 8 thereof, in each quarter during the biennium commencing July 1, after the adjournment of the legislature. How - ever, In case of emergency the Governor may approve a request made through the State Auditor to exceed the expenditure of i/ 8 of the total in any quarter. Said request has been made and the Governor has authorized expenditures for the current quarter on the same basis as would be made if the whole 10% were presently available. This course, if pursued during ensuing quarters, will, of course, reduce the amount available in the final quarters of the biennium. How - ever, the legislature meets some six months before the expiration of the biennium and it is anticipated that they will, by emergency leg - islation, provide for the immediate appropriation of the 2% collected and now unavailable because of the error to which we have above referred. Should the legislature refuse to act, the fund would, of course, be depleted and payments could not be made on the present basis, but would have to be reduced. But the administrative officers, including the Governor, regard this contingency as being unlikely to happen. This office regards the action of the Governor and administra - tive officers as being a matter of policy wholly within their discre - tion. </seg>

Vandemoer, Director of Assistance/ State House. Dear Mr. Vandemoer: Reference is made to your letters of October 18, and September 2 and, also, letter enclosed from Mr. Reed O'Hanlon of date August 24, in which he says; "We have been requested by the Grand Lodge Independent Order of Odd Fellows of Nebraska, to advise them as to the eligibility of certain of their members for old age as - sistance. This Order maintains a home at York, Nebraska, for aged members of the Order, their widows and orphans. The majority of the inmates of this home are now aged people. We have been furnished with information from other states as to the same situation. Our attention has also been called to a ruling of the attorney general of Ne - braska, dated February 12, 1936. "From this information and from a letter written by Mr. A. J. Guendel, formerly State Assistance Director, dated February 21, 1936, to the Assistance Director of Washing - ton County, In regard to another home, we gather that the general ruling on this subject is somewhat as follows: "Guests who have entered such a private home by property settlement upon entering have made a specific contract with the home for their maintenance and are therefore, inel - igible for a pension. Those who entered purely on a charity basis can make application for the maximum amount of county assistance to the local county board and the board should treat this application the same as that of any aged • person not living in such a home, and could make an al- </seg>
            <seg id="p133">opinions ; lowance up to the maximum of $30 a month if they so desired. "In connection with the first quotation above made, we find that in other states they have modified the rule in regard to property settlement that where the amount of property turned over to the home has been exceeded by the value of the care rendered, then the assistance board has taken that factor into consideration and has frequently declared the applicant eligible for such old age assistance. "I would appreciate your comments on this situation, and in particular, whether the ruling of the attorney general as of February 12, 1936, setting forth in more detail the gen - eral rule above outlined still remains in force." I am in agreement that inmates of such homes are not to be deprived of relief payments, subject to deductions for care paid for by contract and, also, subject to . compliance with the provisions of Section 68-258 Compiled Statutes, Supplement 1937, as to income and resources. I am not, however, completely in accord with the implication in Mr. O'Hanlon's letter and in the former Attorney General's opinion that residence in the home necessarily acts to establish residence in the county where the home is located. I enclose herewith copy of opinion given to Mr. John S. Gewacke, County Attorney of Fillmore County of date July 29, 1938, in which this matter is dealt with. This opinion does not, however, effect the question as to whether the inmate is entitled to relief, but only as to what county should be held liable.

            <seg id="p136">REPORT OP ATTORNEY GENERAL We do not believe this action (which resulted In emergency appropriations at the end of the 1935-7 blenrilum) was justified. ■ The account set up by the former state treasurer had its orig - inal thus: Chapter 155 and Chapter 161, Laws 1935, imposed an additional ltf per gallon tax on motor vehicle fuel, for the benefit of state assistance. These laws were declared invalid by our supreme court. The taxes collected under them had been paid to the State Treasurer, deposited by him in state depositories and mingled with other state funds. He had carried an account termed "State Assis - tance Fund" on his books, to which he had transferred credits from the gas tax monies as collected, and against which some warrants had been drawn and paid. The balance in this account as shown by his books when the law was declared Invalid was $1,112,675.97, which he then designated as "State Assistance Fund (old)." By Chapter 17 and Chapter 18, Laws (Special Session) 1935, this invalid tax was retained and recaptured for the benefit of the State of Ne - braska, and directed to be credited to the General Fund. Whether this law was effective, we need not now consider. In any event, the legislature did not attempt to reappropriate the avails of the invalid gasoline tax to the state assistance fund. Instead they made a new and distinct appropriation for state assistance out of the general fund. This should have been recognized. The State Treasurer had no more right to curtail the appropriations for State Assistance upon his books than he would have had to refuse to pay the Governor's salary, which is likewise payable from the general fund. We are satisfied that the error made by your predecessor should be corrected, that you should carry this appropriation on your books in accordance with the legislative acts, and should honor it to thb same extent as other appropriations from the general fund. As we understand it, the (former state treasurer's action was caused by certain litigation instituted by dealers in motor vehicle fuels seeking to recover the taxes they had paid under the laws de - clared invalid. Although these dealers seek to follow these taxes as trust funds, we are strongly of 'opinion that any recovery they may have must be against the state generally, and not for any particular fund or monies. While we do not believe there will be any recovery, nor that any trust will be fastened on the State'B General Fund, yei. we realize that you and your bondsmen are entitled to be protected, not only against probabilities, but against possibilities. We believe that in a conference with you and your bondsmen we could arrive at some definite agreement as to what is necessary to be </seg>
            <seg id="p137">OPINIONS done to protect you from liability. The amount claimed in pending suits does not exceed |117,000 exclusive of interest, and our supreme court Is committed to the theory that each and every one affected must sue for himself. As to void taxes, every tub must stand on its own bottom. Besides this, th^ last legislature cut off all claims not in litigation by a statute of limitations. (L. B. 49, Nebraska 1937, S.C.J. 48). Since the practical problem is to agree as to what sue! shall be the irreducible minimum to which the General Fund may be reduced before registering warrants, we should not find it hard to reach a solution. Of course, if we cannot arrive at an agreement after conference as suggested, we shall feel impelled to proceed by mandamus to com - pel compliance with the law. We feel, however, that your desires and ours are at one, namely to carry out the intention of the leg - islature as to the expenditure of monies appropriated and we trust you will co-operate with us as suggested.

A portion of the money raised for the State Assistance Fund was, as stated in your letter, designated on the treasurer's books as "State Assistance Fund (old)", and that portion of the State Assis - tance Fund has never been drawn against, and is still carried on the treasurer's books under said designation in the amount of $1,112, 675.97.

Dear Sir: We have your letter of August 24, relative to Mrs. Josie Imm, who claims to be a resident of Harlan County, but who has been in California since February 23, 1936. It Is our opinion that this rule would apply with regard to grants for old age assistance than to apply in case of legal settlement for general purposes, or for the purpose of relief from the county poor farm. Under Section 25, Chapter 28, Session Laws (Special) 1935, it is provided as follows: "***If he removes from and resides continuously outside this state for one year, his assistance certificate shall be cancelled.***" It is our opinion that this section is effective, and if this party has been out of the state since February 23, 1936, she is no longer entitled to old age assistance from Nebraska.

Dear Sir: You state that it is proposed in some of the counties to make levies for the purpose of supplementing the fund distributed to such counties under the provisions of Section 13, Chapter 20, Laws of Nebraska, Special Session 1935.

In order that these sections may both be given effect, it would be necessary that the funds raised by the county be used as supple - mentary to funds supplied by the state. It should, of course, always be kept in mind that funds cannot be raised by the county except for purposes which the law may authorize. The net result would be that, for instance, as to old age assistance, the .county might not augment the state's monies, since there is no provision for counties to levy money for that purpose. There are, however, purposes for which the county may levy money and for which the State Assistance Committee also supplies money and in such instances the county's monies may be used to supplement the state's monies. !'■■"■ ■ ■ ■ EDWIN VAIL, Assistant Attprney General .■'■■' : " ."'■'.- • ' " ' ' !'

Under these circumstances we think it would be entirely proper for a reasonable portion of the funds derived from the proceeds of this one mill levy to be expended for the purposes indicated. EDWIN VAIL, Assistant Attorney General . . . ■ ■ j COUNTY TAX IiEVY. May 7, 1938. Mr. J. H. Falloon, County Attorney, Falls City, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In yours of the 30th ult. you refer us to the statutory provis - ions authorizing county boards to levy taxes for county fair purposes, for the soldiers' relief fund, and for the mothers' pension fund and for the emergency relief fund. You ask whether or not the levies for those four purposes must be Included within the 3% mill limit provided by section 77-1801, Comp. Stat. Supp. 1937, as the maximum rate of tax which may be levied for county purposes in counties of over nine thousand population. It has always been the opinion of this office that the levies for mothers' pension fund, for the soldiers' relief fund, and for county fair purposes must be included within said 3% mill limit. The other item as to which you Inquire is the levy for unem - ployment relief which is authorized by special acts of the 1937 leg- </seg>
            <seg id="p142">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL islature now appearing as sections 77-1823-1825, Comp. Stat. Supp. 1937. These sections authorize county boards, at their option, to levy a tax of not to exceed one mill during the years 1937 and 1938, for the relief of unemployed and indigent persons. The sections were enacted as an emergency measure of a temporary nature only, and specifically provide that such levy may be made "notwithstanding any more general or special laws on the subject of revenue on maximum levies in force in this state." It is our opinion that the legislature intended to permit county boards to make this 1 mill levy over and above the 3% mill limit aforesaid, and therefore that such levy may be made Irrespective of said 3% mill limit. This fact should, however, always be borne in mind in connection with the making of county tax levies, that under section 5 of article $ of the Constitution, county boards may never levy taxes the ag - gregate of which shall exceed 50 tf per $100.00 of actual valuation ex - cept for the payment of indebtedness existing at the time the constitu - tion was amended in 1920, unless such excess shall have been authoriz - ed by a vote of the people of the county. Hence, the emergency relief levy of 1 mill so authorized by the 1937 legislature cannot under any circumstances be used or levied so as to increase the aggregate levy to an amount over the constitutional limit so provided. FRANCIS V. ROBINSON, Assistant Attorney General. PERSONAL TAXES OF RESIDENTS ON MILITARY RESERVA - TION — . June 5, 1937 J. A. Capwell, County Attorney, Plattsmouth, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Capwell: Replying to your letter of the 28 th, In which you inquire whether an army officer is obliged to pay personal property tax on his auto - mobile when he applies for license on same and, also, whether or not he is required to pay personal property taxes on other personal property which he maintains on the military reservation at Ft. Crook, Nebraska. Your attention is called to an act of 1893, which now appear a in the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929, as Section 72-601 tu </seg>
            <seg id="p143">OPINIONS 605 inclusive, whereby the State of Nebraska grants to the United States of America, the right to purchase lands for certain purposes, namely, the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals and other needful buildings. We assume that the military reservation at Ft. Crook, Nebraska, comes within the provisions of this act, and the acts of 1887 and 1889. The act of 1889 was an attempt to amend the law of 1887 by a specific reservation as to taxation, the provision being as follows: "That nothing in this act shall exempt any property within the limits of said military reservations belonging to any civilian therein from assessment, levy and collection of tax which would otherwise be subject to taxation within Nebraska, except the personal property of the officers and enlisted men in the service of the United States who may be stationed on said military reservations, the said personal property being owned by said officers and enlisted men for their comfort and convenience." The State of Nebraska, having already ceded jurisdiction over the tract in question, we entertain grave doubt concerning the at - tempt to qualify the cession by the act. However, you will note that the property of officers and enlisted men in the service of the United States are specially exempt and, therefore, we need not consider this question. It would seem clear then, that the act of 1889 which reserved the right as to taxation, did not go so far as to include the personal property owned by officers and enlisted men, and It is, therefore, the opinion of this office that personal property belonging to officers and enlisted men in the United States service, situated on the -military reservation, is not subject to taxation by the State of Nebraska. It is further our opinion that an officer or enlisted man, who actually resides on the military reservation in question, during the time when the assessment of personal property is to be made, according to the statute, need not pay any personal tax for that year when applying for an automobile license on the car which he owned at that time. BARLOW NYE, Administrative Assistant ACTION BY COUNTY BOARD OP EQUAUEBATION AFTER JULY 10. July 19, 193g Mr. Julius D. Cronin, County Attorney, O'Neill, Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p144">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ' : '[ V • Dear Mr. Gronin: We are in receipt of your letter of July 15th in which you say: "Will you please forward; me the opinion of your office on this question: 'Has the County Board of Equalization the power to hold hearings and equalize assessments by rais - ing or lowering valuations after the 10th day of July ot this year?" 1 While this question has not been directly involved in any ad - judicated case which we have had the opportunity to examine, the court in Hiller v. Unltt, 113 Neb. 612, made an expression as to the extent of the jurisdiction of the County . Board of Equalization iu such matters and this was approved in Missouri P. R. Corp. v. Board of Equalization of Richardson County, 114 Neb. 84. In the Hiller case it was held: "The jurisdiction of a county board of equalization is lim - ited to a session of 20 days, but it may adjourn from day to day or from time to time, and its jurisdiction will continue until such time as will enable the assessor to forward a copy of the assessment to the state board of equalization on or before July 10, of each year ." (114 Neb. 84-86) Speaking with Mr. W. H. Smith, the tax commissioner, he states that never in his experience has any county sought to raise or lower its assessments after the abstract was made up and forwarded to the board, as the law requires to be done by July 10th. The adoption of such a practice would lead to infinite difficulties and from a con - sideration of the statute it would seem conclusive that it was intend - ed that the jurisdiction of the County Board of Equalization ends when the abstract is prepared and sent out. EDWIN VAIL, Assistant Attorney General LIEN OF REAL ESTATE TAXES May 28, 1937 Mr. Carroll Thompson, County Attorney, Fullerton, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Thompson: In your letter of May 8th, you state that the Loup River Public </seg>
            <seg id="p145">OPINIONS Power District acquired title to various parcels of Nance county land for right of way in August and September 1936; that the 1936 tax levy had then been made on these lands; that the former owners of the lands refused to pay the taxes and, presumably, the power dis - trict likewise refused to pay these taxes. You inquire whether or not the former owners of the lands are liable and, if not, what should be done to correct the tax books. The former land owners are, of course, not liable for the pay - ment of these taxes. "A land tax creates no personal liability against the owners of the land. Such tax must be collected, if at all, by a sale of the particular tract against which it is charged and upon which it is, by the statute, made a specific lien." Toy v. McHugh, 62 Neb. 820. At the time the Loup River Public Power District acquired title, the 1936 tax was not a lien upon the lands under the provisions of section 77-1959, Comp. St. Supp. 1935. Taxes on real property do not become a lien thereon until the first of January next following the date of the levy. This property therefore passed to the power district, free of tax liens. The power district, organized and exist - ing under and by virtue of S. F. No. 310 of the 1933 legislative ses - sion, is a governmental subdivision of the state within the meaning of the provisions of section 77-202, Comp. St. 1929, exempting from taxation all property of the state and governmental subdivisions. These lands, therefore, became tax exempt when the power district acquired title thereto. In our opinion the 1936 taxes, assessed against these lands, are not collectible from any source, and notation should be made on the tax books for that year to the effect that the properties became tax; exempt before the attachment of the lien of the 1936 taxes.' So long as the power district owns the properties, these properties should be removed from the tax rolls. FRANCIS V. ROBINSON, Assistant Attorney General </seg>
            <seg id="p146">I REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL TAXATION OF AUTOMOBILES. March 7, 1938 Mr. Clair D. Johnson, Treasurer, Fremont, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Johnson: ; i :••'■:•'"■■! We acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 4th in which you refer to two specific sets of facts which have been called to your attention. Both instances mentioned in your letter are practically identical in nature. In each case an automobile owner of Nebraska, after obtaining his 1937 registration certificate, drove his automobile into another state and was there required to take out a license and to pay a tax on the automobile in accordance with the laws of the state into which he had driven the vehicle. He now desires to obtain a 1938 registration certificate in Ne - braska and does not wish to pay the 1937 personal property tax levied in Nebraska on the automobile because of the fact that he has paid personal property tax on the same in the foreign state. You inquire wlfether or not there is any relief which .can be afforded him under these circumstances. Personal property in Nebraska is taxable as of April 1st of each year. We assume that the automobile involved was returned for tax purposes in the tax schedule submitted by the owner of the car as of April 1, 1937. Taxes have been levied in Nebraska upon the . basis of that schedule and must be paid by the owner of the vehicle irrespective of the fact that he may also Gave paid taxes on the same vehicle in another state. This may seem to be working a hardship upon individuals in specific cases. . However, the law is well settled in this respect. In order that you may more clearly understand the reasoning whicii forms the basis for such a rule, we quote briefly from 26 R. C. L. 264: "Thus property may be taxed in a state in which it has a situs for taxing purposes, although it is also taxed in another state. No doubt it would be a great advantage to the county and to the individual states if principles of taxation could be agreed upon whicK did not conflict with each other, and a common scheme could be adopted by which taxation of substantially the same property in two Jurisdic - tions could be avoided.

FRANCIS V. ROBINSON, Assistant Attorney General ATTORNEY'S FEES FOR COLMJCTION OF SCHOOL AND OTHER POMTICAIi SUBDIVISION TAXES BY COUNTY. September 9, 1937. Honorable Charles W. Taylor, Superintendent of Public Instruction, Building. Dear Sir: We have your letter enclosing a letter received from the pres - ident of the board of education of the North Platte school district with reference to the deduction of attorney's fees by Lincoln County from the amount realized in tax foreclosure proceedings before re - mitting the proceeds of such proceedings to the school districts, cities, villages and other governmental subdivisions entitled thereto. You advise that Lincoln County has employed attorneys who are. to be paid 7% from the taxes collected in such proceedings, and ask whether or not such expense may be properly deducted by the county and pro rated against the taxes due such governmental subdivisions. We are advised that the county board of Lincoln County and perhaps other .county boards in this state, have, upon petitions of ten freeholders of such counties, employed attorneys, pursuant to the provisions of section 26-903, C. S. 1929, to collect delinquent real property taxes and to bring foreclosure actions in proper courts for such purposes, and have agreed to pay such attorneys for said services 7,% of the total amounts collected. We observe that the president of the school board referred to assumes that such contracts are not valid and binding upon the county. But, in our opinion, there is nothing illegal or invalid in either the circumstances of form of such contracts so long as the fee arrangement is reasonable ana fair. The county board is, we believe, fully authorized to enter into a .contract with an attorney whereby the attorney is employed to' assist the county attorney, in appropriate proceedings for the col - letion of delinquent taxes. </seg>
            <seg id="p148">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 1 ■';■■■■■'. It is not our purpose to pads upon the question of whether or not a fee equal to 7% of the amount actually collected is fair and reasonable. We call attention, however, to the statute applying to foreclosure of tax sale certificates, which provides fhat an attorney fee equal to 10% of the total amount of the decree shall be taxed as a part of the costs and recovered by the plaintiff. Having concluded that the county may, in the manner described above, employ attorneys for the collection of delinquent taxes, we next consider the original question of whether or not the fees to be paid to such attorneys for said services can be deducted from all of the taxes collected, before distribution is made, including taxes of: school districts, cities, villages' the state and other governmental subdivisions. The alternative would be, of course, to hold that the &lt;county alone is liable for the payment of said fees. It is provided by law, and Nebraska decisions have held that the tax collecting agency a/sts as j trustee of an express trust for all of the governmental subdivisions, for whom the tax is collected. This rule applies especially to the foreclosure of tax sale certificates issued to a governmental subdivision without the payment of a price therefor. In such cases, it has been held that the county or muni - cipality enforcing the lien evidenced by said certificate is responsible to the other governmental subdivisions for the amount of the revenue realized, and no more. it would naturally follow then, that the beneficiaries of the trust (governmental subdivisions entitled to share in the tax) would be, liable for the pro rata share of the actual cost and expenses of the collection, to include costs and expenses of any necessary B uits, which of course would include reasonable attorney's fees. The net proceeds of puch collections are all that need be accounted for. The county is primarily charged with the collection of delinquent real estate taxes. It would be manifestly unfair to require the county, in order to perform the trust imposed upon it by statute, to pay the entire costb and expenses of the collection. It is therefore our opinion that a reasonable attorney fee, in - curred as a part of the expense of the collection of delinquent real estate taxes may be deducted troni the tax before distribution thereof is made to the various governmental subdivisions entitled thereto.

            <seg id="p149">OPINIONS PAYMENT OP ESTATE AND INHERITANCE TAXES April 1, 1937. Mr. Floyd M. Lundberg, County Attorney, Minden, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You say In your letter of March 29: "A question has arisen several times In regard to the interpreta - tion of the third division of Section 77-2201 which commences by say - ing "in all other cases." Some attorneys have interpreted this part of the statute to mean that there is no inheritance tax to pay if the entire estate is less than $500.00. In my opinion this refers only to the beneficial interest received by the legatee and that if the beneficial interest is less than $500.00 then there is no inheritance tax to pay but if the beneficial interest is more than $500.00 then a tax is to be paid." Section 77-2201, Comp. Stat. Supp. 1935, after providing the rate of tax where the property, passes to near kin, and a higher rate when it passes to collaterals, provides: "In all other cases the rate shall be as follows: On each and every hundred dollars of the clear market value of all property and at the same rate for any less amount up to five thousand dollars, four dollars; on all the excess of estates over five thousand dollars and noi exceeding ten thousand dollars, six dollars; on all the excess of estates over ten thousand dollars, eight dollars; on all the excess of estates over twenty thousand dollars and not exceeding fifty thousand dollars, ten dollars; and on all the excess of estates over [fifty thousand dollars, twelve dollars: Provided, an estate in the above case which may be valued at a sum less than five hundred dollars shall not be subject to any duty or tax:**." I think this refers to the entire estate and not the beneficial interest. EDWIN VAIL, Assistant Attorney General. </seg>

You are doubtless familiar with the provisions of these statutes which provide in brief that the owner of a common carrier vehicle for hire, not domiciled in Nebraska or being locally taxed here, shall on or before the 20th day of May of ea/sh year make to the State Board of Equalization a verified statement, showing the aggregate number of miles made by each vehicle during the year ending March 31st and showing the total number of miles made in Nebraska by such vehicle, etc. The board then applies to the value of such vehicle the ratio between the mileage made in this state and the mileage made outside of the state and the pro rata so found shall be the taxable value in the state of Nebraska for the ensuing year. BARLOW NYE, Administrative Assistant COLLECTION OP TAXES UNDER DISTRESS WARRANT. August 20, 1937. Mr. W. L. Brennan, County Attorney, Butte, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Brennan: You say: </seg>
            <seg id="p151">OPINIONS "In the collection of taxes under a distress warrant could a sheriff legally levy upon the $200.00 worth of household furniture exempted under Article Eight, Section Two of the Constitution. "The preposition is this that th"e party owes taxes for previous years upon* property now sold and disposed of and the only property remaining in his hands is the exempt property." It is our opinion that section 2 of Article VIII of the Constitu - tion makes no exemption of the property described from levy under a distress warrant. This provision merely exempts such property from taxation, not from distress for unpaid taxes upon other per - sonal property. Section 20-1556 specifically provides that the exemption men - tioned in Article 15 of Chapter 20 shall not apply in the case of levy and sale for taxes. Section 77-1915, C. S. Supp. 1935, as amended by L. B. 1, 52nd Session, requires distress warrants to be handled in the same manner as executions against personal property. We therefore do not be - lieve that any exemptions can validly be claimed. MILTON C. MURPHY, Assistant Attorney General. COLLECTION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY TAX ON CATTLE REMOVED FROM COUNTY. August 6, 1937 Mr. A. F. Alder, County Attorney, Taylor, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Alder: We have your request for an opinion as to the remedies available for the collection of personal property taxes upon cattle assessed in your county, which cattle are removed therefrom and sol'd before thts taxes thereon become payable. You advise that it is the practice for a number of individuals to bring cattle into your county for spring feeding and to remove such cattle prior to the time the taxes assessed thereon become due and payable. </seg>
            <seg id="p152">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Personal property taxes are payable In accordance with the provisions of section 1, L. B. No. 1, as passed by the last legislature. Said act makes no change in the date such taxes become a lien upon the tax debtor's property as existing under section 77-1959, Comp. St. Supp. 1935: • "Taxes assessed upon personal property shall be a first lien upon the personal property of the person to whom assessed from and after the first day of November next following the date upon which the same are levied and until paid." We are of the opinion that prior to November 1st of the year in which taxes are assessed upon cattle, your county does not have any authority to prevent the removal or to subject the same to said for the taxes being assessed for the current year. The fact that such cattle have been listed and appraised for personal property taxation does not thereby .create any immediate lien or claim upon them that can be enforced against them prior to November 1st. Hardin v. Pavlat, 130 Neb. 829; State v. Nickerson 99 Neb. 517. Regardless of what happens to the cattle, so far as their sale and removal from the county is concerned, it is clear that the taxe B assessed thereon become a "personal liability" of the tax debtor. It is also true that if the property is sold before November 1st, a pur - chaser thereof does not take subject to any lien for such taxes as - sessed during the current year. Wood v. McCook Water Works Company, 97 Neb. 215. It is also true that if the tax debtor has any taxes for prior years upon the same or other property, collection thereof may be made against any cattle that are brought into the county for tem - porary feeding purposes. This is apparent from the decisions review - ed in a recent opinion of this office upon the subject of priority be - tween chattel mortgages and personal tax liens, copy of which opinion is inclosed herewith for your information. It would also appear that where a tax debtor has removed from the county and the sheriff is unable to find property within tht county to satisfy the claim for personal property taxes against such individual, an alias distress warrant may be issued under section 77-1919, Comp. St. 1929, to the county of the tax debtor's residence, where such warrant may be enforced against any available property of the tax debtor. </seg>
            <seg id="p153">OPINIONS i Other possible remedies against a delinquent personal property tax debtor include the bringing of a civil suit under section 77-1918, Comp. St. 1929, by the county treasurer upon the direction of the county board, which method is reflected in the decision of Hoover v. Engler, 63 Neb. 689. BERT L. OVERCASH, Assistant Attorney General. RIGHT OF COUNTY TO ACCEPT DEED AS PAYMENT OF TAXES August 10, 1938 Mr. Julius D. Cronin, County Attorney, O'Neill, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You say: "At the edge of the Village of Ewing, in Holt County, there is an irregular tract of land containing about two acres, upon which was formerly situated an old mili. Taxes which have been delinquent for a good many years amount to the sum of $584.80. The present owner of the property is agreeable to deeding it to the county for back taxes, as - suming that the county can accept it. "I am advised that the county has in mind a prospective purchaser for the property who will take it over and pay taxes but who will not pay therefore in excess of about $60. What the present market value of the property is, I do not know, but I am advised it is somewhere in that neighborhood. "Will you let me have the opinion of your office as to whether or not the county may accept a deed to this prop - erty and cancel the unpaid taxes?" I am of the opinion that the county has no legal right to accept a deed to this property without foreclosing the tax lien and as a consideration for the deed, cancel the taxes on the property includ - ing the taxes due the state and the school district.

Bayer, County Attorney, Alliance, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Bayer: You ask our opinion as to whether the purchase of tax sale cer - tificates by county treasurer for the county is invalid by reason of the fact that the public sale of the land for taxes was not kept open until the first Monday of January. You say that the contention has been made that section 77-2013, Comp. St. Supp. 1935, requires that a public sale for taxes be kept open until the first Monday in January. This section relates to the return made by the county treasurer to the county clerk of the real estate sales; and reads as follows: "On or before the first Monday of January following the sale of the real property, the treasurer shall file in the office of the county clerk a return thereon as the same shall appear upon the treasurer's sale book, and such return, duly certified, shall be evidence of the regularity of the proceedings." Prior to the amendment of 1933 (Session Laws, 1933, page 520) the date specified in the section just quoted was December in - stead of January. </seg>
            <seg id="p155">OPINIONS '-» In our opinion there is nothing whatever in this section of the statutes, either before or after the amendment thereto, that requires the public sale of land for taxes to be held open until the final re - port day specified therein. This section merely requires the county treasurer to report the sales made to the county clerk, and by its very language this report may be made "before" the last day specified therein. , Section 77-2006, Comp. St. 1929, seems to be the only statutory provision dealing with the date for beginning and ending public sales of real estate for taxes. This section provides: "On the day designated in the notice of sale the county treasurer shall commence the sale of those lands and town lots on which the taxes and charges have not been paid, and shall continue the same from day to day, Sundays and holidays excepted, until each parcel, or so much there - of as shall be sufficient to pay the taxes and charges there - on including the cost of advertising, shall have been sold or offered for sale." Under the section just quoted the duty to "continue" the sale from "day to day" ends when the property is "sold or offered for sale." This, in our opinion, may be accomplished prior to the final day a report is required to be made by the county treasurer to the county clerk. This conclusion seems to be supported by the general statement of law as found in 61 C. J. 1191, and the language of the court in the case of State ex rel Snow v. Farney, 36 "Neb. 537, which interpreted an earlier statute of this state upon the same subject but materially different from the present section 77-200G. BERT L. OVERCASH, Assistant Attorney General.

September 30, 1937. - Mr. Maynard Grosshans, County Attorney, York, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In your letter of the 28th you inquire whether the county, treas - urer should make out a list of all lands and town lots subject to sale, and the amount of delinquent taxes against each, and subsequen - tly proceed to publish the same for sale at tax sale foreclosure, in accordance with section 77-2002, and subsequent sections of the statutes as amended, in cases where certain lands or town lots have in previous years' tax sales been sold for taxes and delinquent interest. It is our opinion that all of said lands and town lots on which there are delinquent taxes remaining unpaid at the time specified in the statutes stated, should be advertised and sold. If the purchaser of the tax sale certificate in any previous years' sale desires to pro - tect his interest against the lien of subsequent taxes, he may do so in the manner provided by the statute, namely by paying the sub - sequent taxes. While there may be some doubt concerning the procedure to be followed where a city or village or other governmental subdivision holds the tax sale certificate for previous years' delinquent taxes, and for which no consideration has been paid, yet it seems that the practical way to handle delinquent taxes on such a piece of real estate would be to list the same in the proper notice and offer it for sale in the manner provided by law. If the governmental agency holding the original tax certificate desires to protect its interests, it could of course do so at the time of the sale. You understand of course, that delinquent taxes during the life of L. B. 1 should be taken to include delinquent interest as provided for in the bill only.

Dear Mr. Henry: In your letter of the 10th you state: "Our County Treasurer has asked me to ask you whether. In view of the new delinquent tax law, in advertising delinquent real estate taxes this fall, he should include taxes levied for years prior to 1936." In reply, it is our opinion that all delinquent taxes should be included in the tax sale. Interest on the taxes sold, however, should be in accordance with the provisions of the act, namely to include delinquent interest from the effective date of the act only. If the tax sale certificate is bought by a private individual, he of course .could not collect more interest than he had paid. The county could not in the future collect any Interest. The actual sale of the taxes would constitute payment of the taxes to the county. A different situation would, of course, obtain if the tax sal6 certificates were purchased by a governmental subdivision. Such a sale does not, of course, constitute payment of. the tax, but is merely a remedy provided by statute for collection of the tax. BARLOW NYE, Administrative Assistant. FOBECLOSUBE OP TAX SAIiE CEBTIFICATES — REDEMPTION June 21, 1938. Mr. Arthur A. Weber, County Attorney, Bassett, Nebraska. Dear Sir: p You request our opinion as to certain points in .connection with the foreclosure of tax sale certificates by your county. The first question raised is with reference to the right of an owner of property to redeem same in connection with such proceed - ings. You ask whether the owner can redeem by paying the amount </seg>
            <seg id="p158">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL of the payment made for such property at the foreclosure sale. Section 77-2041, C. S. S. 1937, sets forth the procedure to' be followed in the foreclosure of tax sale certificates. This section pro - vides that such action may be brought by the county or other gov - ernmental subdivision any time after obtaining the certificate and specifies that the owner may redeem his property "within two years from the date of sale under such foreclosure proceeding, by paying to the clerk of the district court, for the use of tne purchaser at such foreclosure sale, his heirs or assigns, the amount for which such land sold at such foreclosure sale, with interest thereon at the rate of twelve percent per annum from the date of such purchase at such foreclosure sale to the date of redemption, and the cost of suit." In accordance with the foregoing provision, it is our opinion that the owner may redeem by paying the amount bid for his real estate together with the specified interest and court costs. The right of the owner in such a case is not to be confused with his rights where, instead of a foreclosure of a tax certificate, the county has merely foreclosed its tax lien under section 77-2039, -C. S. S. 1937. In the latter proceeding, the owner can redeem only by paying the entire amount of his tax, as held by our supreme court in the following cases: Douglas County v. Village of Ralston, 133 Neb. 834, 277 N. W. 341. City of Plattsmouth v. Hazzard, 132 Neb. 284, 271' N. W. 801. Commercial Savings and Loan Association v. Pyramid Realty Com - pany, 121 Neb. 493, 237 N. W. 575. You further advise that your practice is to hold the tax sale certificate for two years after it is received from the county treasurer, and then institute foreclosure proceedings. You ask whether or not the county need wait such a time before instituting such action. Under section 77-2041 above quoted, it is specifically provided that the county may institute such action immediately, but if it does so, the owner of the property is entitled to redeem same under section 3, Article 8 of the Constitution within two years of the date of the foreclosure decree therein. It is wholly a matter of choice whether the county holds the certificate two years before instituting action or whether it institutes action immediately and then waits two years before completing same.' Peterson v. Swanson, 133 Neb. 164, 274 N. W. 482. It is of course unnecessary for the county to actually pay any money for /certificates issued to the county. </seg>
            <seg id="p159">OPINIONS In connection with the practice to be followed in such pro - ceedings, you call attention to section 20-1530, C. S. 1929, and make certain Inquiries to the effect of such statute. That section of the statutes pertains to the sale of real estate under execution for taxes and in our opinion has nothing whatever to do with the foreclosure of tax sale certificates. BERT L. OVERCASH, Assistant Attorney General. RE: CANCELLATION OF INTEREST ON SPECIAL CITY ASSESS - MENTS. May 12, 1938. Mr. Bern R. Coulter, County Attorney, Bridgeport, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Coulter: We have your letter of May 6 enclosing copy of the ordinance of the City of Bayard, Nebraska, which in effect cancels all delin - quent interest on special assessments heretofore made by the city for the purpose of paying the bonded indebtedness created by the special assessment ordinances of that city. We enclose herewith copy of an unofficial opinion of this office under date of May 9 and also copy of an opinion under date of January 28, both 1938,- which deal with this question. It is the opinion of the undersigned that neither the principal amount due nor the interest on a special assessment may be can - celled or compromised by the city. In addition to the reasons which you give in your opinion, namely that the special assessment is levied for the purpose of creating the fund with which to pay both the interest and principal amount of the bonds, the principal amount of the special assessment equalling the principal amount of the bonds and the interest on the special assessment being necessary to pay interest on the bond, and that therefore attempting cancellation of the interest on the assessment would amount to an impairment of the obligation of the contract, another theory might also be advanced. Under the laws of the State of Nebraska special assessments are, of course, a primary obligation of the city or governmental subdivision. The special assessment, is, of course a lien against the property as- </seg>
            <seg id="p160">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL sessed, and if the amount of assessment is not obtained from the property in event of failure of the owner of the property to pay thb same, the money due on the bonds must be raised by general taxation on! all of the property in the city. This being true, any taxpayer of the city could raise the question in the proper proceeding, whereas a bondholder could not raise the question until the amount due oil the bond was in default.

"I am citing 1938 models as an illustration, the question presenting itself as a result of 1937 cars purchased the lat - ter part of 1938, the tax thereon now being due." When valuation is made on April 1, 1938, one 1938 model will have the same value as any other 1938 model, regardless of whether it was purchased in 1938 or the latter part of 1937,— leaving out of account, of /course, the question of mileage which is not taken into account in arriving at valuations. It occurs to us, therefore, that all 1938 models should be valued the same, regardless of when they are purchased.

In our judgment the legislature intended to cover all the business of the companies affected. Such companies are commonly known as fire Insurance companies, although they write tornado and other closely affiliated forms of insurance, and we think the general term "fire Insurance company" was employed because that is the way such companies are commonly designated. Stated differently, we believe that the legislature here employed </seg>

Dear Mr. Lincoln: By yours of the 28th nit. you make inquiry of this office as follows: "Will you kindly advise me if the clerk of the district court has the power to issue the warrant in criminal cases when the complaint is filed direct in this court." In our opinion it is extremely doubtful whether or not a clerk of the district court has power to issue warrants in such cases. . Under the law in section 29-203, Comp St. 1929, and decided cases, a district judge, as distinguished from a district court, has i the power of a magistrate with respect to enforcement of the criminal laws. Section 29-404, Comp. St. 1929, provides that when a complaint is filed it shall be the duty of the magistrate to issue the warrant for the arrest of the accused. "The issuance of a warrant of arrest is a judicial act." 16 C. J. 299 "Inasmuch as a clerk of court is essentially a ministerial officer, he cannot, without express constitutional or statu - tory authority to that effect, exercise any judicial functions, and the court, it has been held, has no power, in the absence of statutory authority to delegate such matters to the clerk." 11 C.

Attention of Mr. Dosek: ■ - ■- ■ . ' ■ | ■ . Dear Sir: You have submitted to this office a number of questions with reference to the above act, which are set forth as follows: 1. Who are resident land owners within the meaning of this act? Is a joint heir of an estate a resident land owner? The Question of whether or not a person is a resident land owner under the above act must be determined as a preliminary matter for the purpose of deciding whether the petition for the formation of a district contains sufficient signatures. It would appear to us that a determination of who is a resident land owner will be strictly con - strued and that ordinarily a person must be living upon the land and own title thereto in order to be a resident land owner. 2. Is it necessary for all joint heirs in an estate to sign a petition to form a district? We are of the opinion that all persons who are joint owners of the legal title to any land must join in the petition for the formation of a district. 3. Is it necessary that the legal description of highways and rights of way be Included in the petition? It is provided in section 10 C of said act that highways and rights of way, which would receive no benefit under the act, are not to be Included In any district formed. In the ordinary situation we think it will be impossible to include such land within a district formed and therefore no legal description thereof need be contained in the petition. It is, of course, necessary under section 12 for the governmental subdivisions and the various public utilities to put in effect plans to eradicate weeds in any of their properties, ad - jacent to a weed eradication district. 4. May land within a weed eradication district, which is free of noxious weeds, be benefited by the operation of the district and be subject to assessment? </seg>
            <seg id="p164">I REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL We think it will be a question of fact in each case as to whether or not a particular piece of land, free of weeds, will be benefited by the weed eradication operations in the surrounding territory. It is conceivable in some situations that a benefit may be shown, but in all cases it will be a question of proof with reference to the precise situation existing. 5. If objections are made to said assessments and adjustments are made thereon, will It be necessary to have a further hearing upon all other assessments? ! ! The assessment of land under said act is to be made according to a percentage schedule of benefit, which each class of land will receive from the current year's operations. If any land owner suc - cessfully attacks the classification of his land, it will merely mean that his land will be changed from one classification to another but this will not require the re-classification of other lands. I 6. To whom may warrants be issued by a weed eradication district? L Section 11 provides that warrants may be issued for the pur - se of borrowing money and to pay claims and expenses of operating the districts. Such warrants shall be issued in the same manner as warrants have been heretofore issued by school districts and other governmental subdivisions. 7. May a district be enlarged after it is formed? In our opinion there is no provision under this act for enlarg - ing a district except that a district be dissolved and a new district formed to include additional land. 8. Must the supervisors of a district be elected from within the district? Yes. It is specifically provided in section 2f of said act that the supervisors are to be elected at a meeting of the land owners "included in the district." BERT L. OVERCASH, Assistant Attorney General. </seg>

Dear Mr. Tilley: We have your recent letter regarding the study being made by the Nebraska State Planning Board of the question of how to prop - erly protect the capltol environs from encroachment by unsightly enterprises and structures. You advise that a committee has been appointed for the purpose of studying this question at the suggestion of city authorities. iYou ask our opinion as to whether the state legislature has authority to set up restrictions as to use, height, and architecture of buildings immediately surrounding the state house grounds. In your said letter you refer to the fact that the city of Lincoln operates under a home rule charter and you make particular in - quiry as to whether this prevents action by the state legislature. The nature and effect of the home rule charter under which the city of Lincoln operates has been litigated before our supreme court a number of times. Some of these decisions are referred to in the recent case of Eppley Hotels Company v. CiEy of Lincoln, (Filed November 26. 1937). in support of the principle that the purpose of the home rule charter is "to render citizens independent of the state legislature as to all "subjects which are of strictly municipal concern." In applying this rule it has been held that the construction of a municipal watermain is a matter of purely "local and municipal concern." Pester v. City of Lincoln, 127 Neb. 440, and that the matter of Improving streets Is also a matter of only city concern. Salsbury v. City of Lincoln, 117 Neb. 465. On the other hand it has been held that the matter of establish - ing a municipal university Is a matter of state concern, as distin - guished from pure local concern, and that a city, notwithstanding its charter, might establish such a university under state laws Carl - burg v. Metcalfe, 120 Neb. 481. It is recognized that there is no "sure test" in determining whether a matter is of purely local or state concern. Eppley Hotels Company v. City of Lincoln, supra; Carlburg v. Metcalfe, supra. </seg>
            <seg id="p166">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Moreover the decisions acknowledge that a given field may be appropriate for both city and state legislative action. In Consumers Coal Co. v. City of Lincoln, 109 Neb. 51, (quoted and followed in Sandell v. City of Omaha, 115 Neb. 861) in speaking of the rights of the state legislature to enter upon fields already covered, the court said: "It (the charter) may provide for the exercise of power on subjects connected with municipal concerns, which are also proper for state legislation, but upon which the state has not spoken, until it speaks." It is well settled that the powers exercised by the city of Lincoln under its charter must be "consistant and subject always to the Con - stitution and Laws of the State." Consumers Coal Co. v. City of Lincoln, supra. The provisions of the local charter cannot authorize the exercise of power . "contrary to the constitution, or any general statute.*' State ex rel City of Lincoln v. | Johnson, 117 Neb. 301; Schroeder v. Zehrung, 108 Neb. 573; Eppley Hotels Co. v. City of Lincoln, supra. The charter of the city of Lincoln has been construed to consti - tute a "grant of legislative power" and not as merely a limitation upon the exercise of legislative power. In "its proper realm the charter has the effect of a statute." Consumers Coal Co. v. City of Lincoln, supra; State ex rel Herbert v. Anderson, 122 Neb. 738. In applying the foregoing principles to the question submitted by you, we conclude that the matter of zoning or otherwise restricting the construction and use of buildings immediately surrounding the state house grounds is not a matter of pure local concern over which the city of Lincoln has exclusive legislative control. While the capitol building and grounds is situated in the city of Lincoln, it is in reality the property and pride of the citizens of the entire state. We are of the opinion that the state legislature acting for and on behalf of the citizens of the entire state is not precluded by the home rule charter of the &lt;city of Lincoln from taking such steps as the legislature thinks necessary to protect the capitol building and grounds from the effect of uncontrolled building activity in the nearby area. </seg>
