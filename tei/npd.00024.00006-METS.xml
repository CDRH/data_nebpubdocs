ALDRICH, Governor of Nebraska, And the Honorables SILAS R. BARTON, Auditor of Public Accounts, WALTER A. GEORGE, State Treasurer, GRANT G. MARTIN, Attorney General, Members of the State Banking Board SIRS: — In conformity with section 3a, chapter 8 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, I beg to submit herewith the Nineteenth Annual Report of the Secretary of the State Banking Board, covering the period beginning November 16, 1909, and ending November 10, 1910. The banks under your supervision were called upon for four reports of their condition during the year, tabulated .summaries of which appear in this report. Detailed reports of the six hundred and sixty-six banks in active operation and reporting November 10, 1910, together with reports of banks in the hands of receivers, a tabulated summary of the condition of the National Banks of Nebraska on November 10, 1910, compiled from reports made to the Comptroller of the Currency, abstract of the re - ports of the condition of both National and State banks combined for the dates referred to above, and comparative statements for the years 1909 and 1910 will be found in this report. The statements, summaries and comparisons which follow, while indicating a decrease in the volume of totals, at the same time show a healthy and satisfactory condition of the banks under your supervision. In fact when consideration is given to the high price level that prevailed the preceding years and the enormous investments made in land at prices which touched high water mark in this state, the inherent strength of the banks has been fully demonstrated by the soundness of the show - ing made. The year 1910 was marked by a more or less critical condition of various crops during the season, which acted as a brake on a too active desire for investments at what seemed to be a too high level of prices. In conjunction with the critical condition of the crops the influence of E banks generally throughout the year was used to hold within sonable bounds what threatened to be an investment and specu - on craze. The closing of the year sees a return to a more normal view of values and investments, and this Department believes the state has now passed to a more conservative business plane, with the banks in position to care for all legitimate enterprises. All products of agriculture have moved slowly toward market, which has tended to reduce deposits somewhat for the time being, but I believe the near future will see an increase of deposits and a decrease </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT OP THE of loans, placing the banks, as a whole, in a much easier condition, though for the time of year their condition as shown by the last report, is not a subject of criticism. tit is with pleasure that I call your attention to the fact that have closed another year without a single bank failure in the State Nebraska. This of itself is sufficient evidence of the stability of the iks of the state. The recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States seems now to have placed the banking act passed by the State Legis - lature of two years ago on the eve of enforcement. This Department desires to state to your honorable body that it will gladly co-operate with you in carrying out the provisions of that act. With this end in view I feel that I ought to place at your disposal such suggestions as to requirements of that act as will enable you to supervise the banks of the state, so that the purposes and intent thereof may be fully and completely met, and I will mention the following modifications for your consideration and for the consideration of the Legislature now in session : A recent decision of one of the District Courts seems to deny you discretionary power in the issuing of charters to banks. To this De - partment this seems a grave position for the Courts to take, and if legislative enactment will give you that authority it ought to be invoked at the earliest possible moment. Kther feature of the law which appeals to this Department as r subject of revision is that which limits the loans a bank may i eight times its capital and surplus. This will mean a severe hardship not only to the banks of this state, but to all its people at certain seasons of the year. This will be especially true during the crop moving and feeding season when all the available loanable capital of the state is required to market the crops, and aid in the production of the wealth of the state by enabling the Nebraska farmer to sell the finished product in the shape of beef, pork and mutton, instead of the raw pioducts of the farm. The fact that the law requires what is con - sidered a reasonable and safe reserve by the banks at all times, would seem to render this restriction entirely uncalled for. Another feature of the law to which I wish to call your attention is the additional requirements and duties placed on examiners. If these requirements are met and carried out in good faith, and this should be done, then sufficient appropriation should be made to enable them to fully meet these requirements. Provision is also made in the law for the approval by you of depositories of the reserve fund of banks under your supervision. This provision, in the opinion of this Department, will prove unsatis - factory in practice, and the law should be amended to simply give you authority to restrain banks from placing their reserve funds with other banks that in your opinion would not be proper and safe custodians of this fund. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">Et is but just to commend the most excellent services performed by State Bank Examiners and the Department force, each of whom with loyalty and fidelity worked to the interest of this Depart- I desire to especially express my appreciation of the efficient services of retiring members of the examining force, Messrs. C. H. Beau - mont and E. S. Mickey, who have recently resigned their positions as state bank examiners, the first to engage in the banking business in this city, the latter having accepted the office of Deputy State Treasurer. In these changes the Department loses two very proficient and successful examiners. I desire to express my sincere thanks to the Hon. L. G. Brian, W. T. Thompson and Arthur Mullen, members of the Board retiring, and to the Hon. S. R. Barton, still remaining a member of the Board, for the uniform courtesies and assistance to me in the performance of my duties as their Secretary. Yours respectfully E. ROYSE, Secretary State Banking Board. </seg>
