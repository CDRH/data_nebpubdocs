Lincoln, Nebraska,

REPORT OF THE 

urv from sales of Supreme Court Reports, Laws and Duplicate 
&amp; n &gt;ks, $5,114.23 ; total, $5,328.84. During the same period then 
has been drawn from the Treasury £5,214.23, leaving ¦ balanet 
therein to the credit of the Library Fund at this date, §114.61 
Most at the expenditure* have been, as in former years, for tht 
i&gt;&lt; netit of the Law Department, especially in completing the 
of American Report, in procuring such as are not donated b\ 

Er States, and in keeping up new editions and new text-books 
t attention has, however, been, paid to the Miscellaneous Dc 
ment, and some valuable and important books added thereto 

NEW BOOMS AND LIBRARY MANAGEMENT. 

The Library lias been in a state of constant growth, and tht 
cramped quarters it has occupied for so many years in the oh: 
( 'apitol, has interfered with the proper management and in devel 
oping it as a whole. Upon the completion of the new west wiiu 
in the year 1881, the offices of the Secretary of State and Treaa 
urer being vacated in the old building, provision was made fol 
accommodating the Library in those rooms, which it occupies 
during the remainder of that year and until the 1st of the presen 

tith, when rooms were assigned on the north side of the groin 
r of the east wing just completed. 

It is, I believe, the design to have the Library permanently 
;¦•¦(! in one large room in the main building, so that its presen 
position can only be looked upon as temporary. Until it is 8( 
peraanentlj fixed, where the eye of its custodian can take it al 
in at a glance, and ample accommodations given those who dail; 
¦alt its treasures, it cannot attain its legitimate usefulness. 

NEBRASKA DEPARTMENT OF HISTORY 

fome effort has been made to obtain complete lists and tiles 
-. lectures, catalog! of schools, speeches and essays 
•y kind published by citizens of the State, or pertaining 
manner to its history. I an just now mailing circulars </seg>

all State and County officers, to editors of newspaper*, and itc 
prominent citizens, requesting donations of this nature. If these 
efforts could be supplemented by some slight expenditure of money 
for the purchase of any rare and scarce material of this kind, the 
desired result would be obtained much sooner. Itcertainly MW9M 
as if the State should have one place where it could exhibit its own 
literary growth to present and coming generations. Donations 
have recently been made and duly acknowledged as follows :

PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE STATE 

I would suggest that some legislation be had whereby the 
•lishment and maintenance of public libraries in the various 
i and towns would be encouraged. This is of course a 
matter of importance mainly to citizens in the different localities, 
but the State might make donations of its documents, its laws, 
legislative journals, etc., to such libraries and to the libraries 
connected with the various institutions of learning. There are 
v. r\ few libraries in the State now. Omaha and Lincoln are the 
only cities where the libraries are large . enough to call for the 
exclusive services of a librarian. Crete, Brownville, Nebraska

City, and some other cities have small libraries under the control 
of some one citizen or literary or benevolent society, so that the 
number of libraries which would be the recipients of the donation 
suggested, will not now exceed ten or fifteen. 

CATALOG. 

My duties as Reporter and Clerk of the Supreme Court, have 
prevented me from preparing our much needed catalog. It 
will be commenced soon and published during the ensuing year. 

THE GENERAL CONDITION 

of the Library is, on the whole, very satisfactory; but books, 
even with the best of care, will wear out, and the Law Library 
especially shows deterioration. A good many of the books in 
that department need binding now. An appropriation for this 
purpose will be money well spent. A continuation of the same 
liberal policy in caring for the Library, will soon place it second 
to none in the west. 

Very respectfully youn 

GUY A. BROWN, 

State Librarian. </seg>
