            <seg id="p007">Governor Bryan's Farewell Message TO THE MEMBERS OP THE FIFTIETH SESSION OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA January 3, 1035 Ladies and Gentlemen of the Fiftieth Session of the Nebraska Legislature: The constitution of the great state of Nebraska contemplates that an outgoing Governor shall present to the legislature a complete budget covering every expending agency of the state: suggesting the amount of funds with which, in the judgment of the j Governor, such depart - ments or spending agencies should be provided for the ensuing biennium. The chief executive is also expected to submit to the legislative body a review of the activities of the state government during the previous two years, the condition of the state's affairs at the present time, and such recommendations for legislative or administrative action as he feels he should offer. The past four years, especially the past two years, have covered a most unusual period in the state's history. Conditions over which the state government has no control have called for unusual administra - tive activity and also required legislative action that could not have been forecast. Added to the depression, through which the state and nation have been passing for a number of years and which resulted in unemployment of thousands of people, we have been visited, during the past year, with the most severe drouth in the state's history. The municipal, county, state, and federal governments have been making heroic efforts to provide work for the unemployed and to supply the needs of those unable to work or find employment so that no person within the borders of our state should lack the necessaries of life. The low prices which farm products and property have brought in the past few years together with the loss of seventy-five per cent of all crops in Nebraska during the past year have made it not only necessary, but obligatory on the part of the govern - ment officials to lighten to the greatest possible extent every financial burden of the people in the way of cost of government and taxation. When prices of farm products, are low the taxpayers' ability to pay is greatly lessened and the demand that taxes be reduced becomes one of the most important things in the minds of the taxpayers. It has become more and more difficult during the past four years for the people to meet their financial obligations. 1 </seg>
            <seg id="p008">TAXATION In my message to the Legislature, submitted January 8, 1931, it was stated: "The subject of taxation, including possible new taxes m connection with road development and the question of banking as it affects the depositor, were easily the outstand - ing issues of the recent campaign. Owing to the present financial condition, these subjects predominated almost to the exclusion of other issues." I am able to report at this time that a very remarkable showing can be made m the matter of tax reduction. The property taxes levied for state purposes only, for the years 1929 and 1930, which was imme - diately previous to my term, were as follows: 1929 $ 7,645,798.00 1930 7,258,798.00 Total $14,904,596.00 During my first term, the taxes levied by years were as follows: 1931 $ 6,213,419.00 1932 5,974,772.00 Total $12,188,191.00 The taxes levied during my second term by years were as follows: 1933 $ 4,955,147.00 1934 4,321,326.00 Total ? 9,276,473.00 The foregoing figures, m each instance, were based upon the re - turns of the county assessors, to which the levies for the various years were applied. Prom the foregoing it will be observed that there was a reduction of 18 per cent m the taxes levied m 1931-32 as com - pared with 1929-30, while for the years 1933-34 the reduction equaled 38 per cent from the total levied m 192 9-30. The reduction m state taxes, following a reduction m the cost of administration of state affairs, is not the only tax reduction that has taken place. It has been my contention that the state, as the t parent organization, should,! take the lead m such matters and the )■ leadership established by «fe~ state has been followed by the sub - divisions to the extent that^the taxes levied for all purposes have decreased from $59,442,398.97 In 1929 to $42,906,527.94 m 1933, the figures for 1934 not being available. These totals include the taxes levied for state, county, school, city and village, township, and for all special purposes, and the decrease of $16,535,871.03 m the 1933 total from the 1929 total is equivalent to 27 per cent. 2 </seg>
            <seg id="p009">The valuation of the state for taxation purposes In 1929 totaled $3,167,489,300.00, which was only $145, 000, 000^00 under the valuation established in 1921, when it reached the total of $3,312,737,091.00. But since 1929, valuations have been reduced to $2,059,678,928.00, the reduction equaling 35 per cent. This reduction, extending as it did to the smallest sub-division of the state, resulted in a lowering of taxes and in consequence a saving to the taxpayers in many of the sub-divisions where they were already establishing the maximum levy authorized by law. In 1929 the average taxed value per acre of farm lands through - out the state was 138.60, while the average taxed value per acre in 1934 was $24.43, a reduction of $14.17 per acre or 36 per cent. All classes of property shared proportionately in this reduction In valua - tion, however, and in the reduction in the amount of taxes paid as a result thereof. STATE FINANCES While there has been so marked a reduction in the valuation of property for taxation purposes, and in the revenues derived from taxa - tion, nevertheless our state finances were never in better condition than they are today, for we not only have no bonded indebtedness, but we have no registered state warrants and all claims against the state are paid in their order as presented. The financial condition of the state is set forth in the monthly report of the State Treasurer, a copy of the report dated December 1st being shown herewith: 3 </seg>

            <seg id="p011">Too much praise cannot be given to the splendid men and women who compose the staff of the administrative departments under the Governor. They have discharged their respective duties with efficiency and economy, disregarding the length of office hours, in an effort to give the people of the state an administrative service with the least possible delay and at the' lowest possible cost. DEPARTMENT OF BANKING The Department of Banking has operated under unusually dis - tressing conditions during the past few years with such results as will, I believe, be held by any impartial observer to compare favorably with those obtained in any other state or under the national system. At the termination of the bank holiday in March, 1933, 154 state banks were permitted to open unrestricted. This number has now been increased to 301 by reason of restricted banks having placed their affairs in condition to open for unrestricted operation and through the reorganization and consolidation of others. Of the 261 banks - opened on a restricted basis at the close of the 1933 bank holiday, 29 have been liquidated, 77 closed and 159 rehabilitated for normal operation, leaving only 13 still operating under restrictions. As of June 30, 1934, there were carried on the books of the Receivership Division of the Banking Department 359 banks which had been declared insolvent. Of these E. H. Luikart had been ap - pointed as the original receiver of 129, C. G. Bliss the original receiver of 83 and the old Guarantee Fund Commission receiver of 67, 8 banks of this number having been in receivership at the time of the creation of the Guarantee Fund Commission in 1923. The Department of Banking is acting as receiver and liquidating agent of 72 of these banks under the provisions of the 1933 Banking Act. By the terms of that Act the Department of Banking declares the bank insolvent without the necessity of filing a petition in the courts and the depart - men itself is the receiver. This new system results in a considerable saving of expense particularly when there is a change in the superin - tendent of banks for it is not necessary to go into the courts and secure changes in the receivers as the department continues to act as receiver with the new superintendent carrying on the work on behalf of the department. As of June 30, 1934, the cost of receiverships per dollar collected in connection with the administrative receiverships and those in which E. H. Luikart was named as the original receiver was 5.77 cents. In other words, the depositor received approximately ninety-four cents out of every dollar of assets collected. Since January 1, 1933, the affairs of 54 insolvent state banks have been closed up and the receiver finally discharged. During the next year it should be possible to reduce the number of insolvent banks still carried on the books by at least one hundred. 5 </seg>
            <seg id="p012">INSURANCE DEPARTMENT AND DIVISION OP FIRE PREVENTION Due to general business conditions, the business of the Insurance Department has decreased considerably during the last biennium. While sixteen insurance companies have been organized in this state, all on the assessment plan, we have lost eight Nebraska companies due to mergers and consolidations and forty-four foreign companies due to mergers and withdrawals from the state. Thirty-three foreign com - panies have been admitted to do business in Nebraska. The depart - ment has issued 58,718 Insurance agent's licenses, which is about 10,000 less than during the previous biennium. The department has examined 114 companies during this period. The appropriation for the department from tax funds during the biennium was only $15,000.00, the balance of the expenses being paid out of fees col - lected. Under the able supervision of Mr. Lee Herdman as Director, the department has eliminated fly-by-night insurance companies from the state as well as those agents who did not come up to our high standards. The work of the Division of Fire Prevention consists of education, inspection and investigation, all designed to reduce the enormous fire losses suffered annually. The work has been continued on practically the same basis as during previous years although the income of the division, which comes from a tax on the premiums of fire insur - ance companies, has been reduced during the last few years about a third. The Fire Marshal and his deputies make on the average about fifteen investigations of suspicious fires each month and about a thou - sand inspections during the same period. As an example of their work It might be mentioned that they have just completed a check on 6,125 rural schools. DEPARTMENT OP ROADS AXD IRRIGATION Following the adverse economic conditions during the years of 1931 and 1932, there is evidence from records in the Department of Roads and Irrigation of a betterment of general conditions. The total number of motor vehicle registrations in 1933 showed an increase over the previous year which increase has been continued in 1934. During this biennium emphasis was placed on efforts to relieve unemployment by providing jobs for men on read work. The num - ber of men at work by contract and direct lifbor on the federal and state highways was steadily increased fronr^^OO in September, 1933, to a peak of 14,500 in June, 1934, according to reports from the Fed - eral Re-employment Service. It is a conservative estimate that for every direct worker on highways a ratio of 1.4 other men are pro - vided Indirectly with jobs. Accordingly it is estimated that during the past year a monthly average of 18,000 men were employed directly and indirectly on federal and state highway work in Nebraska. C. W. A. activities in Nebraska were started through this department which fur - nished a considerable number of engineers to help organize the work. 6 </seg>
            <seg id="p013">In addition to the men already referred to as employed on regular work, there were at the peak of the C. W. A. program 36,517 persons employed on all C. W. A. projects. The monthly average was 6,065 men. Under the present plan of organization of work divisions by the P. E. R. A., the average number of persons employed on state highway projects has been about 1,000 per month. State funds for highway work were reduced by the last legislature by the transfer of one-half cent of the gas tax from the state to the counties and by the reduction of auto registration fees. Nebraska received, however, $7,828,961.00 of federal funds in 1933 and $4,961,0o0.00 in 1934, pracically all of which is now under contract There has been allocated to Nebraska under the original highway act for expenditure on the federal highway system during each of the next two years, the sum of $2,590,000.00, which must be matched by state funds. This law also provides that any state diverting any auto reg - istration fees or gasoline tax set up for road work in excess of those provided by law as of June 18, 1934, shall be subject to the loss of one-third of the amount of federal funds to which the state was entitled for the fiscal year for which the apportionment was made. Construction work by types obligated by this department from January 1, 1933, to December 31, 1934, totals as follows: Grading __642 miles Re-grading (including grading on paving jobs) _250 miles Paving : 201 miles Bituminous mat surfacing ] _249 miles Gravel surfacing 732 miles Gravel — second course 470 miles Number of bridges ; _297 Number of railroad viaducts 9 Number of railroad subways 3 Highway grade separations ; 1 This work when completed will give Nebraska a total of 7,988 miles of marked and maintained highways including 886 miles of paving, 527 miles of bituminous mat surfaced roads, 5,766 miles of gravel surfaced roads and 809 miles of roads graded, but without surfacing. Particular mention must be made of one phase of the water situation in our state. Due to the water shortage in 1933, which became very pronounced in 1934, the water users of the Platte River Basin suffered greatly as did also some of the water users in other parts of the state. During the last two years, Wyoming appropriators diverted water under authority of the "Wyoming State Engineer disre - garding Nebraska priorities. Conferences between officials of the two states availed nothing. Wyoming officials finally gave notice that priorities in Nebraska would not be recognized until a compact -between the states was made recommending recognition of Nebraska's rights. Suit was therefore initiated in the Federal Supreme Court in Septem - 7 </seg>
            <seg id="p014">ber, 1934, by the State of Nebraska against the State of Wyoming seeking an equitable portion of the water of the Platte River Basin for Nebraska water users. Sufficient appropriations should be made for Nebraska's Attorney General to prosecute this suit successfully, involving as it does the prosperity of a great part of the North Platte and Platte Valley irrigated areas. ' DEPARTMENT OP AGRICULTURE AND INSPECTION It is difficult to compare fairly the receipts and disbursements of the Department of Agriculture and Inspection with those of previ - ous years for the reason that it is now conducting some activities which were not conducted by the previous administrations while other activities formerly under the jurisdiction of this department are now being handled otherwise. Upon my recommendation, the legislature at its last session trans - ferred the collection of state gasoline tax from the State Treasurer to this department. This was done with the object of using the inspec - tion force of the department to aid tax collection and stop the boot - legging of gasoline into the state. In 1D31, the sum of $30,000.00 had been appropriated by the legislature to cover the cost of collect - ing the gasoline tax through the State Treasurer's office. No special appropriation was made for this purpose at all in 1933 after trans - ferring it to the Department of Agriculture and Inspection. During the eighteen months this department has had responsibility for this tax collection, it has collected $1,178,994.52 more than had been col - lected during the previous eighteen months. The bootlegging of gas - oline has been stopped and thus not only has tax evasion in that man - ner been stopped but honest gasoline service stations have been pro - tected against the unfair competition of. bootleg gas. The legislature of 1933 legalized the manufacture and sale of beer and other malt, brewed, and fermented beverages containing not to exceed 3.2 per centum of alcohol by weight and imposed a state tax of ninety-three cents for every barrel containing not more than thirty - one gallons. Under this law approximately 3,200 beer dealers in the state must submit, on forms to be furnished by the department, monthly reports of beverages handled by them. The department must check these reports and compare them with other reports sub - mitted by brewers, importers, and distributors who pay the tax. This procedure involves much detailed clerical work and a rather heavy cost of postage and supplies. Between September 1, 1933, and Novem - ber 30, 1933, the sum of $50,741.62 was collected in tax and from December 1, 1933, to November 30, 1934, the additional sum of $266,384.20, making the total collected to last November 30th, $317,125.82. During that whole period from September 1, 1933, to November 30, 1934, the sum of $20,193.06 has been deposited for expenses and nearly all of that amount so used. 8 </seg>
            <seg id="p015">The Bureau of Animal Industry has made a very commendable record during this biennium in the prevention and eradication of livestock diseases. Their work in connection with the control of anthrax might be mentioned as an example. House Roll 110 passed by the 4 9th Session of the Legislature appropriated $30,000.00 for anthrax control. The law calls for quarantine and treatment by the state of infected herds. From December 1, 1932, to October 30, 1934, 155 quarantines have been issued, 10,519 head of livestock quarantined and 105 cases treated at the state's expense. There was during that period an estimated death loss of 386 head of livestock of all classes. Only $12,745.50 of the appropriation was expended. However, the years 1933 and 1934 have shown a decrease in the number of out - breaks of this serious disease. The appropriation of $30,000.00 would not be excessive in a two year period of much Infection. Local practicing veterinarians' services are used on this work on a per diem basis to assist regular state employees. Inspections have been carried on during the biennium on a larger scale than ever before and at the lowest cost to the taxpayers. For example, 9,570 samples of seeds were analyzed by the Seed Labora - tory from January 1, 1934, to November 1st, which is the largest number of samples ever taken care of in this laboratory in the same length of time. During the last four years, 14,924 cars of potatoes were inspected as compared with 1,4 89 during the previous four years. While we now employ only three chemists in the laboratory instead of four employed under the former administration, the same laboratory during the last four years has completed 47,546 analyses against 17,266 during the previous four years. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH The change in the name made by legislative enactment, upon the recommendation of the Governor, from Department of Public Welfare to Department of Health has been of marked value in clarifying a rather general misunderstanding of the functions of this department. Despite the economic distress of the period and unusual climatic conditions, the public health in Nebraska has continued on the whole to be very good. Our death rate from communicable diseases has been comparatively low. Our death rate from tuberculosis continues to be about one-third the national rate and our state is well to the front with its lowest recorded death rate from diphtheria, continued local efforts to prevent that disease by immunization having been effective. The work of the Health Department has been aided beyond measure by the efficiency with which data in regard to all phases of Its work has been secured, classified, and permanently filed by the Division of Vital Statistics. The educational activities of the department have included the distribution of some 2 60,000 pamphlets pertaining to infant, child and maternal hygiene and venereal diseases. In addition, about 10,000 9 </seg>
            <seg id="p016">circulars and booklets have been distributed having to do with different phases of public health. The Child Welfare Bureau has kept its work for dependent, neg - lected and handicapped children on the same high plane during the biennlum just past. They inspect all homes, hospitals and other insti - tutions caring for such children and gather and furnish to cooperating agencies, information and statistics connected with children needing attention or care. In addition, the case record of the bureau for the two years just past shows 483 new cases handled. DEPARTJIENT OF LABOR AND COMPENSATION* The Department of Labor and Compensation has operated during the past biennium on an appropriation of $30,500.00 as compared with $36,000.00 in 1931 and larger amounts prior to that. While there has been a marked reduction in compensation hearings the past two years, the number of accidents, considering the number of persons employed, has not decreased. Agreements and settlements have been more numerous and the cost of litigation thus decreased. A new medical fee schedule adopted in 1933 has lowered medical costs and still provided fair fees to those who rendered the services. The medical practitioners of Nebraska have cooperated with the depart - ment also in bringing down the cost of such services to those injured. In my opinion this department should not be consolidated with the Department of Health as may again be suggested for the reason that the work of the two departments is entirely dissimilar and each should be in charge of those best qualified to handle the particular types of problems arising under them. STATE SHERIFF It has not been intended that the State Sheriff's force should constitute state-wide police nor that they should take over the duties and responsibilities of county sheriffs and local police forces. Rather has it been intended that the State Sheriff's ofTice should be a clearing house for crime reports and information and an agency through which city, county and federal law enforcement departments might cooperate in the suppression of crime. While recommending a very great reduc - tion in practically all appropriations to the session of the legislature two years ago, I did not think it best at that time to reduce the already slender appropriation for this office. The reduction of one - third which was made by the legislature has seriously handicapped the State Sheriff in his efforts to assist the police forces of the state fn the prevention of crime and the arrest and conviction of criminals. During the last biennium a total of 1,4 06 crimes have been re - ported to the State Sheriff's office. During that same period 659 arrests have been made for offenses including arson, bank robbery, forgery and murder, 356 of such arrests, or the largest single group, being for violation of the liquor laws. 10 </seg>
            <seg id="p017">The Attorney General's office, the County Attorneys, County Sher - iffs and other law enforcement agencies of the state have cooperated in a very efficient and harmonious manner to achieve the splendid results that have been brought about in the enforcement of law, reduction of crime and a better public recognition of the importance of making our state a safer and better place in which to live. GAME, FORESTATIOX AND PARKS COMMISSION At the beginning of the biennium a ten-year program was adopted by the Game, Forestation and Parks Commission of which the Governor is Chairman. Its purpose was to develop and execute a business and scientific plan of management of all outdoor resources of our state. This plan has gone forward although the receipts of the commission from the sale of hunting and fishing permits which constitute practi - cally the entire income of this commission, no part of which income comes from Uk^es, were considerably less than the receipts of previ - ous years. The commission had on hand December 31, 1932, the sum of $28,839.21 to which were added during the two-year period receipts of $300,364.03, making a total of $329,203.24. Expenditures during the biennium amounted to $313,008.23. The interest of our people in the program of the commission and their active and patriotic support was evidenced during the present administration by the adding of a new park. This was made possible through the cooperation of the American Legion and citizens of Dixon County who donated 200 acres to the state. This park is located on the upper Missouri in his - tori; trapping country. It is now under construction and will be finished during the summer of 1935. ATHLETIC COMMISSION The work of the Athletic Commission continues to be operated at a net profit to the state and with satisfaction to those who are inter - ested in athletics and recreation. The receipts for the year from July 1, 1933, to June 30, 1934, from license fees amounted to $7,522.15, while the expenses were only $5,958.33. NEW LEGISLATION During the past four years I have been advocating a number of progressive Democratic measures for the benefit of the taxpayers in Nebraska and to promote the general welfare of the public. I recom - mended many of these measures to the legislature in 1931, but that body being overwhelmingly Republican in both branches it was almost impossible for a chief executive who affiliated with another political party to get any legislation passed. Two years later, however, the voters of the state elected a Democratic legislature as well as all Dem - ocratic state officers and re-elected the chief executive. The Demo - cratic administration which is just now terminating its services enacted 11 </seg>
            <seg id="p018">more progressive legislation for the people and brought about more economies and tax reduction during the past two years than has prob - ably been done in any twenty-five years of the state's history combined. In order to meet unusual conditions numerous emergency measures were enacted and many administrative policies inaugurated. BOARD OP CONCILIATION Recognizing conditions as they affected agriculture in particular and industry in general, I created what is known as the State Board of Conciliation by proclamation on January 30, 1933, composed of the following members: Win. H. Smith, Seward, Chairman, State Tax Commissioner H. G. Keeney, Omaha, President, Farmers Union H. C. Parmenter, Yutan, President, Holiday Association C. X.. Dietz, Broken Bow, President, National Grange P. P. Ceder, Genoa, President, Farm Bureau Federation Louis S. Clarke, Omaha, President, Mortgage Bankers Association Stanley Maly, Lincoln, Banker The purpose of this board was to aid in the adjustment of farm indebtedness. It met on February 3, 1933, at the office of the State Tax Commissioner in Lincoln for the purpose of considering a program and setting up local boards in the various counties of the state. Mr. H. C. Parmenter stated he thought it would be inadvisable for him to serve as a member and withdrew. County Boards were set up in 88 of the 93 counties in Nebraska and reports submitted by 74 of these boards show they considered 651 cases, that they averted 167 foreclos - ures and obtained 102 extensions of mortgages. The Nebraska State Board of Conciliation was one of the first of its kind in the entire United States and following the change in the national administration in March, and the recommendation that debt adjustment organizations be established in the various states, the plan adopted in Nebraska was used, with that of the other organizations then in existence, as a guide by those sponsoring the plan from a national standpoint. Considering the fact that the state and county boards served entirely voluntarily, and were not even recompensed for their expenses until the last three months of 1934, when they were allowed a very small amount from federal emergency relief funds for each regular meeting held during those months, and each case settled during the same period, they have rendered a remarkable service to the people, of the state. Since these boards were established by proclamation rather than by statute, their period of service will automatically terminate with the term of the present Governor. The services rendered were of such a nature, however,' that I am sure my successor will feel justified m continuing the work, either through the existing organization, or one to be set up by him. 12 </seg>
            <seg id="p019">The condition of the banks of the state was so precarious during the latter part of the winter of 1933 that I found it necessary March 4, 1933, to declare a bank holiday; in other words, to close all the banks of the state including national banks in order to avert a general crash of the entire banking system of Nebraska. On March 6, 1933, a general banking holiday was declared by our great President, Frank - lin D. Roosevelt. This bank holiday gave the bankers a breathing spell and enabled many of them to dispose of enough of their liquid assets to bring their institutions back to a solvent condition, and this, fol - lowed by the national bank guaranty of deposits, has put the banking business of the state and nation on the safest and most substantial footing that these financial institutions have .enjoyed for many years past. Also other banking emergency legislation was enacted giving the Governor and the head of the Banking Department unusual powers - which aided greatly in bringing the standard of- our banks in Nebraska to a position recognized by the federal banking authorities as being second to none in the nation. An emergency Insurance act granting extraordinary powers to the Governor enabled the insurance companies of the state to tide over the bank and insurance panic at that time. FARM MORTGAGE MORATORIUM One of the most important and farthest reaching relief measures to distressed farmers was the real estate mortgage moratorium act. This act, known as House Roll No. 600, has been the means of saving hundreds of farms in Nebraska from foreclosure and preventing the owners from being put out on the highways. I recommend that this real estate mortgage moratorium be extended for another two years. TAX PAYMENT MADE EASIER Legislation postponing the time at which taxes would become de - linquent from May 1st to July 1st, 1933, permitted the owners of live - stock, grain, produce, etc., to hold their property and take advantage of the rise in prices during that period and thus Increased their in - comes sufficiently to be equal to all the taxes in Nebraska for several years. A law was passed permitting the payment of one-half of the taxes in the spring and one-half in the fall which gives the taxpayers the use of one-half their tax money for six months longer and enables them to take advantage of any summer rise in the price of agricultural products. An act was passed to permit installment payment of delinquent taxes which is proving a great aid in the settlement of delinquent taxes. INTEREST RATES REDUCED The reduction of the interest rate on delinquent taxes from ten per cent to seven per cent and the reduction from twelve per cent to nine 13 </seg>
            <seg id="p020">percent on interest after the taxes are sold is worth hundreds of thou - sands of dollars annually to the taxpayers. Legislation was passed reducing the legal interest rate from eight per cent to six per cent and the contract interest rate from ten per cent to nine per cent. In my judgment this contract interest rate could be further reduced to advantage of both the borrower and the lender. The repeal of the deficiency judgment law has great possibilities for good In the protection of property owners who are unfortunate enough to have to give mortgages. This act, however, should be strengthened so that it cannot be evaded. Among other of the many recommendations made in the Gover - nor's message two years ago that have been enacted into law were removal of the party circle from the ballot, abolishing the library commission by transferring the activity to the University of Nebraska, abolishing the bureau of securities, the bank commissioner and county assessors, repeal of the truck law, and the approval of the national lame-duck amendment to the constitution. PAUTY PLEDGES KEPT Among the Democratic state platform pledges that were enacted were the real estate re-valuation to bring tax reduction, state, county, municipal, and school district; repeal of the code law; banking legis - lation to continue the centralized receivership plan for failed banks which has increased the salvage to the depositors of failed banks from approximately twenty-eight per cent to upwards of sixty-five per cent. Under the general party pledge to lower the cost of government was enacted legislation to reduce salaries of state officers, reduction of official mileage charge, lower witness and jury fees, new school land appraisal, reduction of automobile license fees practically two - thirds, reduction of truck fees, transfer of the gas tax collection from the State Treasurer to the Department of Agriculture and Inspection, legislation to permit county managers and many other similar pieces of progressive legislation. The pledge of the party to repeal the intan - gible tax law was only partially complied with by increasing the tax on intangible property in place of putting all taxation on the same foot - ing so that there would be no discrimination between taxpayers or favoritism. I recommend that this intangible tax law be repealed as pledged to the taxpayers of the state by the party in its 1932 platform. My recommendation to make women eligible for jury service and thus remove the barrier to giving them complete suffrage was not enacted by the legislature of two years ago. I recommend that a bill to that effect be passed by the present legislature. I do not believe that any man will seriously contend that woman is not his equal and that her judgment .would not be as good as his in determining the matter of right and wrong in arriving at a fair and equitable verdict on a jury. 14 </seg>
            <seg id="p021">Ol/I) AGE PENSIONS One of the most important pieces of legislation that I suggested to the legislature in 1933 and also in my message to a former legislature was the matter of old age pensions. The legislature of 1933 established in this state the principle that we arc our brothers' keepers. The prin - ciple of old age pensions has been recognized by the enactment of Senate File No. 111. I consider this the most humanitarian and far reaching in its wholesome effect of any legislation undertaken in this state. In the enactment of this law, however, while the principle is correct, the amount of the tax levy was reduced by the legislature from what was recommended so that it does not produce sufficient funds to pay those indigent persons the full amount as contemplated by the statute. I recommend and earnestly urge that the Nebraska Old Age pension law be immediately amended by making the tax on each per - son between the ages of twenty-one and fifty $1.50 per annum and advisable to make the payment of this old age pension assessment a necessary precedent to voting, the same as a poll tax in many states. The old age pension law is now recognized by the President of the United States as the most important legislation in his program. It is frequently discussed and urged by the President and also by the vari - ous members of his cabinet as of the utmost importance. By amend - ing our state old age pension law as suggested above it will close the poor farms of the state, it will reduce the cost of taking care of those who have reached an age where they or their relatives are unable to care for them. It will permit these unfortunate people, who have done so much during the earlier years of their life to build our state and make it a better place for us and our children, to maintain their self respect, to live among their friends and relatives, to enjoy the educational and social privileges and to continue as patriotic citizens during the few remaining years of their life. It will also take this load off the state and federal relief requirements as the national gov - thon repeal thn poll tax law of this state. I suggest that it might be ernment is now insisting should be done. ABOLISH LAND COMJIISSIONER'S OFFICE Two years ago and twelve years ago as Governor I recommended that the office of the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings be abolished. The duties of this office are so limited and the work bo much of a routine character that the general duties of the office could be discharged through the office of the Secretary of State, and the Board of Educational Lands and Funds should be authorized to em - ploy a secretary and fix his compensation to keep the records and carry out the present duties of the land commissioner as secretary of that board. The abolishment of the office of Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings would lower the cost of state government, shorten the ballot and if my former recommendations had been favorably acted upon some unpleasant experiences of the state would have been avoided. 15 </seg>
            <seg id="p022">APPOINTMENT OP ATTORNEY GENERAL I desire again to call the attention of the legislature to the unwise and impractical governmental plan now in use of electing an attorney general as a constitutional officer. I hope that an amendment to the constitution will be submitted providing for the appointment of an attorney general by the Governor or by the Supreme Court of the state. The attorney general has no duties prescribed by the constitu - tion. He is assumed to serve as the attorney for the executive depart - ments of which the Governor is the chief. When an elected attorney general is of the same political affiliation as the chief executive no serious situations or conditions arise and relations between the attor - ney general and executive officers are, as now, very cordial, satisfac - tory and efficient. Experience has shown, however, that when an attorney general has a different political party affiliation from the chief executive of the state, who is recognized by the constitution as the supreme executive power to speak for the state and to bind the state, very unsatisfactory and inefficient conditions arise and it is possible that the attorney general of a different political party might appear as attorney in state cases against the chief executive or against some of the other executive state officers and leave them without any official legal representation. The salary of an elected attorney general, in order to be in harmony with other state official salaries, necessitates a capable attorney general serving at a financial loss to himself, or a loss to the state in that he might be more efficient as a politician than as a lawyer. GENOA IXDIAX SCHOOL The state of Nebraska has been very fortunate in securing from the federal government without cost what is known as the Genoa Indian School buildings and lands. This property consists of 59 buildings and includes equipment and supplies, 625 acres of grounds and valuable farm lands, at a total estimated value of approximately $536,000.00. When negotiations were under way between the state and federal gov - ernments, the federal government required the state to designate for the consideration of the federal government to what use the Genoa Indian School property would be put if the property were to be turned to the state as a grant. After consultation with the Board of Con - trol, and acting upon their recommendations, the Governor notified the federal government that the property was badly needed by the state and would be used for the purpose of housing the unfortunate state wards who are afflicted with epilepsy, of which the state hospitals and asylums now contain about 300. In addition to the epileptics the Genoa Indian School could probably house an additional 100 persons known as seniles and who are now crowding the insane and feeble minded institutions. The federal government approved the purpose for which the state indicated it desired the Genoa property and com - pleted the grant. In turning this property to the state it was necessary to place it in the hands of the Governor until the legislature could 16 </seg>
            <seg id="p023">make other disposition of it. The Governor, knowing that it was necessary to turn this property to the Board of Control m order to carry out the purpose for which it was conveyed to the state, ap - pointed the Chairman of the Board of Control, Mrs. Nellie G. Benson, as the agent for the Governor and she has, after consultation with the Governor, handled the property, appointed guards to protect the buildings and contents, signed corn-hog agreements, disposed of the state's share of crops, and created and paid the necessary bills to pro - tect and administer this property until it could be officially turned over to the Board of Control. The grant of this property to the state followed the action of the Senate of the United States on January 23, 1934. The housing of 300 epileptics and about 100 senile patients m this institution will separate them from very undesirable surround - ings and house them m. very desirable quarters where they can have more room, fresh air and exercise. In withdrawing these patients from other institutions it will relieve the present serious overcrowded con - dition as well as reducing the maintenance expense of the state asylums where these patients are now housed. In the appropriation bill these arrangements have been taken into consideration. The receipts and expenditures m connection with the Genoa insti - tution during the time it has been m the hands of the state and oper - ated by the Governor through his agent, the Chairman of the Board of Control, are as follows, and the balance on hand will be turned over to the incoming Governor: RECEIPTS: Rent received from Elmer Elm as last half of rent due $ 560.00 Warrant from United States Treasurer on Corn-hog agreement 22.62 Total Receipts $582.62 EXPENDITURES : C. H. Noble — 1 month's salary $ 60.00 Paul R. Miller — 1 month's salary. 75.00 P. P. Ceder — 1 month's salary 75.00 W. A. Kretz— l month's salary. 60.00 The "following checks are m connection with convert - ing 20 acres of corn m the field into ensilage: F. O. Anderson &amp; Son Implement Co. — twine 2.60 A. Thorn — 7 % hours with tractor 7.50 F. D. Eoger— l3 hours with cutter and tractor 9.25 Glen Smith — Corn binder.- 15.00 Victor Larson — Tractor, rack and team 26.15 R. Anderson — 12 hours with rack and team 4.80 F. Strain — 12 hours with rack and team 4.80 17 </seg>
            <seg id="p024">Louis Stenzel — 12 hours with rack and team 4.80 Elroy Widle — 12 hours with rack and team 4.80 C. Gustafson — 6 hours with rack and team 2.4 0 F. Gustafson — 6 hours with rack and team 2.4 0 N Nels Pearson — 12 hours labor- 3.00 Total Expenditures ; $357.50 Balance on hand $22 5.12 (In addition to the above payments there are a number of outstanding bills yet unpaid as the above balance is not sufficient to take care of them.) I recommend, therefore, that in compliance with the plans and conditions submitted by the state to the federal government and ap - proved by them as a condition to the granting of the Genoa property to the state that the legislature pass a suitable act transferring the Genoa Indian School property to the state Board of Control for the housing of epileptics and senile patients and that suitable appropria - tions be made as outlined in the Governor's budget which has already been presented to your honorable body. NEW CAPITOL BUILDING The Governor takes a great deal of pleasure and satisfaction in reporting to your honorable body that the new capitol building which was authorized by the thirty-seventh session of the legislature of 1019 is now practically completed. The legislature provided for the creation of a commission composed of the Governor, State Engineer and three other-members to be appointed by the Governor, and empowered them to proceed with the making of plans and specifications for the con - struction and completion of a new capitol building, the furnishing and equipping of same, suitable landscaping and adequate heating and power plant and to be paid for from a fund to be raised by special tax levy of a designated amount extending over a period of years so that the building could be paid for as it was constructed. The original authorized cost was $5,000,000.00. Later in order to increase the size of the building to meet the housing requirements of state activities the authorized cost was increased to approximately $10,000,000.00. The Capitol Commission has done its work and has done it well. The new capitol building of Nebraska is "an inspired monument worthy of the state for which it stands; a thing of beauty so conceived and fashioned as to properly record and exploit our civilization, aspirations and patriotism, past, present and future; intelligently designed, durably and conscientiously built and of worthy materials; and all beautifully set, surrounded, embellished and adequately furnished." I believe it can be correctly stated that no building constructed anywhere throughout the world in the past hundred years compares 18 </seg>
            <seg id="p025">to the Nebraska state capitol in architecture, utility and artistic fin - ish and furnishings. This magnificent capitol building was conceived, planned and constructed without any graft and has probably cost less per cubic foot than any public building in modern times. A few of rooms in our new capitol, such as the Supreme Court rooms, the Governor's suite, and the library have been finished in a manner that some might call extravagant. They were not constructed, however, to see how elaborately they could be furnished, or how much they could be made to cost, but rather to serve an educational purpose. The Capitol Commission wanted the people of Nebraska to have an oppor - tunity to see what science and art has accomplished throughout the world and these materials, decorations and furnishings were brought together from the ends of the earth for these few rooms. The remainder of the building might be said to be a work shop composed of steel, concrete and marble that should serve the state as a suitable capitol building for the next 500 years if it is properly maintained and cared for. Another outstanding feature in connection with the magnificent building in which Nebraska people can take pride is that it is fully paid for and no additional tax levy need be made for that purpose. The amount of money spent in construction of this building and under contract to January 1, 1935, totals $9,800,449.07. There is a balance of the appropriation available for use prior to July 1, 1935, of $73,942.44 and there will be in the capitol fund an additional balance from the tax levy upwards of $134,000.00. The legislature two years ago appropriated $10,000.00 for repair - ing, refinishing and the necessary refurnishing of the Governor's Mansion. Under the direction and supervision of the Capitol Com - mission and the Governor's wife the intent and wishes of the leg - islature have been carried out as far as possible and I believe will be approved by the members of the legislature and the people of the state when they have an opportunity to view the results of this work. The fund was not quite sufficient to purchase some additional pieces of furniture that should be acquired and for repairs that should be made in the basement. There is a balance remaining in this Mansion repair fund of $367.60. I recommend that an additional $1,000.00 be appropriated to be used for the above mentioned furni - ture and repairs. The Capitol Commission has prepared a full and complete report in detail of its activities from the time it was created by statute in 1919 to January 1, 1935. This report gives all the information as to how the plan was conceived and the steps taken, in chronological order, showing the cost for the competition in architecture when the various plans were submitted and the cost of each section of the struc - ture and also of the furnishings, heating plant, etc. The report is signed by the Governor as Chairman and by the State Engineer as Secretary and I am submitting it to the legislature as the final report 19 </seg>
            <seg id="p026">of the Capitol Commission with the recommendation that it be ap - proved and the Commission relieved of any further duties or activities. In closing this report of the construction and practical completion of the capitol building, the Commission recommends that the "Governor be authorized to complete minor unfinished items in accordance with the original plans of the Commission, to-wit: murals, flood lighting the tower, court yard fountains, directory plates, etc., using such amount of the Capitol Commission fund as may be required. The Capitol Commission further wishes to suggest the future maintenance of the state capitol and Governor's Mansion by the Governor as he could utilize the engineering services of the Department of Roads and Irri - gation in the careful preservation of these structures and their contents." The maintenance and care of this great building does not consist of sweeping, dusting, washing and polishing alone but, representing an investment of $10,000,000.00. it requires engineering supervision to detect deterioration at its inception so that it can be corrected imme - diately and the building and its furnishings and contents not per - mitted to be injured and then require large sums to correct and repair the damage, as was done a few years ago in re-surfacing the terrace around the building. It is recognized by all that our capitol building does not have a satisfactory setting, that the ground upon which it is located is inade - quate to bring out the actual beauty of the structure. Owing to the proximity of the present buildings to the north, and those yet to be built, if not prevented, a view of the building, with the exception of the tower, is shut oft until one is so close that he does not have the proper perspective. The state of Nebraska also owns the buildings and grounds of the State University. They extend east along U Street and reach a point directly opposite the capitol building looking from the capitol north on Fifteenth Street. The city of Lincoln is desirous of cooperating with the state in extending the grounds of the capitol and the university by widening Fifteenth Street between the two so that the beauty and the educational utility of the buildings will not be destroyed or jeopardized. The city of .Lincoln has already established a sinking fund for the purpose of widening Fifteenth Street from the university grounds south towards the capitol and I recommend that the state utilize whatever part is necessary of the remaining capitol building fund to enlarge the capitol grounds on the north by acquiring 150 feet on each side of Fifteenth Street from K Street to M Street. By widening this approach to the capitol and properly parking it, and perhaps later erecting suitable memorial monuments between each block in honor of Nebraska Soldiers and Sailors of the various wars in which our patriotic young men have served, the beauty of Nebraska's Capitol Building could be preserved and would be enjoyed by generations to come. 20 </seg>
            <seg id="p027">CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS The voters of the state have added three important amendments to the state constitution. One' of these amendments changes the pres - ent legislative set-up from a legislature composed of two houses to what is known as the unicameral or one house legislative body. This change in the physical legislative set-up and procedure is not expected in itself to restore prosperity or to cure all of the defects or dissatis - faction that may have occurred under or been brought about by the present two house plan. I believe, however, that the one house plan has some merit and I am glad that the voters of the state decided to give it a trial. It will shorten the legislative sessions and will reduce the cost to the taxpayers. It will eliminate many of the abuses of the two house legislative plan through the conference committee route that frequently result in a defeat of the people's wishes. It will more definitely fix responsibility on the individual which is avoided in the joint dealings between the two branches of the legislature. The in - crease in the financial allowance to the members of the smaller body will encourage some specially trained men and women to &lt;- give the state the benefit of their services who otherwise could not afford to take their time for legislative service under the small remuneration now allowed. The one house legislative plan was adopted as the result of the suggestion and influence of the senior United States Senator from Ne - braska, Honorable George W. Norris. Senator Norris threw his whole soul into the campaign to bring about the change in our con - stitution. He had very definite ideas as to the number of mem - bers that the one house plan should set up. He believed in a small number and suggested that the house be composed of thirty mem - bers. The success or failure of the one house legislature will be cred-. ited to Senator Norris. I recommend to this honorable body that, If Senator Norris is to have the credit or blame of the success or fail - ure of this one house legislative plan, then it is fair to him and the people of the state who have faith in him, to carry out as nearly as possible his views as to the physical set-up of the one house body so that the plan may be given a fair trial. PROHIBITION REPEAL. The repeal of the clause in our state constitution which pro - hibited the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors opens up a wide field of discussion in seeking a solution of the problem created. History has shown that no plan yet devised by men providing for the manufacture, distribution or sale of intoxicating beverages has proven satisfactory. It is unlikely that any plan dealing with this liquor question adopted by your honorable body will prove satisfac - tory either to the so-called wets or drys. There are, however, some fundamental rights that the people have that should be safe-guarded. 21 </seg>
            <seg id="p028">It is admitted that the profit made from the liquor business is what makes it very difficult to handle it satisfactorily. If a plan could be devised that would take the profit out of the sale of the liquor, a part, at least, of the evil would be eliminated or somewhat curbed. If no license were issued that would permit the consumption of the liquor on the premises where it is sold it would lessen the dimen - sions of the public nuisance that promiscuous sale on the premises would create. Those who manufacture, distribute or sell intoxicating liquors should be required, under heavy bond, to pay the damage to the individual caused by the sale or use of such liquor either directly or indirectly. The responsibility for enforcing the law, under what - ever plan is devised by the legislature, should be placed in the hands of the chief executive of the state so that he might be held respon - sible directly to the voters for the enforcement or non-enforcement. If a commission is devised for the handling of licenses or permits or enforcement, or if the constitutional prerogative or duty of law en - forcement is taken away from the Governor and placed in the hands of a commission, the selection and appointment of said commission should be given careful consideration. Provision might well be made that, if the commission consists of three members, not more than two of them should be affiliated with the same political party and not more than two of them be classed, from their personal standpoint, as either wets or drys. Under our form of government and especially the Democratic theory of government, those residing in the smaller governmental units should be considered as to whether or not liquor is to be sold within the confines of such governmental units. In other words, it would no doubt be more satisfactory to the people if the right of self deter - mination in townships, municipalities and counties may be exercised in deciding whether liquors should be sold in such units or not. Liquor in Nebraska was formerly regulated under what is known as the Slocum Act. All of its provisions were tested in the courts and their constitutionality established. The Slocum law had many conditions and restrictions that lessened the evils of promiscuous handling and sale of liquor and I believe that the Slocum law could be used to advantage as a yardstick in considering the manner in which intoxicating liquor should be sold in our state. CHILD li.AHOK AMENDMENT I desire again to call to the attention of the Nebraska legislature the proposed amendment to the federal constitution known as the child labor amendment. The object of this amendment is to prevent the employment and enforced labor of children of tender age. This amendment was considered by a former session of the legislature and I have had many requests to bring it to the attention of the mem - bers of the Fiftieth Session of the legislature. It was proposed by Congress and has not yet been approved by a sufficient number of 22 </seg>
            <seg id="p029">states to become a part of the federal constitution. If, upon an exam - ination of the wording of this amendment, you find that it would not prohibit the parents of farm children from determining the class of work and the age at which it would be safe to have their children assist in the farm work, I feel that this amendment should be ap - proved by the Nebraska legislature. The original intention of those who advocated this law against child labor was that it should apply to mills, factories, mines, sweatshops and other places where children had been required to slave and where such -employment undermines the children, both physically and mentally. EXEMPT HCMIES FROM TAXATION The people of Nebraska are being urged by the federal govern - ment to find employment for labor and to lighten the relief load with which the federal government is assisting. Permit me to bring to your attention a plan which I believe will provide more employment for the unemployed, will create a greater market for all building materials and will greatly increase the number of home owners. Today hundreds of homes are being sold for taxes and people who have put their life savings into homes are being forced to give them up and to call for government relief. The desire to own homes, build homes or to buy homes is almost lost on account of the danger dur - ing a depression, if the owner is out of employment, that the home will be sold by the sheriff for taxes. I recommend that, by an amend - ment to the constitution, if necessary, or, if not, by statute, that all homesteads not in excess in value of four or five thousand dollars and which are occupied by the owners be exempt from taxation of all kinds. The state of Florida has just amended its constitution so as to exempt homesteads not to exceed $5,000.00 from taxation. This applies in municipalities to not over two city lots or in the country to not more than 160 acres of land. Where the homestead is of a greater value, that portion over $5,000.00 is taxable. In Florida this Is creat - ing a movement to buy homes, build homes and to use wages and salaries to apply on homes. It would create an extensive demand for all kinds of building materials as well as absorb the unemployed on a wide scale. This is a real housing plan. No more important action could be taken at this time, in my judgment, to save the home of the small home owner who has his life savings invested, who had a small fixed income and now has employment and income wiped away and is in dread of losing his home. I believe that this movement to own a home has great pos - sibilities for good and that the movement will spread throughout the nation and make the nation one of home owners. I suggest as a replacement tax that a state income tax be enacted as many of" the states have done so as to lighten the load on real estate. I would also suggest that if the state, county or municipal governments are to share in any of the profits from the parl-mutuel betting machines that 23 </seg>
            <seg id="p030">this profit might well be used to partially offset the exemption on homesteads from taxation. UPHOLD THE PRESIDENT The great statesman and leader who is at the head of the federal government, Franklin D. Roosevelt, is making a courageous and heroic effort to restore conditions that our people will be self-sup - porting, prosperous and happy. Our state administration has sup - ported every plan and helped carry out every measure that the Presi - dent has offered in his recovery program. Our President is entitled to the undivided support of the people of the nation and all governmental units, large or small, and I implore this legislature and the incom - ing administration to give whatever aid and cooperation are possible to the President's efforts through his many plans to bring about a speedy and permanent rehabilitation of the nation. FEDERAL AND STATE EMERGENCY RELIEF I feel that you should be fully advised as to the emergency relief set-up in this state and the amounts of money that have been received from federal sources, the manner in which it is handled, the number of people employed in its administration and the amount of money on hand in this state emergency relief fund January 1, 1935. On June 14, 1933, a conference was held in Washington, D. C, attended by Governors or their representatives from all the states to consider the problem of relief. I was represented at this confer - ence and, as a result of the plans outlined thereat, a State Emergency Relief Committee was appointed for Nebraska by the Governor con - sisting of the following members: Wm. H. Smith, Seward, State Tax Commissioner, Chairman Harland L. Mossman, Omaha Gene Huse, Norfolk A. P. Buechler, Grand Island Dr. C. P. Fall, Beatrice Frank D. Throop, .Lincoln Dr. Francis W. Heagey, Omaha This committee, which has served without compensation, held its first meeting, with five members present, on June 22, 1933, and the first allotment of federal relief funds to counties was made at a meeting of the committee on July 21, 1933. At the Washington conference on June 14th, the sum of $150, - 000.00 of federal relief funds was alloted to Nebraska, to cover the months of July, August, and September. On August 31st a supple - mental grant of $32,861.00 was made for that month, and on Septem - ber 19th an additional grant of $50,000.00 was made, the latter being intended, however, to meet the relief load in October. 24 </seg>
            <seg id="p031">Since the initial grant made m July, 1933, the total grants received by Governor Bryan for Nebraska up to December 31, 1934, amount to $13,267,297.00, upon which requisitions totaling $10,573,860.15 have been presented to him by the State Emergency Relief Administration. Although the Governor of Nebraska has signed the monthly requests for these huge sums he has had no part m deciding m what manner this relief should be extended or administered nor as to the appoint - ment of the federal administrative relief staff numbering upwards of 1,600 persons. The following statement shows, the individual and total grants by month since the first funds were received and the total requisitions by months: Total WAGNER Bllili RELIEF FUND Paid y Out by Gov.

This amount probably will be placed to the Governor's credit with the Federal Reserve Bank at Omaha by the time this message is delivered and this sum added to the balance on hand will make a total of $4,654,586.85 relief money m the hands of the Governor. At the outset the State Committee had a part m the administra - tion of the relief program. County committees were set up m the various counties participating m the funds, these committees being designated jointly by the State Committee and the county boards of commissioners or supervisors. The federal relief administrator, at the present time, however, is m complete charge of the administration 26 </seg>
            <seg id="p033">of the relief program, with the State Committee serving in an advis - ory capacity to pass on policies. The county organizations, including both the county committees and the administrative authorities, are designated by the Federal Relief Administration. The relief program, at the beginning, was administered by three people, with the voluntary aid of the force in the State Tax Com - missioner's office. The funds administered have increased from the initial allotment of $150,000.00 to cover three months, to an allot - ment of $1,961,150.00 for the month of January, 1935. The admin - istrative force has increased from the initial three persons to a total of 273 persons carried on the head office payroll and 1,391 persons administering the relief in the various counties, in the month of November. The total cost of administration for that month was $183,139.05, or 13.6 per cent of the funds handled. The cost of administration in the head office, included in the foregoing total, was $54,261.31 or 4.4 per cent of the funds handled for the month. A total of 75 counties are now participating in federal relief with 18 counties handling their own relief load. These 18 counties are as follows: Antelope Dawson Nemaha Arthur Grant Phelps Banner Hooker Saline Butler Keith Sarpy Cass Kimball Seward Cuming Merrick Sioux The state, as a state, has not participated in the financing of relief, but the counties receiving federal aid have been required by the Federal Administrator to supply funds to a certain amount. They have also relinquished to the federal authorities all control in the administration of relief. What the policy of the federal authorities, in the administration of relief, will be in the future is yet to be determined as the funds available will become exhausted next month. It is expected, however, that the states and the sub-divisions thereof will be called upon to contribute a larger part of the total cost than they have in the past and, if so, the funds should be handled under state authority rather than federal authority and the cooperation of the county authorities elected to administer county affairs should be secured, under which plan, in my opinion, the cost of administration could be materially reduced. With the people of the state already burdened as the result of drouth and taxes, the problem of financing a more extensive participa - tion in the relief load will be one of the serious ones confronting this session of the legislature for solution. 27 </seg>
            <seg id="p034">ALFALFA EMBARGO The shortage of feed for livestock in Nebraska is becoming a very acute problem. The price of feed had advanced to a point where it would cost more to buy feed for an animal during the rest of the winter than the animal would be worth on the present market in the spring. There has been an embargo for several years on alfalfa grown in Idaho. Realizing the desperate feed situation in Nebraska, I arranged through the Department of Agriculture and Inspection to send our state entomologist, Mr. Gates, to Idaho to make an investiga - tion. He, together with the entomologist connected with the Univer - siy of Idaho, advised us that ten counties in Idaho had had no alfalfa weevil for seven or eight years and that, in their judgment, there would be no danger of infestation in Nebraska from the shipment of alfalfa grown in these counties during the past season. We found that this alfalfa could be sent to central points in Nebraska at an average cost of about $20.00 per ton. As a relief measure to protect the livestock, work stock, dairy cows, foundation herds, etc., that were being sacrificed for the lack of feed, I raised the embargo on alfalfa shipments from these Idaho counties until April 1st. Safe - guards have been thrown around these shipments and each car is required to have a state inspector's certificate showing that the alfalfa was grown in the counties designated, was free from weevil and was loaded for shipment in the counties designated. The regular embargo will apply after the first of April so that if any infestation of weevil appears in the coming year's crop in Idaho such hay cannot be shipped into Nebraska without a special act of the Governor. While we have received some protests from alfalfa dealers, the farmers and stock owners throughout the state are expressing their appreciation of the state's action in permitting them to secure alfalfa at a price not too extremely high. Practically all alfalfa sold in Nebraska by dealers is being shipped from Montana and Washington which border on Idaho. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE I strongly recommend that your honorable body consider the matter of unemployment insurance. Here is a subject of far reach - ing importance and if a federal and state unemployment insurance plan had been in operation the past few years it would have saved the taxpayers millions of dollars taking care of the unemployed. It would have saved the self-respect of millions of wage earners now on charity and it would have prevented communism from getting the hold in the country with which the nation is now confronted. A federal unemployment insurance law, that would require the employers of labor to pay a small per cent on the amount of wages paid out or a law providing for joint action between federal and state governments to create an insurance fund so that a small amount would be paid to wage earners during the time they were out of employment, is a part of a social justice plan which I have been advocating for the 28 </seg>
            <seg id="p035">past several years and is now a part of the new deal program recently announced by the national administration. WATER POWER AND IRRIGATION A very important piece of legislation was enacted two years ago which makes it possible to utilize the water in our streams for electric power and for irrigating the fields. Much headway has been made along these lines during the past year through the developments at Sutherland and Genoa. With the conditions that the state imposed in granting the water permits which require Nebraska people to be given an opportunity to buy electricity generated on Nebraska streams before said electricity can be offered for sale outside the borders of our state, and that small independent power plants and the munici - pally owned plants of the state would be permitted to buy electricity from these generating plants at as low a rate as any other company, these great power plants should prove of incalculable benefit in sup - plying electric power at reasonable rates. I have not only favored the development of the two projects that are under way but I feel it is just as important that the other proposed irrigation and power plants in Nebraska be given the same federal assistance to develop their respective projects. I refer to the North Loup, Middle Loup, Tri-County projects and the proposed development in southwestern Nebraska. There is an almost unlimited market for electric power in Ne - braska and the serious drouth this year has again demonstrated that the rainfall should be supplemented by irrigation from our streams in order to insure regular and profitable crops. It has also been demonstrated that irrigation development by itself is seldom self - sustaining on account of the development and maintenance cost. Power and irrigation should be developed together so that the profits from the sale of power can be used to reduce the cost of irrigation and insure the latter of being a permanent financial success. I express the hope that this legislature will make a joint appeal through suitable resolution to the federal government to supply immediately the neces - sary funds to permit the development of our power and irrigation projects that have already made application for federal loans. Our state is extremely fortunate in that it has no bonded indebted - ness and I urge upon the members of this legislature the importance of seeing that none is permitted to be fastened upon the people of Nebraska. I feel that the proceeds from the state gasoline tax should be used exclusively for road building and maintenance and not be per - mitted to be diverted for any other purpose. I believe, however, that gasoline used in farm tractors and not upon the highways should be exempt from the gasoline tax. I hope that it will not be necessary for you to increase the amount of taxes now paid by the people of Nebraska to carry on the gov - 29 </seg>
            <seg id="p036">ernmental affairs. Their load Is heavy when compared with their ability to pay owing to the unparalleled drouth. The suggestions which I have made were not for increasing taxes but an equalization of taxes that will better adjust the tax load to those who receive the most benefits from government. The statutes provide that the Governor shall submit to the legislature a report of the activities of the Board of Pardons and Paroles. As no appropriation was made for the publication of a report of this kind I am submitting with this message a typewritten report by the Chief Probation Officer to the Board of Pardons and Paroles. I also submit herewith a report of the money received by the Governor for the biennium ending December 31, 1934. Receipts of the Treasurer for all money received are on file in the Governor's office. I attach to this message a report of the receipts in connection with the beer tax and administrative expenses for its collection. Inas - much as the legislature did not include in the regulatory beer "tax statute a provision requiring the State Treasurer to approve vouchers for the administrative expense in collecting the beer tax through the Department of Agriculture and Inspection, and it necessitated the Governor setting up an administrative expense fund in his office so that the net amount of the beer tax could be turned to the State Treasurer as provided for in the statute, I recommend that an amend - ment be enacted that will permit the payment of the administrative expense of collecting the beer tax the same as provided in other depart- I ments where inspections and fees are required. CONCLUSION* In conclusion, I am deeply indebted to the people of the state of Nebraska for the confidence that they have placed in me and the honors they have shown to the members of our family. I have now served three terms as Governor of this state. I sincerely appreciate the opportunities that I have been given to serve the citizens of our fair state. It has been my desire and I have used every means that it was possible to command in an effort to make the government function to encourage the progress and development of, our state and to promote the general welfare of its people. I can take pride with you and the people of our state in -.the position that Nebraska occupies among the states of the Union. It is common knowledge throughout the United States that Nebraska's financial credit is second to that of no other state. She has no bonded indebtedness. She has borrowed no money from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to feed her people that must be paid back by taxation. No state warrants have been registered during the past four years. There are no deficits in any spending agency of the state and the state budget is balanced. A magnificent new Capitol costing $10,000,000.00 has been constructed and. paid for in full. Our public 30 </seg>
            <seg id="p037">roads have been paid for as they have been constructed. No strikes and no lock-outs have occurred m our state during these times of unrest. There has been no declaring of martial law nor the calling into action of the National Guard. This reflects great credit upon the citizenship of Nebraska as to their poise and balance, as to their law - abiding nature and their patriotism. Nebraska now enjoys the dis - tinction of having the highest financial credit and the lowest tax rate of any state m the Union. I hope that your service to your state during this session of the legislature will be pleasant to you as I feel sure it will be of much benefit to the people who have entrusted you with their representation. I am grateful and appreciative of the splendid cooperation which I have received as the chief executive from all branches of the gov - ernment service. In laying down the duties as chief executive, I want to congratulate the people upon their selection of R. ii. Cochran as their Governor. I have confidence m his ability, his integrity and his patriotism, to give you an efficient and honest and serviceable ad - ministration and I feel sure that this legislature and the people of the state will give him and his associates as state officials the support necessary to that end.
