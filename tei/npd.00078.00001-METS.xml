            <seg id="p012">Forty-seventh Annual Report This report is for the most part a record j of the achieve - ments of the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station dur - ing the fiscal year ending June 30, 1933. The reports from the substations extend to January 1, 1934. A financial state - ment showing the receipts and expenditures of the Experi - ment Station is included. The projects are grouped and discussed under subject head - ings. Little or no progress has been made on some projects, while others, on which attention has been concentrated, have been advanced rapidly or completed. Curtailment of appcc - priations and a reduction in cash funds due to the low prices of agricultural products have necessitated a readjustment of the research program of the Experiment Station. There have been many requests for new information, probably accen - tuated by the advent of the Agricultural Adjustment pro - gram. Efforts have been made to take care of them as far as possible. In its program of work the Experiment Station is co-opera - ting with several bureaus and offices of the United States De - partment of Agriculture. A list of the publications issued by the station during the past is given later in the report. The bulletins and circulars issued are available to any citizen of the state by writing the Agricultural Experiment Station, Lincoln, Nebraska. AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING Tractor Testing. — During the year 1932, four manufactur - ers submitted twelve tractors for tests. Eleven were of the track-layer type. Ten used gasoline and one used kerosene for fuel. The Diesel motor made its first appearance at the Nebraska testing plant and established new fuel-economy records with a low-grade oil used locally as a furnace fuel. A report on the tests made in 1932 was made in Bulletin 277; the report for 1933 will be contained in Bulletin 285. Wind-driven Electric Plants for Farm Use.- — Additional operating data have been collected and a publication is in preparation. Interest in this source of electricity is evidenced by the fact that at least two new manufacturing plants have recently been established for the building of this sort of equipment. Pump Irrigation. — Pumping tests were continued in a study . of the efficiency of different types of wells and equipment. The results thus far obtained have been printed as Bulletin 282, "Pump Irrigation Investigations in Nebraska". </seg>
            <seg id="p013">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Electric Power on Nebraska Farms.— Subprojects include studies of small electric motors for farms, automatic water systems, the small unit plant, and the electrically operated refrigerator. A general bulletin, entitled "Uses of Electricity on Nebraska Farms— 1930-1934," is forthcoming. A feed - n£;e^\ n S S^ dy is - . ready for Publication. A circular (Mo. 45) has been printed on installing the mechanical refrig- GT3, cor. A Survey of Farm Machinery.— The purpose of this study is to get together some data on the rate of depreciation of hnT„ "^f^T A ci F cular base d on a study of account books kept by farmers in co-operation with the Department ot Kural Economics is in preparation. Efficiency of Tractor Lugs.— Work has been continued on this project, and a report will be prepared within the next year. Methods of Cooling Milk on Farms and Their Effect on Quality.— Emphasis is being put on the problem of storage and the use of one compartment for several products. This work is done in co-operation with the Dairy Department. Adaptation of Pneumatic Tires to Farm Tractors.— During the year a study of the feasibility of pneumatic tires for tractors was undertaken with the co-operation of several tire manufacturing companies. Under certain conditions and in certain circumstances pneumatic tires were found superior to steel wheels and lugs. Under field conditions such as a hay field or sandy soil the tractor equipped with pneumatic tires will usually pull more m intermediate and high than the steel - wheeled tractor. Thus it can often save fuel and time. The steel-wheeled tractor will usually pull more in low gear and can get through slippery spots better than the rubber-tired tractor. animal diseases Organisms Belonging to the Hemorrhagic Septicemia Group.— The work under this project has been finished with the exception of the compilation of the detailed reports. A publication will be issued later. The Influence of Environment on Poultry Morbidity. — Sub - stantial progress has been made. The work on fowl cholera has been finished and that on blackhead of turkeys is almost complete. Publication can be expected soon, in the form of a revision of Bulletin 195 or as a new bulletin. The diseases being studied, m addition to those mentioned above, are bacillary white diarrhea, tuberculosis, coccidiosis, and fowl typhus. </seg>
            <seg id="p014">Forty-seventh Annual Report The results thus far on blackhead warrant the conclusion that blackhead is, definitely a filth-borne disease and it is possible in poultry yards to reduce the hazard from this disease to a negligible minimum. Contaminated soil, feed, and water are the dominant factors that spread the disease. Erysipelas among Nebraska Swine. — This disease may cause trouble in the future ; its presence has been proved, and it will be difficult to distinguish it, in the field, from cholera. The following data suggest the general status of the disease in this state: Outbreaks from which material was examined 119 Outbreaks dn which swine erysipelas was proved 14 Specimens concurrently examined for cholera 17 Specimens showing hog cholera 12 Specimens containing both choleTa and erysipelas 1 Specimens of erysipelas without cholera 5 .Laboratory Diagnosis and Examination of Specimens. — This project takes care of the specimens that come to the Ex - periment Station for examination and diagnosis. During the year 6,282 laboratory examinations were made and reported on. DAIRY HUSBANDRY The Principles of Ice Cream Making. — This project in - cludes a study of samples of ice cream from various manu - facturers in the state. The past year vanilla and chocolate flavors were scored. Considerable difference was noted in the way samples melted down, and some of the manufacturers have suggested this as a subject for study. Grototh of Dairy Cattle. — Approximately 100 animals are being measured, weighed, and photographed monthly. One phase, on the influence of pregnancy on the gain in weight of lactating cows of four breeds, is being tabulated. The Vitamin Content of Milk. — Studies of the vitamin A content of skimmilk, standardized milk, and cream from different breeds of cows have resulted in the following con - clusions : the vitamin A content of milk is associated largely with the butterfat, and separated milk containing a small quantity of fat contains only a little vitamin A; standardiza - tion of the butterfat content of milk by the addition of separ - ated milk reduces its vitamin A potency; and, under the con - ditions of these experiments, Holstein cream was shown to have more vitamin A than Jersey cream. Approximately 750 rats were used in the three phases of the work. The results will be printed as Research Bulletin 69. </seg>
            <seg id="p015">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Factors Affecting the Quality of Fluid Milk. — Studies of the bacterial count, sediment, and fat content of milk de - livered to the College creamery by farmers has been con - tinued. Reports to producers on quality and the system of bonuses and reductions have continued. to promote improve - ment. The operation of a milk pool by the local co-operative milk association has caused the discontinuation of some of the work. In the herd owned by the Experiment Station, cows known to produce milk with high counts have been eliminated. Other factors causing high counts have been the rubber teat cups on milking machines, the life of which is about three weeks with four-time milking and about 50 cows to the milking; carelessness in washing and sterilizing the milking machine and the utensils ; failure to clean the cow ; and the udder flora. A study of milk quality as affected by the individual cow has shown the presence of streptococci in fresh milk to be a cause of low quality. In monthly studies of udders high bac - terial counts of milk were usually found accompanied by streptococcus, and a salty taste was found commonly in cases that showed high leucocyte content and in cases of mastitis. Study of the udders and other aspects of the infection problem will continue. Manufacture of Cream Cheese. — Attention has been given to improving the keeping quality of cheese. By developing the proper acidity, heating after the cheese is Curdled, and avoiding contamination, cheese that will keep under refrig - eration for from two to three weeks can be produced. It has been found that this cheese can be made on a small scale and marketed profitably. The Effect of Metals on Milk. — The work on this project is just getting under way. The equipment has been obtained and a few experimental runs have been made. FIELD CROPS AND SOILS Corn Improvement through Inbreeding and Hybridization. — This project is directed toward the development of superior corn hybrids between selfed lines, which will be practical for farm use. One hundred sixteen hybrids, largely three-line and four-line first-generation double crosses, and 20 varieties were tested for yield in 1932. Twenty-nine of the hybrids were obtained from other states. Two double crosses de - veloped from Nebraska White Prize averaged 14 and 13 bushels per acre higher than the standard variety of Hogue Yellow Dent, which yielded 47.3 bushels. Iowa double cross No. 13, an experimental hybrid from the Iowa Experiment </seg>
            <seg id="p016">Forty-seventh Annual Report Station, was highest of the yellow corn, 12.6 bushels above Hogue. A double cross designated as Nebraska No. 238, in - volving Illinois and Iowa inbreds, was 9.5 bushels above Hogue and 9.7 bushels above the average of 22 farmers' vari - eties. The White Prize hybrids usually mature too late here, but these yellow hybrids are well adapted. Krug, the highest - yielding commercial variety, ranked twenty-third among the lots in the experiment. Five commercial hybrids from Iowa and Illinois averaged 48.1 bushels, only two per cent better than Hogue. In 1933 the first attempts were made to have farmers pro - duce hybrid seed by means of natural crossing plats. Seed stocks of the two single-cross parents used to produce seed of the Nebraska double cross No. 238 above described were distributed to 32 Nebraska farmers who planted them in natural crossing plats. This will provide a seed supply for a considerable acreage in 1934. Corn Tillage Practices. — The results of eleven years of cul - tivation tests will soon be ready for publication. It may be concluded that weed control is the main consideration in culti - vation of corn. Some stirring of the soil, however, is bene - ficial as evidenced by the yield of 29.7 bushels per acre obtained from merely scraping the ground to control weed growth in comparison with 34.0 bushels per acre secured from normal cultivation. No serious injury from root prun - ing is likely to occur under normal conditions of cultivation. Root-pruning studies, in which roots were cut at varying depths and distances around the corn plants, disclosed the fact that only deep, close pruning such as would not ordin - arily occur in the field had any serious effect on the yield. In these controlled tests very severe pruning lowered the yield 11.3 bushels per acre below the unpruned. Listing, surface drilling, and surface checking have been compared for 11 years as methods of planting; the data indicate that only small differences in yield may be expected under con - ditions such as prevailed at Lincoln during the period under study. Small Grains — Studies of Varieties, Breeding, Acclimatiza - tion, and Culture. — The varietal testing and breeding investi - gations with winter wheat are co-operative with the U. S. Department of Agriculture. The Nebraska selection from Crimean winter wheat which is known as Cheyenne has con - tinued to show its superiority over ordinary Turkey. It resists lodging and shattering and tolerates the Hessian fly, although it is not resistant to it. It is popular with farmers. </seg>
            <seg id="p017">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Nebraska No. 60, a selection from Turkey, now comprises about 65 per cent of the wheat acreage in the state. In 20 years it has averaged six per cent better in yield than its parent variety, whereas Cheyenne in the last five years has averaged 14 per cent better. A new Turkey selection that is resistant to local stinking smut and Hessian fly and is attractive in other respects is being increased for more ex - tensive tests. A number of hybrid selections are also showing promise. A three-year comparison at Lincoln has shown no signifi - cant differences in the winter wheat yield from the use of three types of furrow drill. The average yield from furrow drills was, however, 7.8 bushels per acre less than from stand - ard 7-inch surface drills. The lower yield was found largely due to inability of the wheat planted in such widely spaced rows (14 inches) to fully occupy the land. During nine years, four of which have been bad Hessian - fly seasons, October 1 has proved superior to both September 23rd and October 8th as planting dates. This superiority has amounted to 4V6 and 5 bushels in acre yield, respectively. Plowing in July, supplemented by disking to control weeds and volunteer grain, has continued to show great advantages as a method of preparing the seed bed for winter wheat. A severe epidemic of stem rust of oats in 1932 showed the superiority in rust resistance of Iogold and three new selec - tions of Burt oats known as Nebraska No. 518, Nebraska No. 520, and Nebraska No. 529. This superiority amounted to about 15 bushels per acre. Nebraska No. 520 has been one of the highest yielding varieties in the field tests. A large number of segregates from a cross between Markton and Iogold have been selected because of their outstanding resist - ance to smut and stem rust. The smooth-bearded varieties of barley have continued to show their superiority over Common Six-row. In the past five years Komar has exceeded Marquis spring wheat by 26 per cent, and Ceres, now being grown in the state as a cer - tified crop, has exceeded the same wheat by 15 per cent. Komar has also proved most productive at the Box Butte Experimental Farm. Forage Crops, Grain Sorghums, and Soy Beans. — A study to determine the yields of various legumes when grown on soil depleted of subsoil moisture by a previous cropping to alfalfa gave these results: the average annual yield during three years of alfalfa, sweet clover, and red clover on soil previously cropped for six years to alfalfa were respectively </seg>
            <seg id="p018">Forty-seventh Annual Report i. 2.67, 2-65, and 2.97 tons; on land not previously cropped to alfalfa corresponding yields were respectively 3.87, 2.75, and 3.39 tons per acre. It is apparent that alfalfa is the superior crop if the subsoil moisture has not been depleted, but if the opposite is true its yield may be equalled or surpassed by sweet or red clover. The choice of these crops may then be based on other factors than yield. The experiments on variety testing and breeding of alfalfa are in collaboration with the U. S. Department of Agricul - ture. Considerable interest has developed in Hardistan and Turkestan alfalfa because of their superior resistance to the bacterial wilt disease and low temperatures, although their yield has been somewhat below that of Grimm and northern - grown Common alfalfa under conditions' 1 where this disease is not a serious factor. Because of its special virtues of wilt and cold resistance and consequent longer maintenance of stand, the Hardistan is being distributed for farm use. It is estimated that 275 acres are now being grown for seed production on 35 farms in seed-producing areas of the state. Among the newest varieties of promise, Ladak has been out - standing. Seed from France, Italy, South Africa, Argentina, California, and Arizona has proved unadapted to Nebraska conditions. The alfalfa improvement program is being continued. Selection for seed production within self-fertilized lines is reported upon in a paper being prepared for publication. The results indicate that the seed yield per plant has been greatly increased by this method of selection. Many of the self-fer - tilized lines which are under test in the nursery continue to show high yielding ability as well as a high degree of resist - ance to the wilt disease and low temperature. Owing to decidedly favorable moisture conditions various annual forage crops gave exceptionally high yields of cured forage in 1932 as follows: Common millet 5.3 tons, Sudan 4.5 tons, Kansas Orange cane 6.2 tons, Black Amber cane 7.2 tons. During the past seven years, a number of grain sorghums have equaled or somewhat exceeded standard corn varieties in yield of both grain and fodder. Two or three recently developed early maturing grain sorghums may prove par - ticularly well suited to southern Nebraska. As a 7-year aver - age, Atlas Sorgo has been the most productive silage crop tested. In addition to yield, factors such as ease of securing stands, weed control, and the harvesting, storage and market - ing of the grain must be given consideration when sorghums are compared with corn. </seg>
            <seg id="p019">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station The following yields in bushels per acre were obtained in 1932 from varieties of soy beans grown in cultivated rows: Manchu 29.2, Virginia 24.8, Illini 34.7, Ito San 31.9, Aksar - ben 30.4, and Midwest 22.1. When planted in uncultivated seven-inch rows the yield of Manchu beans was 21.7. Management of Permanent Pastures and Native Meadows. — Co-operative experiments for the improvement of per - manent pastures were established with three eastern Nebras - ka farmers during 1932. The effects of fertilizers, cultural practices, and seeding of desirable pasture plants were studied. The application of manure and ammonium sulfate increased yields appreciably, while lime and superphosphate showed no gains. The disking of pastures was decidedly detrimental. The sowing of additional forage seeds into per - manent pastures as an improvement measure is an uncertain practice. Two more extensive co-operative projects were established during 1933 to investigate further the effects of fertilizers and cultural practices and in addition to note the effects of burning and different intensities of clipping, simulating pasture conditions. The eradication of the more serious pasture weeds by different times of mowing and the use of chemicals is being studied. An experiment to determine the effects of introducing culti - vated forage plants into the subirrigated prairie meadows of the Elkhorn Valley and the sandhills has given favorable re - sults and is being continued. Soil TUth.-r-The properties of soil friction and plasticity were under investigation during the year. Previous study had shown that the coefficient of friction was independent of area of contact of any given character of soil surface. It appears, however, that variations in the granular character of the surface have a large effect. With powdered granules that pass a 0.5 mm. sieve used as a basis, the co - efficient of friction is decreased over 20 per cent as granule size is increased up to 2 mm. For the study of plasticity an apparatus has been developed in which soil of definite moist - ness falls and extrudes through an opening in the bottom of its container. The theoretical formula for the amount of soil extruded (E) is: E= K m\/h where m is the mass of soil, h the distance of fall, and K an instrument constant involving the diameter of the orifice. The results thus far support the principle involved. A some - what similar apparatus is being developed for observing the end point of the upper plastic limit. </seg>
            <seg id="p020">Forty-seventh Annual Report The Restoration of Organic Matter in Nebraska Soils. — The experiments for determining the rate and the nature of decom - position of various organic materials when added to small plats of soil under field conditions are being continued. A set of plats has also been established to determine the effects on organic matter and nitrogen of various modifications of a rotation of corn, oats, and wheat. These modifications are sweet clover as a catch crop in the wheat, the application of lime and superphosphate, the application of manure, the application of nitrogenous fertilizer on the wheat in the spring, and the untreated rotation. At the Box Butte Sub - station a wheat field is being used to study the effects on organic matter of plowing, disking, growth of sweet clover, application of nitrogenous fertilizer, burning the straw and stubble, and summer tillage. This was begun in 1930 and the plan calls for testing at four-year intervals. Th-e Availability of Phosphorus in Soils of Alkaline Reac - tion as Related to the Usage of Phosphate Fertilizer. — In the laboratory a percolator has been perfected for obtaining soil extracts for analysis, with which continuous water extrac - tions from a number of soils have been made. The amount of phosphorus extracted has been found to follow the formula : Log A - log (A-y) - log C=kv where A is the maximum amount of phosphorus removable by' the extractive used, y is the amount actually removed by a volume of extractive v, and C and k are constants of integra - tion and proportionality. A is apparently independent of the rate of extraction. C and k vary with different soils. So far it has not been found that either y or A values correlate satis - factorily with field response to phosphate. fruits and vegetables Pruning Apple Trees. — One object of this experiment is to compare heavy with light pruning at transplanting time. Jonathan and Winesap trees are included, and the transplant - ing was done six years ago. Half of the trees were removed and studied in 1931 and half of the remaining trees in 1932. Results secured from trunk measurements of the filler vari - eties at Union indicate that the system of training used in the early years of the life of the apple tree has little effect upon its diameter in later years. Variety Testing. — The 1932 strawberry tests indicate that Dunlap outyielded Blakemore by at least one-third, in spite of the heavier frost damage to the Dunlap variety. The strawberry field was renewed and continued. Gooseberry </seg>
            <seg id="p021">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station varieties were compared as to size of fruit. This was obtained by counting the number of berries per quart. Houghton and Abundance had the lowest counts, Downing and Oregon Champion the highest, and Josselyn, Pixwell, and Carrie intermediate counts. Orchard Culture. — The 1932 apple yields from the cultural blocks were so light that no definite suggestions as to their significance can be made. The clean-culture block was seeded to sweet clover with moderate success. Korean Lespedeza will be tried next spring. Blight was not worse than in 1931, although it did spread somewhat to other varieties, notably York. There seemed to be a correlation between cul - ture and this sort of infection. The soil-treatment work with grapes includes cultivation, the use of fertilizers, scraping the ground, and mulching. No cultural treatment has thus far been superior to ordinary cultivation. Fruit Stocks Investigation. — Data on average trunk diam - eter, average height, and dimensions of top have been obtained for the trees remaining in the top-worked orchard. Half of the original trees were taken out in 1931. The trees on Vir - ginia Crab stock have again shown the most vigorous growth. Similar data will be obtained on the scion-rooted orchard at Union. Orchard Spraying. — In 1932 special attention was given to testing materials for the control of apple scab and black rot on Jonathan trees in an orchard at Shubert. Scab infection was severe and rainy weather prevented an effective applica - tion of the calyx spray. The pink spray, often omitted in Nebraska, was badly needed in 1932. Two strengths of liquid lime-sulfur, 1-50 and %-50, were used throughout the sea - son. In another plat liquid lime-sulfur was used in all fun - gus sprays, but the pink spray was omitted. Two strengths of Bordeaux were used in two other plats, following liquid lime-sulfur in the pink and calyx sprays. Dry lime-sulfur, Kopper's Flotation sulfur, and Koloform were also tested. In checking the results on the foliage difficulty was encoun - tered and more work on that phase will be done next year. Data from the fruit show that there was a heavy infection of scab on unsprayed fruit and that liquicHime-sulf ur and Bor - deaux, the old well-known fungcides, gave the best control of the disease. The 2-4-50 Bordeaux seems to be as weak a dilution as it is safe to use. The same is true of 1-50 lime - sulfur. Black rot was probably as severe as in previous sea- </seg>

Root Systems of Apple Trees. — Trees are excavated from the culture plats in order to study root growth. In the deep loess soil at the Union orchard trees are more deeply rooted than at Lincoln. At Union the growth of corn near the trees checked lateral root development, especially when the corn row was only zy_ feet away. ' Experiments xoith Asparagus,- Lettuce, Spinach, and To - matoes. — The five-year average yield of the largest crowns of asparagus has been 41 per cent higher than that of the smallest size. Variation of the cutting period from 4 to 10 weeks has shown that the longer periods have not caused a reduction in yield. Mulching with straw or manure has proved undesirable. The mulches reduce yield and hinder the emergence of spears. Adding salt to the soil resulted in re - duced yields. Shallow planting has proved superior to deep planting. Straw-mulching head-lettuce plants just after they are transplanted from the greenhouse has resulted in more com - pact but smaller heads than with cultivation. Testing of varieties of spinach for resistance to flower production is in progress, with no results thus far. Applications of superphos - phate to loess soils south of Nebraska City have increased the yields of tomatoes 25 per cent. Manure has caused similar gains, but both together have resulted in only slightly greater gains. Good northern-grown tomato plants have proved 25 to 40 per cent superior to commercial southern-grown plants. Storage of Seed Potatoes. — This work has been carried on for two seasons at the Box Butte experimental farm and in - volves such phases as cellar storage, cold storage, maturity, a warming period after cold storage, exposure of cut seed to the sun, and others. The addition of a fall period of cold storage to the spring period increased the number of rotten tubers and slightly increased the weight of sprouts but reduced the number of stems per seed piece. Cold storage from Novem - ber 15 on was better than immediately after harvest or later in the storage season. Putting potatoes into cold storage in the spring resulted in a lower stand, especially when put into storage as late as June 1, and tended to increase the number of stems per plant. Other cold-storage treatments resulted in increased yields over cellar storage of 10 to 25 per cent. Taking potatoes out of cold storage late rather than early proved beneficial as regards soundness of tubers and stands. The number of stems per seed piece decreased with each pro- </seg>
            <seg id="p023">Nebraska Agbicultural Experiment Station longation of the cold storage, and the yields were generally proportional to the stands. Transferring potatoes from cold storage to the cellar two weeks before planting, in compari - son with two days, resulted in greater stimulation of growth, slightly more rot, and a slightly better stand. Tubers immature when harvested lost more weight than mature tubers. Scabby potatoes of medium maturity lost more weight than less mature and less scabby potatoes. Tests with seed potatoes cut in various ways and placed in cold storage shortly after harvest in 1932 indicate that while early weight loss is avoided the practice is not so good as stor - age in a cellar for several days before the cold storage. Pieces cut lengthwise lost less weight than those cut crosswise or diagonally. Tubers with straight cuts or cracks lost still less. When cut surfaces were exposed to the sun for 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours before storing, the weight loss increased with each lengthening of the exposure asd the differences became greater as the storage season advanced. Nutritional Conditions Influencing the Potato. — The object of this experiment is to determine the nutritional conditions underlying the nutrition and development of stolons and tubers under various conditions. The results briefly are as follows: High nitrogen favors growth, but delays tuber de - velopment. Reducing the N increases the supply of carbo - hydrate and retards vegetative growth and stimulates tuber growth. After tuberization has begun, vegetative growth is retarded or completely stopped. With prolonged N starva - tion the plants become chlorotic and tuber growth slows down, but if, after a period, N is again supplied, tuber growth is stimulated more than growth of leaves. New stolons may be forced out at the nodes where older stolons were produced. The median stolons on the portion of the stems underground usually produce tubers first. Tuber shape seems to be un - affected by nutrition. During long days with high tempera - ture, tuber development was not so great in proportion to other growth as during winter days with low temperature. Cultural Experiments with Potatoes. — As a result of eight years' tests of time of planting in Box Butte county on dry land, June 20-25 has proved to be best. Research Bulletin 61 contains the results up to 1930. Development of Tuber-line Strains of Seed Potatoes. — Tuber-line strains have been isolated from several commercial lots of Triumph potatoes.

About 20 to 25 per cent of the 1932 certified seed acreage in Ne - braska was planted with these tuber lines. About 95 per cent of the certified acreage is planted with indexed stock. The tuber lines provide greater uniformity in all respects. The early strains seem most desirable at Lincoln and under irri - gation at North Platte and Scottsbluff, but on dry land at Alliance the medium and late strains seem better except for late planting, for which the early strains have proved best. Similar work is being started with the Irish Cobbler variety. HOME ECONOMICS Electric Cooking Stoves. — The testing of five stoves repre - senting various types of surface units and ovens has been completed and the results were published in Research Bulletin 68 in October, 1933. Variations in the efficiency and time of heating were found for the surface units, and merits and defects in the types of ovens were brought to light. The adaptation of various types of utensils to electric stoves was also studied and the results are reported in the same bulletin. A popular circular will also be issued, dealing with the selec - tion and management of electric stoves. The Family History and Standards of Living of Farm Families in Selected Districts in Nebraska. — This project will probably be completed in 1934. It has been extended to in - clude a study of technique in gathering data on diet and its adequacy. A four weeks' intensive food study of a number of selected families is being made, the weeks being one from each season of the year. The plan is to compare the record of these four weeks with the year's record, which is kept under more normal conditions but with less detail and accu - racy. Estimates of food consumption will be obtained also by the schedule method from the same families, if possible, so that the three methods can be compared. Variability in the Cooking Quality of Navy Beans. — This work has been started. A comparison is being made of beans from various regions in the United States. Work thus far indicates that Nebraska-grown beans are equal to other beans in cooking quality and palatability. Relief Agencies Available to Farm Families.— -This study is to be of short duration. Records of relief agencies were found unavailable for the two or three years before 1932. Informa - tion is available, however, for the years 1932 and 1933. </seg>

TI _f Hes8tm_Fly and Other Injurious Insects.— Work on the Hessian fly was resumed in 1929 and has been continued since. Field observation stations were maintained in Fill - more and Phelps counties from August to early October for the study of the relation of rainfall and temperature to the emergence and egg-laying of the main fall brood. In ad - dition studies of the life history and control of other insects of minor importance, were carried on in the new insectary! These include cherry slug, imported cabbage worm, egg-plant flea-beetle, boxelder plant bug, and house ants. Life Histories of Several Common Cutworms. — The por - tion of the project that includes keys to the various kinds of cutworms that are known to attack crops* is now completed and is being prepared for publication as a research bulletin The part dealing with life histories and control measures will require more time. Grasshopper Control.— A careful study of the value of kinds of baits was continued. Definite evidence that certain ingredients and methods of preparation improved the bait was obtained. A Brood Study of the Codling Moth in Southeastern Ne - oraskas—The weather conditions of 1932 gave opportunity for further study of the codling moth. The aim is to find the relation of weather to variations in development and to codling-moth populations in the orchard. livestock feeding Wintering Rations for Stock Calves. — The fourth trial in a series on wintering was closed in April, 1933. Several new comparisons were made. In a comparison of Atlas Sorgo ensilage with corn ensilage, the former produced 85 per cent of the gain per ton that the latter produced, but it yielded 29 per cent more and hence produced 10 per cent more gain per acre. The sorgo yielded 13y 2 tons of ensilage per acre. In a comparison of Atlas Sorgo ensilage with chopped corn fodder, the latter produced 40 per cent less gain per acre than the former. Steer calves were compared with heifer calves on a ration of corn silage and alfalfa. The heifers were slightly more efficient in feed utilization and carried considerably more flesh at the close than the steers did.

            <seg id="p026">Forty-seventh Annual Report feed efficiency was 83 per cent of that of the calves. All of the cattle in the wintering experiment will be finished dur - ing the summer and fall. Cattle from previous wintering tests were fed out in the summer of 1932. Four lots of steers were fed from April 19 to July 16 on corn, alfalfa, and a pound of cottonseed cake daily. Foot rot caused lower gains than usual. Three lots of steers were fed 190 days on shelled corn while on pas - ture. Late in the summer they were put in a dry lot and fed corn and alfalfa. Winter rations proved to have no effect on summer gains. A gain of about 2% pounds per day was made in all lots. Temporary Pastures. — This project was begun in 1932. The departments of Animal Husbandry and Agronomy co - operate in this work. Twelve fenced pastures of \y_\ acres each were planted with temporary crops including rye, sudan grass, first and second year sweet clover, and oats and sweet clover together. By establishing a suitable sequence of two or more the carrying capacity was increased nearly threefold. The most grazing was obtained where rye was used from April 18 to June 3. The ground was then plowed and on June 4 planted to sudan grass. This was grazed from July 12 to September 21. One acre provided 312 steer days, or the equivalent of 10 months of grazing for one steer. Each of the two crops provided the same amount. White sweet clover seeded with oats ranked second, pro - viding 232 steer days. The ground was seeded April 16 and grazed from June 13 to October 11. Second-year sweet clover grazed from May 11 to July 25 supplied 220 steer days. Sudan grass used from June 20 to September 21 pro - duced 177 steer days. Native sod pasture (mostly blue grass) produced 145 steer days. The Effect of Corn in Various Forms on Rate and Economy of Gain. — Four lots, each containing 10 head of 639-pound yearling steers, were fed 180 days.

Lot 2 had slightly more finish and sold higher, but there was insufficient difference to justify the grinding. Rations for Fattening Pigs on Sudan Grass. — Eight lots of spring pigs were fed for 100 days upon various grains and supplements while on sudan grass pasture. Adding tankage to shelled corn increased the daily gain from 0.98 to 1.41 pounds; 35 pounds of tankage saved 110 pounds of corn in producing 100 pounds of gain. The pigs receiving no tank - age rooted up the sudan grass badly. Rolled wheat produced slightly higher gains than whole or cracked wheat. Tankage was fed in this comparison. In producing 100 pounds of gain, 43 pounds of wheat and 5 pounds of tankage were saved by rolling, while 31 pounds of wheat and 4 pounds of tankage were saved by cracking. Satisfactory gains were made by all three lots. Several protein mixtures were compared with tankage as supplements to corn. Soy beans and tankage mixed 4 to 1 gave a slightly lower gain, a decrease in daily corn consump - tion of 1.04 pounds, and an increase in supplement consump - tion of 0.04 pound. To produce 100 pounds of gain, 56 pounds less corn and 31 pounds more supplement were' re - quired. The soy-bean-fed pigs produced soft carcasses. Their back fat was 1.26 inches thick in contrast to 1.58 inches on the straight tankage lot. Soy-bean oil meal and tankage mixed 4 to 1 produced 0.09 pound greater daily gain than tankage alone; 1.24 pounds of the mixed supplement were consumed daily in contrast to 0.49 pound of tankage. Four hundred six pounds of feed in the mixed-supplement lot were required to produce 100 pounds gain in comparison with 400 pounds in the tankage lot. The carcasses of both lots graded hard. Obviously, extracting the oil from the soy beans eliminated the soft pork factor. A vegetable protein mixture of equal parts of cottonseed meal, linseed oil meal, corn gluten meal, and soy-bean oil meal produced 0.10 pound less daily gain than tankage. The Effect of Method of Preparation on the Feeding Value of Barley for Pigs. — In a test designed to ascertain the most satisfactory way to feed barley, 10 lots of 103-pound pigs were fed 69 days. Tankage was used in all cases. One lot of corn served as a check. This lot gained 1.61 pounds per head daily and produced 100 pounds of gain upon 346 pounds of corn and 45 pounds of tankage. </seg>
            <seg id="p028">Forty-seventh Annual Report In a self-fed series, finely ground barley produced 1.88 pounds of daily gain ; cracked barley, 1.63 pounds ; and whole barley, 1.42 pounds. To produce 100 pounds of gain on finely ground barley, only 80 per cent as much feed was required as on the whole grain. Cracked barley required 88 per cent as much as the whole grain. In a series where the rations were hand-fed dry, whole barley produced 1.15 pounds daily gain ; cracked, 1.59 pounds, and finely ground 1.65 pounds. To produce 100 pounds of gain on finely ground barley required 85 per cent as much feed as on the \vhole grain. Cracked barley was slightly more efficient and required but 83 per cent as much. In another series, the feed was soaked and hand-fed. Whole barley produced 1.21 pounds daily gain; cracked barley, 1.51 pounds ; and finely ground, 1.64 pounds. To pro - duce 100 pounds of gain on finely ground barley required 96 per cent as much feed as on whole grain, while on cracked grain it required 98 per cent as much. Forage Crops for Hogs. — Seventy head of 12-weeks-old pigs averaging 52 pounds were used in a growth and fattening ex - periment which was started July 16. Ten head were kept on a full feed of corn and tankage and were used as a check. The rest were used in a growing test and were later re - divided and used in an 85-day cornfield feeding test. The lot on full feed proved to be far more efficient in feed utiliza - tion than the lots on growing rations. In the cornfield the results amply justified the use of supplements. Tankage in the self-feeder proved most efficient. This lot was the only one to finish in the 85-day period. All other lots were self -fed for 22 days on shelled corn and tankage following withdrawal from the field, and all ate an unusually large amount of tank - age. Linseed Meal, Cottonseed Meal, and Corn Gluten Meal as Supplements to Corn and Alfalfa in Fattening Lambs. — Eight lots each containing 25 head of 60-pound lambs were fed 100 days in a third trial in this series. Cottonseed meal produced the largest and most efficient gain. In producing 100 pounds of. gain 43 pounds of cottonseed meal replaced 80 pounds of corn and 105 pounds of alfalfa. In the average of three trials corn gluten meal has proved most efficient and linseed meal least efficient. No advantage has been obtained from mixing the supplements. Five lots of 25 lambs each were fed 87 days to determine the advisability of adding protein supplement to corn and alfalfa when the total digestible nutrients and digestible crude </seg>
            <seg id="p029">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station protein are equal. Linseed meal, cottonseed meal, and corn gluten meal were used, and corn starch was added to the pro - tein supplements in order to keep the total digestible nutrients and the digestible crude protein equal. No extra gain was produced by the supplements. Apparently corn and alfalfa furnish a practical amount of nutrients for fattening lambs. Twelve lambs were fed 148 days in an individual feeding test to study the effect of the same supplements upon the fattening lamb and upon the carcasses when the supplements constitute 50 per cent of the concentrate ration. Results showed no appreciable difference in the three supplements fed under these conditions. Gains in the replications were not consistent. No ill effects observed were attributable to the rations. The carcass studies were largely of a negative order. The refractive indices showed the fat on the controls (fed corn without supplement) to be the firmest. Palata - bility sudies gave a narrow range of grading, indicating uni - formity in quality. Production of Market Lambs from Aged Western Ewes. — The third trial under this project was completed. Three lots of bred western ewes were fed on three planes of nutri - tion to permit a study of effect on weight of ewes, birth weights of lambs, market value, and other factors. Ewes fed a medium grain ration during pregnancy made the largest gains, produced the heaviest lambs, and showed the best financial returns in this series, where a no-grain ration, a medium grain ration, and a heavy grain ration were com - pared. The lambs from this group also made the best gains. milling and baking Preparation and Study of the Cereal Glutelins. — Work has substantiated further the view that "glutenin", as prepared from wheat flour by any known methods of isolation and puri - fication, can not be regarded as a definite chemical entity. Beyond reasonable doubt the same may be said of the so - called "glutelins" of the other cereals. Furthermore, this same situation doubtless prevails with regard to "gliadin", which has been customarily considered to be the other chief protein constituent of wheat gluten. It is becoming increas - ingly apparent that the gluten of wheat flour is made up largely of a heterogeneous mixture of "dissociable compon - ents". Any so-called "purified protein preparation" from wheat flour or gluten probably consists of a group of these "disso - ciable components" having similar properties. Preparations </seg>
            <seg id="p030">Forty-seventh Annual Report 23 having constant properties are obtained so long as the same method of preparation is adhered to m all details. Variations m method of preparation cause variations among the compon - ent groups and therefore measurable variations m the chem - ical composition (as well as m physical properties) of the preparations themselves. These beliefs are somewhat m conformity with the find - ings of Sorenson (Compt. rend. Lab., Carlsberg, Vol. 18, No. 5, 1930), who has concluded that perhaps all of the soluble proteins are "reversibly dissociable component systems". In the case of the gluten proteins, however, there is as yet some doubt as to the reversibility of all of the various component groups that may be isolated from them. It is true that various different protein "fractions" (component groups?) can be isolated by minor variations m technique. These "fractions" vary systematically with respect to reversibility, susceptibility to denaturation, solubility, and chemical com - position. For the purpose of briefly indicating the nature of these systematic variations one may conveniently consider the various component systems of gluten as falling roughly into three groups. There is the "glutenin" group, the "gliadin" group, and a third group having intermediate properties and designated as "mesonin". The component systems of the glutenin group are the most insoluble and the least readily reversible. The gliadin "fractions" are the most readily reversible and the most soluble. The "mesonin" group is in - termediate with respect to these properties, as would be ex - pected. The irreversibility of the glutenin group is probably due to the fact that the components of this group are highly susceptible to denaturation during their exposure to the re - agents (alcohol, salts, etc.) used m their preparation. If denaturation could be completely avoided, it might be found that these glutenin systems are also reversible. Systematic variations m chemical composition have been proved by an - alyses of the products of hydrolysis of a considerable number of glutenin, gliadin, and mesonin preparations, respectively. Enzymes of Wheat Flour as Related to Flour Grade and Baking Chafacteristics. — Because of the urgent need m the wheat industry at the present time for a satisfactory standard procedure for the estimation of diastatic activity m wheat flour, and because of the failure of existing methods to give satisfactory results m the hands of different technicians, effort during the year has been devoted to the development of a suitable laboratory procedure for the determination of </seg>
            <seg id="p031">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station 24 flour diastatic value. The result has been a method that appears well suited for this purpose. The method for which specifications and details are being published in the May, 1933, issue of Cereal Chemistry is based upon Hagedorn and Jensen's (Biochem. Zeitschr. 135:45-58, 1923) micro-method for the estimation of blood sugar. This method depends upon the reduction of potassium ferricyanide to ferrocyanide by reducing sugars in alkaline solution, fol - lowed by iodometric titration of the unreduced ferricyanide. Its adaptation for use with flour and cereal products necessi - tated a study of numerous factors involved, both individually and in relation to each other. The proposed method, when used strictly according to specifications, appears to combine the following features: (1) reliability, (2) simplicity, (3) convenience, (4) minimum requirement for special equip - ment, and (5) consistent agreement among different lab - oratories. It is being submitted to the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists as a suitable basis for an "official" method. plant diseases Environmental Conditions Influencing the Development of Stem Rust in the Absence of an Alternate Host. — This study, covering ten years, has been completed, with the general con - clusion that an epidemic is possible under a sequence of the following conditions: (1) a large amount of initial inoculum reaching Nebraska when conditions favor maximum infec - tion and the subsequent production of large numbers of pri - mary uredia over a wide area; (2) winter wheat entering the heading stage the first week of June or thereafter, with pri - mary uredia appearing about the same time; (3) an extended fruiting period during which optimum temperature, an evenly distributed precipitation above the normal, and other favor - able conditions are at hand for rapid development of uredio - sporic conditions. The Pathological and Physiological Aspects of Alfalfa Fail - ures in Nebraska. — About 200 additional varieties, strains, and selections were tested and rated for cold resistance dur - ing the past season. This work is co-operative with the U. S. Department of Agriculture. Research Bulletin 66 contains the results of three years' testing of alfalfas from the United States, South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. Except for seed originating from a few old fields of Turkestan and Ladak and the seed lots of Turkestan origin, all were found susceptible to wilt. It has been found that wilt-resistant </seg>
            <seg id="p032">Forty-seventh Annual Report 25 alfalfas should be isolated from susceptible sorts when they are grown for seed; otherwise cross pollination will weaken their resistance. It appears that the trend of cold resistance for each suc - cessive uneliminated inbred generation is sharply lowered, but that when cold elimination is practiced the remaining plants, when selfed, yield progeny with much greater cold resistance. Much of the same relationship occurs in selfed lines and in the progeny of individual plants selected for wilt resistance. With few exceptions it has been possible by elim - ination through wilt and cold testing to obtain individuals, the progeny of which show a high resistance to both wilt and cold. Research Bulletin 63 contains the results of a study of the nature of resistance in alfalfa to wilt. It was found that re - sistance in some alfalfas is associated with certain morpho - logical features, particularly in the root, which inhibit rapid development and invasion of the vital tissues by the bacteria. Differences in these features may be modified by environ - ment ; for this reason not a single alfalfa has been found com - pletely resistant. Hardiness of Alfalfa, Winter Wheat, and Other Crops. — During the past few years a study has been made of environ - mental influences on hardening, in co-operation with the U. S. Department of Agriculture. A method has been developed by which hardiness in alfalfas can be determined by their enzymatic response. For several years hardiness studies of winter wheats have been in progress, and work with spring grains has been under way for the past two years. The De - partment of Agronomy and the, U» S. Department of Agri - culture co-operate. Potato Scab and Fusarium Wilt in Relation fa Infection from the Soil. — The data from a scab survey conducted on 100 western-Nebraska farms several years ago have been pre - pared for publication. Analysis of the data shows that length of time between potato crops was the most important factor in relation to scab infection. The interval between crops had no influence on Fusarium wilt. There was a definite correla - tion between decreasing amounts of scab and increasing H-ion concentration from pH 6.0 to 8.5. Scab, Fusarium wilt, ahd Rhizoctonia are being studied in connection with- rotation experiments at the Scottsbluff and Box Butte substations. \ In the greenhouse the effect of soil temperature, moisture, and aeration previous to the time of tuber formation is be - ing studied in both sterilized and unsterilized inoculated soils. </seg>
            <seg id="p033">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station 26 Preliminary tests indicate that the factors that influence scab development during the time of tuber formation may also influence the potential scab-producing power of the soil. Actinomyces scabies has been found capable of attacking and rotting the stems and stolons if the soil is heavily inoculated. A large number of strains of this organism reported from Europe as pathogenic have been tested. Extensive studies of soils, in both the field and greenhouse, have been made by the dilution-plate method in an attempt to correlate either the number or the percentage of Actinomyces and other organisms with the amount of scab produced on such soils. The results to date are not very encouraging. Histological studies have been made of infection phenomena with different varieties of tubers at various ages. Physio - logical and morphological studies of strains of A. scabies and other pathogenic species are being conducted. The Cherry Leaf Spot Disease Caused by Coccomyces Hiemalis. — This project, in co-operation with the Department of Horticulture, has been confined to a study of the time and number of spray applications necessary for control of leaf spot on Early Richmond and Montmorency cherries. In 1931 the omission of the fourth spray of lime-sulfur resulted in a greater amount of infection than the omission of any other spray. In 1932 leaf spot was more severe and again the most important spray was the fourth. A large amount of infection occurred after August 10th and a fifth spray would have been needed to control the disease effectually. The severe infec - tion of the Early Richmond was probably due to the early infection of many root sprouts that served later as a source of inoculum. Such sprouts should have been removed or sprayed. WUt and Die-back of the White Elm. — The results of this study are being printed as Research Bulletin 70. The organ - ism is apparently identical with that described by Curtis May of Ohio and is a species of Cephalosporium. The only con - trol found is that of early removal of infected portions of the tree before the disease becomes well established. Diseases of Garden Beans in Nebraska. — Many bean fields were examined in the Scottsbluff irrigated district for dis - eases.

POULTRY ,J The Feeding Value of Various Dried-meat Products. — Since great variation has been reported in the value of various meat products as poultry feed a series of experiments was planned in which 20 parts of dried-meat product adjusted with starch to the same protein level were added to 80 parts of basal ration. Four kinds of meat meal, namely meat meal crack - lings, tankage, meat and bone meal, and meat meal crack - lings with a protein level slightly higher than that of the first - named kind, were compared in lots of one hundred Leghorn chicks each. The data indicate no striking differences in the growth-promoting value of the various products when fed at the same protein level. The Antirachitic Value of Cod-liver Stearine for Growing Chicks. — The rickets-preventing value of stearine and the crude cod-liver oil from which the stearine was produced were compared in two series of experiments. It is apparent from the results that about 40 per cent more stearine than crude cod-liver oil is required to supply a given number of anti - rachitic units. Nutritive Value of Wheat and Wheat-milling Products for Growing Chicks. — Wheat and its milling products are rel - atively rich in the vitamin B complex factor. The concentra - tion of these in different parts of the wheat kernel was studied by adding ground wheat, bran, and shorts at parallel protein levels to a basal ration made deficient in the Bx part of the B complex. A marked difference in the rate and qual - ity of feathering in the three lots of chicks was noted. Wheat bran apparently carries a factor which stimulates smooth feather development. A second trial gave similar results. Modifying the Calcium .-Phosphorus Ratio of a Specific Ration for Poults. — It was observed that poults were able to tolerate a considerable variation in the Ca:P ratio when liberal amounts of vitamin D and ultra-violet energy were provided. In the first series of experiments calcium carbon - ate additions were made to effect the Ca:P ratio variations. When vitamin D and ultra-violet energy were withheld the ration with higher calcium level (four per cent calcium car - bonate) and wider ratio prolonged the life of the poults con - siderably. Effect of Humidity on the Hatchability of Turkey Eggs. — Two small cabinet incubators with a fan system have been obtained for this work, which has just been started. In the </seg>

The Comparative Efficiency of Various Proteins in Poultry teedxng.—la\&amp;_t year's report a plan for studying the net retention of nitrogen, phosphorus, and calcium was described, bmce then four lots of 69 chicks each have been handled in the manner outlined, and a fifth lot of 64 is being studied The Ca:P ratio was varied and the effects of variations on net and absolute retentions were studied. The conclusions reached were as follows: 1. The net retention and absolute retention of nitrogen and Phosphorus are not affected by widening the Ca:P ratio. 2. The net retention of calcium decreases as the percent - age of calcium in the ration increases, other factors beinjr equivalent. B 3. The absolute retention of calcium in the bird is unaffect - ed by an increase in calcium in the ration. TheDepartment of. Poultry Husbandry co-operates with the Department of Chemistry on this project and on the others that involve the nutrient requirements of growing chicks. rural economics Nebraska Farm Land Prices.— This project consists of 0ne V 5 a histor y of f arm land prices from 1860 to 19dZ. The consideration involved in nearly every transfer by warranty deed has been obtained for eleven Nebraska counties. A second part is a study of the farm mortgage history of eleven southeastern Nebraska townships, chiefly in York county. The results of this study have been published as Research Bulletin 67. A third part deals with the assessed and sales value of Ne - braska farm land for the years 1921-32. Almost all of the tabulation on this phase has been completed. ? °\\2L Marketing Com and Wheat in Nebraska by Differ - ent Methods.— Statistics on price, production, and related phases are being added regularly to those already collected. Analysis of this material, together with current market infor - mation, provides the basis for the material presented each month in the Nebraska Economic Situation". It also provides a clearer insight into cyclical and seasonal price movements, their frequency of occurrence, and their causes. Audit data for 79 farmers' elevators for 1931 were added to similar data already tabulated. The three main aspects of </seg>
            <seg id="p036">Forty-seventh Annual Report 29 this study are: the financial status of Nebraska farmers' ele - vators, 1920-31; the operating results for the same years; and the development of standards for the use of local elevators in analyzing their operating results. Data on the market movement of the principal grains and classes of livestock were added to similar data already collect - ed Seasonal and regional differences in the marketing move - ment of these products and the factors accountable for these differences are being studied. Cost of Producing Farm Crops. — Farmers in various parts of the state co-operate in this work. They keep accurate records of hours of labor and other costs of various farm operations and these records are tabulated at the college. Records are being kept on wheat, corn, tractors, horses, and potatoes. The number of records ranged from 249 on corn in 1932 to 10 on tractors in the same year. In 1933 the num - bers of records were increased. Farm Organization and Farm Costs.— This project utilizes the farm account book for obtaining information upon the relative profit obtained under different systems of organizing the farm business in the various areas of the state. Many of the co-operators who keep a farm record book also keep cost - of-production records on one or two crops. About 1,000 books were placed with farmers for 1933. A manuscript is in pre - paration on "Effects of Inflation and Deflation upon Nebraska Agriculture, 1914-1932", in which some of the data obtained in this project will bemused. Transporting Livestock to Market.— -This project was closed in the autumn of 1932 with the publication of Bulletin 275, "Truck and Rail Transportation of Nebraska Livestock to the Omaha Market". ", ;. ... , Economic Studies in Prices, Volume of Production, and Purchasing Power of Farm Products.— Data on the prices paid farmers for corn, wheat, oats, hogs, butterfat, eggs, and potatoes at different places in the state from January, 1895, to December, 1932, have been assembled and published in Bulletin 284. . Sources and Expenditures of Public Revenue, with Special Reference to Nebraska.— -This emergency project was created as a result of numerous requests for information on tax matters. Such requests became exceptionally numerous in the spring of 1932. A series of twelve circulars on taxation was published by the Experiment Station, part of which were written by members of the Department of Rural Econorfiics </seg>

Severe storms have caused losses of $5,000 to $6,000 m property during the last two years. The 1933 crop season was approximately normal m total precipitation although the rainfall was distributed erratically. The carry-over of soil moisture was slight and the winter precipitation low, and the soil was very dry m the early spring. During April and May, however, 8.58 inches of rain fell. In June 'and July 1.85 inches was recorded and m Aug - ust and September the rainfall was slightly above normal. Late m November a slow rain of 1.15 inches left the soil m better condition for winter grains than for several years. Dry-land Crops and Tillage Practices. — The shortage of moisture during the winter and early spring resulted m a heavy loss of winter grains. The only survival of winter wheat was on fallow and on early fall plowing after small grain. Of these two the yield was but little better on fallow. Spring grains fared relatively better than winter wheat; the yields were only slightly below normal. Yields of corn aver - aged about 24 bushels per acre, which is about 20 per cent above normal. It was a good year for grain and forage sor - ghums : Kalo, a promising new grain sorghum, yielded 33 bushels per acre on cropped land and 59 on fallow ; Club Kafir, another new and later-maturing variety, yielded 29 bushels on cropped land and 64 on fallow. Potatoes were injured by the dry weather and yielded the lowest m twelve years; the highest yield was 55 bushels of No. 1 potatoes per acre after fallow, while the average on cropped land was 24 bushels. The results of dry-land crop production for the period 1907-31 have been published as Bulletin 279. Pump Irrigation. — During the season of 1933 the irriga - tion pumping plant was operated during five months on 39 days for a total of 322.5 hours. During this time 5,750 kw.- </seg>
            <seg id="p039">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station 32 hrs. of electricity were used and 822.2 acre inches of water pumped, at a cost of $151.54 for power and $99.45 for labor. Water was applied to 42.7 acres of corn, 1 acre of potatoes, 5 5 acres of alfalfa, 6.0 acres of sudan pasture, and 15 acres of ground to be seeded to new alfalfa. Yields of corn ran from about 30 to 85 bushels per acre and averaged over 59 Potatoes yielded about 400 bushels per acre. No attempt has been made to estimate the value of the in - creased production due to irrigation, but apparently as m tKiff?« TL he ma? c *Z pay even under low Prices and 2™S2IS/• *lf Plas Probably the outstanding feature demonstrated m the past several seasons is the fact that by generous use of water land may be got ready to support a stand of alfalfa when under natural conditions it would take a number of years to accomplish the same result. Corn, Wheat, and Rye for Fattening Calves.—The third years work on this project has been completed. The data obtained confirm the results of the previous years. Creep Feeding Calves.—This work was continued; the re - sults agree with data previously obtained. ' Feeding Cattle on Native Grass.—Steer calves which had been wintered on alfalfa hay and about 6 pounds of corn per head daily were fed m four ways: one lot was finished m dry lot on ground corn and alfalfa hay; a second lot was full-fed SETTI I°?™ (£- liat, ivi i grass for three montns and finished JJEZ ' a *hird lot was fed 8 Pounds of ground corn on ?It FL aas for three months and finished m dry lot; the fourth lot was grazed on native grass for three months with - iHSSfi 1 f nd then finished m dry lot.

            <seg id="p040">Forty-seventh Annual Report 33 Sheep. — The flock of grade ewes is kept on a farm flock basis. No experimental lamb feeding was done this year. Poultry. — A flock-testing project was begun this year in co - operation with the Department of Poultry Husbandry and the Extension Service. Entries of 100 eggs are incubated in the same incubator; the chicks are brooded together in large units; and records are kept of egg grades, fertility of the eggs, hatchability, death loss, and growth. In the fall 12 pullets from each entry will be selected and trapnested during their pullet year. Differences are already apparent. Horses. — Progress is being made in the development of the Percheron herd. Interest is reflected in the ready sale of surplus breeding animals. The Holstein Herd. — The quality of the herd has been much improved by the disposal of the older and less desirable cows. There has been only a fair demand for bulls. Since July 1, 1932, the Advanced Registry Office has reported 17 365-day semiofficial records. All age classes except Senior 1 and Senior 4 are represented. The average of the 17 records is 722.9 pounds of fat, with three records above 800, one reach - ing 893. The daughters of the former herd sire, N P Hengerveld Topsy Count, and the present herd sire, Sir Triune Pansy 24th, are finding permanent places in the herd. A daughter of the former bull raised the herd record in the Junior-2 class by producing 18,978 pounds of milk, or 696.6 pounds of fat. A daughter of the latter produced 19,937 pounds of milk, or 717.1 pounds of fat. These cows show quality and size as well as productive power. Horticulture. — The past season has given further evidence that some species of trees will not live during periods of long - continued drouth at the North Platte Substation without special care and attention. Jack Pine in most of the plantings has died, presumably because of insufficient moisture. West - ern Yellow, Scotch, and Austrian pines have lived under similar conditions. It would seem that the Jack Pine should be confined to the sandy soils. Many of the Black Hills spruce which had been growing for twenty years and had attained a height of 20 to 25 feet died, presumably also for lack of moisture. Russian Olive trees have been dying back for the past several years. The loss among the irrigated trees is at about the same rate as among the trees on dry land. Hackberry, American Elm, and Honey Locust are still the best deciduous trees for lawn and street planting, with Colo - rado Blue Spruce, Austrian pine, and Black Hills spruce as </seg>

The effect on sugar content will also be studied. The work has not been advanced far enough for conclusive results. Potatoes. — A series of tests was begun with an early-matur - ing strain of Triumphs to compare this strain with Cobbler, which is usually selected as an early potato m this valley. The results thus far indicate that this strain of Triumph is fully the equal of Cobbler as an early market potato. Lamb Feeding.— -The last year of a three-year lamb-feeding test was completed. Wheat has been used m connection with other feeds, and uniform gains were obtained from the lots m which it was fed. Dairying.— The division of the herd into two groups, one of which gets a grain supplement while the other is fed rough - age alone, has been continued. The average profit above feed cost has been practically the same m both lots. Poultry. — The work with poultry is demonstrational rather than experimental. Ordinary farm conditions are approxi - mated and by attention to care and feeding it is being shown that a small flock can be made to yield a profit. </seg>

Generally speaking, the choice between the several supplements used will depend largely upon their accessibility and cost. Dairy Cattle. — The small herd of purebred Holsteins is managed as a demonstration herd. The data kept include breeding, feeding, and production. The herd has a five-year average on two-time milking of 411 pounds of butterfat. There has been a good demand for surplus females, but only a fair demand for bulls. Poultry. — While there has normally been a decrease m the fertility and hatchability of turkey eggs as the laying season has advanced, the decrease this year was unusually great. Eggs placed m the incubator April sth showed 94 per cent fertility and 73 per cent hatchability. By the last of May these percentages had dropped to 63 and 13. Meadow Investigation. — The water table m the subirrigated meadows has lowered sufficiently m many places to make seed - ing of clover unprofitable. The stand on established clover meadows has been reduced and yields cut close to 25 per cent. Trees. — The shelter belt plantings of 20 years ago suffered considerable loss the past year. American Elm has 100 per cent survival. The heaviest loss has been with Boxelder and Honey Locust. A belt of Chinese Elm set out three years ago have suffered no loss since the first month.
