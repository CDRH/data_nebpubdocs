            <seg id="p003">Nebraska State Board of Health BULLETIN NO. 1. CREATING A STATE BOARD OF HEALTH K first law creating a State Hoard of Health in the State of ka was passed by the Legislature in 181)1. There being no itional provision for a State Hoard of Health, this difficulty ercoinc by creating a board of health out of state ofti&gt; provided for by constitution by a statutory act. Estate Hoard of Health (proper) consists of three members, overnor. Attorney General, and the Superintendent of Public iction. who are ex-officio members, four secretaries who are i-tive members of the Hoard and are appointed from three \a of medicine, for a term of four years, two of whom are reg - one a homeopath, and one an eclectic. The first Hoard of Secretaries consisted of James Vance Beghtol. regular, of Friend, Nebraska; Charles F. Stewart, of Auburn, ecl.-c - tic; Frederick E. Halderman, regular, of Omaha; Edmund Turney Allen, homeopath, of Omaha, who issued to themselves the first certificates, which are numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively and bear the date of August 18, 1891. GOVERNING THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE Finy person is regarded as practicing medicine who shall operate profess to heal or prescribe for or otherwise treat ailments of another. The exceptions to this act of the Legislature are gratui - tous service in case of emergency, administration of ordinary house - hold remedies, and does not apply to commissioned surgeons in the United States Army and Navy, nor to nurses engaged in their legit - imate occupations. 3 </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 MATERNITY HOMES Plaws were enacted by the last Legislature affecting medic;il tion. The House Roll No. 247. regarding hospitals that receive for care or treatment, within a period of six months, more than one woman during pregnancy, or during or after delivery, except women re - lated by blood or marriage ; or has in his or her custody or control, at any one time, two or more infants under the age of two years, unattended by parents or guardians, for the purpose of providing them with care, food, and lodging, except infants related to them by blood or marriage, shall be deemed to maintain a maternity home or maternity boarding house, or home for the care of infants, or lying-in hospital. The law requires such hospital or homes to obtain a license from ate Board of Health, after having first obtained endorsement from the local board of health. The law is a move in the right di - rection. An amendment should be made to this law making it more effective in closing up abortion houses and baby farms. MEDICAL COLLEGES .ite Kile No. 27!* was passed, amending the law defining M ••&gt; 1 - ical Colleges, which provides for the following: The main points in the law are the following: "Legally char - tered" medical colleges shall require for admission: (1) at least a diploma from an accredited high school of this or some other state, or a certificate from the State Superintendent of Public Instruc - tion showing that the applicant has successfully passed an exami - nation covering the branches of study embraced in an accredited high school course; (2) said medical college or school in good standing shall show evidence of modern methods in all its branches of instruction and demonstration; (3) its equipment and facilities for medical instruction shall be modern and shall be kept up-to - date by the purchase from time to time and use of such equipment as the State Board of Health shall prescribe; (4) said medical col - lege or school in good standing shall keep and maintain a library consisting of up-to-date text-books and periodicals dealing with medical subjects and questions; (5) such medical colleges or schools in good standing shall have access to, own, or control a hospital, </seg>
            <seg id="p005">5 the students of said medical college or school shall be required to regularly participate in the treatment of cases; (6) said medical colleges or schools in good standing shall have a faculty of at least four who devote their entire time to the teaching of medicine and its associated branches in said school, and the remainder of the faculty shall be composed of representative members of the medical profession; (7) such medical colleges or schools shall also require as a requisite for granting the degree of M.D. attendance upon at least four courses of lectures of eight months each, no two of such courses to be held within one year, and having a full faculty of capable professors in all the different branches of medical educa - tion, to-wit, anatomy, physiology, chemistry, toxicology, pathology, hygiene, materia medica, therapeutics, obstetrics, bacteriology, medical jurisprudence, gynecology, principles and practice of medi - cine and surgery, and especially requiring clinical instructions in the two last named of not less than four hours per week in each week during the last two courses of lectures. It is the duty of the Board to see that the above provisions are strictly enforced. They have the right to inspect the equipment and method of teaching of the medical colleges and schools of the State, and have the power to refuse examination to the j;radiiate* of schools which are adjudged not a college or school in good standing. ■11 be apparent to any one in favor of higher medical educa - e advancement and benefit this law gives, not only to the but the profession as well, of the State. iirmer ruling of the Attorney General was to the effect that the old law any one presenting a diploma from a legally red medical college and obtaining grades by examination by injunction or by process of law, obtain an order from the compelling the Hoard to issue him a license. This can not lie inder the present law, which shuts out the possibility of quiz nd students becoming successful applicants before the State CERTIFICATES Since the organization of the State Board of Health applications for license to practice medicine have been granted or refused as f li </seg>

            <seg id="p008">8 VITAL STATISTICS The legislature of 1905 for the promotion of sanitary and statis - tical purposes created the State Board of Health a registrar of vital statistics, and for the proper carrying out of its provisions provides for the appointment of local registrars, deputy registrars, and sub - :ars in the cities, towns, villages, and rural districts through - out the State. Bj this law physicians are required to fill out a .standard birth certificate for each birth occurring in their practice and file the same promptly with the local registrar or sub-registrar Where no physician is in attendance, the law requires the house - holder to make such returns. The physician is also required to fill out the medical part of the death certificate for all deaths occur tin his practice. This act requires every undertaker or person ig in such capacity, in the burial or other disposition of the I. to fill out or cause to be filled out a standard death certifi - and file the same with the local registrar or sub-registrar, and ive from such registrar a burial or removal permit before such • is removed for burial or other disposition; and all sextons at takers of cemeteries are required to demand such permits be - fore allowing burial to take place. The penalty for the violation of any of the provisions of this law is a fine of not less than $10 nor more than $100. The law provides that the State Board of Health classify, compile, index, and make a permanent record of the births and deaths reported. owa If * Kansas 1, X Centui k y 1, 2 Louisiana 1, Maine 1. 2 Maryland 1, 2 lichigan 1. 2 (innesota 1, 2 [issouri 1, 2 'evada 1, 2 ;ew Hampshire 1, 2 New Jersey '. 1, Ohio 1, 2 South Dakota 1.
