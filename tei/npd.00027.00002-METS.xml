            <seg id="p002"/>
            <seg id="p003">sentatives of the Thirty-Third Session of the Legis - lature of Nebraska: Gentlemen: tit is with a sense of grave responsibility that I assume duties of this high office. Few men in the history of a monwealth are called by the people to serve in this capac - and while it is my good fortune to be thus honored, I hope ill be my opportunity to be of some real service to the )le of Nebraska. compliance with the constitution, I submit the fol - lg for your information and consideration : Under our plan of government, you have the important function of formulating and passing laws. The power to ap - propriate the taxes of the people is left to your judgment, limited and subject only to the veto of the Governor. IYour powers, duties, and rights are enumerated in the stitution before it refers to either of the other coordinate nches of the government. You have the right to direct, slate, and control the business affairs of the state, prac - illy without limit. Your power to pass the laws, regulat - the life, liberty, and property of the people is limited only the state and federal constitutions. In the nature of things, you have in the past, and will continue in the future, to be the most important branch of the government. The far-reaching effect of your actions places grave responsibility on you. Moderation, prudence, and com - mon sense should guide and control your deliberations. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 Governor's Message All legislation should be accurately prepared and care - fully considered before passing. The things of immediate ad - vantage should not be held so close to your eyes that you can not see the great principles of justice and reason upon which all legislation of permanent value rests. It is your duty and mine, in dealing with appropriations, to be economical and just. We should not be parsimonious in making the necessary appropriations. I The power to appropriate does not mean that public is be improvidently spent or wasted. It does not mean ; the state should pursue policies regarding its public in - ltions that are wasteful. The care, fidelity, and economy successful private business should be applied to the af - 8 of the state. Economy is a public virtue as well as a ate one, and while I favor all necessary appropriations all public needs, I recommend that care and caution be I in making appropriations. APPROPRIATION BILLS. fin recent years, what is commonly referred to as "log - ing" has become a fixed habit in legislative bodies. The ling of votes by members of the legislature on appropria - bills is both vicious and dangerous. In doing this public Is are expended without sufficient consideration of either justice or the necessity of the appropriations. I favor the passage of legislation that will control and stop this evil. The important appropriation bills should not be held until the closing days of the legislative session. It is a physical impossibility to properly consider these bills at that time. The strife to pass laws and the haste with which things are done prevent' investigation and deliberation. The effort of members to economize in the early part of the legis- </seg>
            <seg id="p005">Nebraska Legislature 1913 5 lature is overlooked and forgotten. Public money should not be appropriated hastily and without consideration. A legis - lature does not perform its full duty to those who created it if it holds the appropriation bills until the closing hours of the legislative session, and then forces these important bills through by voting for the reports of conference committees. I suggest that all appropriation bills be made a special order by the house of representatives, beginning on the twen - ty-fifth day of the legislative session; that after that date, these bills continue to have first place on the calendar until all have been considered and disposed of; if this is done, they will reach the senate early in the session. Then the senate can make these bills a special order early in the session, say the fortieth legislative day. These appropriation bills can then be given first place on the senate calendar until all have been disposed of. This suggestion, if adopted and fol - lowed, will make it possible to dispose of all appropriations before the fiftieth day of the session. If you will take this advanced step, you will render invaluable service to the peo - ple of the state. In my judgment this course will largely eliminate "log-rolling" and vote-trading on appropriation bills. I Wherever possible, specific items should be given. The dency is to make appropriations in bulk sums. Whenever ssible, the specific items of each appropriation should be en. By doing this, you can get a better understanding what the appropriation is for; the governor can then in - itigate and pass on each item. THE EXPENDITURE OF PUBLIC MONEY. The most serious problem of Nebraska affairs is the in - creasing expenses of our state government, and the most </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 Governor's Message important matter for this legislature and my administration to deal with is the proper expenditure of public funds. I Our increasing taxes are not caused, in my judgment, dishonest or corrupt officials. It may be true that in te cases there is petty graft, but the main fault lies in the ure of our business agents to properly manage our state itutions, and the other business affairs of the state. BOARD OF CONTROL. I believe that the people of Nebraska who are intelligent and who from the strides of this state in industrial and agri - cultural pursuits are disposed to carefully manage their private business, have realized that the state's finances have been carelessly and indifferently managed. This may have been due in part to the inefficiency of our system and partly from our inclination to mix too much politics with our busi - nes8. Be this as it may, it is a matter of congratulation to the people of this state that they have adopted almost unani - mously the proposed constitutional amendment, providing for a non-partisan board of control of our public institutions. I shall endeavor to name as members of this board honest men who have succeeded in their own business, and who will bring to the management of these state institutions a large and successful experience in private business. It is my hope that through this board all the supplies of the state will be bought through one purchasing agent at a greatly reduced cost. In my judgment it is waste and extravagance in the different branches of the state govern - ment which causes high taxation. This can be largely eliminated by a strictly business management. 81 shall also require during my administration that the n who are placed on this board shall make their home </seg>
            <seg id="p007">7 during their term of office at Lincoln and devote their entire time to the business of the state. I shall also insist that no member of the board, no rela - tive or business associate of any member of the board, Ik - interested in any contract to which the state is a party, and that no relative of any member of the board be appointed by said board to any position in the state institutions. I would recommend that the above provisions be embodied in the new law governing the board. I hope that this legislature will provide adequate salaries for the members of this board, in order that the state may at all times have the service of high-class and competent men on this board. While the first members of this board will not assume office until July 1. I shall make the ap - pointment at as early a date as possible, and after confirma - tion of the same by the senate, I shall expect these men, from the time of their appointment until they assume official control of our state institutions, to familiarize themselves with the different institutions, the number and character of employees, and particularly investigate whether the state needs as much help at the different institutions as it has at the present time. From the number of applications I have had for appointments, I am led to believe that some of these positions could, without impairment of service, be either consolidated with other positions or abolished entirely. I shall insist that the primary consideration in the manage - ment by this board of our state institutions shall be that every person employed by the state shall render an adequate service for the compensation he receives, and that if the duties of any position are such as not to require such services, that such position shall be abolished. </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 i[ therefore ask the earnest cooperation of this legisla - in securing a broad and comprehensive law defining the 8 of this new board, and fixing its responsibility. EDUCATION AND AGRICULTURE. I favor a liberal policy towards our educational institu - tions. Our state ranks among the first in the Union in her educational advantages, and I am confident that our people want appropriations sufficient to maintain her standing as a progressive state in educational affairs. Our university has made remarkable advances, and I am satisfied it is in the control of splendid men, and under wise management. This institution, however, is handicapped for want of revenue, its funds being raised entirely from direct taxation. This condition, therefore, would cause me to be opposed to its removal from its present location, es - pecially in view of the fact that removal would mean a prac - tical total loss as far as the present buildings are con - cerned, and would undoubtedly mean a great sacrifice in the value of the present site. It is no serious handicap for the agricultural college to be separated from the main university. In its present location, the university is more accessible to the large body of students, especially those who are compelled to seek employment during their college course. This latter feature can not be emphasized too much, as the state has no more important asset than these self - made young men and women who are seeking an education. In this connection I would add that in my judgment the efficiency of our state normal schools could be increased by placing these institutions under the control of our board of regents, or the board of control. I Nebraska is primarily an agricultural state, and general culture our principal resource. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">9 I am in favor of a broad and liberal policy on the part of the state towards our agricultural interests, in order that we may not only add to our productive area, but also increase materially the products of that now in cultivation. Inten - sive farming should be the aim of all Nebraskans. This means real "conservation" for Nebraska. It will Mag in - creased prosperity athome, and prestige away from home. COUNTY AGRICULTURAL EXPERTS. tTo the above end I am in favor of supplementing the k of our agricultural schools by a law authorizing county •ds, if they deem it advisable, to employ expert help at county farms in each county for the purpose of making and crop experiments, testing seeds, and otherwise ap - ng improved and scientific methods of farming and stock ing to local conditions. PENITENTIARY. tThe penitentiary of this state should not only be a penal tution but also a reformatory. To this end I would mmend that the short-term and less hardened criminals eparated from the long-term and more vicious inmates. This could be brought about by converting the Milford Home for old soldiers into a reformatory where the inmates could take up agricultural work and be used on the public roads of the state under suitable provisions of law. Such a law should also provide that any discharged convict from the penitentiary could secure employment at the reformatory at a living wage until he could secure permanent employ- In this connection I would also recommend that the state pass stringent laws against the tramp nuisance, and </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 Egravated cases that confirmed tramps be committed to reformatory or sentenced to work on county experi - al farms, where such farms are established. II am opposed to contract prison labor, and I would ommend that the legislature pass a law abolishing the ae in this state, and that the inmates of our state prisons o are not working at agriculture or road-making should used by the state in making articles of wearing apparel 1 other supplies for our different state institutions. I am ormed that the state at a small expense could install sew - : machines and other necessary machinery for this purpose. e policy of the state in my judgment should be to use these goners on work that requires the greatest amount of labor I the least amount of capital. tThe diversion of part of the penitentiary labor to road - ling would be a step in the good roads movement which state should take up. I hope that the legislature will rtake some systematic policy of good road building in ■aska. ILLICIT USE OF OPIATES. One of the principle sources of trouble at penal institu - tions is the illicit use of opiates among the inmates. This traffic should be suppressed, and I recommend that the legislature make it a felony for any person to illegally traffic in such articles at our penitentiary. OLD SOLDIERS. tThe establishment of a reformatory as above recom - led would necessitate the abandonment of the Milford iers' Home. This would result in a benefit to the state ell as to the old soldiers affected. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">Nebraska Legislature 1913 11 The Grand Island Home could be improved and enlarged if necessary, and the old soldiers, to whom this nation owes a lasting debt of gratitude, could be better cared for. The most comfortable quarters and conveniences should be pro- Tided for these deserving citizens during their declining years. Upon my last visit to the soldiers' home at Grand Island, I noticed a serious oversight on the part of some one. I found men well advanced in years subjected to the necessity (if climbing several flights of stairs to reach their quarters. This should be remedied at once, and the state should provide suitable elevator facilities at this institution. I recommend that the legislature make a suitable .ap - propriation for this purpose. ROAD LAWS Our road laws are inefficient and wholly inadequate. Having been passed at different times, the provisions are conflicting, and the duties and responsibilities divided. Having had actual experience as a county official, I feel war - ranted in saying that our system of road laws is responsible for the waste of more public funds than any other laws on the statute books. The present system of expending road and bridge funds is the largest leak in our system of gov - ernment. The plan of dividing the care and maintenance of highways and bridges between the road districts, the county and the state, is wrong. The expenditure of the bridge and road funds by different sets of officials necessarily means loss and waste. This divided responsibility and divi - sion of funds makes it impossible to economically or success - fully expend the road and bridge taxes. I We need a modern, up-to-date, business-like road law. central principle should be that one set of officials shall </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 and bridge funds shall be expended under the supervision of this set of officials. If you will pass an adequate road law, you will render a valuable service to the people of the state. While other questions are important, the passage of this law means more to the average taxpayer than any other legisla - tion that will be passed at this session. II recommend the repeal of the present road and bridge , and the passage of a comprehensive, efficient, and prac - road law. WATER POWER. I am in favor of the conservation of the resources of the state of Nebraska. Among these is the proper protection of the water power of the public streams of this state, and I would recommend that this legislature make a small appro - priation for the purpose of investigating the water-power resources of Nebraska. tThe state should be fully advised as to what the possi - ties of the state in this line are, before it attempts any iprehensive legislation on the subject. If valuable water r er exists in this state, the rights to the same should be rrved for the people, and the same relinquished only under per leases from the state, whereby the rates and uses of same are fully controlled. tMy recent visit to Scotts Bluff has impressed me with value of water for irrigation, whereby vast areas of land hat part of the state, a few years since wonniess and roductive, have been converted into as productive and lable an agriculural section as there is in the world. R Water power rights are very valuable in other states, there is no reason why the people of this state should </seg>
            <seg id="p013">Nebraska Legislature l!*i:{ 13 not enjoy cheaper power for various uses, if the same can be made available through water power existing in the state. I am apprised of the fact that the beds of the streams in the western part of our state are underlaid with gravel and sand, and it should be first determined as an engineering proposition to what extent permanent dams and the proper diversion of such streams can be made, hence my recommen - dation of a small appropriation for proper investigation before the state is committed to a large outlay of money. SCHOOL LANDS. It is frequently suggested that the state should sell the public school lands, the argument being made that such a policy would open up more land for settlement, and would yield a greater income to the school fund. I am opposed to the sale of these lands, as I have confidence in the stability of these lands as a permanent investment. If none of the public school lands of the state had been sold, our entire public school system could be maintained at this time with slight expense in the form of direct taxation. Statistics show that the increase in value in farm lands in Nebraska has been in the last ten years over 100 per cent. This in - crease, in addition to the safety of the investment, appeals to me as an unanswerable argument why the state at this time should not sell these school lands. STATE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL. The usefulness of the state industrial school at Kearney can be materially extended. A complete and thorough course, similar to that pursued in the agricultural schools of our state, should be made a part of the course of study. We </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 scientific methods of farming. By developing a state farm in connection with this institution we can make it self-sus - taining, and, at the same time, give invaluable help and in - struction to the inmates. I recommend whatever legislation is necessary to carry out the foregoing suggestions. ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE. tOur constitution provides that all courts shall be open, every person, for any injury done him in his lands, goods, on, or reputation, shall have a remedy by due process iw and justice, administered without denial or delay. tTo make this provision effective, the voters of this state 908 increased the membership of the supreme court from ■e to seven members, and also increased the annual salary be supreme judges from $2,500 to $4,500. principal argument made in favor of this increase that the work of the court would be kept up. It was aed and represented that justice could and would be lily administered. I Two years ago it became apparent that our supreme rt was falling behind with its work. In order to assist court the legislature passed a law requiring all litigants &gt;rint abstracts of the pleadings and the evidence. This, ■as claimed, would enable the court to catch up and keep the work of that body. Notwithstanding the increased abership of the court, and the increased salary of the Bjes, and the passage of an act placing additional expense litigants for the printing of abstracts, the work of the reme court has continued to fall behind. At the present time there are nearly one thousand cases on the supreme court docket undisposed of. The court is nearly two years behind with its work, and continues to lose ground. This condition of the supreme court docket works </seg>
            <seg id="p015">15 injustice. If litigants must wait two or three years in order that their rights may be adjudicated, their constitutional rights are abridged, and in many instances denied. tin my opinion, there is no need of seven judges sitting very case. Provisions should be made for a division of court into sections. JUDGES BY DISTRICTS tOur present plan of state wide primary nominations lies it possible for the centers of population to elect most the judges. To remedy these things, a constitutional jndment should be submitted, providing for the election nembers of our supreme court in districts, thereby giving erent sections of the state representation in this court. NON-PARTISAN JUDICIARY. In 1909 a law was passed requiring all candidates for judicial office to run by petition. This law prohibited poli - tical parties from nominating candidates for judicial posi - tions. This law was declared invalid by a divided court. Four members of the court concurred in the opinion which declared the law unconstitutional. In 1911, the legislature passed a similar law eliminating the provisions that had been found objectionable by the court. The Governor of our state vetoed this act. One branch of the legislature passed the act over the Governor's veto, but it failed of passage over the Governor's veto in the other branch by a few votes. As the people of this state have elected a majority of two legislatures in favor of this principle, it seems but just that it should be made a part of the statute law of the state. The voters of Nebraska have indicated very strongly that they are not satisfied with the present method of electing judicial </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 Governor's Message officers. The people of this state desire to remove the judi - cial branch of the government as far as possible from the in - fluence of partisan politics, and I recommend the passage of whatever legislation is necessary for this purpose. WORKINGMEN'S COMPENSATION ACT. Not having had either the time or the opportunity to ex - amine the proceedings and the reports of the workingmen's compensation commission, I do not feel qualified to make a recommendation at this time on this important subject. This legislation deals with an important phase of our busi - ness and social life, so careful examination and thoughtful consideration should be given to it by this legislature. CORPORATIONS. In 1909 the legislature passed a law which imposed an occupation fee on corporations, ranging from five dollars on a corporation with a capital of ten thousand dollars or less, to two hundred dollars on a corporation with a capital stock of over two million dollars. Since then the supreme court has decided that the state has a right to levy and collect this occupation fee. I The amount of the fee paid by the larger corporations is lly out of proportion to the amount paid by the smaller •orations. If a corporation capitalized at five hundred isand dollars contributed to this fund in the same pro - ion that a ten thousand dollar corporation does, the unt of the fee would be two hundred and fifty dollars ead of a hundred dollars, while if a corporation capital - at two million dollars contributed in the same proportion a ten thousand dollar corporation does, the fee would ne thousand dollars instead of two hundred dollars. </seg>
            <seg id="p017">17 While I am not in favor of making this occupation fee oppressive, still I am in favor of amending the law so that the larger corporation shall contribute a just and propor - tionate share as compared with the smaller corporations. I recommend the amendment of the law increasing the amount of the occupation fee on larger corporations. ELECTION LAWS. The independence of the voter, generally speaking, is of benefit to society. I am in favor of encouraging independ - ent voting, and to that end, I recommend that the party circle at the head of the official ballot be abolished. I The registration laws of our cities should be modified, the passage of laws that will permit voters, in es where registration is required, to register without in - venience or delay, and I further recommend that provi - is be placed in these registration laws which will preserve h the freedom and the purity of elections. I recommend passage of laws that will permit contest of a primary :tion, and also legislation that will permit the recount of es cast for candidates at a general election. GOVERNOR'S TERM OF OFFICE. II desire to reiterate my declaration when I was a candi- I for this office that I am strongly in favor of limiting Governor of this state to a single term. I deem it advis - ', however, that the term should be increased to a four - • term, and the salary increased to such an amount as fairly compensate, not only for the services rendered as jrnor, but for the legitimate expenses incident to this </seg>
            <seg id="p018">18 Governor's Message THE SAN FRANCISCO EXPOSITION. This legislature will be asked by representatives of the Panama Exposition for an appropriation for a suitable ex - hibit of this state. I am opposed to any appropriation for «uch purpose, as I believe that the state can to a far greater advantage expend the public money on good roads, educa - tional or agricultural development. THE WIDOW OF ROY BLUNT. This legislature is familiar with the unfortunate occur - rence at our state penitentiary some months ago, following which during the pursuit of escaped convicts, Roy Blunt, an innocent citizen of Nebraska, lost his life, leaving a young widow, now a mother. I deem it proper that the state should now make reparation as far as possible for this death, and I would recommend that this legislature appropriate the sum of $20,000 for the purchase of a quarter section of land in Sarpy county, the home of the widow, the title of said land to be taken by the state, and that the control and income of the same be given to the widow during her lifetime. PUBLICITY DEPARTMENT. As a means of aiding in the state's development, I favor a policy of greater publicity as to the resources of Nebraska- Statistics and information on farming, stock raising, dairy - ing, fruit raising possibilities, as well as opportunities for manufacturing and other industries should be secured by an officer of the state, and this information furnished to pros - pective settlers and investors. I am not in favor of creating a separate department for 4- It a aKnira mii*nAfliia Wilt* T iwu&gt;niTl m &amp;Y\ H t Yt n t t }\ id lf&gt;anal a til 1*0 lilt* aliuv tr |JUl uui 1 1 cvviuiuiviiu mai 11110 u^ima 1 ui xz </seg>

I It has been urged from various sources that this state i need of a new capitol building. In this opinion I do not :ur. Admitting that there is some congestion in the pres - capitol building, I believe it would be far more advisable rovide a separate building on state ground, which build - should be the property of the state, for the use of our reme court, our state library and the state historical The site owned by the state historical society is in my judgment a suitable site, but before there is any building erected by the state on this or any other property, the title should be taken in the name of the state, and kept entirely under its control. I recommend for your consideration an appropriation suitable for the above purpose. THE PUBLIC HEALTH. I would recommend that you be liberal in matters tend - ing to safeguard the public health. The state has become so populated that our water supply and the disposal of sewage are factors in our health conditions, and I recommend that you enact such legislation as will tend to protect the lives and the health of our people. BLUE SKY LAW. The state of Kansas, by making her banking department </seg>
            <seg id="p020">Governor's Message zens, has to a large degree excluded from the state companies of no merit or of small likelihood of success, and through which in the past large sums of the people's savings have been lost. After due examination by the banking depart - ment a license to sell stocks and securities is issued to such companies only as can furnish evidence of merit and honest intentions. A similar law should be enacted in Nebraska. This law should also contain a provision prohibiting the sale of watered stock in any corporation. CONSTITUTIONAL. E recommend that you ratify the constitutional amend - submitted by the Federal Congress, providing for the on of United States senators by direct vote of the people. NEBRASKA. Nebraska, located as she is near the geographical center of our nation, capable of maintaining ten times her present population, possessing a fertile soil, healthful climate, an in - telligent and honest citizenship, is destined to lead in the things that make moral, mental, and intellectual greatness. »This is the state committed to our care. Let us act for common good in correcting abuses and making necessary rms. It is our duty to protect the rights of all, for jus - is the foundation upon which our government rests. In conclusion I desire to thank you for your attention, and to assure you that, as representatives of the people of this state, you will at all times have my earnest cooperation in all matters looking to the welfare of the state. I have no purpose to serve in this office but the good of the state, and I feel confident that as the law-making body of Nebraska, that I will also have your earnest cooperation. </seg>
