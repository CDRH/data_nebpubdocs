There was one bank failure daring the year, the Citi - zens Bank of Firth, which was taken charge of by State Bank Examiner E. S. Mickey by order of the State Bank - ing Hoard. March 1!'. l'.KiT. and placed in (he hands of ceiver Fred Whittemore March 26, 1907, who has since paid a dividend of seventy per cent to depositors. The action of the Banking Board dosing this bank was the result of in - formation received from those in charge of the bank, that the Cashier. Mr. W. .1. Crandall. the only resident officer of the bank, had absconded, and that a run on the bank by depositors was imminent. Upon investigation by the Exam iner it was ascertained that the cashier had lost heavily in siM'Culations on the lx&gt;ard of trade recently and had depart - ed for parts unknown, owin^j the bank a targe sum.

In the main the text of the State Banking act is complied with by the banks of the state to a degree that is gratifying to this Department, and recent events justify fully the wisdom of the banking act, which imposes restrictions sufficient to make conservative banking a rule in this state. Many of the afa of former years are no longer practiced, and a general senti - ment seems to ex'st am &gt;ng the banks that compliance with quirements of the law keeps a bank within the bounds of safety. in other words, the law is a sale guide, both to the experie and inexperienced, pointing the way that avoids loss and failure. There is one practice that exists to some extent in this state which, in my opinioa.sooner or later will have to be remedk sennas trouble will follow — I refer to a chain of small bi owned, operated a n:l controlled by the same management, or used as feeders for some larger bank.

S There are some amendments to the present law that would d materially to its efficiency, which have been called t&lt;&gt; your attention and to the attention of the legislature heretofore. Some legs] definition ought to be adopted of the words "bank" and other of these propositions should be adopted. No addition to the present law would strengthen the banks of this sta' much as a provision that would lead to increasing the surplus funds of the banks. A. large surplus fund not only gives in creased security to the depositor, but stands as a protection against insolvency or impairment of capital stock. (While the average reserve carried by banks seldom alls below thirty per cent there are some few that loan too &gt; and at times have barely the legal requirement of fifteen per b available. I would recommend that the law be amended ring banks to carry at least twenty-five per cent of their its in available funds. elusion this Department you ha\ '"bunker'". so that this Department might protect hanks from en- noachment by people or institutions attempting to do a bank- ing business, or some part of it under some other name. I would also recommend that a provision be enacted prohib- iting the officers and employes of a bank from borrowing funds, directly or indirectly, and fixing proper penalties for the violation thereof. I would also recommend that that the law provide that the affairs of corporations transacting a banking business be man- aired and controlled by a board of directors constating of not than three residents of the state of Nebraska, and each men ild be the owner of at least $500.00 par value of the capital k, and that the president and rice-president be chosen from :ird of directors. The Department believes that banks should be encoui to increase their surplus funds, and one of two methods should ulopted to bring about this desired end in the interest of protection to the depositor: either the surplus fund should fempt from taxation, or banks should be permitted to loan up twenty per cent of their paid capital and surplus combined.
