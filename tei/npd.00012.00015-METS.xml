REPORT. 

K presenting to you the eighth biennial report of the 
aska Industrial Home I feel my inability to make clear 
u the good the home is accomplishing and its great need. 

11 the first place, the object of the home does not seem i&lt;&gt; 
nderstood by the public at large as it should. I am smv 
friends who are at all conversant with the work ami 
hings of the home will agree with me that the obje&lt; 
arthy one— to give shelter and protection to unfortunate 
ng women and girls, and help them to better lives. In 
first place, by living good lives ourselves, and by m 
mental training, they are inspired to higher ideals; then 
he physical training in the industrial departments they 
fitted to fill higher places in life. 

I am a great believer in dealing with — permit me to say 
law breakers — with kindness. Of course there are cases 
where severe punishment must be resorted to; but with the 
class of young women and girls we have to deal a kind word 
spoken at the right time will do more to break a stubborn 
will than the most severe measures. Service rend' 
through fear of punishment is never satisfactory, and is certainly 
not a means of reform. Reformation must come from 
the heart, and severe punishment does not touch the heart 
in the right way, particularly the heart of the true American. 
It is more likely to arouse a feeling of rebellion and cause 
them to wish they were the ones in authority. 

INDUSTRY. 

In the industrial departments the inmates are taught system 
and thoroughness under the direction of the matron. 
They are drilled in the following departments: Laundry, 
plain cooking and pastry, chamber work, and general house- 

DISCIPLINE. </seg>

            <seg id="p006">

partments when considered by the superintendent and matron 
worthy of promotion. Each girl serves her time in all 
the departments. The majority become very capable housekeepers, 
and upon our recommendation secure positions in 
the best families of the state, where they have not failed to 
give good satisfaction. 

SEWING. 

Our sewing is an industry worthy of commendable mention. 
Each girl is required to spend a part of her time in 
the sewing room, where is taught all kinds of plain sewing, 
as well as hemstitching, drawn work in simple patterns, ami 
heting. In many cases girls when admitted to the institution 
know nothing about even the plainest sewing, luit 
become very good sewers before they leave. We try to fit 
each girl so she will be able to cut and make her own clothing, 
and, in fact, do all the plain sewing for a family. In 
cases where practicable girls are taught to cut and fit professionally. 


EDUCATIONAIi. 

I T e have a good school in connection with the home under 
efficient direction of Miss Etta Brooks, who also does 
bookkeeping and secretary work of the institution. All 
i who have not. finished the eighth grade in the public 
*ols are required to attend school, unless excused for 
ial reasons. The largest number enrolled in 1903 was 
and in 1904, 14. No pupil is excused from school except 
iccount of sickness, a fact which keeps our daily attend; 
almost perfect. The branches taught are reading, spellarithmetic, 
language, physiology, history, geography, 
penmanship. We have school eleven months each year. 

RELIGIOUS. 

K connection with the home we have a Sunday school, cond 
by the officers and employes of the institution. Also 
rt chapel service each evening. 

Twice each montli we have preaching by the Reverend Morgan 
of Grover, who gratuitously tenders his services. We </seg>

            <seg id="p007">

are much iadebtad and deeply grateful to him for his kindmmi 
intercut in our spiritual welfare. I would suggest 
tliat our appreciation be shown in a more substantial way 
thau a mere "Thank you." 

RKl'AIKS AND IMPROVEMENTS. 

I lie appropriation for repairs was so meager, considering 
in iiuitv of the repairs and improvements needed, that it 
decidedly discouraging to undertake the work. How, 
I have done the best I could under the circumstances. 
e had built a good, warm hog house 16 by 16, 15-foot 
e; a small chicken house 10 by 16 feet, shed roof 18 
es, brick foundation; also a new platform and frame for 
farm scales, and have fenced a ten-acre pasture for our 
*, and repaired all the fences, making those around the 
lots hog tight. 

I .are put a new roof on the cottage and otherwise repaired 
outside; repaired the plastering, papered, and painted 
inside of the building. 

Iave had both large nurseries painted and the floors ¦ 
with linoleum. Have had the plastering repaired in all 
rooms on the third floor in the north wing; also the 
aitory. Have papered the main hall, two large dining 
is, and the reading room. In the south wing have reed 
the plastering in several rooms, papered seven rooms 
two large halls. Have had f 65 worth of plumbing done 
titly. and numerous smaller repairs I will not take space 
lumerate. 

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS. 

To Governor Mickey I wish to express my sincere appreciation 
for kindly interest in the welfare of the home, ami 
for his encouragement and words of cheer. To the B&lt; 
of Public Lands and Buildings for their many courtesies ami 
care in seeing that the state funds have been used for the 
best interest of the institution. To the Advisory Board for 
their kindness, and to the business men of Milford and Lincoln, 
whom I have found at all times patient and obli^inir. </seg>

earnest work and loyalty, have been of great assistance to me
