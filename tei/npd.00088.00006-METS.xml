         <seg id="p009">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION GENERAL STATEMENT Presentation The purpose of this Thirty-Sixth Biennial Report of the State Depart - ment 'of Public Instruction is to provide officials and workers in the field of education with the information essential to cooperation in the school sys - tem of Nebraska. Selection of subjects follows the requirements of the law. Restriction of time and space limit presentation to outline form. These con - cisions of publication are in keeping with the democratic procedure of school administration in the state which offers to citizens the privilege of participa - tion in its program of citizenship. Review of previous reports shows.ti&gt;at many problems persist from bien - mum to biennium. It is encouraging to note in these same reports that solu - tions keep pace with the problems as they arise. Our public schools, like our homes and our churches and all the rest of our institutions, are of hum - ble origin; the equipment and service of today is the result of unremitting cooperative effort from year to year to help people meet the requirements of independence in a rapidly changing world. During the current biennium world events have stirred the people of the state and the nation to the realization of urgent need for national defense. For the first time, on November 5, 1940, citizens cast their ballots in the consciousness of foreign alignments directed against the United States. Re - gardless of party or creed, all insist upon a program to maintain the Ameri - can Way of Life. Congress has voted billions for defense. Industry is re - doubling its efforts for increased production. : Military conscription is in operation. Every new day brings added responsibilities to the people of America. Training for these responsibilities calls for the enlistment of chil - dren and parents, officials and citizens in the improvement of educational service. ¦•; :¦¦ ¦'¦ : ¦".; '.-'.'¦[ .;;' '¦ ¦•¦;.¦! !.. The need for more thorough understanding and appreciation of the principles of American government is apparent. More skilled workers are needed for agriculture and industry. More attention must be given to the health of people of all ages. These provisions for increasing die efficiency of personnel are as essential to competition in time of peace as they are impera - tive in time of war. : I am happy to pay tribute to members of the teaching profession for devotion to youth and country. The will to Carry On in the adverse circum - stances of recent years is abundant evidence of the highest professional spirit. All of us are .indebted, to laymen who accept responsibility for the trusteeship of the schools without financial reward. Parents and taxpayers make sacri - fices for die education of youth these days. To the credit of the youngsters, n must be said that no other generation has ever sensed so keenly the re- </seg>
         <seg id="p010">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT auiremencs of preparation for the future. The splendid spirit of the response to the Conscription Law expresses the patriotic influence of homes and schools and communities of Nebraska. Tribute is due members of the Staff and secretarial assistants in the State Department who perform their service, conscious of the needs of thousands of youngsters confronted with varied and difficult conditions of life today. Loyalty to the public schools is loyalty to the children of Nebraska." In the presence of obligations to posterity and country our people will carry on in the future as they have in the past. The immediate requirement is to search out the truth of conditions as they are and make provision for a pro - gram of citizenship worthy of our State and Nation. Constitution Guarantees Educational Opportunity In dealing with the educational program, the framers of the first Gonsti - cution of Nebraska, adopted in 1866, followed the pronouncement and spirit of the famous Ordinance of 1787 on the subject: "Religion, morality and knowledge being necessary to good gov - ernment and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged." Accordingly, Section 16 of the Bill of Rights in the fundamental law of the new state reads: "Religion, morality and knowledge, however, being essential to good government, it shall be the duty of the legislature to pass suitable laws to protect every religious denomination in the peace- j able enjoyment of its own mode of public worship, and to encourage ! schools and the means of instruction." j In addition to the recognition of the requirements for citizenship in the new state, the founders established a guarantee of perpetuity for trust funds and resources included in the federal land grants and provided for the fi - nancial support of public education. Sections on these subjects follow: "Sec. 2. The University lands, school lands and other lands which have been acquired by the territory of Nebraska or which may hereafter be acquired by the state of Nebraska, for educational or school purposes, shall not be aliened or sold for a less sum than five dollars per acre. "Sec. 1. The principal of all funds arising from the sale, or other disposition of lands or other property, granted or entrusted to this state for educational and religious purposes, shall forever be preserved inviolate and undiminished; and the income arising there - from shall be faithfully applied to the specific objects of the original grants or appropriations. The legislature shall make such provisions by taxation or otherwise, as, with the income arising from the school </seg>
         <seg id="p011">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION " trust fund, will secure a thorough and.efficient system of common schools throughout the state; but no religious sect or sects shall ever have any exclusive right to, or control of, any.part of the school funds of this state." Nebraska Constitution, 1866. The members of the Constitutional Convention of 1875 erased the re - quirement of taxation for the support of the public schools from the funda - mental law. However, this convention of 1875 made definite provision for the State Board of Educational Lands and Funds, consisting of the Governor, Secretary of State, Treasurer, Attorney General, and Commissioner of Pub - lic Lands and Buildings to administer all school.lands and funds. Another vital amendment of the Constitution of 1875, remaining in the present Con - stitution, is Section 5, Article VII, which reads: , "All fines, penalties, and license moneys, arising under the general laws of die state, shall belong and be paid over to the counties re - spectively, where the same may be levied or imposed, and all fines, penalties and license moneys arising under the rules, by-laws, or ordinances of cities, villages, towns, precincts, or other municipal subdivisions less than a county, shall belong and be paid over to the same respectively. All such fines, penalties, and license moneys shall be appropriated exclusively to the use and support of the common schools in the respective subdivisions where the same may ¦¦ • accrue." .' ;.' .;•;. "' '.; "'¦ : ' ¦ ¦.¦'¦_ ..¦":" Elimination of die Constitution requirement of taxation for the sup - port of die school has been followed by the loss of revenue from this source. At present, the obligation of the State is expressed in the following words of legal rather than financial significance: ¦ "The Legislature shall provide for die free instruction in the common schools of this state of all persons between the ages of five and twenty-one years." State Superintendent of Public instruction is Constitutional Executive : The first territorial school law, approved March 16, 1855, conferred upon the territorial librarian the duties of Superintendent of Public Instruction and gave to him the authority "to make all rules and regulations that might be necessary to carry the law into full effect according to its spirit and intent." In 1858 the legislature created the office of Territorial Commissioner of Common Schools.. This office was consolidated with the office of Territor - ial Auditor in 1861. The State Legislature of 1869 established a separate office for the administration of the schools under die title of State Superin - tendent of Public Instruction, and the Constitutional Convention of 1875 placed it on a constitutional basis, ¦*/'¦: In 1917 the Legislature placed the election of State Superintendent on a </seg>
         <seg id="p012">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT non-partisan ballot. A constitutional amendment, adopted September 21, 1920, extended the term of office to four years, effective after 1923. In common with all other constitutional executives, the State Superin - tendent of Public Instruction is required to "perform such duties as may be provided by law." The legislature has largely delegated the responsibility for public education to the counties and school districts of the state, but the State Superintendent is empowered to enforce its statutes. His interpreta - tion of the law is binding until reversed by a court of competent jurisdiction. It follows naturally, from this broad legal authority, that the duties of the State Department of Public Instruction are as varied as the needs of the schools throughout the State. The State Superintendent, with the help of his staff and the school people of the State, works out the courses of study for elementary and high schools and establishes programs for character education and instruction in the harmful effects of alcohol. Members of his staff supervise the high school normal training courses and inspect the work. He is a member of the State Normal Board, the State Board of Educational Lands and Funds, and secretary of the State Board for Vocational Education. The Bureau of Certification for Teachers and the Bureau of Education and Registration for Nurses are divisions of the State Department. All state apportionments for the public schools are made in the business office of the Department. A graphic presentation of the State Department of Public Instruction appears in Chart I. AMERICANISM "Americanism is an unfailing love of country; loyalty to its institutions and ideals; eagerness to de - fend it against all enemies; undivided allegiance to the flag, and a desire to secure the blessing of liberty to ourselves and posterity." </seg>

         <seg id="p014">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF EDUCATION THROUGH THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Introduction The statement accompanying the official budget of the State Department r"o icsrs for the Biennium 1941-43 follows: "In submitting the budget requests of the State Department of Public Instruction for the biennium 1941-43 I call your attention to financial policy and control of the schools of Nebraska. "I Funds for Local Districts. "Requests for funds to be distributed to local school districts follow Statutory requirements closely. For example, Section 79-522 of the School Law relative to tuition for the children of representatives of the army and navy on duty in Nebraska reads: 'Any school district in this state wherein children, as described in Section 1 of this Art (79-521) attend school shall be entitled to charge as tuition for such pupil, for the time such pupil is enrolled the sum of one ($1.00) dollar per week, if such child is enrolled in the grade school of such district, the sum of two and 25/100 (#2.25) dollars per week, if such child is enrolled in any high school of such district, and the tuition so charged shall be paid by the State of Nebraska out of an appropriation therefor from the General Fund.' The appropriation for this purpose during the current biennium was $15,000. Developments in connection with the national defense program during the ensuing biennium will doubtless bring to Nebraska additional enrollment in this classification but the amount has been restricted to current obligations which amounts to #25,382.45. "This same procedure applies to other items in this division of the budget. Details and explanations of items are written on the official forms. I am well aware of the influence of economic conditions upon financial support for the schools. Provisions for homes must always take precedence over provision for education—but this same relation does not hold between education and other governmental services. Since the defense of the country, &lt;v well as the economic security of the people whether in peace or war depend largely upon the intelligence and discipline of youth in the classrooms today, it is imperative to consider the support of public schools as basic to all other requirements of government. "School expenditures in Nebraska at present are less than two-thirds of the expenditures in 1925, while expenditures for other services of govern - ment have more than doubled in this same period. State appropriations' intended as initial provisions for the equalization of educational opportunity </seg>
         <seg id="p015">OF,PUBLIC INSTRUCTION in Nebraska schools have been cut in recent years below the requirements of relief for districts in financial distress. "Educational interests have rightfully given way to the claims of the needy and the aged in this period of economic emergency. Now the chief concern must be for national defense. But the inevitable result of these pre - dominating emphases in public expenditures is weakness instead of strength in the citizenship of the state. In contrast, expenditures for education mean constructive contribution to individual welfare and community progress. Fin - ally, public confidence requires the state to make good its own guarantees for the program of citizenship. II Funds for Departmental Operation. "In connection with the requests for the operation of the State Depart - ment of Public Instruction, I calf your attention to the control of education in Nebraska. The following agencies of the federal government are under independent administration in the state. 1. The National Youth Administration. 2. Works Progress Administration. 3. Civilian Conservation Corps. .4. Special Administration for training in connection with the program of national defense. "The effect of these extensions of federal programs appears in the fol - lowing statement made by John W.. Studebaker, Commissioner of Education of the United States in 'School Life,' official organ for U. S. Office, publication, May, 1940. \ 'It is generally agreed that if we are to avoid unnecessary diffi - culties and the duplications and efficiency growing out of a muddled . structure of administrative authority, and if we are to avoid the . chiseling away of educational functions by agencies whose primary function is not a well-rounded educational program, the public must insist upon placing the educational program in charge of educational authorities.' "Your State Department cooperates with federal agencies in several important projects in the interests of children and the communities of their residence but if Nebraska is-to have its own program of education, it must make adequate provision for control in if s own State Department oj Public Instruction. . :- .¦":; "You will be concerned to know that reduction in appropriations during the current biennium made it necessary to discontinue even such significant service as cooperation in the safety program. Lack of funds is accountable also for the suspension of directory service in the State Department, result- </seg>

These are merely illustrations of the effect of retrenchments in the administration of long established functions of the State Department As in all other phases of government, strenuous conditions of recent times have made increased demands upon education, such as are represented in the service of the federal agencies. Proper control and coordina - tion of effort requires adequate provision for administration in a single agency. That agency in Nebraska is the State Department of Public Instruc - tion. The requests in this division of the budget are based upon the mini - mum requirements of efficient operation in keeping with the responsibility fixed by the people of the state." The trend of appropriations for the State Department of Public In - struction in relation to other appropriations for the State Government appears in Chan No. 11. The data of this Chart is found in Table No. I National Defense Program Includes Important Health Meature The people of this country were startled to find that one out of every f've men called to the colors in 1918 was physically unfit for military duty. Examination of volunteers for military service in the state of New York in 1940 indicates that 30 per cent, or nearly one out of every three, have been refused on the grounds of physical disability. Findings of recent investigations in Nebraska show a close parallel be - tween health conditions in the state and other states. H. R. 10606 would make available in June, 1940, #100,000,000— #50 000,000 for the improvement of regular school programs and #50, - -000 000 for the establishment and development of school camp programs. States may share in these appropriations according to the ratio which the number of children in each state bears to the total number in all states. The appropriations increase #20.000,000 a year during the first five years until a maximum of #200,000,000 is reached in 1946, when this amount becomes available annually. For the first three years, funds are available to the states that have com - plied with the provisions of the Act without expenditures by the states for programs specified in the Act. Thereafter, the states will be required to match federal funds with state and local funds to the extent of 10 per cent or the first year, 15 per cent the second year, and 25 per cent for each following year. Administration of the provisions of the Act is placed in the State Department of Public Instruction upon acceptance by the Legis- </seg>

         <seg id="p022">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 22 State Funds For School Support Note: The Fifty Third Legislature made total apptopriations of $126,550 for use in the public schools for each year of the Biennial period 1939-1941. These funds are: 1. State Aid to Weak Districts. 2. MaJlery Act Aid. 3. Normal Training Aid. 4. Nebraska High School Improvement Program. 5. Expense of Inspection. 6. Tuition of Children of Representatives of United States Army and Navy. 7. Instruction of Deaf Children. 8. Bureau of Education and Registration for Nurses. Explanatory statements and special recommendations are presented ieparately for each Fund. State Aid to Weak Districts The Thirtieth Session of the Nebraska Legislature passed the original State Aid to Weak Districts Law in 1907. House Roll 356 was introduced by Doran of Garfield, Henry of Holt, Metzger of Cherry, and Wilson of Custer County. Its title reads: "An Act to provide at least seven months ol school in the first eight grades for all the youth of this state whose parents or guardians live in school districts whose funds are not sufficient to main - tain school for seven months." This Act appropriated #50,000. The conditions which had to be met in the field at that time are ex - pressed in the following statement taken from page 49, Biennial Report of 1906: "During the past year there were 306 school districts maintaining three months of school or less; 640 districts maintaining from three to six months of school. There will be about 1,000 districts in the northern and western counties entitled to state aid under this meas - ure. The average number of pupils in these 1,000 districts is about fifteen, which would mean that 15,000 boys and girls will receive at least seven months of free school privileges under this law. This makes it possible for all boys and girls in the state to receive at least an eighth grade education, which means at least two years more than they are now receiving." Supt. J. L. Mcßrien gave the following interpretation of the intent of the provision: </seg>
         <seg id="p023">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 23 "* * * * It is an attempt by society to build the individual. Such a policy holds that the state is strong in die proportion in which every individual in the state is free, large, educated, independent. ****" Basic requirements of apportionment in the original appropriation included: . . ¦ (1) . A term of seven months. Employment of a legally qualified teacher at not less than #30 per month. . (2) Maximum legal levy. . The basic requirements of apportionmertt in the present day revision of the law in Section 79-222 to 79-224 include: (1) A term of nine months if there are 10 or more children be - tween 7 and 16 years of age; a term of 6 months if there are less than 10 children. (2) Minimum area of 12 sections per school maintained. (3) Funds applied only to teacher's salary. (4) Allowance in amount necessary to make #1,000 available for schools with 10 children or #750 for schools with less than 10 children, after the local districts have levied 8 mils. Attention is called to the formula in these provisions for the equaliza - zation of educational opportunity and burden—whenever a rural district with 12 or more sections, after making a levy of 8 mills, does not have the money necessary to maintain a minimum school program, the State supplements the revenues for this purpose. The state has maintained equality of educa - tional opportunity for these districts but has never seen jit to extend the program for the equalkdtion of educational opportunity and burden through - out the system in its entirety. The allowance for the biennium 1939-1941 lacks #3,156 of being enough to satisfy the guarantees of the law. The actual requirement for the ensuing biennium under the present provisions is $73,156. In this connection, I call .your attention to die trend toward the laiget school districts in Nebraska, as set forth in the report from Seward County in the October, 1940, issue of the Nebraska Education Bulletin. Additional funds should be available to give encouragement to this procedure in the interest of economy and school efficiency. Restoration to #100,000, which was die appropriation for die 1937-1939 biennium would provide the guaran - tees under the law and serve this larger purpose. </seg>

Worley of Waverly Consolidated District No. 145, Lancaster County, gives a glimpse of the background and operation of a MalJery Art School: "Waverlyj Consolidated School is one of the oldest schools in Nebraska. One of the districts later included in the consolidation had a sod school house built two years before the admission of Nebraska into the Union. Six years later, in 1871, the first school was organized in Waverly and the new two - story frame school house became the pride of the village in 1887. The ninth grade was added in 1891. After consolidation with seven rural school dis - tricts in 1918, it became a full twelve-grade school. The district now has .an area of nearly fifty sections and a valuation of #3,531,333. "The new building and equipment cost $180,000. It was dedicated in 1921 and has been the center of community life since that time. The site is ten acres on which there are two baseball diamonds, two day tennis courts, and the only cindered track in the county outside of Lincoln. Nearly 150 </seg>

"The course of study is built to serve practical needs. The extra-curricu - lar program provides for cultural and recreational interests. Organizations, such as the "W" Club, F. F. A., Girl Reserves and Hi-Y, take care of leader - ship and civic service. Waverly has been a teacher-training center for the University of Nebraska College of Agriculture under the direction of G. A. Spidel who has been head of the vocational department for the past 19 years. "The commercial department has twenty typewriters, mimeograph and duplicator equipment. The science department has adequate equipment for all sciences; the home-making department has sewing machines, gas and gasoline ranges, steam tables, etc. The agriculture department has a suite of rooms besides a modern shop which houses die seven school buses in the summer. A lunch room seats 120. Mothers in the Parent-Teachers Associa - tion serve hot lunches during the year; The auditorium seats 400. "At the present there are seven teachers in the high school and five in the grades. Enrollment is 135 in the grades and 121 in the high school. Fifty-three of the latter are non-resident. "A study of 314 alumni, graduated during the past 13 years, showed the following occupational distribution: "Fifty-four or 17%, were either planning or following a definite profes - sion—ll having chosen die ministry. "Eighty, or 25%, were engaged in agriculture. "Ninety-nine, or 30%, were home-makers. "Fifty-six, or 17%, were in the commercial field. "Nine years ago the Lancaster County Activities Association was or - ganized. Superintendent Jay B. Worley has been its head since its forma - tion. It provides a county program of competitive sports including baseball, tennis, volleyball, basketball and track, as well as music, dramatics, declama - tory and scholastic competition. In the past nine years Waverly has won 85 trophies as against 41 for its nearest competitor among the fifteen schools in the Association. Waverly has also consistently ranked high in district and state contests. "The present type of organization has made possible the quality of work and variety of courses and is responsible for the records of representa - tives of the school. Consolidation has also made possible transportation of all children to and from school. The finest part of the whole picture is that the general levy of the Waverly schools, including costs of transportation, is only 4.8 mills, as against an average of 4.72 mills for rural districts in Lancaster County, including county levy for high school tuition." </seg>

A brief statement of educational conditions on this level, together with a summary of the organization and procedures in opera - tion under appropriation, appear in die Report of the Background Statement Committee of the Nebraska High School Improvement Program. It is urged that the request for the continuation of this allowance be considered in relation to the influence of efficiency in instruction for 83,000 young people of Nebraska on die threshold of citizenship. In this connec - tion it must be remembered that the current expenditures per year jor th&lt;t high school program in Nebraska amount to $6,421,114.21. The investment in plants and equipment is $}6J&amp;i,507.00. Allowance of #7,500 for the improvement of instruction in high schools is eleven-hundredths of one per cent of the amount expended for this instruction. Expetue of Inspection :'.

Pupils receiving the benefits of the free high school tuition (aw are from districts that do not maintain accredited or approved high schools. One of the important functions of" high school inspection is to protect the time of the children and money of the taxpayers in the services of these schools. Ex - penditure for tuition of rural pupils alone justifies the allowance for this purpose. ' : </seg>
         <seg id="p032">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 32 Generally speaking, the high schools of the state are ready and anxious to render service to the non-resident pupils commesurate with the amount of money received from them, but occasionally districts attempt to make the nonresident tuition bear the expense of the entire high school. In situations like these, a high school supervisor can render most effective service to the students themselves. Prior to 1923, the University of Nebraska received biennial appropria - tions of #20,000.00 for high school inspection and the State Department of Public Instruction a like amount. In that year, the functions of the two were united and the responsibility for inspection placed in the Department of Public Instruction, but this department was not given any additional funds for inspection over what it had previously received. #20,000.00 was the amount set aside for high school inspection up to and including the bien - nium 1929-1931. More help is necessary if the schools are to be given the service essen - tial to the protection of the investment of the money of the taxpayers and the time of pupils in the program of secondary education. Need for greater efficiency in high school service is abundant justification for an allowance of £20,000.00 Tuition of Children of Representatives of Army and Navy in Nebraska Provisions for the tuition of children whose parents are in the United States Military or Naval Service have been made as follows: 1933-35 , £ 9,906.60 1937-39 15,000.00 1939-41 _..... 15,000.00 In order to comply with die law, the request for the biennium 1941-1943 is £25,382.45, as shown in Table No. V. Unfortunately the federal government makes no provision for the edu - cation of the children of its defenders except in the District of Columbia and the Panama Canal Zone. Without aid from the state, local districts in the vicinity of military stations cannot carry the burden for the added enroll - ment. </seg>

The following statement from Report No. 2 of the Nebraska Legislative Council confirms the findings of school authorities on the relation of school support to other requirements of government: ; "Perhaps the most striking fact illustrated by the tables on gov - ernmental costs is that the local units have npt followed the same trend as the National and State Governments. While the two first-named units show an almost phenomenal increase, the counties and cities have prac - tically stood still, and the school districts show a sharp decline. This de - cline seems to have reached its low point in 1934, at which rime another increase was begun, but as yet school expenditures since 1934 have not climbed to, or even approached, the pre-depression level. The school district is the one principal unit of government which shows a considerable.net re - duction in costs for the whole period under consideration. </seg>

         <seg id="p037">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 37 "The reasons for the differences between the trends in costs of govern - ment at the different levels are fairly obvious. In the first place, with the advent of the depression all levels of government tried, temporarily to reduce costs, by reducing salaries and curtailing activities. These efforts, however, were almost immediately overwhelmed by die impact of the depression itself, with its demands;for increased assistance and welfare work, the brunt of which has been borne almost entirely by the National and State Governments. The counties and cities, however, nave had some increased obligations in as - sistance work, which have just about offset ' their initial economies. The school districts, on the other hand, have not had to absorb any of the increases in assistance and welfare costs, hence all funds saved through re - ductions in salaries, number of teachers, and building programs, show as a net gain." Space permits only a brief statement of specific problems in connec - tion with school finance requiring attention in Nebraska.' Licenses, Fees and Permits ¦ The first obligation of school administration is the protection of the funds legally committed to officials for educational purposes. It is futile to insist upon ideals of citizenship in the classrooms when officials fail to comply with the law and to provide the example of integrity in the opera - .tion of the schools. With children the adage holds, "Example is ever more powerful than precept." In this connection attention is directed to the following statement which appears in Report No. 10 of the Nebraska Legis - lative Council, issued May 10, 1940. .. "The State Constitution provides that all 'fines, penalties, and license moneys, arising under the general laws of the State or the . ordinances of cities, arid villages shall go to the support of common schools.* . ::¦ "There are many charges collected by the State which were form - erly classified as 'licenses' and deposited in the Temporary School ¦¦¦' Fund, but which are now styled 'permits' and deposited in other Funds. 2 . ; •'.'..¦.• ,¦¦¦¦;. ¦¦¦ .¦ i :¦:;; ; - . ¦ . . ¦,; &#132; - "In 1921. receipts from hunting and fishing permits were diverted from the Temporary School Fund to the use of the Game Foresta - ; tipn and Parks Commission.

These collections, as of July 1, 1939, totaled p50,75&amp;.x "Some other minor diversions have occurred, as in the case of embalmers' fees, public warehouse, peddlers' and commission mer - chants' licenses, but they involve relatively small sums. "The income from automobile drivers' licenses has never been deposited to the Common School fund, but the school people feel that, along with other licenses, this money belongs to them. To March 21, 1940, a total of #950,408.35 had been collected from this source, of which $762,286.14 was received during die last two and a half years, since the new drivers' license law went into effect. "Whether the charges referred to above are really 'licenses' which belong to the schools, or 'permits' which may properly be devoted to other purposes, is a nice legal question, and one which we do not attempt to answer." The departments concerned arc entitled to unquestioned financial sup - port. The claims of the public schools are based upon the fundamental law of the state. These conditions call for a friendly suit in the Supreme Court to determine the application of revenues from these sources. Trust Administration The statement presented on page 41, shows that school funds and resources derived from the federal land grants in die trusteeship of die state total #18,258,683.95. Under present organization the ex officio members of the Board of Educational Lands and Funds hold executive au - thority of administration. According to Report No. 10 of the Legislative Council, "The appointive personnel of the Board consists of one state sur - veyor, one chief clerk, one 'assistant to the Secretary' and one stenographer, with a payroll of $6,660.00 a year. In addition to these four full-time employees, one Assistant Attorney General is assigned part-time to the Board, for which he is paid #150.00 a month out of the Board's funds, the remainder of his salary being paid by the Attorney General's office." The results of the administration of these trusts appear in the official report of the Hanson Audit Company covering the period of January 6, 1927, to January 7, 1937. A fair statement of current conditions is available in Report No. 10 of the Legislative Council quoted above. Obligation to the legal beneficiaries and the taxpayers of Nebraska calls for administrative provision in keeping with the values included in the trusts. It must be admitted thai the requirements of efficiency in operation lTotal compiled from State Auditor's reports. </seg>
         <seg id="p039">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 39 are the same in public as in private affairs. Accordingly, suggestions for administrative organization and clerical force to handle this heritage may be found in the provision of private corporations with comparable assets such as a bank or large trust in a city. The most Important consideration is executive representation for the interests of present and future generations of school children of Nebraska. Since the school endowments are public trusts, watchfulness on the part of citizens, especially members of school boards, is a continuous require - ment of proper administration. Opportunity for cooperation w'tth state of - ficials to the advantage of the district as well as the endowments is at hand in the bond transactions of local districts. No issue should be sold or re - funded without notice well in advance to the Secretary of the State Board of Educational Lands and Funds. • •¦;.. Tax Delinquency Ninety pet cent of the revenue for the support of the public schools in Nebraska is derived from property taxes. Consequently, delinquency in the payment of property taxes means extreme hardship for the schools. Indi - cation of the conditions appear in the following statement of the problem in Report No. 2 of the Nebraska Legislative Council: "The exact total of delinquency in Nebraska is unknown, but we do have evidence that it reaches a sizeable figure. The total tax col - lections for any given year, even including the collection of delin - quent taxes from previous years, seldom equal, or even approach, the total levies for that year. For example, according to the records of the State Tax Commissioner, 1 a total of #41,941,727 was levied on property in the State for all purposes, for the fiscal year 1936 - -¦:'.' 37- •'¦'¦. -- :: ¦':'¦'¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦•¦ .'¦• , ¦ . '¦: "However, according to the figures which we have compiled,2 a total of only #38.557,269 was collected for that year, including de - linquent taxes collected for previous years. This suggests a net de - linquency for the year of 8.07% of all property taxes levied. The gross delinquency, however, was much greater. Of the total taxes levied for the State Government for the fiscal year 1935-1936,42.04% remained unsaid at the end of the year, and of the total levied for , 1936-1937, 44.84% remained uncollected at the end of the year. 3 "In 1936, the Auditor of Public Accounts listed a total of #4, - -613,734, in State taxes alone, as 'delinquent and due from coun - ties.' 4 Delinquency seems to be increasing, both in percentage and 116 th Annual Report, p. 146. I 2See.Table No.. 24, p. 61, Leg-islntive Council Report No. 2. 3 complied from figures secured from the Auditor's office. ¦ 4 Biennial Report, 1934-1936 pp. 70m00. •¦•¦•¦•• • •¦••¦¦ </seg>
         <seg id="p040">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 40 in absolute amount —the latter, especially, as the levies increase. Therefore, the total of delinquency at present is probably consider - ably in excess of the figure given for 1936. Since taxes, when paid, are prorated among the taxing units in proportion to their share of the total levy, we may assume that the taxes of the political sub - divisions were delinquent in the same proportion. For the last three years, the State's share of the total property tax levy has averaged only 10.63'/c. This suggests that more than $10,000,000 in delinquent property taxes is carried on the books of the State and its subdivisions." It is apparent that delinquent school taxes exceed the amount necessary to pay for the operation of the schools for a year. In reply to school authorities requesting procedure of collection, a rep - resentative of the Attorney General's Office made this statement on No - vember 17, 1938: "I do not know of any statutory provision which in express terms or by necessary implication, authorizes a school district, * * * * to pay the expenses or a part of the expenses incurred in the collec - tion of taxes, including school taxes within the corporate limits of a city lying within its boundaries. The school district can employ legal counsel, it is true, in cases where it becomes necessary to do so, but I do not believe it can employ counsel to do something or to assist in doing something the district is not authorized to do. The Legislature will soon be in session and if it wishes to do so, it can, in my opinion, authorize a school district to pay all or a part of the expenses of foreclosing tax liens upon real estate lying within the corporate limits of the district." Even though tax delinquency is largely the result of economic conditions, procedure to deal with the problems involved is essential to the protection of taxpayers as well as to the public service. Equalization of Burdens and Opportunities Under provisions of State Aid to Weak Districts the Legislature has recognized minimum standards of educational opportunity for all children since 1907. In addition to the provision of funds for the support of the schools as set forth, the Legislature should give immediate attention to the enactment of a law for the equalization of educational opportunities and burdens in the 7,207 districts of the State. More than forty states have such laws. One - half of the state pays 25% of the cost of education. The State Depart - ment and our school authorities have long recognized the justice of such pro - vision for the school children of Nebraska. </seg>
         <seg id="p041">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 41 The following statement appears in the Tenth Biennial Report of the Department, under date of December 3, 1878: "There are now great inequalities in the burdens which different dis - tricts have to bear in sustaining the school system. A state tax tends to re - move this inequality. The extent of the variation in the amount of tax paid in different districts will surprise any one who has not given attention to the subject. I cite a few examples taken at random from the last reports: In Dodge County the rate of school tax varies in different districts from 2 to 25 mills; in Valley County, from 5 to 35 mills; in Harlan, from 4 to 25 mills; and in Douglas from 3 to 25 mills. Here we see that in some districts a man will pay on a hundred dollars seventeen times as much as in others. Two farms of equal value lying side by;side, but in separate districts—the owner : of one pays six times as much school tax as the other." The financial conditions in these same districts in 1936 are shown in the following tabulations. • COUNTY Plat.

This proposal carried at the election Nov. 5, 1940, by a majority of 60,205. The membership of the ex officio Board now includes the Governor, die Secretary of State, die State Treasurer, the Attorney General and die State Superintendent of Public Instruction. As a fifth member, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction will be a direct representative of the school children who are the legal beneficiaries of the largest trusts in the state. District Levies Have Wide Variations It will be noted in Table No. VII that die average levy in rural dis - tricts, including the county levy for free high school tuition, is 6.2 mills, while the average levy of high school districts is 10.79 mills. The second factor in the determination of school support appears in Section 77-201 of die law dealing with valuation. This statute reads: "All property in this state, not expressly exempt therefrom, shall be subject to taxation, and shall be valued and assessed at its actual value. In arriving at the 'actual value' of property, as used in this Act, there shall be taken into consideration its value in the market in the ordinary course of trade and in arriving at the 'actual value' of real property there shall be taken into consideration the proximity </seg>

         <seg id="p048">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Improvements Are Made in School Plants During the Biennium 1939-41 A report of budding projects in cooperation with the federal govern - ment appears in Table No. VIII. In addition to the improvements listed, several districts have made provision for buildings through local finance and administration. An outstanding example is the new high school building un - der construction in Lincoln which will cost approximately $600,000. The State Department sponsors a federal project which provides for cleaning and renovation of school buildings in many districts. Through this service the walls of thousands of classrooms have been decorated. Much school equipment has also been put in good repair. In some districts the pro - gram includes landscaping the grounds. Approximately 250 workers under the direction of the Works Projects Administration are engaged during the current year in these improvements affecting the health and happiness of school personnel. A Recurring Question What is the outstanding responsibility of the schools in the days ahead? Congress has already given one answer to this question. It has made an appropriation of #60,500,000.00 for training programs in connection with national defense. These funds, available November 1, are itemized as follows: $26000,000.00 for training of people of less than college grade for defense industries; 8,000,000.00 for repairing and replacing equipment; 9,000,000.00 for engineering colleges; 10,000,000.00 for rural youth above the age of seventeen; 7,500,000.00 for the education and jaining of youth on N. Y. A. work relief program through regular educational channels. In addition to these sums, the National Youth Administration received $12 500,000.00 for its program. On October 3, 1940, Congressman Schwert of New York introduced what is known as the "National Preparedness Act of 1940 for Health Education, Physical Education, and Recreation in Schools and School Camps." This Bill, H. R. 10606, carries an appropriation of ?1.000 000.00 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1940. These measures find full justification in the experience of 1917-1919. But they apply only to specific phases of the broad, continuous program essential to effectiveness citizenship in every community. Schools must help young people to meet the competition oi pence as well as die conflict of war. The important requirement of 1940 is a combination of opportunity and work in keeping with the blessings of the American Way of Life. Inspiration to Carry On in this program rests with parents and teachers who know the meaning of citizenship in a democratic social order. </seg>

The reports appear in varying forms up to 1926 when the Department of Public Instruction adopted standard accounting forms ap - proved by the United States Commissioner of Education. By the first Monday in July of each year, district officials submit dis - trict reports to County Superintendents. In turn the various County Super - intendents, send the compilation of their district reports to the State Super - intendent by August 15. From these County, reports, the State Superintend - ent tabulates the Statistical Summaries for the entire public school system of the state. :..•,',:;.

         <seg id="p060">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 60 School Laws Determine Educational Program In Nebraska The Constitution of Nebraska places the control of the schools in the Legislature. Section 6, Article VII on this subject reacts: "The legislature shall provide for the free instruction, in the com - mon schools of this stare, oi all persons between the ages of ilve and twenty-one years." In keeping with this provision of fundamental law, the Supreme Court held in the case of American Surety Company vs. School District, 117 N. 6, that "School District is a creature of statute, has no powers beyond those given by legislature, may contract only respecting objects and to extent laws permit. Pleadings in action on contract must show contract was one which district could make." School Law in Nebraska in turn commits the administration of the schools to local authorities. In rural districts and other types of districts having an - nual meetings of electors, the democratic procedure is in effect. In districts where the administration is in the hands of elective officials serving on school boards, the representative procedure prevails. These types of administration find confirmation in the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Gad - dis vs. School District, 92 Neb. 701, which reads: "Form of government of county district is democratic as disting - uished from that of district having more than 1,500 inhabitants." Under present legislation, citizens in local districts have the power to alter district boundaries and make any changes in administration which ap - peal to them. It is true that the boundaries of territorial days .still persist throughout the state, but these conditions obtain because the people have not seen fit to exercise the powers of merger or even county-wide reorgani - zation now on the statute books. The same power applies to the instructional program. The people in local communities have maintained such courses as die benefits to their children seemed to justify. Practical work has been in - troduced on this basis in so far as financial resources permit. In brief, school law in Nebraska, with all of its defects and shortcom - ings, is the educational charter for every child in the state and the basic pro - gram for citizenship in every community of the state. In one district under its provisions is the vision and will to have a good school. In an adjoining district under the same provisions is failure to recognize the welfare of youth and the requirements of progress. These conditions for the operation of schools call for continuous study of school law on the part of teachers and board members. Section 79-1606 requires its publication in "pamphlet form". County Superintendents supply one copy to each rural school board. Members of boards in other types of districts and interested citizens may purchase copies from the following pub - lishers: </seg>

This service includes the publication of the Nebraska Educational Directory and the Nebraska Edu - cation Bulletin, maintenance of an Active Duty File for all teachers in the state and cooperation in special studies dealing with problems of employ - ment, tenure, retirement and related matters of vital concern to the public school program as well as to teachers. ¦; ¦. ¦To provide the data for these services, a personnel record file of all teachers and superintendents in the state was established in the State Depart - ment in 1937-38. County and city superintendents and teachers have cooper - ated splendidly in supplying the information for this personnel file in the State Department. This file b restricted to professional use under official supervision. : . &#132; . ¦ ; Many county and city: superintendents have recently established per - sonnel record files in their own offices. Experience proves that this service is exceedingly convenient for executives and of great value to the.schools and members of the teaching profession. Increasing responsibility of the schools for the American Way impresses the importance of cooperative service and loyalty to fellow workers in the testing times ahead. The tasks of public education are many and difficult, but it is the privilege of each teacher to join hands with 14,500 members of h:'s profession in the state and a million in the nation in a common program for citizenship. . ' . •'... • To meet the varied and changing needs of learners requires the service cf many different types of instruction.

         <seg id="p062">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 62 contemporary life situations. There is evolving not only a realignment of subject matter in the high school curriculum but with it new technique in classroom teaching. Instead of the traditional one text for each subject there is now integration and correlation of subjects into a laboratory method of classroom teaching, which calls for the resources of many books and refer - ence materials. In meeting this need, school libraries are proving themselves indispensable. They have become the general laboratory of the small high school in Nebraska, utilizing to the greatest extent all the fruitful material of the book. It is true that the smaller high schools of the state are suffering most in proportion as this change in educational content and methods proceeds. It is also true that their importance in gauging Nebraska's educational prog - ress cannot be ignored. They are educative units in basic contact with native Nebraska, with the stuff of which our state is made. The tendrils of the small high school rest in the soil of the state and reflect its trends, progress and needs. Under our present agricultural circumstances, Nebraska's high schools are facing real difficulties. Teacher-training institutions are building courses to meet the chief curriculum developments and teaching techniques and are sending superintendents and teachers into school districts which lack organized school libraries and finances to acquire them. A central fund which could be used for school libraries in proportion to needs would relieve the pressure in classrooms, meet the demands of new educational procedure and keep school standards generally near par. Such a fund would give assistance to a superintendent in a small high school in or - ganizing a school library and promoting its service. When organized evident - ly, a school library is the cheapest department in terms of jervice a high school can offer. One dollar spent on a book or magazine will spread far - ther than a dollar spent in any other way. It will reach more people, meet more individual needs and require less expenditure for preparation and up - keep. In December, 1939, the State Department of Public Instruction spon - sored a Federal Works Project to organize and operate library service in the public schools of the state. Surveys were made to determine urgent library needs of Nebraska's public schools and evolving procedure to service those needs. By March 1, 1940, 42 schools in 29 counties had made application for public school library projects. By December I, 1940, 40 schools in 27 counties had organized school libraries under the Works Projects Administra - tion. Records in the State Department of Public Instruction show that Ne - braska public schools have 696,426 boob. In the year 1938-39, rural schools spent #23, 913.48 on their libraries, while city and village schools spent $88, - -655.45, making a total of £112,568.93 in all. Since 1901, the Nebraska Library Commission, located in the State Capitol, has extended library service throughout the state and has made books </seg>
         <seg id="p063">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 63 available to libraries, schools and individuals. ¦ From December 1, 1938, to November 30, 1940, the Traveling Library Unit of the Commission loaned 82,868 books in response to 1,904 requests from schools. With the addition of these books, many schools are able to maintain highly serviceable collec - tions for adults, as well as for students in their communities. Experience during the past biennium has demonstrated the value of school library service. In order to insure satisfactory operation and provide instruction to pupils in the use of books, the State Department of Public Instruction has requested an appropriation of $5,000.00 for library super - vision during the biennium of 1941-43. -..••"¦'. Temperance Instruction Continues To Be Legal Requirement The first law In Nebraska requiring instruction in physiology and hy - giene, "with special reference to the effects of alcoholic drinks and other stimulants and narcotics upon the human system," was passed by the Legis - lature in 1885. This.law in the original form has remained in force in the state for sixty-five years. To strengthen its effectiveness, the Legislature in 1937 included "a satisfactory course or satisfactory examination in the same subject as a qualification for a teacher's certificate." Accordingly, the schools Carry On for personal and common welfare. The conditions back of this requirement appear in the annual revenue reports issued by the Nebraska Liquor Commission. Statement of receipts follow: : ¦ \ 1938-39 1939-40 Spirit Liquors CLL. .: $1,025,787.14 £1,166,426.48 ¦-¦¦¦ Fortified Wines :......

The contribution of liquor taxes to o!d age assistance, which claims these revenues, is a significant fact in the study of economics and government. In view of these ramifications of the liquor traffic into every interest and ac - tivity of life, adequate protection for youth calls for the cooperation of the home, the church and every other institution in the social order. Satisfactory solutions to the problems remain to be found. Filing Department Contributes to Efficiency of Service The Centralized Filing System, established in July, 1931, in the De - partment of Public Instruction has proved to be a great time-saver for the entire staff. When each division maintained its filing service, it was necessary to locate the files concerned before attempting to get correspondence and related materials. Now, reference is on call. Work in the Filing Department is varied and interesting. Correspon - dence from Nebraska and all parts of the world, school reports, certificate applications, grade cards, certificate cards, mimeographed letters, bulletins and magazines—in fact everything pertaining to school work—are filed here. Labels of different colors make it possible to locate materials quickly. The new certification law which went into effect September 1, 1938, brought increased demands upon the Department. The year 1941, in which a great number of these certificates will expire, promises even larger vol - ume of business. Applications for certificates, identified by a buff-colored label, are filed alphabetically with pertinent correspondence for thousands of teachers. Card files which consist of the examination grades for teachers ate filed by county. When the student has completed the examinations and has earned an Elementary certificate, the card is taken from the County card file and filed alphabetically by name in the Elementary certificate card file.

The National Child Welfare Division is labeled in white, which con - sists of three individual folders—one for general correspondence, one for re - quests for material from County Superintendents and another for various requests. The subject file with an index of 120 divisions contains correspondence and material referred to frequently and is not transferred each year. It includes form letters, maps, statistics and some legal material. Individual folders are used for the correspondence of the State Super intendent, heads of departments, National Education Association, America Library Association, American Association of University Women, Ameri - can Legion, American Council on Education, County Superintendents' Con - ference, Rural School Chorus, Rural School Achievements, American Educa - tion Week, Vocational Education, State Teachers Colleges, State Board of Examiners, '. Nebraska Universities, Temperance, National Child Welfare and the individual publishing companies. Stencils which may be used again are kept in a separate file. Copies of all mimeographed material are filed in numerical order for each year. Each year starts with No. 1. The first for 1941 will read 41-1. The bulletin file includes annual reports from all the Departments of the State of Nebraska, Educational Directories, School Laws, Courses of Study, Annual Reports from other states, etc. A large rack of educational magazines is also filed. Lack of space makes it necessary-to transfer back issues to the basement every few months. The charge-out system is a great help. When a letter, report or any other material is loaned, a charge-out card takes its place with the name of the person to whom it is loaned, the date of the material and the date on which it is loaned. In this manner, charged material can be located easily. A aoss reference system has proved very helpful also. . Federal Project, reports for school libraries, school lunches and reno - vation service are also filed.

Authorities Request Safety Program in Schools Prior to the current bienniutn the State Department maintained con - tinuous research and reporting service for the prevention of accidents in the five areas of homes, agriculture, industry, public control and highways. The data was secured through the cooperation of the Nebraska Press Asso - ciation and made available to the schools in a weekly bulletin. The objective of this service was to alert pupils and patrons to the dangerous conditions about them. Every spring gravel pits, for example, claim the lives of a number of boys, blasting caps maim others. The bulletin called attention to these fascinating hazards for youth in many communities. The need for continuous reminders applies particularly to bicycles riders. Accidents cost the lives of two of these youngsters every day in America. Because of lack of funds the State Department was forced to discon - tinue its safety service, except for cooperation with other agendes during the current biennium. The following quotation from a letter from R. H. Richardson, Safety Engineer in the Highway Safety and Patrol Division of the State Department of Roads and Irrigation, expresses the need for a definite program in the schools and the spirit of die working arrange - ment for the prevention of accidents on the highways: "Costs of traffic accidents for ten months of 1940 in Nebraska alone have amounted to nearly #2,000,000.00 and are increasing even more rapid - ly during November and December. Today, December 6, the record for this year is 225 fatalities, which is the same as the entire year of 1938. Last year 277 persons were killed and 4,483 were injured according to the list of accidents reported. "The Nebraska Safety Patrol has found the schools most helpful in Saftey Education. At this time Corporal O. H. Witt is assigned to special duty preparing and furnishing Safety Lesson material and making personal - appearances before large school groups including Parents and Teachers, etc. However, something more must be done to save the young people of school age and prevent the great human and economic loss resulting from traffic accidents. "The Nebraska Safety Council is limited in its activities by lack of funds and is working under a severe handicap. </seg>
         <seg id="p067">OF- PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 67 "Can you somehow arrange to include in your budget for 1941-42 at least the same activity which you had two years ago when the results for the year of 1938 showed a reduction from 332 to 225 traffic deaths or a saving of 97 lives over 1937? la these years of financial stress, saving must be emphasized, and when one child's life has a national value of #25,000 it is only a question of how big ah investment we can make in Safety which can bring such large returns in money, comfort and happiness to the citizens of Nebraska. Please urge that the budget be enlarged to permit your full co - operation again as in the past. : : "We wish to express our appreciation of the wholehearted cooperation of the Department of Public Instruction with the Highway Safety Patrol and the Nebraska Safety Council. We realize that you are able to cover other areas of Safety such as Fire hazards, play grounds, farm, home and industry where the Safety Patrol does not function. Certainly we cannot afford to neglect the teaching of Safety in the home when the annual num - ber of fatal accidents here exceed the number on highways fey six hundred." Opportunity For Hickter Education i&lt; Traditional in Nebraska Pioneers of Nebraska were deeply concerned for higher education. The territorial legislature issued the first Charter for an institution of higher learning, known as Simpson University, on March 9, 1855. A score of similar authorizations followed prior to statehood. ¦¦-.-¦ Recognizing this concern for higher education, the makers of the Con - stitution guaranteed free instruction to all persons between the ages of five and twenty-one years. Within two years after the admission of Nebraska into die Union, die Legislature made provision for the University of Ne - braska. Other institutions have been established as needs have arisen. Con - firming the authority for the establishment of the Mundpal University of Omaha, the Supreme Court held that "Education has always been a matter of State concern in Nebraska x x x x," and that "the city in providing said educational institutions acts as a political subdivision of the state in a mat - ter of state concern." 1 In these provisions is the determination of the people of Nebraska to keep open the doors of institutions of higher learning for all. ¦; '¦¦. ¦/_: ;';¦ ¦¦-..: ..• \ ..¦ : -..\ ••.;.;: '...-¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦' The Educational Directory of the present year includes these splendid institutions: University of Nebraska, Lincoln.

Under the inspiration of this concern of parents and dozens, more than 17 000 young people of Nebraska are now enrolled in institutions of higher learning. It is the policy of the State Department to cooperate in every way possible with them and their parents in the realization of worthy ambitions for life. Accordingly, the State Department stands squarely for the continuation of full college opportunity in the State Teachers Colleges and the utmost en - couragement of all other institutions of higher learning. The spirit of higher learning in Nebraska compels institutional adjust - ment to meet individual and social needs. Students who invest the precious years of youth are entitled to practical courses, when conditions of employ - ment demand such equipment. In this same connection it must be admitted that the obligation to modernize administration is as binding upon educational institutions as it is upon any other agency of private or public interest.

         <seg id="p070">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 70 In Memoriam With the passing of Dr. Clark A. Fulmer, September 11, 1940, Voca - tional Education has lost a great leader and a tireless worker. Born in Mar - cellus, New York in 1867, he moved with his parents to Nebraska in 1880. . He attended the Gibbon High School, the Nebraska Baptist Seminary, and was graduated from the Fremont Normal School in 1892. In 1898 he was granted the Ph. B. by the Nebraska Wesleyan University; the M. A. from the University of Nebraska in 1910; the LLD., from the Grand Island Col - lege in 1914; and the degree of Ed. D. from Nebraska Wesleyan University in 1934. Membership in honorary fraternities include Phi Delta Kappa, Phi Kappa Phi and Phi Gamma Mu. He taught school from 1892 to 1898; was Superintendent of Schools in several Nebraska cities from 1898 to 1908; from 1908 to 1911, Dean of the Liberal Arts College, Nebraska Wesleyan University; was chancellor from 1911 to 1917. Since 1918 he has served as Director of Vocational Education in Nebraska. During the World War, he served as Special Agent for War Training and recently initiated the present National Defense Program in Nebraska. Doctor Fulmer was present at the Baltimore meeting of the National So - ciety for the Promotion of Vocational Education in 1920 when the first meeting of State Directors was held, forming a temporary organization and took an active part as a member of a committee in framing die constitution and by - laws under which the Association was organized and now operates. At a second meeting held at Salt Lake Gty in September, 1921, the report of the committee on constitution and by-laws was made by Doctor Fulmer and per - manent offices were made at this meeting. This meeting was a called meeting by the Federal Board for the purpose of informing the states more fully on civilian rehabilitation. At this organization meeting Doctor Fulmer was elected secretary of the National Association of State Directors and two years later was made president of the Association. His leadership and counsel- have always been invaluable. Years ago he was the first in the country to fully appreciate the necessity for Occupational Guidance. All of the philosophy which motivated his life is being accepted by the American people. This is the greatest compliment that can be paid to a professional worker. His ab - sence at the next and subsequent meetings of the Directors Association and the A. V. A. will be regretted by every member. </seg>

         <seg id="p078">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 78 EXAMINATIONS FOR THIRD GRADE ELEMENTARY CERTIFICATES The Nebraska State Teachers Examinations for the Third Grade Elementary Certificate are held five times during each year in the office of each county superintendent and at such odier points in the county as the county superintendent may designate. Beginning with the July, 1939, examinations die questions used in the examinations have been the "ob - jective type", consisting of true-false, completion, and multiple choice type questions. The seventeen teachers examination subjects have been combined into eight units of examination, each unit consisting of 100 questions. Each unit of examination is assigned to a definite hour of the day arid is com - pleted within that hour. Two conditions called for adjustment in the procedure of examinations. The first, involved improvement in the service; die second, grew out of financial limitations. The reading of teachers examination papers under the former setup entailed an expense of several thousand dollars each bi - ennium. Only a part of this expense was born by the examination fee of 50c for each examination number which is submitted to this office by the several counties. In the new type examinations die papers are graded in the State Department by the regular office force. A number of advantages which the new iquestions have over the old type have already come to light. Among the more important of these are: 1. The factor of personal opinion has been eliminated in the grading of the papers and a more reliable check on the knowledge and ability of die student is afforded. 2. The high school teachers and in particular the normal training teachers are able to devote their time to academic and pro - fessional training rather than to catechisms of the old examination questions, which will ultimately make for a broader and richer background for the prospective teachers. </seg>

Introduction The responsibilities of the Division of Secondary Education are: (a) the inspection of high schools for the purpose of recommending accredit - ment by the University of Nebraska and of approval by the State Depart - ment of Public Instruction, (b) the rendering of all possible assistance in the solution of the problems of these schools and (c) the direction of the high school normal training program in accordance with the laws and the regulations pertaining thereto as set up by the State Department. In this work we have the cooperation of the University of. Nebraska, the county superintendents and all divisions of the State Department of Public Instruction. » ¦ ' %'¦¦:. .'¦ Observations of the work done in the high schools of the state lead to the conclusion that the teachers and administrators are, on the whole, progressive and eager to serve their communities in accordance with best educational practice. They are constantly attending summer school sessions, conventions and conferences in spite of the reduced salaries of recent years. They are hampered, however, by two circumstances. In the first place, in - adequate financial support imposes burdens of too many and too large classes with the result that teachers do not have enough time for adequate preparation or for the necessary guidance of individual pupils. In the second place, there is a great need in every community for an evaluation of the work die school is doing and a careful study of the needs of the com - munity in which the school is operating. . Cooperative Study of Secondary School Standard* Scientific evaluation of all phases of the work of a school is now being made more certain as a result of the Cooperative Study of Secondary School Standards recently worked out by the six regional accrediting agencies </seg>
         <seg id="p084">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 84 in cooperation with the American Council on Education. The committee in charge of the study has completed the survey and the refined criteria are now in use in many of the secondary schools. It is rapidly becoming ap - parent that these evaluative devices are the greatest stimulus to professional growth so far developed. This is due to the thorough manner in which they enable the local faculty to measure and interpret the efficiency of their own institution in terms of their community needs. Secondary School Curriculum Revision The economic depression of recent years, with its attendant unem - ployment, has focused attention upon the shortcomings of the traditional secondary school curriculum and has shown its inadequacy to prepare young people for the all-improtant task of earning a living. Society is insisting that it is necessary to give proper attention to the needs of the eighty per cent of our young people who do not go into institutions of higher learn - ing as well as to the twenty per cent who go to college. This growing de - mand has resulted in the present High School Improvement Program in Nebraska. For a number of years responsibility for the issuance of the Course of Study for High Schools, commonly referred to as the High School Manual, was fixed by statutory provision in the University of Nebraska and the State Department of Public Instruction. Through no fault of either institution, this did not prove to be a satisfactory arrangement; and ss a result, educators, laymen, the University of Nebraska, the State Teach - ers Association, the Superintendents and Principals Association and the State Department of Public Instruction joined in a request to the Legislature for a remedial act to fix the responsibility in one institution and make pro - vision for a revision of the High School Manual. The last Legislature amended Section 79-901 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska so that it fixed the authority for issuing the High School Man - ual in the Department of Public Instruction and in the general appropria - tion bill it provided a fund of $7,500.00 to carry on the revision necessary to the issuance of a new Manual. This fund was divided as follows: Services and Expense of Curriculum Expert, not to exceed $3,500.00 Consultations widi Committees of High School Teachers, Principals, Superintendents and Patrons, not to exceed.... 2,500.00 Printing, not to exceed _ _ „.. 1,500.00 These laws were signed by the Governor and in due time became op - erative. With a legal setup completed and the appropriation available, State Superintendent Taylor moved toward getting the task under way. Since the effort, to be successful, must necessarily be a cooperative one, he asked various authorities to appoint representatives to a general committee which would have charge of the project and determine policies to be followed. These authorities were: </seg>

Out of the various discussions came a realization of the need of a better understanding of the whole proposal and some subcommittees were appointed to make investi - gations and studies, with instructions to report their findings at the next meeting of the general committee.. This meeting was held on Match 9, 1940, at which time the subcom - mittees on the delineation of the problem submitted their report. It was carefully discussed, several changes suggested, and finally adopted as rep - resenting the ideas of the committee relative to the field to be covered by the high school improvement program. It seemed advisable to the commit - tee members at this meeting that certain definite projects be undertaken to carry forward the ideas embodied in the committee report. This took the form of naming several subcommittees with special responsibilities as fol - lows: ¦ .-¦ •. ¦;•;'. : : '. ¦•'/.'¦' ;: ¦:''' :.'' ' ¦'.

A Committee on the High School Course in Aviation, which was given the responsibility of drafting regulations and recommendations under which the high schools of Nebraska should offer the course called "An Introduction to the Science of Aviation." A Part-Time and Industrial Committee, to study the part-time trade and industrial program in the State of Nebraska. The responsibility of this committee was later extended to cover all phases of vocational training and guidance. An Editorial Committee, to be responsible for the editing and arranging of all materials produced by the subcommittees for publica - tion and distribution. Each of these committees has been actively engaged in the performance of the duties for which it was appointed. A meeting of the general com - mittee was called for November 29, 1940, to receive the reports of these subcommittees, at which time three completed reports were presented, that by the Committee on Background Statement, that by the Committee on Outstanding Educational Procedures and Projects, and that by the Com - mittee on Part-Time Trade and Industry. One other, the Committee on Remedial Reading and Library, had its preliminary report so nearly com - pleted that the general committee was able to discuss it and accept its find - ings. All these reports were carefully evaluated in the light of the theme, making improvements functional in the operation of the' local schools. In - structions were given to the Editorial Committee to make some suggested changes and then make the reports available for distribution. Reports of the other committees will be received later. Much has been accomplished thus far in the high school improve - ment program. Schools are generally becoming more and more conver - sant with their needs and the needs of their communities. The great task is to be able to interpret the needs of the schools in terms of the community and to shape the curriculum to meet the needs of the individual pupils so that they in turn can become useful members of the community in which they reside. Much remains to be done, but the improvement program gives evidence of having come a long way toward the solution of the needs of our Nebraska high schools. Guidance in Secondary Schools An adequate discussion of guidance in our high schools would require far more space than is permissible in a report of this kind. It is now recognized as an essential part of any efficient school program. The philosophy of guidance must be one of die foundations on which the whole program of the secondary school is based. Up until the present </seg>
         <seg id="p087">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 87 time a lack of understanding on the part of teachers and administrators has nutated agaimttbs very important field. Even a highly trained guidance counselor would be *ble to do little against the inertia V an unsympathetic corps of teachers. The first need seems to be that of securing the active sympathetic cooperation of the teachers themselves. is no longer considered to be the province of a single well - trained individual working independently in a school system but rather it is now viewed as * part of the work of each teacher and, so far as possible the teacher should have specialized training in this field.

While the number of accredited high schools remained practically the same, the en - rollment decreased from 77,028 in 1937-38 to 76,659 in 1939-40, but there was a slight increase for the year 1939-40 over that of 1938-39. This might indicate a tendency toward an increase in the high school enrollment in the^future. The peak enrollment was in 1936-37, when 77,695 pupils at - tended Nebraska's accredited high schools. The same trend in enrollment is evident in the approved high schools. The net reduction in enrollment is probably due to the economic depression with its attendant migration of families from the state.

It is also noteworthy that, while the total enrollment in accredit - ed high schools, as shown in the above table, increased by 783 from 1938-39 to 1939-40, the non-resident enrollment decreased 420 in the same period, which would indicate that the resident enrollment must have actually in - creased by 1,203 pupils. In other words, the loss in non-resident enrollment furnished a part of the gain shown in resident enrollment because of migra - tion from country to towns. The distribution of high school teachers in approximately 500 Nebraska public accredited high schools with fewer than 15 teachers for the year 1939-40 is as follows: Schools Teachers School* Teachers 55 2 23 9 99 3 23 10 96 4 8 11 69 5 6 12 46 6 7 13 32 7 3 14 26 8 The total number of these teachers is 2,574. This gives an average teaching force of 5.2 teachers per school. This seems to show dearly that Nebraska is a state of small high schools. Organization of High Schools The great majority of Nebraska high schools are still operating under the 8-4 plan. Records for the year 1939-40 show that 375 schools were still using this plan. However, of this number, 128 offered kindergarten work, 66 schools used the straight 6-6 plan of organization, 22 schools used the 6-3-^ plan, 16 schools were organized under the 6-2-4 plan, and 6 schools employed the 5-3-4 plan wherein the sixth, seventh, and eighth grades were depart mentalized. In addition to this, there were several other schools with grades organized peculiarly to their own community needs. </seg>
         <seg id="p089">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 89 It is significant to note that daring the biennium just closing, the 6-6 plan has grown the most rapidly. The argument most frequently offered in favor of the 6-6 plan is that.it enables a school to offer a broader program of studies, more vocational work, more extracurricular activities, and allows teachers an opportunity to limit their instructional activities to those particu - lar subjects in which they have specialized training. Scottsbluff and McCook school systems also operate junior colleges. Reports indicate that enrollments are increasing in both institutions. For the school year 1939-40, the McCook Junior College reported 97 first-year students and 60 second-year students making a total of 157. Scottsbluff Junior College, for the same year, reported 91 first-year students and 54 second-year students making a total of 145. Without question, these schools are making it possible for some of the youth in die surrounding territory to continue their education when many would otherwise find it impossible to attend institutions of higher learning. Vocational Courses Offered in Nebraska High Schools • One hundred eleven schools are offering Smith-Hughes Agriculture during the school year 1940-41. Of this number, 10 are offering a two-year program of vocational agriculture, 78 are offering a three-year program, and 23 are offering a four-year program. The tendency is toward extending work to three and four-year programs. There are approximately 40 schools in the state other than Smith-Hughes schools offering one or two semesters of agri - culture. All the normal training high schools are required by regulation to offer at least one semester of agriculture. About 104 high schools in the state offer Smith-Hughes Home Eco - nomics and about 135 other schools are offering some form of household arts. Of the total figure, approximately 83 ate offering the first-year work in household arts, about 60 the second-year work and about 10 the third-year work. A few schools offer one semester of either sewing or cooking and a few offer sewing one year and alternate with cooking the next. Two hundred and fifteen schools are offering some phase of manual train - ing. Two hundred and thirteen of these offer the first year of manual training while 53 are offering second-year, manual training, 8 schools are offering a third year and four schools are offering four-years of manual training in grades rune through twelve. Several of the smaller high schools offer at feast one semester in manual training, j . At the dose of the school year 193940, 452 schools were offering first - year typewriting to 12,521 students. The majority of these high schools offer but one year of typewriting since the figures indicate that only 240 schools were offering second-year, typewriting. A few schools offer only one semester of beginning typewriting under a plan whereby one section takes a semester's work the first semester of the school year and another group takes the work the sdfcond semester. Typewriting seems to be one of the most pop - ular courses offered in the high school curriculum. The schools feel that most anyone can make use of the knowledge gained in an elementary typewriting </seg>
         <seg id="p090">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 90 course regardless of whether or not they plan to use the training for future employment purposes. Two hundred thirty-seven schools are offering either one or two years of shorthand with an enrollment embracing 4,610. The greater percentage of these schools alternate first- and second-year work. Perhaps it would not be amiss to suggest that shorthand be offered to those students who have reason - able grounds to believe that they will find use for this instruction in later life and be able to continue their specialization along this line. Very few students are fortunate enough to secure office or secretarial employment with only high school training. School authorities might well make a survey of graduates for the last 10 years to determine the percentage of students who are gainfully employed or were able to continue their commercial arts training by reason of their high school work. In general, high schools should offer such courses as meet the needs of that particular community. Bookkeeping is offered in 255 schools in the state which involves a large enrollment of 5,662 students. Several of our larger high schools have well-developed courses in bookkeeping. Some schools offer only one semester of bookkeeping in which only the fundamentals of the subject are mastered. There would seem to be little argument concerning the value of a practical bookkeeping course. All normal training high schools are required by regu - lation to offer bookkeeping. Ninety-four schools are offering a course in commercial arithmetic. This course is usually held to one semester's wotk and may be added to aigbera and geometry to complete a high school minor or major in mathe - matics. Fifty-four schools in the state with an enrollment of 1,000 were offer - ing either one or two semesters of commercial geography. Geography courses of all kinds have definitely been increasing in the past two years. A practical course in office practice has been offered with much suc - cess in the larger high schools. Twenty-seven schools are now offering this course to 102 students. This is a phase of commercial specialization .work and is possible only in schools where a sufficient number of students are interested in commercial arts specialization with a view toward future employment in various business fields. Often has it been said that music is a universal language. It is gratify - ing to note the more prominent place that various music courses are finding in our high schools. In fact, no other subject seems to be making as rapid a growth as music. There is no doubt but what the many interests have been responsible for the great increase in various music courses in our Nebraska high schools. Certainly the radio has had a direct influence. It is interesting to note that 12,303 students are now engaged in some type'bf music instruc - tion as follows: Chorus, 3,902; orchestra, 736; band, 2,334; glee club, 2;479. </seg>
         <seg id="p091">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 91 Lengthened Recitation Period It is encouraging to note the number of schools that are increasing the recitation period from 40 to 60 minutes. Two years ago, about 18 per cent of the high schools were operating on this basis, but today the! number has increased to about 30 percent. Many schools have found the hour recitation schedule particularly desirable. . -¦-.: ' Supervised Correspondence Cowries A large number of fully accredited, minor accredited and approved high schools are taking advantage of die opportunity offered to them in the supervised correspondence courses of the University of Nebraska, and are dius able to extend the number of their subject offerings. The number of high schools that have taken advantage, of these courses is as follows: • 1938-1939 1939-1940 Approved schools (2 Yr.) „ ._._...._„._„ .............. 7 J9 Approved schools (3 Yr.) ._._.„.„.„....._...„... ...... 0 . j 1 Approved schools (4 Yr.) ... ........... ....... 8 14 Minor accredited schools : „ ................. 13 16 Fully accredited schools .....„„...„.. ........ ™&#132;.135 1(59 .. ¦ . ... -: s ¦'¦••.'.

This method of enriching the curriculum and meeting the varied needs of individual pup'ds is especially helpful to the small high school. In all, one hundred fifty-two courses are offered by the Extension Division, thus affording a wide choice of subjects. High School Inspection And Acereditment A complete discussion of the various phases of high school inspection "would require far more space than can be allotted to this report and! would, no doubt, prove burdensome to readers. At best, only a brief survey of some of the more interesting aspects, objectives and purposes, as carried on by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, can be given. Authority for this work is vested by law in the office of the State Superin - tendent of Public Instruction. It has a two-fold purpose—die determination of high school acereditment as finally recognized by the University authorities and the determination of approval to receive not only state apportionments but to receive state aid in connection with the program of high school normal training.

This was done to avoid trie serious duplication of effort that prevailed under the old plan. This arrangement has prevailed for several years and has proven very satisfactory. The University has set up certain standards of accreditment for the high school inspector to use in determining the evaluation of the schools visited as well as serving as a guide to school authorities in planning the or - ganization of their curricula. The standards as given in the University Extension News Bulletin of June 12, 1940, are: "The University of Nebraska maintains a list of accredited schools, the graduates of which are admitted to the University (and to nearly all of the colleges and universities of the United States) without entrance examinations in subjects that are properly certified as completed within these schools. Unless a graduate of an accredited school, a candidate for admission must be prepared to take examinations in those subjects in which entrance credits are desired, except that graduates of non-accredited four-year high schools may be excused from taking the academic examinations by passing an intelli - gence test with a standing that shows ability to do the work of a college freshman. 'Accredited' schools are such as are found to meet the 'Standards of Accredited Schools' to a degree that meets the approval of the University Committee on Accredited Schools . Standards Of Accredited Schools 1. Not less than 12 units required for graduation from a senior high school (tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grades), or not less than 15 units for graduation from a four-year high school. 2. At least three teachers, including the superintendent, giving full time to instruction in the high school, provided that in schools having junior - senior organization, at least two teachers, including the superintendent, shall give full time to instruction in the senior high school, grades 10-12 inclusive. Schools desiring to organize on other than the 84 or the 6-3-3 plan shall submit in advance such details of organization as will clearly indicate the local needs and the attendant reasons for the change. Such schools will be considered special cases, and will be subject to accreditment on their merits. Under this provision, some five- and six-year high schools with three teachers have been approved as fully accredited schools. 3. The minimum preparation of all teachers new to the school in four - year high schools and in grades 10 to 12 inclusive in schools organized on any other plan authorized by Standard 2tobe a baccalaureate degree. This shall not apply to teachers recognized on September 1, 1929, as having the </seg>
         <seg id="p093">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 93 equivalent of 120 college hours, to superintendents qualified on September 1, 1931, or to members of the instructional staff teaching in Nebraska accredited high schools in 1937-38. All who instruct in grades 6 to 12 in - clusive to be legally qualified for giving such instruction. 4. AH teachers new to the school to instruct in the field of their major or other adequate preparation. Any departure from this standard to be re - ported in writing. Exceptions will be approved only after a careful con - sideration of all factors involved. In interpreting this standard 15 college hours in the field will be recognized as adequate preparation, providing it includes college preparation in die specific subject taught, a year for subjects carried for two semesters in the high school and a semester for subjects carried for but one semester in the high school. Deduction from the 15 college hours may be allowed to the extent of two semester hours a unit, except in English, science, and social studies, for approved high school work, not to exceed a total of 6 semester hours. Each basis of qualification shall include at least one college course of three hours or more. A minimum of 15 college hours, with the deductions as indicated for approved high school work in certain fields, will meet the standard as acceptable preparation in English, any foreign language, mathematics, science, and social studies. The following special fields require 12 hours, with deductions for approved high school work as above. (a) Commercial arts should include at least two college courses in each subject taught, one of which may be a course in special methods of teaching commercial subjects. The minimum preparation in typewriting is four ; semester hours; in shorthand, eight semes - i- ter hours; in bookeeping, four semester hours; in social business (business law, economic geography, general,business) six semester .; : i hours. ; ¦'¦¦¦ .. ¦- ' .-: '¦.':¦¦-.¦.- ¦ ...¦¦ (b) Industrial arts should include bench woodwork and wood finishing, -'•.: operation and care of woodworking machines, wood turning, archi - tectural drafting or mechanical drawing, and home mechanics or . any of the commonly taught industrial arts subjects. (c) Representative art should include representation, decorative art, art . appreciation, and art history. : (d) Music should include music methods, voice, harmony, and otches - ¦'¦','':':.- tea or band. •¦ :'[' ".¦¦¦'.,¦¦; ' - ¦¦ ..¦ ¦¦ . ... (c) Agriculture should include agriculture and methods in agriculture and may include six hours of natural science. (f) Home economics should include food and nutrition, textiles and dodiing (all widi some laboratory experience), home management, child development and family relationships, basic design and home furnishings, and methods of teaching homemaking education. </seg>
         <seg id="p094">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 94 (g) Physical education and athletics should include general physical education, methods in teaching physical education, theory and prac - tice of competitive sports and playgrounds, hygiene, and the or - ganization and administration of physical education and athletics. (h) Argumentation, dramatics, journalism, and speech to have appro - priate college courses in the respective subjects. English credit may be used in completing the 12 hours. (i) A teacher of a single special subject shall meet the minimum re - quirement in that subject, without necessarily havine 12 hours in the field. 5. Students entering accredited schools from non-accredited or non - approved schools to be required to pass a written examination in all high school subjects carried by them which they do not continue, the papers to remain on file for review by supervisors or inspecting authorities. Accredited schools are expected to accept without examination, credits earned in other accredited or in approved schools. 6. Laboratory and library facilities adequate to the needs of instruction in the subjects taught. 7. The location and construction of the buildings, the lighting, heating, and ventilation of the rooms, the nature of the lavatories, corridors, closets, water supply, school furniture, apparatus, and methods of cleaning to be such as to insure hygienic conditions for both pupils and teachers. 8. Efficiency of instruction, acquired habits of thought and study, and the general intellectual and moral tone of the school such as to justify con - fidence in the work of the school. List Of Accredited Schools There is now but one list of schools fully accredited to the University of Nebraska. For the convenience of the smaller communities, the University establishes a list of 'Minor Accredited Schools,' the graduates of which may receive from the senior high school 11 units or credentials giving them con - ditional admission to college. Additional credit can be secured by complet - ing satisfactorily 30 hours of college work or by examination. Variations from the standards will be permitted to meet local conditions, as may seem proper to the Committee. All standards will be considered, and must be met to a reasonable degree. There must be at least two instructors giving full time to the high school. Instructors of academic subjects shall meet Standard 4 in at least two of the subjects which they teach. All instructors new to the school, including the superintendents, shall meet Standard 3. The University of Nebraska does not maintain an inspector of accredited schools. By arrangement with the State Department of Public Instruction the University Committee on Accredited Schools receives reports of inspec - tion made by officials of that Department in lieu of reports by University </seg>
         <seg id="p095">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 95 inspectors. Requests for inspection should be made to State Superintendent Charles W. Taylor, Lincoln, Nebraska. Application for accreditment should fee made to G. W. Rosenlof, University Examiner, lincoln, Nebraska. All required reports must be on file by December 1 in order to receive con - sideration." * Compiled reports for accreditment of high schools in Nebraska for the biennium 1938 to 1940 are as follows: 1938-1939 1939-1940 Total Number of Fully Accredited Public High Schools 449 454 Total Number of Minor Accredited Public High Schools 73 691 Total Number of FuUy Acaedited Private High Schools 44 471 Total Number of Minor Accredited Private High Schools 6 3 Grand total of acaedited public and private high schools 572 573 The following represent the schools so accredited as of July 1, 1940.

Whitman Winnetoon North Central Astociation Another accrediting agency heretofore and at present recognized in Ne - braska, as in 20 other North Central states in contiguous territory, is the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. The object of this association is that of establishing closer relationship between die sec - ondary schools and the institutions of higher learning within the group of states in the North Central area as well as between other areas of the United States. Membership in this organization is entirely optional and voluntary. It js a mutual society, the Constitution of which provides that all decisions of the Association bearing on the policy and management of secondary schools and institutions of higher education are understood to be purely advisory in character. In order to realize the above objectives, several other immedi - ate aims have been set up, among these being the following: First to bring about a better acquaintance, a keener sympathy and heartier spirit of,co - operation among the leaders of the secondary schools and colleges by enabling them to meet at personal conferences at least once a year; second, to encour - age the free discussion of common educational problems and devise ways </seg>
         <seg id="p101">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 101 and means of solving these problems through the exchange of views at con - ferences and through published reports; and, third, to promote the physical, intellectual and moral well-being of students in secondary schools and colleges by calling attention to the need for proper sanitary conditions in school buildings, adequate library and laboratory facilities, defensible curriculum organizations, high standards of scholarship and professional achievement among teachers, scientific practices among administrators and, finally, to suggest better ways in which adequate financial support may be given to the carrying on of the necessary programs of secondary education. As indicated, membership is purely voluntary. There is and can be no compulsion. Any school choosing to become a member of the Association may make application therefor and shall be visited by the proper officials authorized to.make such visitations and, having been found to meet die desirable standards or qualifications as set up, will be recognized for approval. The significance of this plan of regional accreditation ties in,the fact that the graduates of such institutions as are accredited to the Association are admitted to practically every institution of higher learning in the United States. Neither does this Association seek to control the schools when accredited either as regards their course of study, their curriculum, their plan of organization for administration and supervision, the personnel of rfieir faculty, or any other of a number of factors generally considered in accreditment relations. This Association has approved the application of 144 public high schools and 8 private high schools in Nebraska. Schools so accredited are indicated on preceding pages and are designated by an asterisk placed to the left of the name of each school. Teachers in any Nebraska accredited school may elect to qualify under North Central Association Standards. : j .-¦ ¦ . - ¦ • ¦ ¦¦'¦-¦¦".- ¦ " ¦ - - ¦ . Criterion 7—Preparation of the Instructional and Supervisory Staff (a) All members of the instructional and supervisory staff (excepting the administrative head of the high school whose college preparation is indi - cated under Criterion 6) possess the minimum general training assumed to be guaranteed by a bachelor's degree from an institution of higher education accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools or from an institution of equal standing.

         <seg id="p102">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 102 degree, also the kind and distribution of college courses taken and the recency oi their completion. (b) The minimum professional training of individual members of the instructional and supervisory staff (excepting the administrative head of the high school whose professional training is indicated in Criterion 6) is fifteen semester hours of education. In the case of a teacher whose professional training consists oi less than fifteen semester hours, the State Committee shall have discretionary power to waive this criterion if in its judgment the teacher is otherwise highly qualified and is doing clearly superior work. (Un - til professional courses are defined by the Association, the Commission will accept as such only courses certified as education by the institution in which they were earned.) (c) All members of the instructional and supervisory staff are ade - quately prepared in those subjects and fields in which they are engaged. All teachers in new schools making application for approval and all newly employed teachers in secondary schools now on the approved list of the Association shall, until such time as the Commission redefines adequate preparation, have a minimum preparation for their respective teaching assign - ments in accordance with the following: English —15 semester hours. Foreign languages —15 semester hours in language taught. Science —15 semester hours, of which 5 shall be in the science taught. Mathematics .—ls semester hours. Social Studies —15 semester hours, which must include preparation in specific subjects taught. Deduction in the fields of foreign language and mathematics allowed to the extent of 2 semester hours for each unit earned in high school, not to ex - ceed a total of 6 semester hours. The State Committee will consider adequate preparation in science and social studies to be a year of college work for subjects covering a year of sec - ondary work and a semester of college work for subjects covering. but a semester in the secondary school. In the case of teachers of subjects in such fields as agriculture, art and drawing, commerce, home economics, industrial arts, music, physical education, and speech, it shall be the responsibility of the State Committee to satisfy it - self that teachers of subjects in these fields are relatively as well qualified as are those for which the minimum preparation is specified above. Li judging the </seg>
         <seg id="p103">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 103 adequacy and comprehensiveness of the preparation of teachers, the State Committee shall take into consideration the amount of preparation in excess of the minimum specified above in the case of all teachers holding a major teaching ass^nment; namely, the teaching of two or more sections, or more ;than 30 pupils, in a particular field. Approved Non-Accredited Hifh School* .'.¦¦ Origin of Approved High Schools The approved non-accredited high schools were organized in rural and vjllage schools where only one or two years of high school work was offered. Later some of these were extended to include the third and fourth years of high school work. Most of those offering the fourth year are now included on the list of accredited high schools. The origin of the approved high school is well known to people who are familiar with rural conditions in Nebraska. Parents, wishing to have their children continue in school without leaving home, made the necessary effort in true pioneer style. Provisions were made for including high school work in the local school even though expenditures must necessarily be greater. At first the high school work was offered with little or no supervision by the State Department of Public Instruction. As near as it was practicable to do so, the local school board planned their course to parallel that of the nearest accredited high school. This was done so that their children could complete their work in an accredited high school without loss of high school credit. Commendable work in the rural schools was evidenced by the suc - cess of the students in continuing their work in the larger school. State Supervision of Approved Hifh School* The enactment of the free high school tuition law, Section 79-901, Nebraska Statutes, provided that free high school tuition could be legally paid only! "to school districts which have been approved by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction as schools qualified to grant free public high school edu - cation to non-resident pupils under the provisions of this Act." Section 79-901 further provides that the county board of supervisors or commissioners shall exclude from the county free high school tuition levy "all the actual valuation of all taxable property of any district in which is main - tained an approved four-year high school." Actual valuation of all taxable property of any district shall be excluded from die county free high school tuition levy in proportion to the number of years for which the high school maintained in the district is approved:—three-fourths of the actual valuation for a district which maintains an approved three-year high school; one-half of the actual valuation for a district which maintains an approved two-year high school; arid one-fourth of the actual valuation for a district which main - tains an approved one-year high school. .¦'.'• </seg>
         <seg id="p104">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 104 All high schools in the state which are accredited to the University of Nebraska are approved for collecting free high school tuition and are totally exempt from the county free high school tuition levy. A school may not be accredited for less than four years of high school work. The approved non - accredited high schools are approved for collecting free high school tuition and are exempt from the free high school tuition levy for the proportionate amount, according to the years of high school work offered with the approval of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. The State Department of Public Instruction has maintained careful su - pervision over the approved high schools as required by state law. All Stu - dents of the approved high schools may be admitted to the accredited high schools without special examination. Graduates of the four-year approved non - accreditec! high schools are admitted to the University of Nebraska upon condition with eleven units of high school credit. Applicants with at least eleven entrance credits from non-accredited high schools are tequired to pass, during the period of registration, either the entrance examinations given by the University Examiner or a satisfactory psychological test. Standards for Approved Non-Accredited High School* Number of teachers required. (For specific information on the number of teachers required for ap - proved high schools in Nebraska see page 12, Bulletin J, Approved Rural and Village High Schools.) A school may be approved as a one- or two-year high school with one properly qualified teacher. If the ninth- and tenth-grade work is combined and alternated, the teacher may also teach the seventh and eighth grades, if their work is properly combined and alternated. A school may be approved as a three-year school with two properly qual - ified teachers. In addition to the high school grades, these teachers may also teach the seventh and eighth grades when combined in one class. A school can only be approved as a four-year high school when at least two properly qualified teachers devote their entire time to high school work.. Qualifications of Teachers in Approved Non-Accredited High Schools Minimum Requirement. A teacher in a Nine- or Ten-Grade Approved High School (one or two years) shall hold a Nebraska Senior Grade School Certificate or one of higher rank. (See exceptions mentioned in third paragraph.) A teacher in an Eleven- or Twelve-Grade Approved High School (three or four years) shall hold a Nebraska Secondary School Certificate or one of higher rank. (See exceptions mentioned in third paragraph.) </seg>
         <seg id="p105">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 105 Since the new certification law is not retroactive, a teacher who holds a valid Second Grade High School Certificate or one of higher rank is qual - ified to teach in an approved non-accredited "high school as long as the said certificate remains in force. (See page 12, Bulletin J, Approved Rural and Village High Schools, 1935-1937.) The progressive ranlc of certificates under the new law is Senior Grade School, Secondary School and Administrative and Supervisory. Departmental Recommendation. '. (a) All teachers of high school academic subject matter shall show the completion of not less than twelve semester hours of college credit in at least two of die fields of academic subject matter that they are called upon to : teach. . ¦';¦• :; "¦ , '."" :¦ " :¦¦) '¦¦ '¦': (b) Teachers who teach outside of their major and minor fields of sub - ject matter shall show at least nine semester hours of college credit in the subjects which they are teaching. Deduction from this requirement may be permitted to the extent of two hours for each unit of the subject taken in high school, the total deduction not to exceed six semester hours. Teachers of science should show college preparation *in the specific science taught. Total Number of Approved Non-Accredited Hifh School* Compiled reports show a gradual decrease in the number of approved non-accredited high schools in Nebraska. This is due to various causes. The decrease in population, improved facilities for transportation, and a desire to send pupils to a school which can offer a more extensive curriculum are no doubt the most pertinent factors in the decrease in number.

         <seg id="p110">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 110 Marching Forward The curtain on another biennium of Nebraska secondary education has been drawn. The accomplishment of the past two years gives us encourage - ment for the future and points the way to even greater realizations. The many phases and forces of economic depression give Nebraskans an unquestioned right to feel proud of the progress their high schools have made. Schools have found themselves in the predicament of having larger and larger enrollments to care for with constantly decreasing revenues. The un - employment situation has forced an increasing number of young people into the schools and at the same time the decreasing property valuation has re - sulted in a much smaller amount of money available for school support. Teaching staffs have, of necessity, been reduced to the minimum. This has meant a great increase in the size of classes taught and in some instances the extent of the curriculum has been limited. The apparent earmarks of desperation need not discourage us. Indeed, it has been dramatically shown that the citizens of Nebraska are entirely ca - pable of surviving adverses and vicissitudes, and as a result of the test, become even stronger in their support of educational opportunities for their children. One cannot travel over the state and see the teachers at their work with - out realizing the changed attitude for the better—an attitude founded on an unconquerable spirit and a hope that is well grounded on recent tendencies and happenings. No one will doubt but what such enthusiastic optimism will carry the cause of education to higher achievements and greater opportunities in the biennium to come.

         <seg id="p111">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 111 Trench in Normal Training Enrollment The high school normal training program has been in operation in Ne - braska for thirty-four years. During that time approximately 49,000 teachers have been prepared to teach in the rural schools. Exact figures available for the last twenty-seven years, show 44,764 students graduated from the two-year normal training course, or an average of 1,658 per year. For the biennium just closing, the number of approved normal training high schools has de - creased from 187 to 184. However, the enrollment in the normal training courses has increased during that same period from 2,891 to 3,002. In gen - eral there has been a gradual decrease in both the number of normal training high schools and enrollment since 1924-2? mainly for two reasons. Li the first place, the number of one- and two-room rural schools has been decreasing steadily, thus reducing the demand for the graduates of normal training schools. In the second place, the four state teachers colleges have been supply - ing an increasing number of rural teachers. •"¦ • The following table shows the number of normal training high schools, the enrollment in. the normal training courses, and the number of teachers employed in the one- and two-room rural schools from 1929-30 to the present time:- ' • : ; ': '.'

Of the normal training graduates who are eligible for certi - ficates, an increasing percentage each year nave secured schdols. </seg>

There is no way of knowing how many secured positions at a later date, but it is certain that many did so. Selective Enrollment in Normal Training Courses This department has consistendy emphasized the importance of greater care in the selection of students for enrollment in the normal training course. All normal training bulletins sent out by the department have stressed the importance of scholarship, personality and character. No doubt this policy has had its influence upon the enrollment in the high school normal training courses. Moreover, the fact that, in the great majority of schools, the nor - mal training subjects are very well taught and demand a great deal of effort on the part of the students serves to deter the less serious from enrolling. Normal Training Courses Produce Good Teachers As a result of the greater selectivity in enrollment and the constantly im - proved courses of study and methods of presentation on the part of the su - pervisors, the normal training high schools are producing graduates who do a very acceptable type of teaching in the rural schools of the state. In fact, it is the testimony of many county superintendents that they are very defin - itely preferred to those who have had training in higher institutions, unless this training included special work in the field of rural education. Courses Are Based Upon Rural Needs In the high school, not a few but all of the courses making up die normal training curriculum have been planned with one central idea of training a rural teacher. They center around rural conditions and are based upon rural needs. The supervisor, herself, has had teaching experience in the rural schools. During the two-year course, the students review thoroughly the common branches in order that they may have their subject matter well in hand, and they are required to observe and do practice teaching, under supervision, in rural schools. Supervisors Are Highest Type Teachers Our normal training supervisors are an exceptionally fine group of teachers, in sympathy with the problems of the rural areas, and earnest in their </seg>
         <seg id="p113">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 113 attempts to provide the land of training which will best meet those problems. Their efforts are not limited to training in subject matter and the techniques of teaching. They endeavor to point out to their students the opportunities for leadership which will be theirs as they enter a community as a teacher and to help them to see the advantages and possibilities of rural life. The results of their efforts are seen in the improvements of the personalities of many of their students during the two years they are under the influence of the supervisor. Farm Boys And Girls Especially Adapted For Rural Teaching It must be kept in mind that most of the students who take the normal training course in high school are rural boys and girls who are familiar with rural conditions. A teacher without this background, no matter how fine her training, is obliged, in many cases, to make a very difficult adjustment when she teaches a rural school for the first time. The ideal situation would be to take rural boys and girls, fitted by nature to become teachers, and give them at least two years, beyond high school, in a teacher-training institution with a rich rural curriculum. They would then, however, demand better salaries and better working conditions than exist in the average rural school today. When a greater degree of prosperity returns to Nebraska, it is to be hoped and expected that the rural schools will rapidly work toward such a goal. In the meantime, die normal training course in high school seems to offer the best solution. .-:".' :'.'.'¦ '.''¦..'¦'. '.-.'. •¦¦..- Normal Training It a Vocational Course During the past twenty years, a great deal of emphasis has been placed upon the necessity of including vocational courses in the high school curricu - lum. The normal training course is vocational. It is very doubtful whether any other course offered in the high schools of Nebraska prepares as many of its graduates to go directly into positions where they are able to earn their living. . .

         <seg id="p114">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 114 vocational training offered in the secondary schools can compare with' this record? The Pre-Professional Phase of Normal Training The normal training course has another value which our high schools are coming to recognize more fully—and this b what may be called the pre - professional phase. In short, the course becomes a college preparatory course for young men and women who plan to go on to institutions of higher learning and later enter the teaching profession. Evidence at hand seems to indicate that the normal training course Is superior to any other course offered in high school as a preparation for college entrance for those students who ex - pea to prepare themselves for the teaching profession. Number of Rural Teachers Required Each Year At the present time, there are one- and two-room rural schools in Nebraska, employing 5 863 teachers. The number of new teachers required each year for these schools is normally about twenty-five per cent of the total number employed. That is, about 1.500 new teachers are needed each year to fill the vacancies in the rural schools. In 1939 the colleges of Ne - braska recommended 357 candidates for die Initial General Elementary Cer - tificate. In 1940 they recommended 383 for the same certificate, the average for the two years being 370 teachers prepared for rural teaching by the in - stitutions of higher learning in the state. This is a little less than one-fourth of the entire number of new teachers needed each year to.fill vacancies in the rural schools. Teachers College* Add New Rural Courte* The teachers colleges of Nebraska have added several courses during the past biennium which materially strengthen their rural curricula. Each col - lege now maintains a rural school for observation and practice teaching. These improvements in the rural departments of the teachers colleges are to be heartily commended. No doubt, any considerable improvement in economic conditions in Nebraska will find many teachers taking advantage of these added courses. Normal Training Graduates Continue to Improve Themselves Reports received from the county superintendents from time to time, show that a large proportion of the high school normal training graduates continue to improve themselves professionally by attending summer and reg - ular sessions of the University of Nebraska and die four state teachers col - leges. They have continued to do this, even during the past six years when salaries have been low. Leaving out of consideration those who are teaching for the first time this fall and hence have had no opportunity to get further training, it would seem that only about one-fourth have failed to continue their education at some institution of higher learning. </seg>

All the efforts and activities of the Division of Rural and Elementary Education have been devoted to the improvement of instruction and improve - ment of the school environment through the cooperation of teachers, parents, and other patrons of the school, county superintendents, and the State De - partment of Public Instruction. Intensive effort is directed toward the im - provement of instruction and its supervision, greater cooperation between home and school, improved equipment, standard and superior schools, and library enrichment. Special help is given in the formulating and developing of county-wide and local progressive school programs that will result in the realization of these goals. , As: in other states, the work of the Director of Rural and Elementary Education in Nebraska is concerned with the promotion of the state program of rural and elementary education, the supervision of instruction, and research. Professional leadership stimulates professional growth; it results in new ideas, inspiration, and higher professional ideals of service to teachers. Profession - al growth and increased efficiency is promoted through classroom visitation, commendation, constructive individual criticism, classroom demonstrations, testing programs, standards of achievement, individual instruction, contests and exhibits, teachers' meetings and institutes, school demonstration days </seg>

The field work consists of school visitation; personal conferences with teachers, superintendents, patents, and students; and educational addresses. During the biennium, the Director of Rural and Elementary Education has given 73 addresses at county, district, regional, and group teachers' meetings; school officers' meetings; eighth grade promotion programs; local, county council, district, and state Parent-Teacher Association meetings; Standardization and Superior school meeting; school - house dedicatory programs; and other community meetings. The office work of the Division has included the preparation, of the 1940 bulletin, "Rural Education Moving Forward", a two-hundred and forty page manual for rural teachers; issuance of certificates of membership in the State Rural School Chorus; mimeographed bulletins; issuance of recognition cer - tificates for better rural school teaching; recognition of standard and superior rural schools; preparation of eighth grade examination questions; rural and elementary school correspondence; and conferences with parents, teachers, school officers, other taxpayers, and pupils. The work of this division cannot be measured merely in terms of sta - tistical data concerning buildings and grounds, libraries, equipment, and personnel. It is the aim oi this division to realize with the cooperation of the home, school, and the church the richest dividends for the Nebraska boys and girls, dividends in achieving permanent interests in good reading, in the development of good habits of study, in the appreciation of good music and, most of all, a knowledge of the duties and the opportunities of a cit - izen of the United States.

         <seg id="p120">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Eighth Grade Examinations Section 79-901, Nebraska School Laws, as amended in 1939, reduces the number of subjects in which eighth grade examinations are given from fourteen to eight. The subjects required under the present law are Agri - culture and Geography as one examination subject, History and Civics as one examination subject, Physiology and Hygiene as one examination sub - ject, Arithmetic, Grammar, Spelling, Reading, and Penmanship which shall be graded on the basis of the penmanship in the other papers. The examinations were offered in April and in May. In compliance with die law, the eighth grade examinations have been prepared by the Division of Rural and Elementary Education and sent out to county super - intendents. The State Elementary Course of Study is the basis for the preparation of examination questions. A conscientious effort is put forth in order that these examinations may be a fair and reasonable test of the pupil's ability to do high school work. These tests conform with the standards and scope of examinations as given in "Rural Education Moving Forward, 1940." The reduction in the number of the subjects and the preparation of most of the tests in objective form enabled the pupils to complete, their tests in one day, and lessened the cost of the examination paper and grading. Reports of the cost of the paper and scoring of tests in 1939 and 1940 have been received from forty-one counties. In 1939, the total cost of paper and scoring in forty-one counties averaged £97.49; in 1940, the total cost of paper and scoring in the same forty-one counties averaged making a reduction of 44 per cent in total cost of paper and scoring of eighth-grade papers. The purpose of the final eighth grade examinations is to determine the eligibility of pupils to receive free high school tuition from the county for high school instruction in public approved high schools. It is the opinion of this department that such a test should be required until more supervision is provided for rural schools. Although pupils have not been permitted to take the eighth grade examinations unless the teachers have certified that they have completed the work as outlined by the Course of Study and are capable of doing high school work, very poor and failing papers as well as excellent papers have been filed in this office, which indicates that a test should be made before pupils are entitled to free high school tuition. Twenty-seven states have 975 rural school supervisors assisting county superintendents. In many of these states where there are the rural school supervisors assisting county superintendents, there is either local freedom in giving eighth grade examinations or county dominance of examinations. </seg>

         <seg id="p127">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Library Serriee for Rural School* . Attempts are being made to organize county libraries in the state. Adams County is the first to take advantage of the County Library Law. A County Library makes is possible for every resident to have access to a well-stocked book collection. In some sections of Nebraska, regional libraries which in - clude several counties may be more practical as a plan for library service. In 1929, the Legislature enacted Section 79-515, which provides that the school board of every school district within this state shall set aside annually from the general school funds the sum of five dollars per teacher employed for the school library fund. • According to reports received in this office, 2901 districts reported that they had purchased library books during die past year. Meanwhile, the boys and girls of Nebraska are in desperate need of additional library materials. The present students cannot wait for county and regional libraries to be voted in order that the counties may have adequate library service. There - fore, county superintendents are making noteworthy efforts to provide rural boys and girls with good reading materials in at least 57 counties. The County Superintendent's Circulating Library is helping in a measure to meet the immediate needs. A report on the Circulating Library is included in the 1940 "Rural Education Moving Forward", pages 205-207. In addition to the 54 counties luted in the bulletin, Richardson, Nemaha, and Cuming Counties adopted the plan in September. The American Association of University Women, the League of Women Voters, The Federated Women's Clubs, and the Kiwanis and the Rotary Clubs have assisted materially in en - riching the library service for rural schools in many counties. Aids for the selection of school library boob are included in the 1940 "Rural Education Moving Forward" and the Course of Study for Elementary Schools of Nebraska. The bulletin "Schools and Public Libraries Working Together" has been prepared by the Research Division of the National Educational Asso - ciation in cooperation with the Joint Committee of the. National Educational Association and the American Library Association. This bulletin will be published by the National Educational Association in 1941. Your Director of Rural and Elementary Education is a member.of this committee which was recently called to Washington, D. C. to work on the bulletin. All expenses were taken care of by the sponsoring associations. i An accepted principle for good library service in the elementary schools is that the Superintendent of Schools and the Board of Education should have the responsibility for school library service since a library is essential to every school program. </seg>
         <seg id="p128">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Mutic in the Rural School The Nebraska Rural School Chorus, originated by Professor C. A. Fulterton of lowa, has become a popular school activity. The chorus work last year was carried on by 1723 teachers in the rural schools of Nebraska. Tfie 10th annual State Rural School Chorus appeared at the State Fair, September 3, 1940. Certificates are issued by the State Department of Public Instruction to those pupils who sing the twelve Rural School Chorus songs acceptably with the phonograph. High school music supervisors in Saline and Stanton Counties have commented favorably on the great improvement noticed in die singing of the rural high school boys and girls who have had die privilege of partici - pating in the chorus work-in rural schools. Burt County and Dakota County are enthusiastic over the plan of hav - ing music supervisors employed in a few rural districts in each county. The plan is for each rural school participating in this music program to pay a certain amount of the supervisor's salary. The Tonette Band, the Rhythm Band, and the Harmonica Band are three of the melody bands that are very popular in rural schools. For additional information in regard to music in the rural schools, see pages 195-201 in the 1940 "Rural Education Moving Forward." Progren in Rural Education A Research Bulletin of the National Education Association, Volume XVIII, Number 4, September 1940, reports progress in rural education throughout die nation, as well as in Nebraska. In Chapter 111, Major Trends in Rural Education, 1930-1940, and in Table 111, is shown tte ten - year trend with respect to certain phases of rural education in forty-three states. This information was compiled from questionnaire reports filled out by county superintendents. The following percentages were compiled from the reports of Nebraska county superintendents: Classroom procedures have improved according to 94 per cent of the replies. The average amount of training for teachers has improved according to 82 per cent of the replies. Ninety-seven per cent of die replies indicated that there was improve - ment in the Courses of Study. , . Improvement in equipment and supplies was noted in 88 per cent of the replies. Supervision and in-service training and regularity of attendance have been improved according to 79 per cent of the replies. </seg>

Conferences with county and dty superintendents will confirm the statement that rural pupils require a period for orientation on their entering high school. This important period seems to vary in high schools. In one school, a period of four weeks enabled rural pupils to progress at the average rate of resident pupil progress. In another, the city superintendent felt that the first six weeks were apparently lost and that after that period, generally speaking, the rural pupils fitted in the city high school in good shape. Another high school in which half of the students were from rural districts found that there was no handicap in class work after three months. It was stated that after a short "warming-up" period of three or four months, that rural children were holding their own. Superintendents declared that it was most important for the teachers to have a sympathetic attitude, especially while the pupils were in this new situation. Some schools made a practice of placing their best trained, most sympathetic, experienced teachers in charge of the ninth grade class. The comments were made by long-term, experienced superintendents in towns whose high schools have large enrollments. Since farm property has been paying from 64 to 70 per cent of the state taxes in Nebraska, and since almost two million dollars are paid for high school tuition annually to the high schools of the state by farm taxes, rural pupils are entitled to understanding, sympathetic, and interested teach - ers who will give careful consideration to their problems and will aid them in becoming adjusted to the school environment of the large high school, thereby helping them to succeed in their work. </seg>

         <seg id="p134">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT School Officers' Conventioni A county school board association is one of the very best agencies for developing an active interest in the improvement of school conditions throughout the county and for inspiring a more united and cooperative pro - gram of work. Since the improvement of a school is so dependent on die school board and community, this department is interested in school of - ficers' meetings being held in order that school officers may become better informed as to the needs of the school, educational progress and policies, plans for modern school buildings, and financing of schools. Some states require county school officers' meetings. The school laws of Missouri and North Dakota provide for mileage of school officers who attend the county school board meetings. During the Biennium, School Officers' Meetings were reported in the following counties: Adams, Box Butte, Boyd, Buffalo, Butler, Custer, Dawson, Dodge, Douglas, Fillmore, Greeley, Hamilton, Holt, Howard, Kimball, Lincoln, Madison, Merrick, Phelps, Pierce, Polk, Saunders, Sheri - dan, Thayer, Washington, and York. Parent-Teacher Associations In order to give to the boys and girls the educational advantages that they should have, we must have a strong spirit of cooperation and harmony. The spirit of cooperation and neighborliness best finds expression and op - portunity for growth when patrons come together. The use of the school as a recreation center, for meetings of Parent-Teacher Associations and com - munity organizations offers great possibilities for bringing the school and community together. Participation in these meetings will develop leadership. According to the reports received, there are 1036 Parent-Teacher Associa - tions or community organizations cooperating with the school. For helps in organizing a Parent-Teacher Association, for suggestions for maintaining interest, for basic program discussion material, and for themes for programs, see pages 143-212, "1940 Rural Education Moving Forward." Other Cooperative Efforts for School Improvement The fine cooperation of many of the service clubs and organizations with the rural communities throughout the state has been shown in the Circulating Library work, community activities in health, Rural Field Day, Christmas Caroling, school equipment, and music of the rural schools.

Library Facilities Adequate library facilities and reading materials are needed for teach - ers and children. Clerical Assistance (or County Superintendents Gerical assistance for the County Superintendent should be provided by legislation to those county superintendents who do not have clerical help. The work of supervision b greatly handicapped when county super - intendents are compelled to devote a major part of dieir time to clerical work because of die lack of stenographic help. Status of Rural School Supervision in United States It is of interest to know that twenty-seven states have 975 rural school supervisors assisting county superintendents. These states are Alabama, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South </seg>
         <seg id="p137">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 137 Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. There are also 105 rural school supervisors in the State Departments of Education, in the states. States having three or more state rural school supervisors are Alabama—3, Delaware-4, Illinois—7, lowa—s, Louisiana —5, Maine—4, Michigan—3, Minnesota—6, New York—s, North Carolina —6, South Carolina—3, Tennessee—3, West Virginia—3, Wisconsin—s. The total number of rural school supervisors employed in the United States has more than held its own during the period of economic depression. During the six years from 1930-1936 there was an increase from 945 to 975. Even so, much remains to be done throughout the nation if all rural schools every - where are to have the service of trained supervisors to supplement other efforts now being made to help teachers. It is especially important that the young and inexperienced teachers now employed in some rural commun - ities grow in effectiveness, and provide adequate educational training for rural children. (Pamphlet No. 72, "Status of Rural School Supervisors in the United States in. 1935-36" published by the Office of Education Washington, D. C.) Intelligent guidance, a helping hand, willingness to assist where needed, and the ..pointing out of better teaching procedures ofttimes change failure into success for the teacher and bring to the boys and girls a year of happy achievement and progress that will contribute greatly to their growth and development. / \ </seg>

These classes are conducted in schools, shops or industrial plants with practical men and women as instructors. They are offering instruction to per - sons of all ages over sixteen years who are obliged to be self-supporting and entitled to such schooling. 1,930 men and 37 women were enrolled in Adult Classes. Schools received reimbursements totaling $9,626.44 for this type of instruction. (b) Part rime Trade Extension Classes These classes enroll young men and women between the ages of sixteen and twenty-one who have entered upon em - ployment as apprentices or learners. These apprentices or learners are returned to school for a minimum of four hours per week to receive instruction. Due to shortage of jobs dur - ing the past several years, youth has been denied opportunity to learn on the job as an apprentice. With conditions in industry gradually improving, youth of the state should be given more opportunity to secure training by the part-time in school and the part-time on the job method. 160 boys and 1,211 girls were enrolled in Part-time Trade Extension Classes. Schools received reimbursements totaling #8,859.10 for this type of instruction. (c) Part-time General Continuation Schools Under the laws of Nebraska, the board of education in any school district having fifteen or more children between the ages of fourteen and sixteen who hold employment permits which are in force must establish part-time classes giving in - struction to such permit holders for eight hours per week. When part-time classes are established permit holders are re - quired to attend, while the classes are open upon a voluntary basis for all others between 14 and 16. The schedule of in - struction in the part-time school is not fixed, as the pupils enrolled are of varying ages and scholastic attainment. They are employed in a variety of jobs and their experiences are those of workers rather than children. Consequently, to make the school best serve their need, it is organized on an op - portunity school basis to give the pupil the things he needs and can profit by most. 288 boys and 70 girls were enrolled in Part-time General Continuation Oasses. Schools received reimbursements to - taling $12,281.10 for this type of instruction. </seg>

(b) All-Day Homemaking Departments Homemaking training is an essential part of the general educa - tion of every girl. Courses in the day schools are at least two years in length.They are planned to give the girls training in the homemaking responsibilities they should be carrying at the present, and to lay a foundation for a continued develop - ment in homemaking interests and abilities. Each year's work includes units in social and family relationships; personal hygiene; food preparation on the meal basis; clothing selec - tion, construction and care; and child care and development. The subject matter in each unit is selected and organized by the homemaking teacher so it will be most practical for each com - munity. Home projects are a part of each year's work. These are supervised through home visits to cooperate with parents and through individual conferences at school. In addition to units in homemaking the course includes in - struction in art applied to clothing, house furnishings and decorating problems; science related to home problems and physiology. 195 boys and 4,490 girls were enrolled in the All-Day Home - making classes. Reimbursements for this type of instruction totaled $48,867.88. IV. Distributive Education Courses for workers and employers in the Distributive Occupations are now being made available by local school hoards, in cooperation with the State Department of Vocational Education. The train - ing of adults and youth for their occupational needs has been rec - ognized as a function of the educational system. Distributive Oc - cupations are those followed by workers direcdy engaged in mer - chandising activities, or in direct contact with buyer or seller when (1) Distributing to consumers, jobbers, wholesalers, and others the products of agriculture and industry. (2) Managing, operating, or conducting a commercial service or personal service business, or selling the services of such a business. Distributive Occupations do not include clerical occupations such as bookkeeping, stenography, office clerical work, and the like. </seg>

'; Vocational Rehabilitation of ; Physically Disabled Persons Many years ago the administrators of Vocational Rehibilitation realized the inadequacy of the then existing crippled children's program in Nebraska. Under the sanction of the State Board, the Rehabilitation Division promoted surveys and crippled children's clinics in cooperation with the Nebraska Elk's Association and a majority of our County Medical Societies. This program and resultant publicity not only brought physical examinations to almost 4,000 crippled children and adequate medical attention to more than half of them, but was a large factor in this state's finally vastly increasing our public supported services for the care of crippled children until Nebraska's public crippled children's facilities are now serving more than five or six times as many persons as were being aided ten years ago. These facilities are the State Orthopedic Hospital, the Crippled Children's Division of the State Child Welfare Department under the Board of Control and the Orthopedic Division of the State University Hospital. Supplementing these public sup - ported programs are the organization supported programs of the Nebraska Elk's Association, the Shrine, the Nebraska Chapter of the National Society for Crippled Children and the children's committees of the American Legion and several other fraternal and civic organizations. As a direct result of these improved facilities the percentage of time and effort lost in rehabilitation in working with non-feasible and non-responsive cases among the young disabled is vastly reduced. Conversely, the percentage of young disabled who come to the Rehabilitation Department for vocational training whose physical restoration is adequate and whose schooling has been maintained at normal levels is steadily .increasing. Five years ago when the newly-formed Crippled Children's Division was created under the Child Welfare Department, Rehabilitation turned over to them records on 3,700 crippled children's cases. With this big job suc - cessfully under way and under the direction of competent people, Rehabilita - tion administrators were in a position to give more attention to the improve- </seg>
         <seg id="p148">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 148 ment of the selection of cases, vocational counseling technique, employment training methods, and improved employer and placement relations. Rehabilitation of physically disabled persons is a job in which the plan - ning must be for lifetimes, whether the work is with rich or poor, young or old, talented or dull. Results may appear to come slowly but successful ob - jectives can be attained only when based on careful longtime planning. Hence, in the report of this year rehabilitation administrators see culmination of efforts commenced ten years ago. The following comparative figures are of interest: 1938-1939 1939-1940 Increase Per Cent 1. Rehabilitated 63 95 + 50.8 2. Active Case Load at Year's End 274 415 + 51.5 3. Of Above Active Load—Service Complete and Awaiting Employ - ment or in Employment under Follow-up 50 60+20 Total Cases served during Past Fiscal Year (Total of 1 and 2) 337 510 + 51.3 These gains are simple proof of the fact that the pioneering in pro - motion of crippled children's work, accident prevention, and related activities were sound and in a long-time program has paid permanent dividends. Two years ago the Legislature increased the State Funds for Vocational Rehabilitation in the amount of $4,796.96. It also arranged for the more adequate development of the program by providing "that up to #6,954.24 of the total State Funds could be used to meet emergency situations of necessary physical restoration and maintenance that frequently arise in cases in process of preparation for various occupatioins." This small increase and the lib - eralization of the use of Federal Funds and State Matching Funds have been major and important factors in the increasing and expanding of the Rehabili - tation Service that has occurred in Nebraska within the last sixteen months. During chat time the program has almost doubled in all phases of work and in the number of persons served. Due to recent Congressional action, Federal Funds available to Nebraska for the coming biennium are increased by the amount of $18,353.04, if Ne - braska matches the Federal increase. While the Rehabilitation Service has now expanded to the point that we are now serving a total of almost five hun - dred persons annually, and annually returning to self-support in private em - ployment almost one hundred disabled persons previously dependent upon so - ciety, there are still many more persons becoming dependent through accident and disease disabilities than we can rehabilitate with present funds and facili - ties. </seg>
         <seg id="p149">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 149 : Last year from combined State and Federal sources ¦ Vocational Re - habilitation spent a total of #49,129.76. The ninety-five persons who were graduated as closed rehabilitations are now engaged in permanent productive employment in which they are earning a total of #80,000.00 annually. As these disabled persons are working at beginning jobs in the new fields of em - ployment for which they have been prepared, their earnings can be expected to increase throughout the years. The ninety-five persons rehabilitated have eighty-five dependents. The Average minimum monthly payment to persons on relief in Nebraska is fifteen dollars; thus, the average minimum cost of taking care of the bare subsistence of these persons rehabilitated and their dependents would be #180.00 per year or a total of #32,400.00 annually for the one hundred eighty persons involved. '..." ' &lt;; . : . •'.,:¦ ¦ Thus, at a cost for the entire program of Rehabilitation for the. past fiscal year of only liity percent more than would have to be expended for 'thd annual subsistence of these same persons, we have permanently re - duced the load of dependency in Nebraska by #32,400.00 annually and added $80,000.00 to the annual earning capacity of Nebraska's workers. The State Board for Vocational Education requested the. governor to provide a like increase of State Funds in the budget which he will submit to the 1941 session; of the Nebraska Legislature in order that the total Fed - eral Fund of approximately #70,000.00 for the coming biennium can be .matched.'- ..¦-•.¦ • ¦' :'/ .. ¦ ,'¦' .:¦¦"'..¦¦ ¦¦"•¦ '¦;' </seg>
         <seg id="p150">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 150 CHARACTER EDUCATION Edna H. Jackson, Supervisor CONTENTS:—Realization of need for Character Education—Legal Requirement—Knighthood of Youth Clubs—High School Service League. American people are challenged as never before by the need for a sys - tem of universal education which will develop citizens of sterling worth and unswerving integrity. Anxiety for the welfare of democracy is the impelling force back of increased demands for character education in the schools. Sin - cere emphasis on patriotic loyalty is coupled with a realization of the need of educating our people to accept and appreciate the ethical principles which have been fundamental in development of the Nation. Nebraska has been in the foreground in the nation-wide character edu - cation movement which has gained considerable impetus during the past ten years. In 1927, die legislature enacted one of the first state laws to require "each and every teacher employed to give instruction in the first twelve grades of any public, private, parochial or denominational school in the State" to give special emphasis to instruction, which would "tend to develop an upright and desirable citizenry." The same legislature required the State Superintendent of Public Instruction to aid teachers in giving the special emphasis required. This has been consistently done and the whole school program directed toward that end as the chief concern of education. Americans cherish personal liberty, freedom of speech, freedom of religion and government by popular vote. Children must be trained to use these privileges wisely and helped to see and accept their obligations as citizens, to assure the perpetuation of these privileges. The Knighthood of Youth Club in the elementary grades and the High School Service League in the secondary schools afford opportunity for this training. Young people "learn by doing" and have actual practice in making decisions, accepting re - sponsibilities, and a large share in shaping the programs which are vital to their training in citizenship. Functional training through which each individ - ual is given opportunity for personal counseling is the primary purpose of the whole plan. A new bulletin has been prepared to aid teachers in the urban and ele - mentary schools of Nebraska in giving the specific emphasis required by the character education law. Careful attention has been given to inculcating ideals of courtesy, industry, honesty, thrift, reverence, and patriotism. A general plan for directing activities of the classroom has been included in this new Knighthood of Youth Club Guide, a manual of patriotic instrution on the Flag of the United States; how to respect it and how to display it. Lessons on loyalty to Nebraska are oudined also. The Knighthood of Youth Club and the High School Service League afford opportunity for cooperation with home, church, and community. </seg>
         <seg id="p151">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 151 They ate the "hvschool service dubs" under the direction of a trained leader, a teacher. Many opportunities are found for encouragement and for group approval. Projects are designed to aid pupils in forming desirable attitudes and habits. ¦'.: \ The immediate objective of the Knighthood of Youth and the High School Service League is the highest development of each pupil—physically, mentally, socially, emotionally, and spiritually. The schools have not func - tioned properly unless they produce active citizenship. A child may be taught to read, write, cipher, and his ability may be developed in the arts, but education in a democracy has failed unless it has taught him the folow - ing,all of. which are of equal importance: first, to be responsible for himself; second, to use his freedom intelligently; third, to think in group situations; fourth, to be dissatisfied with success that comes at the expense of others; fifth, to be an active force in government. The test of any program of education is not how well it looks on paper, but what it "educes," how it develops, brings forth changes in the lives of those whom it seeks to educate. The results of the character education program in Nebraska can only be measured through the attitudes and ideals of die pupils: who have been directed through its suggestions. To obtain this specific information and include it in this or any other report would be im - possible. Progress has been noted by many who have observed the work of the schools carefully/. . Character education cuts across the whole education process. It is not confined to the schools and for this reason the schools must find ways to coordinate their efforts with other agencies. Teachers should use every opportunity to cooperate with the home and the church in helping each child obtain an adequate training in spiritual values. This Nation was founded on Christian principles and only through observance of these can it hope to survive through the turbulent exigencies that envelop so much of the world. An appreciation of the opportunities of being an American citizen must be inculcated in the early training of youth if they are to be willing to defend their country. Teachers and parents should use every opportunity to instill into their very beings a love of country which would enable them to make any sacrifice demanded of a free people in time of crises. They must be made to see their advantages under our form of government and to fer - vently desire its continuance. The schools and social agencies must find some way to off-set the wave of "defeatism" which has threatened the welfare of our Nation as much as "fifth-column activities." "It is the spirit of frustration in the face of such a land of wide opportunities that must be ".arrested." ; . '¦¦¦' '•. V i--V:" •¦'"' :¦' .

" The registered nurses of Nebraska, through their own efforts, are ren - dering a vital service to the people of this state in maintaining this Bureau, the sole purpose of which is to provide safer and more intelligent nursing service. If nurses did not carry on this undertaking, it would have to be done by the state to protect the public against an influx of nurses from other states who are poorly qualified and to circumvent questionable projects for the training of nurses which are promoted solely for private gain. Through definitely established legal requirements, the Bureau also protects the inter - est? of young women who enter the accredited schools of nursing in Nebraska so that they may receive preparation according to acceptable standards of nursing, education. These are highly necessary to enable them to render intelligent professional service which only is safe in caring for the sick and disabled and for the .prevention of diseases and conservation of health. The real purpose of licensure or registration of nurses is to provide professional nursing service in order to protect the public as far as possible from incompetent nurses just as the licensure of physicians, dentists, phar - macists and the certification of teachers is required to protect the public against incompetence in those professional services. o"&gt;.'R N. is the symbol of the Registered Nurse.

         <seg id="p154">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 154 Restrictions Hamper Activities and Work of the Bureau Restrictions on the use of Bureau funds during the last legislative session (1939), in addition to those established legally, curtail the activ - ities and handicap the work of the Bureau. Under these restrictions no funds are available for the employment, from time to time, of additional assistants in the office of the Bureau. This situation exists even though ample funds are deposited for the Bureau under the state treasurer solely through the payment of fees paid by nurses themselves. The work of the Bureau is constantly increasing as more nurses become licensed, and, due to requests for records by the American Red cross Nursing Service and many nurses being transferred under the national defense program. To meet these increasing demands, also, requests by nurses diemselves for more pro - grams of instruction to keep pace with advancement in medical practice, more assistants are needed in the office of the Bureau. No difficulties are encountered if the Bureau is permitted to function according to the statutes under which it was established. Under the laws enacted during the legislative session of 1937, ten per - cent (10%) of the fees collected from the nurses are paid into the state treasury. During this biennium this amounts to #2,282.00. Referendum Vote on Reduction of the Annual Re-Registration Fee At the time the law was enacted establishing the Bureau of Education and Registration for Nurses, it was agreed that consideration would be given to the reduction of the annual re-registration fee as soon as the Bureau was fully established under the new order. From time to time, members of the profession have expressed a desire for action in accordance with this agreement. The majority of states in the union have established a re-regis - tration of only one dollar. The tendency for reduction of these fees in Nebraska has increased since the legislative session of 1939 when restrictions on the use of our funds were imposed (in addition to those already enacted in our law of 1935). At the annual meeting of the Bureau on November 9, 1939, it was unanimously decided to refer the matter to the nurses registered in Nebraska. Accordingly, a referendum vote by mail was conducted in April 1940 with these results: Total number of votes cast _ 2,966 Votes for reduction of fee to #1.00 1,620 Votes for retention of fee of #2.00 1,346 Majority of votes cast for reduction to #1.00 274 In accordance with the majority vote, it was decided, at the annual meeting of the Bureau on November 27, 1940, to take steps to present an amendment during the next legislative session (1941) to reduce the annual re-registration fee to one dollar. </seg>
         <seg id="p155">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 155 Conference* on The Curriculum During the biennium, three conferences on the curriculum for schools of nursing, have been held, one in 1939 and two in 1940.

If she desires to become enrolled in the American Red Cross Nursing Service, to which every patriotic and public spirited nurse aspires, she must have graduated from a school the standards of which meet the recrements established by the American Red Cross. Approved stand - ards o^ preparation are needed also for nurses who specialize in various helds ot service through taking courses in the various colleges and univer - sities throughout the country which now offer advanced courses, in nursing 1 o meet these needs for sound preparation of nurses, curriculum conferences are^ held to study and improve the methods of instruction in our schools and recently emphasis has been placed on the ward program of teaching as student nurses spend more time on the hospital wards than in the classrooms. Institute For Registered Nurjei An institute for nurses who are registered in Nebraska, was held in Omaha on March 22-24, 1939. Over 500 registered for the institute (including 131 student nurses from accredited schools of nursing in the state). A varied program was presented to meet the needs of nurses in the three major fields of service: Private duty, Institutional service, and Public Health Nursing. ¦','.' The majority of graduate nurses are financially unable to take additional courses from time to time. Institutes are exceedingly helpful therefore in bringing before 1 them new discoveries and methods of treatment in caring for the sick and injured, and new programs for health work. Specialists, and those prominent in the field of nursing, are brought here from different parts of the country and expenses incurred are paid by the Bureau from the fees paid by nurses only. ¦'-. . :-'.- : General Information of Accredited Schools of Nursing At present there are diirteen accredited schools of nursing in Nebraska: </seg>

Eleven schools admit only one class each year which usually results in a more thorough and better organized teaching program in both theory and practice as more time is available for teaching the various courses. A better sequence of subjects and clinical assignments is possible in most of the institutions through the admission of only one class annually. Two schools admit two classes each year usually in September and February. </seg>
         <seg id="p157">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 157 . ' • •¦"•.¦ Selection of Student* i Unwise selection of students in schools of nursing has been a problem for many years. For a time, improvement took place in more careful selec - tion or acceptance of students in that only those who rank in the upper thud or half in the high school class was admitted or those who attained, a general average of not lessthani 85 percent. Some schools still maintain these stand - dards, but others are admitting young women of low scholastic ability ', accord - ing to the high school records submitted to this office. Neither is it credit - able to a school to enter college students whose records show a low grade of scholarship. ". Only young women of normal, intelligence or mote should be admitted as what nurses are taught and what they do affect the very. lives or people. :, ¦;-" . . ..;,.- ¦'...',.. :\,.: ..¦:-¦.. -.'^y ¦¦¦-.'..., ••¦¦ &gt;'¦•¦'• .ii.^rV. Selection implies not only high standards of admission but superior judgment in elimination of students. It involves discrimination in regard to personality adjustment as much as acquirement of manual dexterity and skills, and intelligent grasp of classroom instruction. ¦ More than ever before, we need young women who can carry responsibility, who have a high degree of professional competency. : ; . : i . ; -: : " Intelligence tests are given in all schools of nursing on or shortly after admission of each class of students. Various aptitude and achievement tests are given also in four schools of nursing. Intelligence tests are administered in three schools by nurses on the.faculty of the school or a member of the hospital staff. The value of such a procedure is'questionable as psychologi - cal tests should be given by experts or those well qualified to do so and particularly to score them accurately and intelligently. . . ' Health Examinations Health examinations are given regularly now in all schools of nursing and each student receives at least three of such examinations, during the course of three years. Preventive measures against communicable diseases are taken in all schools but they are more thoroughly and definitely carried out in several schools than in others. Scarlet fever still is contracted by students in some schools and not at all in others. For early, detection of tuberculosis more schools now include X-rays of chests for. all students in the first health examinations given after, admission to the schools. From an administrative standpoint, it is "good business" to safeguard the health of student nurses at all times. ¦ • . - . .-, The amount of student illness, oh the whole, is gradually decreasing. Undoubtedly this is due in part to more thorough health examinations for the. detection of disease, more , preventive measures being taken routinely, reduction of hours on duty in the hospital, and improved living conditions in several of the ' schools during the past two years. </seg>
         <seg id="p158">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 158 Overcrowding and inadequate housing conditions are not conducive to well - being and happiness in a school of nursing. Teaching Equipment The teaching equipment in nine schools of nursing is now much improv - ed, and an entirely new teaching unit has recently been provided in one of our larger schools. Four schools are soil deficient in teaching equipment (dem - onstration rooms, etc.) for giving classroom instruction in the nursing arts courses which are the most important in the whole curriculum. I . Facilities for teaching the physical and biological sciences, especially for laboratory periods, are becoming more adequate as more schools establish. affiliations or connections with colleges and universities. This improvement is reflected in fewer failures in state examinations during the last two years. Library facilities are still inadequate in three schools of nursing while marked improvement has taken place in such facilities, also in library service, in ten schools. Inasmuch as student nurses now pay tuition and other ices through which textbooks may be provided for each student as her own property, that old bugbear of having to use old or obsolete editions is grad - ually being eliminated. Curriculum In all accredited schools of nursing, the total number of curriculum hours is increasing but this should not be done too rapidly at the expense of a sound teaching program and especially if only one full-time instructor is employed. However, some progress must be shown each year. Through the affiliarive course in Psychiatric Nursing at the Hastings State Hospital, Ingleside, eight schools of nursing have markedly increased their total num - ber of curriculum hours as a well developed program of classroom instruction has been developed there.

         <seg id="p159">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 159 centered on this vital phase of die teaching process to develop all of the latent educational values in the hospital experience which is necessary in the prepara - tion of nurses. The ward teaching program has become more definitely organized with a clearer understanding of the methods that may be employed in this situation. Closer integration of classroom teaching with ward expe - rerience has also been emphasized in an effort to prepare more intelligent nurses and enable them to adjust well to the many demands made in their professional service, .The ward teaching program is carried on more consistently in our better schools where faculty co-operation is the rule which is due largely to better prepared supervisors who have taken advanced courses for the positions they hold. Some schools voluntarily try to improve the teaching program while others do so reluctantly and meagerly probably because the hospitals with which they are connected rely too much on the young students to catty the nursing load of these hospitals.. Graduate nurses should be employed in sufficient numbers to provide good nursing service for the patients and sup - plementary to student service. The graduate staffs not only stabilize and improve nursing services, but they make it possible to give student nurses a richer and better balanced program of education and especially of ward instruction. \ • ' Still needed in the state are better clinical facilities for teaching pedia - tric nursing although several schools are making progress in that the hospitals are increasing the admission of pediatric patients quite satisfactorily. More charity cases are being cared for in these hospitals to provide for more and varied experience for students nurses. Two schools of nursing send their students outside of the state for affiliation in pediatric nursing. ¦.'": State Examinations Three state examinations for nurses were held each year for graduates of Nebraska accredited schools of nursing to become licensed and for ap - plicants from other states who are eligible (meet Nebraska legal require - ments). ¦;•'.;¦¦: ..:¦.•.¦¦ "¦; '.';. ¦'¦.... •¦ '•¦: '.-- : . .'.-.:¦- '..;¦¦..¦•!.".¦¦.'

         <seg id="p160">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 160 Conclusion Standards of nursing education in Nebraska do not tank among the highest in the United States, in so far as state standards are concerned, neither do they relegate this state among those of low standards. They are somewhat above average and improving gradually each year. It is gratifying to find that very few of the graduates (in recent years) of pur accredited schools of nursing have difficulty in becoming registered by reciprocity in most of the states in the union. Fewer graduates fail in our.state exam - inations for nurses since the curriculum and teaching methods have been improved. . ; • In order to keep pace with the advancement made in all brandies of education during the past two or three decades and particularly with the med - ical profession whose scientific development eclipses the wotk of generations before, nursing education has undergone a complete change. The young woman, trained mechanically by repetition to do a piece of work skillfully is no longer acceptable. Today, nursing if well done, has become a fine art and requires the highest intelligence to interpret and carry out the de - mands made upon it by the medical profession. In order to meet these demands, special teaching is required and nurse instructors, whose only duty is teaching, become necessary. The scraps of a hospital's spare time for teaching can no longer meet the expanding curriculum. Education in its truest sense, and not merely training young women how to do a few treat - ments has become the order of the day in schools of nursing as evidenced by the connections with colleges and universities which have been established throughout the country. "Nursing has come a long way in the past centuries—from the mere kindly neighbor's care, through the Sairy Gamp stage, to the beginning of real nursing in 1854 when Florence Nightingale began her work, and, ever since that time it has made rapid progress, without any "dark days." It has entered into the social life of our people to the extent that to-day nursing is an indespensable essential. It has progressed through some difficult timw, ever attaining higher standards endeavoring always to keep pace with the rapid advances of medicine."

         <seg id="p162">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Building Programs Of Nebraska Schools On Sound Financial Basis The total value of school property reported by County Superintendents on July 1, 1940, was #82,361,854.02. Indebtedness on this date was #26,740, - -166.30. These outstanding obligations amounted to approximately one-third of the investment in properties and were 1.39 per cent of the tax base for the year which was #1,922,271,788.00. Debt Is Reduced Outstanding obligations in 1940 show a decrease of #8,550,842.83 from the high point of indebtedness in 1931 when it reached #35,291,009.13. Moreover, accumulated sinking funds available on July 1, 1940, totalled #3,188,519.11. Accordingly, the net indebtedness on this date was #23,551, - -647.19. P Valuation Trends In Nebraska The valuation of all the tangible property of the state for taxation purposes has decreased from #3,102,050,571, in 1930 to #1,922,271;788 in 1940, the decrease amounting to 38.03 per cent. The decrease in the valuation of lands and improvements, which is included in the foregoing, has been in excess of the average decrease for all property in that it has amountd to 40.54 per cent, the valuation in 1930 having been fixed at #1,736,632,780 whereas in 1940 it was found by the State Board of Equalization and Assessment to be #1,032,542,666. Prior to 1933 the law provided that real estate should be revalued for taxation purposes each four years, and the last assessment under that law was made in 1930 when the value was found to be #46,128,595 less than was found in 1929. As a result of the continued adverse economic condi - tions, there was a demand in 1932 for a general reduction in the assessed value of lands and improvements and while the law did not authorize it, the State Board of Equalization and Assessment arbitrarily approved a re - valuation that resulted in a reduction of #301,153,484 from the previous year's total as returned by the assessors. ***** In 1933 the law was amended by the legislature to provide for a re - assessment in 1933 and again in 1934 and every two years thereafter. It is this law under which the state is operating at the present time. Following its passage, there was an additional reduction in the valuation of lands and improvements of #287,257.385 in that year from the valuation in 1932, and a further reduction of #7,570,753 when the reassessment was made in 1934. The decrease in the value of ill property in 1940 from the 1939 value totaled #125,247,803 or 6.1 per cent, whereas the decrease in die value of lands and improvements alone amounted to #86,858,277 or 8.5 per cent, —from 20//) Annual Report of the State Tax Commissioner. </seg>
