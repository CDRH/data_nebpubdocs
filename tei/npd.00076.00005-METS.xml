We believe tha* careful reading of the pages which follow will be of interest to all those who beheve In a Nebraska state-wide program of public education. Whatever success the department has had during the two years is due to the earnest cooperation of the department heads and their able corps irss" d, * State sup r mendent —■*• **■ ~*»*»» ** z takes which the department has made. Any credit really belongs to the d rectors who have worked for the state unceasingly.

This responsibility of the state for the educa - tion of its citizens in general has always been reflected in the high type of educauona. thinking found in Nebraska's Constitutional Convention and Legislates of former years. These statesmen have always attacked the edu - cauonal problems of the state from a non-political viewpoint. Special credit and praise are due to the very fine personnel that has always made up the committee on education in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The very life of democracy depends upon the universal and equitable education of each generation of youths as they come upon Ae scene of action As will be seen elsewhere in this report, the State of Nebraska toU schools Pr ° Ud ° f *' f3Ct th3t ShC h3S bee " B ' Vin9 9CnerOUS Support Constitutional Provision for Education r*JT" o nL ATticle ° f the ConstituHon of the State of Neb-ka - "The Legislature shall provide for the free instruction in the </seg>
            <seg id="p008">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT common schools of this state of all persons between the ages of five and twenty-one years." This provision in the Constitution clearly indicates that our Nebraska pioneers accepted the theory that education is the function of the state. In keeping with! this provision in the Constitution some forty-nine sessions of the Nebraska 1 Legislature have from time to time enacted laws presumed to carry out the intent of the above quoted section. In the main these laws have been adequate, and under the wise leadership of these legislative sessions the educational program of the state has moved forward over a long period of years in a most satisfactory manner. While the Legislature has in many instances recognized that education is the function of the state, it has delegated almost in its entirety the respon - sibility which is carried with this constitutional provision to the counties, the muncipaliticsi and in an even larger degree to the small rural districts them - selves. The law provides that certain territory within the state may under certain conditions be organized into a school district. Little thought has been given to the ability of these local school districts to carry the burden which the Constitution and legislative enactments have imposed. Great credit must be given to those stalwart men and women throughout the state who through all these years have taxed themselves, in many cases beyond their ability to pay, in order that the youth of the state might have the advantages which the framers of the Constitution intended they should have. The per - ennial struggle which many of the weaker districts of the state have made to carry on an 1 adequate educational program indicates the zeal and enthusiasm and the sacrifices which parents are willing to make in behalf of an intelligent and enlightened citizenry. Inequality of Opportunity During the past few years there have been increasing evidences that we have failed to recognize the inability of the weaker districts of the state to carry on a reasonable educational program. The Legislature has wisely recog - nized this, to a certain extent, as evidenced by the appropriation during the past few bienniums of one hundred thousand dollars io be used in aiding weak districts. It becomes more and more apparent, however, that this sum ts wholly inadequate and that certain provisions of the law governing aid to weak districts should be changed, so that districts embracing less than twelve sections of land, where geographical boundaries make larger districts impossible, blight receive the benefit of this appropriation. In the report for the biennium ending January 1, 1933, some forty pages were devoted to the inequalities existing between districts in the various counties. Elsewhere in this report will be found a table showing compara - tive valuations and levies in- the ninety-three counties of the state. A study of this table will reveal that in the sandhill region of the state there are dis - tricts having an assessed valuation of as low as twenty-five or thirty thous- </seg>
            <seg id="p009">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION and dollars. These districts, even when they levy the maximum amount per - mitted by law, can scarcely raise enough money to provide school privileges for the children of the district. In other counties in the state there are districts with valuations of close to half a million dollars, where the levy is scarcely more than two mills. Responsibility Cannot Be Localized To expect a district with a valuation of thirty thousand dollars to main - tain an adequate educational program for some thirty children, while another district with a valuation of one-half a million dollars may have but ten pupils to educate, is scarcely reasonable. Educational advantages properly belong to all of the youth of the state, and it is not sound educational theory to hold that a wealthy district has discharged its entire obligation when it pro - vides schooling for the children within its boundaries. It is not at all certain that the child reared in the district where educational advantagss are meager will always remain a resident of the district. If the child because of inade - quate schooling ultimately becomes a charge of the state the state must bear the burden, not the local district A few of the some seven thousand school districts of the state are traversed by main line railroads, transmission lines, pipe lines, and the like, and these districts in many instances can operate with a one mill levy. Districts adjoin - ing these not blessed with railroads and transmission lines must in many in - stances levy the maximum amount permitted by law. These adjoining districts in many cases contribute just as much to the support of the railroads and transmission lines as do the districts which these line traverse. Certainly some means should be found whereby the burden of school support might be more equitably distributed. Elsewhere in this report reference is made to the fact that we spend in the United States approximately a billion and a half dollars to care for five hundred thousand prisoners, an amount within some two hundred million dollars of the whole amount spent for the education of twenty-six million school children. While this constitutes an eloquent plea for a reasonable edu - , cational program, it is not in any sense the most forceful argument which can be presented. Education and the Taxpayer Just what would the taxpayer find if education should be drastically cur - tailed? Society spends more for war than it does for education. It may be difficult to prove that education in itself, or perhaps we should say the type of education which we have had, will eliminate war. Naturally there are those who insist that the schools have failed because of the misfortunes which have overtaken society within recent years. Perhaps a careful analysis will reveal that the schools can scarcely be charged with the responsibility for all of these misfortunes. Must we not take into account the fact that there have been many evidences that we have a society which has exalted property above </seg>
            <seg id="p010">! REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT I ) . ■ . ( i ' ' human rights. Certain lines of commercial endeavor rather than the school - room have attracted the best minds. Perhaps the schools should not be blamed if the younger generation gives greater heed to the examples of what have been frequently pointed out as our great industrial leaders rather than to the training which they have received at the hands of meagerly paid teachers. Who Would Wreck the Schools? • There are certain groups at the present time who would be perfectly willing to abandon our entire program of education. These same groups' have been clamoring 'since the earliest organization of a public school system that it is not right to tax all the people in order to educate all of the children. May we speculate a bit as to just what would happen if we were to curtail seriously our educational program? Assume that thousands of children are permitted to grow up in ignorance. Inquire as to how many of our great industrial enterprises could continue in the face of a situation where a large portion of the population jis illiterate. We b?lieve that we may safely say that In the first place the 'demand for newspapers, books, and periodicals of all kinds would be reduced in about the same proportion that illiteracy increases. With this reduced demand for newspapers and periodicals would come a reduced demand for all of the products of the great printing industry. Industry de - pends in a large measure upon advertising. To an illiterate advertising would b? meaningless. With decreased demands for advertised products goes a corresponding decrease in employment. The savage on some stray island in the Pacific may be happy with a crude drum, made with rather simple materials which he finds close at hand, but he does not constitute a market for a radio, a grand piano, a cornet, or any other of a hundred or more musical instruments the making of which today employs thousands of people. This same savage may be content to broil a fish over a fire built in a crude fireplace of stones; but the makers of gas ranges, electric stoves, and a thousand and one other modern kitchen appli - ances will not long be kept busy in supplying his demands. Almost every citizen is a taxpayer, and as a taxpayer and a citizen he derives a certain benefit from all of the worthwhile things that are an integral part of our complex social order; and few of these advantages constitute the individual work of any one taxpayer or citizen. Practically all of the things which we prize and upon which we pay taxes would be non-existent if it were not for the fact that we have an established social order. The question that must be answered is whether or not in our judgment this social order which makes wealth possible could exist if it were not for education. In our judgment education can be justified as a creator of social stability. It can be justified as the most valuable adjunct which industry has, and in all probability the! one thing without which industry would cease to exist. Either of these should be sufficient to justify its claim for continued support — yet It has additional claims. There are thousand a and one things which we accept </seg>
            <seg id="p011">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION as a part of our rightful heritage merely because they add to the sum total of thmgs which make life satisfactory and enjoyable and worthwhile. Edu - cation can be justified in our opinion on this basis alone. The ability of the citizens of the state to enjoy music, literature, and all of the kindred arts amply repays all of the expense which an adequate educational program entails. Not long ago a research student at one of our great state universities made a discovery which has made it possible for medical science to almost completely eliminate rickets in children. He was offered a million dollars for his discovery but chose rather to place it in the hands of a medical foun - dation in order that there might be no profit and in order that its benefits might be wide spread and universal. Hundreds of similar instances could be men - tioned. •■'■•■•■ : •■■■■' Educational costs sink into insignificance when measured in terms of the welfare of society. Strange Bed-Fellows Foster Lewis, writing in the December 2, 1932, issue of the Labor Forum made this statement: "One of the strangest spectacles in our land today is the sight of the common man, the poor, the unpossessed, and the unem - ployed joining with the rich and the propertied classes for tax relief. The masses are made to feel that somehow they are to profit hugely by reducing the taxes on the other fellow— and, of course, themselves. "This is illustrated best of all in the fight to reduce school bud - gets and curtail Dublic schools. "The common man is generally ignorant of the fact that the public school is the only real and permament gift which comes to his children from the state. He does not know that free public education is only about 100 years old and that all the progress or place his children may ever have, depends upon the education fur - nished them at a small expense or no expense to him by the state. He does not realize that many heavy taxpayers and groups hold - ing large properties resent educating his children and that they would be glad to avoid this tax and turn his family back toward peasantry and serfdom. He is led to believe that if he can save some $5 to $15 in his yearly tax bill that he U somehow ahead. He is blinded to his own household's welfare and taken In by all the talk about "crushing taxation' until he is ready to help kill the goose that lays the golden eggs for his family's future. 1 1. "And after he has helped kill the goose his advisers from the propertied group will let him sweat for his children's education </seg>
            <seg id="p012">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT while they will send their children to PRIVATE schools which he cannot afford. "Then he will wake up to the realization that he has sold his children's birthright for a mess of pottage and that his advisers of the well-to-do group have secured the larger mess of pottage and he is left with only the memory that he economized— ON HIS OWN CHILDREN. "Truly the Lion and the Lamb, or the Infant and the Adder .' playing together are no more strange than the sight of the com - mon man joining with the rich man to tear down his own school - house and set his own children out of what his fathers got for them by ballots and by the strength of their right arms. Will wonders never cease?" What the Critics Neglect The critics of the schools point to an increase of 300 per cent in school expenses. These critics neglect to tell you: 1 That high school enrollment in the United States has increased since 1900 from 519.000 to 5.460.000 in 1934. That is an increase of 1.052 per cent. 2. That elementary school enrollments have increased from 15.000,000 in 1900 to 21.000.000 in 1934. an increase of 40 per cent 3. That Ihe purchasing value of the dollar has decreased 48 per cent since 1914. 4. That children employed in gainful occupations decreased 75 per cent between 1910 and 1930. These unemployed children are now in school. 5 That 100 of the 140 NRA codes prohibit the employment of children under' 18 years of age. These children also turn to the schools for more education. 6. That in recent years thousands of adults have called upon the schools for courses in vocational and leisure-time subjects. 7. That according to the national survey. 2.280.000 children are deprived of all educational opportunities. 8 That jit costs in the neighborhood of $90 a year to keep a child in school in prosperous times: it costs approximately $300 to keep a persor i in prison for a lyear. In the United States we are spending a billion and a halt dollars each year to care for 500.000 prisoners. We are spending only 200 million more than that for the education of 26.000.000 school children. Which is the better expenditure? 9 That a constructive program must be developed for 3.000.000 young people between 18 and 20 years of age. who are out of school and out of </seg>

No civilization can cut off its growth and live. 10. That in the Panic of 1837 the schools were not made to suffer. On the contrary, the panic gave birth to a period known in American history as the Revival of Education. paired' """* '" *"** ° f 1857 Ae SUPP ° Tt °* ** Schoob conUnued «"&gt;»•" - 12. That in the Panic of 1873 in 29 states the average increase in school support from 1873 to 1879 increased 53% despite the distressing financial situa - tion in 1873. 13 That in the Depression of 1893, 1907. and 1922 school support during each of these critical times continued unmolested and in fact even increased Up until the present depression the people of the country recognized that the best asset of a nation is trained intelligence. 14. That in general, the American people still believe, individually and collectively, in the need of education for the masses. A small but powerful group of selfish individuals have, however, made a direct attack upon the schools, and thus far they have been startlingly successful. Only an awakened public opinion will save the basic institution of our American democracy. 15. That Senator Copelands committee has shown that the cost of crime in the United States is almost 13 billion dollars annually. The surest method of meeting crime is not less, but more education. Newton D. Baker says in a statement made June. 1931: "Ever since I was a child I have been meeting public problems. . .to come finally to the conclusion. . .always that education furnishes the only solu - tion. . . . All the problems that arise— problems requiring either a n:w approach to: an old evil, or a new remedy for an evil that has taken a new form in the changing kaleidoscope of social development —all these have only one answer. That answer is education." The Nebraska Situation Turning to the situation in Nebraska, let us call your attention to some important facts indicative of the development of Nebraska^ program of public education. 1 Enrollments in the elementary -and secondary schools in Nebraska have greatly increased. In the graded schools the enrollments have grown from 123,805 in 1903 to 194.401 in 1933. or 57 per cent 2. High school enrollment during the same period has grown from 17,165 to more than 70.000 at present— an increase of more than 300 per cent. </seg>
            <seg id="p014">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 3. The number of graduates from 4-year high schools has increased ap - proximately 425 per cent. In 1903 there were 2,648 graduates, and in 1933 a f sw less than 14.000. This number is almost equal to the entire high school enrollment in 1903. i. Over 15 000 eighth grade graduates enter our town and city high schools every yi:ar. 5. Nebraska leads in the teaching of scientific temperance. During our administration, two complete bulletins dealing with the harmful effects of alcohol and narcotics have been published and placed in every school in the state. 6. Nebraska has inaugurated a character education program that is being carefully observed by every state in the union. The plan used in Nebraska is already being used in several other states. The Issue Must be Met The people of Nebraska either want an adequate educational program or they do not want it. There is ample evidence to show that school board mem - bers and patrons throughout the state have been ready and anxious to effect every possible economy in the maintenance of their schools. A report given out by the Tax Commissioner's office shows that the total tax reductions in county, city and town, or local areas, the schools have been taking the brunt — 56 per cent or more than one-half of the reductions in government tax costs. Further reductions cannot be made if the schools are to continue to function. In view of the greatly reduced school budgets now available in the various school dis - tricts of the state we desire to state in all sincerity that should the time come when we definitely set out to further curtail school expenditures drastically, just then we as a state and a nation start a downward plunge toward ob - livion. . Every citizen in Nebraska who is definitely interested in the cause of education owes a great deal of gratitude for the fine cooperation which has been accorded to all of the educational agencies by such organizations as the Parent-Teacher Associations, the Federation of Women's Clubs, the American Legion and the American Legion Auxiliary,' the Federation of Labor, the Grange, the Farmer's Union, the various church organizations, and other simi - lar groups. Rural Education Teachers in the rural schools have been alert to their great opportunity and have cooperated with their respective county superintendents in carrying forward the educational program for the rural schools of the state. The rural school achievements as given by the Division of Rural Education in this report bespeak an enthusiasm, a sincere interest and understanding, and willingness on the part of the teachers to put forth every effort in behalf of the educational interests of the boys and girls in the rural schools of Nebraska.

            <seg id="p020">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Rural Parent'Teacher Associations If our hypothesis, that the standard of the American school is based upon and has grown out of public opinion, has any merit, then the best way to im - prove schools is to cultivate, promote, and vitalize public opinion relative to the schools in any particular community. The rural school is no exception to this principle. It is the judgment of this department that the organization of rural Parent-Teacher Associations, officered and manned by the rural people them - selves, is the proper place to begin work for the betterment of the rural schools, in so far as they need betterment. We often hear of "the rural school prob - lem." It is to be doubted whether or not there is any one rural school problem separate and apart from other school problems. :Here, again, we have the in - feriority complex at work. Proper st mulation of public opinion related to rural schools within the rural districts themselves will ultimately prove the solution of whatever rural school problem may exist. This is the procedure that has always worked in the city schools, and there is no reason why it will not work with equal suc - cess in the rural districts. During the present biennium the department has done everything it could in cooperating with the state and national group of parents and teachers to promote rural Parent-Teacher Association work. A specific report of this phase will be found later on in the section of this report devoted to the Divi - sion of Rural Education. It is our belief that the schools of any community will rise no h gher than' the public opinion of the community demands. Scientific Temperance Instruction Section 79-1409 of the Nebraska Statutes provides as follows: "Provision shall be made by the proper local school authorities .for instructing the pupils in all schools supported by public money, or under state control, in physiology and hygiene with special reference to the ef - fects of alcoholic drinks and other stimulants and narcotics up the human system. ' In connection with the foregoing section of the law, the office has felt that it was charged with a very definite responsibility. Some eight years ago there was published a rather complete normal training bulletin dealing with physiology and hygiene, which bulletin contained a great deal of material dealing with the teaching of the harmful effects of alcoholic drinks and other stimulants and narcotics upon the human system. I ■.■!'••■■ This office has been happy to accept the responsibility which the fore - going statutory provision imposes, and we have no apology to offer for the very definite program which has been carried on in practically all of the schools of the state. Believing in the importance of properly training teachers so that they may present scientific temperance instruction, this office issued a revised bulletin in </seg>
            <seg id="p021">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION July 1933. The new bulletin which was designed for use in normal training classes is predicated on the belief that the best motive that can be used for the pupils is a health motive. In this later bulletin our best .efforts are put forth in order to interpret the needs of the schools for scientific instruction. The whole plan of scientific temperance instruction as embodied in the bulletin seeks to approach the sub - ject on the basis of common sense. Character Education Section 79-2131 and 79-2132. Compiled Statutes of 1929 read as follows: Section I. "It shall be the duty of each and every teacher employed to give instruction in the regular course of the first twelve grades of any public, private, parochial or denominational school in the State of Ne - braska to so arrange and present his or her instruction as to give special emphasis to common honesty, morality, courtesy, obedience to law, re - spect for the national flag, the Constitution of the United States and Constitution of the State of Nebraska, respect for parents and the home, the dignity and necessity of honest labor and other lessons of a steadying influence, which tend to promote and develop an upright and desirable citizenry." Section II. "For the purpose of this act the State Superintendent of Public Instruction shall prepare by September 1, 1927. an outline with suggestions such as in his judgment will best accomplish the purpose set forth in Section one, and shall incorporate the same in the regular course of study for the first twelve grades of all schools of the State of Ne - braska." I Complying with the definite mandate of the Legislature as expressed in the foregoing sections, this office inaugurated in Nebraska a character education program which has been closely observed by practically every other state in the union. As a matter of fact, a number of states are at the present time using very much the same plan which has been used so successfully in Nebraska. There may be those who would be inclined to question the statement that the program has been successful. There are experts in the field of education who insist that no program can be called successful until you have accurate scientific data to substantiate your claim. Some of these experts would insist that it would take years of careful research to clearly determine whether or not anything worthwhile has been accomplished under the character education pro - gram in Nebraska. To these our answer is: First, we recognize that character is something rather intangible, it is hard to define. It cannot be put into a test tube and analyzed. The real merit of any plan for improved conduct development can never be known in all of its variations and implications. This office is willing to accept the valuation of the program made by sev - eral thousand fathers and mothers whose children have attended schools where </seg>

            <seg id="p023"/>
            <seg id="p024">I REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT the plan was given emphasis. The great majority of these fathers and mothers have expressed the opinion that the program has and is actually functioning in the everyday iives of their children. And while there may be experts who in - sist that the opinion of these parents is not scientific and cannot be accepted as final, this office has too great an appreciation for the intelligence and com - mon sense of (Nebraska fathers and mothers to permit rating lightly their ex - pressed opinions. Normal Training Some twtnty-seven years ago Nebraska launched a rather unique teacher training program which was designated high school normal training. It is prob - ably safe to say that 90% of the rural school teachers, during this twenty-seven year period, received their preliminary preparation for teaching in the normal training high schools. Many of the present day leaders in education in Nebraska are graduates] of these high schools. The normal training high school is one institution which definitely concentrates its whole effort in the matter of pre - paring teachers for rural school service. The graduate of a normal training high school definitely plans throughout his high school course to teach in a rural school. He goes into this work with - out any feeling of inferiority and without any feeling that the position is not entirely commensurate with his ability. In other words, he is happy in his situation because it is the specific work for which he has been trained. The normal training program must be continued until such a time as economic conditions will permit the payment of higher salaries to rural teachers, so that those who are to enter this field of education may be assured sufficient remuneration to justify a more expensive training course in a teacher training institution of higher rank. It is not a question of high school normal training versus college training for the rural teacher so much as it is a question of high school normal training versus no training at all. A glance at the table appearing on another page showing the certificates issued by the four state teachers colleges indicates that there were but 27 ele - mentary rural certificates, no advanced rural certificates and no professional rural certificates issued by these institutions. It is clearly apparent that the time has not: yet come for abandoning normal training. Adult Immigration Education The Legislature of 1927 set up in the State Department of Education the Division of Adult Immigrant Education. The law was enacted in response to an insistent demand which grew out of the world war. For six years this division carried on a' very definite program of Americanization in this state. The results clearly justified those who sponsored the law. The work that was accomplished represented a definite achievement in view of the limited funds available for this work. </seg>
            <seg id="p025">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION At the present time a great deal could be accomplished if in our Depart - ment we had a State Supervisor of Adult Education who could cooperate with the Supervisor furnished by the Federal Relief Administration. The coopera - tion of the groups which the Adult Immigrant Division seeks to serve is worthy of the highest praise and commendation, but it must be obvious that skillful direction must be furnished in the preliminary organization of the classes. We sincerely hope that the Legislature will find it possible to make avail - able sufficient funds to at least maintain a skeleton of an organization. Dignity and Democracy of Labor No nation can hope to become great on a diet of luxury and idleness. Children are not educated with the thought that they may thus avoid work, but upon the theory that they may be better prepared for useful work. If a democracy such as our is to survive, the whole mass of people must be trained for useful work and service to the social group as a whole. Few who have received the benefits provided under the Federal Relief set - up enjoy idleness. The plea of those who have called at this office seeking relief under the Emergency Educational Program has been for employment rather than relief. The normal man or woman knows that growth comes through activity, not idleness, and in all of the courses of study and printed material which this office distributes to the various school districts of the state we shall keep in mind a philosophy based upon the gospel of work for every - body, with reasonably high standards of living, in the hope that every person within the state may have an opportunity for a busy, useful life, the only sort of a life through which he can make a worthwhile contribution to society. Church Schools i Nebraska is greatly indebted to the many fine denominational colleges and the parochial schools for the service which they have rendered to the cause of education. The State Department of Education desires to acknowledge the splendid cooperation of the various church organizations sponsoring these schools. The church must be recognized as one of the greatest character build - ing agencies which we have, and the devotion which these organizations have shown for education merits our highest commendation. . Physical Education Chapter 79, Section 2113, School laws of 1929 provides that: ■ "It shall be the duty of every teacher engaged in teaching in the schools of the state, separately and carefully, to test and examine every child under his jurisdiction, except as herein provided, to ascertain if such child is suffering from defective sight or hearing or diseased teeth, or breathes through his mouth . . . ." </seg>
            <seg id="p026">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT If it is worthwhile to have our school children examined in order to dis - cover their physical defects it would seem reasonable that we make every possible effort to set up a program of physical education so that they may be kept healthy and free from physical defects. This office has made available to all of the normal training classes in the state and to rural teachers a bulletin which deals with the subject of physical education and health. State Institutions of Higher Learning The University of Nebraska has, over a long period of years, been recog - nized as one of the outstanding educational institutions in the entire conntry. It is difficult to place a proper estimate upon the value of the service which it has rendered in training leaders in almost every field of endeavor. Graduates of this institution may be found in positions of leadership in almost every section of the United States and in foreign countries. Any steps that would curtail the sphere of influence which the university now exerts would constitute false economy. ■ The four state teachers" colleges at Chadron, Kearney, Peru and Wayne arc recognized as outstanding in their particular field. Thousands of young men and young women have been enabled to advance in their chosen profes - sions because! of these schools so located as to serve four distinct regions of the state. These schools are to be commended for the courage shown by their leaders and the sacrifices which faculty members have been willing to make during these trying times. It is to be hoped that they may be permitted to con - tinue their splendid record of service. There can be but little doubt that the best interests of the state, as a whole, would be served if all of the state's institutions of higher learning could be placed undertone governing board. Such a plan has been tried in other states with success. 1 Such a plan would permit the setting up of a program which would avoid the present overlapping of work carried on in the present institu - tions. Such a plan would permit the setting up at one institution of an outstand - ing program for the training of primary teachers, another institution could be recognized as outstanding in the field of training high school teachers, etc. Pos - sibly the time has not yet come for putting such a plan into operation. Aid under the Mallcry Act (Section 79-810, 79-2409) In 1921-23, the Nebraska Legislature appropriated $75,000 for Aid to Weak Districts, that is, rural elementary schools, and $30,000 for the Mallery Act schools. The next Legislature included these two appropriations under one heading and increased the amounts to a total of $110,000, in one item. This appropriation, as Aid to Weak School Districts, was really a misnomer. The weak rural districts in the sandhill region present one kind of problem, and the </seg>
            <seg id="p027">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Mallery Act schools another. The desire of the state to encourage the teach - ing of vocational subjects, such as home economics, agricultural work, commer - cial, and manual training, in consolidated rural schools and rural high schools, as provided for under the Mallery Act, is quite another sort of educational problem. From the legislative session of 1923 to the present time, one appro - priation. Aid to Schools, has been made, seemingly to fill the requirements of the distribution of funds under the law providing for State Aid to Weak Dis - tricts, and also under the Mallery Act. As a matter of fact, the wording of the law is such that the Attorney General has advised us to spend all of that ap - propriation for Aid to Weak School Districts, so long as it was demanded for such schools, with the idea of dividing what might be left among the schools qualifying under the Mallery Act. The year 1927 was the last year, until 1933, in which there were any funds available for distribution to Mallery Act schools! For the past two or three years the demands on the appropriated funds for State Aid to Weak Districts, as such, have not been so great, for one major reason: current school expenditures, both miscellaneous and for teachers' sal - aries, have been decreased to such a low level that the difference between esti - mated available funds on hand or to be raised, and estimated funds to be ex - pended, is less than ever before for the individual district. This difference be - tween the two estimated figures, at the beginning of the school year, is the amount applied for as state aid, and as a result the total amounts due counties have been lowered. In 1933 the first distribution of funds to Mallery Act schools was made since 1927 when only 9 per cent of the funds to which Mallery Act schools were entitled was available. In March, 1933, only V/ 2 per cent of the funds to which Mallery Act schools were entitled for expenditure through the year 1932 was available. In February. 1934. 60H per cent of the funds to which Mallery Act schools were entitled for expenditures through the year 1933 was distributed to the schools, due to the lowered demand on the funds for aid to weak districts. In the opinion of this department, the state has a moral obligation, either to appropriate money for these Mallery Act schools or to repeal the law. These schools have made the capital outlay investment as required by Sections 79-810 and 79-2409, and have spent other moneys in good faith, expecting to receive the reimbursement from the state, as the Statutes promised them. This depart - ment feels that normally $100,000 Will be used biennially for State Aid to Weak Rural Districts, and between $50,000 and $70,000. biennially, for rural consolidated and rural high schools qualifying under the Mallery Act. </seg>

A COMPILATION OF MEMORABLE UTTERANCES On Agriculture Education Public Health Rural Schools Military Academy Navy Academy;' and A National University From MESSAGES OF THE PRESIDENTS And From Other American Statesmen Education is the Chief Defense of Nations — Edmund Burke. </seg>
            <seg id="p035">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION To the Congress of the United States: Permit me to call your attention to some of the Memorable Utterances of our most distinguished Presidents of the United States on the following questions as compiled from the "Messages of the President": Agriculture, Edu - cation. Commerce. Manufactures, Public Health, Good Roads, State Canals, Rivers and Harbors, Military Academy, Navy Academy, and a National Uni - versity, and utterances from other American statesmen. GEORGE WASHINGTON. (First Annual Address from "Messages of the Presidents", Volume I, Page 66.) The advancement of agriculture, commerce, and manufactures by all proper means will not, I trust, need recommendations, but I cannot forbear intimating to you the expediency of giving effectual encouragement as well to the introduction of new and useful inventions from abroad as to the exer - tions of skill and genius in producing them at home, and of facilitating the intercourse between the distant parts of our country by a due attention to the post-offices and post roads. Nor am I less persuaded that you will agree with me in opinion that there is nothing which can better deserve your patronage than the promotion of science and literature. Knowledge is in every country the surest basis of public happiness. In one in which the measure of government receive their impressions so immediately from the sense of the community as in ours it is proportionally essential. To the security of a free constitution it contri - butes in various ways,— by convincing those who are intrusted with the public administration that every valuable end of government Is best answered by the enlightened confidence of the people, and by teaching the people them - selves to know and to value their own rights; to discern and provide against invasions of them; to distinguish between oppression and the necessary exer - cise of lawful authority; between burthens proceeding from a disregard to their convenience and those resulting from the inevitable exigencies of society; to discriminate the spirit of liberty from that of licentiousness— cherishing the first, avoiding the last — and uniting a speedy but temperate vigilance against encroachments, with an inviolable respect to the laws. Whether this desirable object will be best promoted by affording aids to seminaries of learning already established, by the institution of a national university, or by any other expedients will be well worthy of a place in the deliberations of the Legislature. GEORGE WASHINGTON (Eighth Annual Address from "Messages of the Presidents'. Volume I. Pages 202-203.) </seg>
            <seg id="p036">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT I have heretofore proposed to the consideration of Congress the expe - diency of establishing a national university and also a military academy. The desirableness of both these institutions has so constantly increased with every new view I have taken of the subject that I cannot omit the opportunity of once for all recalling your attention to them. The assembly to which I address myself is too enlightened not to be fully sensible how much a flourishing state of the arts and sciences contribute to national prosperity and reputation. True it is that our country, much to its honor, contains many seminaries of learning highly respectable and useful; but the funds upon which they rest are too narrow to command the ablest professors in the different departments of liberal knowledge for the institution contemplated, though they would be excellent auxiliaries. i Amongst the motives to such an institution, the assimilation of the prin - ciples, opinions, and manners of our countrymen by the common education of a portion of our youth from every quarter well deserves attention. The more homogeneous our citizens can be made in these particulars the greater will be our prospect of permanent union; and a primary object of such a national institution should be the education of our youth in the science of government. In a republic what species of knowledge can be equally important and what duty more pressing on its legislature than to patronize a plan for communi - cating it to those who are to be the future guardians of the liberties of the country? .' The institution of a military academy is also recommended by cogent reasons. However pacific the general policy of a nation may be, it oiight never to be without an adequate stock of military knowledge for emergencies. The first would impair the energy of its character, and both would hazard its safety or expose it to greater evils when war could not be avoided; besides that, war might often not depend upon its own choice. In proportion as the observance of pacific maxims might exempt a nation from the necessity of practicing the rules of the military art ought to be its care in preserving and transmitting,! v P ro P er establishment, and knowledge of that art. Whatever arguments may be drawn from particular examples superficially viewed a thorough examination of the subject will evince that the art of war Is at once comprehensive and complicated, that it demands much previous study, and that the possession of it in its most improved and perfect state is always of great moment to the security of a nation. This, therefore, ought to be a seri - ous care of every government, and for this purpose an academy where a regu - lar course qi instruction is given is an obvious expedient which different na - tions have successfully employed. JOHN ADAMS (Second Annual Address from "Messages of the Presidents", </seg>
            <seg id="p037">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Volume I. Page 271.) t r^ W , hilC o With reverence and "-esignaHon we contemplate the dispensations of Divine Providence in the alarming and destructive pestilence with which several of our cities and towns have been visited, there is cause for gratitude and mutual congratulations that the malady has disappeared and that we are again permitted to assemble in safety at the seat of Government for the dis - charge of our important duties. But when we reflect that this fatal disorder has within a few years made repeated ravages in some of our principal sea - ports, and with increased malignancy, and when we consider the magnitude of the evils arising from the interruption of public and private business, whereby the national interests are deeply affected, I think it my duty to invite the Legislature of the Union to examine the expediency of establishing suitable regulations in aid of the health laws of the respective States; for those being formed on the idea that contagious sickness may be communicated through chan - nels of commerce, there seems to be a necessity that Congress, who alone can regulate trade, should frame a system which, while it may tend to pre - serve the general health, may be compatible with the interests of commerce and the safety of the revenue. THOMAS JEFFERSON (Sixth Annual Message from "Messages of the Presidents". ' Volume I, Pages 409-410.) Education is here place among the articles of public care, not that it would be proposed to take its ordinary branches out of the hands of private enter - prise, which manages so much better all the concerns to which it is equal, but a public institution can alone supply those sciences which though rarely called for are yet necessary to complete the circle, all the parts of which contribute to the improvement of the country and some of them to its preser - vation. The subject is now proposed for the consideration of Congress be - cause if approved by the time the State legislatures shall have deliberated on this extension of the Federal trusts, and the laws shall be passed and other arrangements made for their execution, the necessary funds will be on hand and without employment. The present consideration of a national establishment for education parti - cularly is rendered proper by this circumstance also, that if Congress approv - ing the proposition. I shall yet think it more eligible to found it on a donation of lands, they have! it now in their power to endow it with those which will be among the earliest to produce the necessary income. This foundation would have the advantage of being independent of war. which may suspend other improvements by requiring for its own purposes the resources destined for them. </seg>
            <seg id="p038">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT JOHN QU1NCY ADAMS (First Annual Message from "Messages of the Presidents." Volume II, Pages 309-310.) Among the first, perhaps the very first, instrument for the improvement of the condition of men is knowledge, and to the acquisition of much of the knowledge adapted to the wants, the comforts, and the enjoyments of human lite public institutions and seminaries of learning are essential. So convinced of this was the first of my predecessors in this office, now first in the memory, as, living, he was the first in the hearts, of our countrymen, that once and again in his addresses to the Congresses with whom he cooperated in the public serv - ice he earnestly recommended the establishment of seminaries of learning, to prepare for all the emergencies of peace and war — a national university and a military academy. With respect to the latter, had he lived to the present day, in turning his eyes to the institution at West Point he would have enjoyed the gratification of his most earnest wishes; but in surveying the city which has been honored with his name he would have seen the spot of earth which he had destined and bequeathed to the use and benefit of his country as the site for an university still bare and barren. ULYSSES S. GRANT (Third Annual Message from "Messages of the Presidents," Volume VII, Page 152.) • Educational interest may well be served by the grant of the proceeds of the sale of public lands to settlers. I dd not wish to be understood as recom - mending in the least degree a^euTtaUment of what is being done by the Gen - eral Government for the encouragement of education. ULYSSES S. GRANT (Fourth Annual Message from "Messages of the Presidents," Volume VH. Page 203.) The rapidly increasing interest in education is a most encouraging feature in the current history of the country, and it is no doubt true that this is due in a great measure to the efforts of the Bureau of Education. That office is continually receiving evidences, which abundantly prove its efficiency, from the various institutions of learning and educators of all kinds throughout the country. The report of the Commissioner contains a vast amount of educational details of great interest. The bill now pending before Congress, providing for the appropriation of the net proceeds of the sales of public lands for cdu - catinal purposes, to aid the States in the general education of their rising </seg>
            <seg id="p039">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION generation, is a measure of such great importance to our real progress and is so unanimously approved by the leading friends of education that I commend it to the favorable attention of Congress. RUTHERFORD B. HAYES (Second Annual Message from "Messages of the Presidents." Volume VII. Page 506.) The report of the Commissioner of the Bureau of Education shows very gratifying progress throughout the country in all the interests committed to the care of this important office. The report is especially encouraging with respect to the extension of the advantages of the common-school system in sections of the country where the general enjoyment of the privilege of free schools is not yet attained. To education more than to any other agency we are to look as the resource for the advancement of the people in the requisite knowledge and appreciation of their rights and responsibilities as citizens, and I desire to repeat the suggestion contained in my former message in behalf of the enactment of appropriate measures by Congress for the purpose of supplementing with na - tional aid the local systems of education in the several States. Adequate acccmodations for the great library, which is overgrowing the capacity of the rooms now occupied at th; Capitol, should be provided with - out further delay. This invaluable collection of books, manuscripts, and illus - trative art has grown to such proportions, in connection with the copyright system of the country, as to demand the prompt and careful attention of Con - gress to save it from injury in its present crowded and insufficient quarters. As this library is national in its character, and must from the nature of the case increase even more rapidly in the future than in the past, it cannot oe doubted that the people will sanction any wise expenditure to preserve it and to enlarge its usefulness. RUTHERFORD B. HAYES (Third Annual Message from "Messages of the Presidents," Volume VII, Page 579.) It is gratifying to learn from the Bureau of Education the extent to which educational privileges throughout the United States have advanced during the year. No more fundamental responsibility rests upon Congress than that of devising appropriate measures of financial aid to education, supplemental to local action in the States and Territories and in the District of Columbia. The wise forethought of the founders of our Government has not only furnished the basis for the support of the common school systems of the newer States but laid the foundations for the maintenance of their universities and colleges </seg>
            <seg id="p040">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT of agriculture and the mechanic arts. Measures in accordance with this tra - ditional policy, for the further benefit of all these interests and the extension of the same advantages to every portion of the country, it is hoped will receive your favorable consideration. To preserve and perpetuate the national literature should be among the foremost cares of the National Legislature. The .library gathered at the Capi - tol still remains unprovided with any suitable accomodations for its rapidly increasing stores. The magnitude and importance of the collection, increased as it is by the deposits made under the law of copyright, by domestic and foreign exchanges, and by the scientific library of the Smithsonian Institution, call for building accommodations which shall be at once adequate and fireproof. The location of such a public building, which should provide for the pressing necessities of the present and for the vast increase of the nation's books in the future, is a matter which addresses itself to the discretion of Congress. It is earnestly recommendad as a measure which should unite all suffrages and which should no longer be delayed. RUTHERFORD B. HAYES (Fourth Annual Message from "Messages of the Presidents," Volume VII. Pages 602-603.) It is not, i however, to be forgotten that the best and surest guaranty of the primary rights of citizenship is to be found in that capacity for self-protec - tion which can belong only to a people whose right to universal suffrage is supported by universal education. The means at the command of the local and State authorities are in many cases wholly inadequate to furnish free in - struction to all who need it. This is especially true where before emancipation the education! of the people was neglected or prevented, in the interest of slavery. Firmly convinced that the subject of popular education deserves the earnest attention of the people of the whole country, with a view to wise and comprehensive action by the Government of the United States, I respectfully recommend that Congress, by suitable legislation and with proper safeguards, supplement the local educational funds in the several States where the grave duties and responsibilities of citizenship have been devolved on uneducated people by devoting to the purpose grants of the public lands and, if necessary, by appropriations from the Treasury of the United States. Whatever Govern - ment can fairly do to promote free popular education ought to be done. Wher - ever general 'education is found, peace, virtue, and social order prevail and civil and religious liberty are secure. RUTHERFORD B. HAYES (Foirth Annual Message from "Messages of the Presidents", Volume VII, Page 626-627.) The Commissioner of Education reports a continued Increase of public </seg>
            <seg id="p041">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION interest in educational affairs, and that the public schools generally throughout the country are well sustained. Industrial training is attracting deserved at - tention and colleges for instruction, theoretical and practical, in agriculture and mechanic arts, including the Government schools recently established for the instruction of Indian youth, are gaining steadily in public estimation. The Commissioner asks special attention to the depredations committed on the lands reserved for the future support of public instruction, and to the very great need of help from the nation for schools in the territories and in the Southern States. The recommendation heretofore made is repeated and urged, that an educational fund be set apart from the net proceeds of the sales of the public lands annually, the income of which and the remainder of the net annual proceeds to be distributed on some satisfactory plan to the States and the Territories and the District of Columbia. The success of the public schools of the District of Columbia, and the progress made, under the intelligent direction of the board of education and the superintendent, in supplying the educational requirements of the District with thoroughly trained and efficient teachers, is very gratifying. The Acts of Congress, from time to time, donating public lands to the several States and Territories in aid to educational interests have proved to be wise measures of public policy, resulting in great and lasting benefit. It would seem to be a matter of simple justice to extend the benefits of this legislation, the wisdom of which has been so fully vindicated by experience, to the District of Col - umbia. CHESTER A. ARTHUR (First Annual Message from "Messages of the Presidents", Volume VIII, Page 58.) A large portion of the public domain has been from time to time devoted to the promotion of education. There is now a special reason why, by setting apart the proceeds of its sales of public lands or by some other course, the Government should 'aid the work of education. Many who now exercise the right of suffrage are unable to read the ballot which they cast. Upon many who had just emerged from a condition of slavery were suddenly devolved the respnsibilities of citizenship in that portion of the country most impov - erished by war. I have been pleased to learn from the report of the Com - missioner of Education that there has lately been a commendable increase of interest and effort for their instruction; but all that can be done by local legislation and private generosity should be supplemented by such aid as can be constitutionally afforded by the National Government. I would suggest! that if any fund be dedicated to this purpose it may be wisely distributed in the different states according to the ratio of illiteracy, as by this means those localities which are most in need of such assistance will reap its special benefits. </seg>
            <seg id="p042">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT CHESTER A. ARTHUR (Th rd Annual Message from "Messages of the Presidents", Volume VIII, Page 184.) I have previously referred to the alarming state of illiteracy in certain portions of the country, and again submit for the consideration of Congress whether some Federal aid should not be extended to public primary education wherever adequate provision therefore has not already been made. BENJAMIN HARRISON (First Annual Message from "Messages of the Presidents", Volume IX. Pages 54-55.) The interest of the General Government in the education of the people found an early expression, not only in the thoughtful and sometimes warning utterances of jour ablest statesmen, but in liberal appropriations from the common resources for, the support of education in the new States. No one will deny that it is of gravest national concern that those who hold the ultimate of control of all public affairs should have the necessary intelligence wisely to direct and determine them. National aid to education has heretofore taken the form of land grants, and in that form the constitutional power of Congress to pro - mote the education of the people is not seriously questioned when the form is changed to that of a direct grant of money from the public Treasury. Such aid should be, as it always has been, suggested by some exceptional conditions. [The sudden emancipation of the slaves of the South, the bestowal of the suffrage which soon followed, and the impairment of the ability of the States where these new citizens were chiefly found to adequately provide edu - cational facilities presented not only exceptional but unexampled conditions. That the situation has been much ameliorated there is no doubt. The ability and interest of the States have happily increased. But a great work remains to be done, and I think the General Govern - ment should lend its aid. As the suggestion of a national grant in aid of education grows chiefly out of the condition and needs of the emancipated slave and his descendants, the relief should as far as possible, while necessarily proceeding upon some general lines, be applied to the need that suggested it. It is essential, if much good is to be accomplished, that the sympathy and ' active interest of the people of the States should be enlisted, and that the methods adopted should be such as to stimulate and not to supplant local taxation for school purposes. ABRAHAM LINCOLN (Abraham Lincoln sealed his faith in Federal aid for public education by signing the Land-grant College Act, three years after it had been vetoed by James Buchanan.) </seg>
            <seg id="p043">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION We have purposely placed Abraham Lincoln out of the chronological order in the list of Presidents named for the reason that the great work he did in signing the Land-grant College Act still lives and is functioning better today than any time since it became a law. He actions speak louder than his words notwithstanding his matchless power of speech. You could no more do away with these college than you could stop the sun in its course. We now have fifty land-grant colleges well established with great facul - ties and thousands of students. We have twenty-four state universities in each of which there is one land-grant college, and twenty-six separate land - grant colleges with practically every state sharing in their wholesome contri - butions to the welfare of our people. These institutions are training their students in scientific agriculture, mechanic arts, and home economics. WOODROW WILSON (Woodrow Wilson, like Abraham Lincoln, sealed his faith in Federal aid for public education by signing the Agricultural Extension Act, under which we have our county agent and home-demonstration agent; by signing the Smith-Hughes Act and Rehabilitation Act.) As in the case of Abraham Lincoln, and for the same reason, Woodrow Wilson is placed out of chronological order in the list of Presidents we have named because of what he did. Woodrow Wilson signed the Smith-Lever Act providing for our county agents and county home-demonstration agents in 19H. There arc now two thousand, three-hundred twelve county agents with two-hundred twenty-two assistant county agents, and one-thousand one - hundred seventy-six county home-demonstration agents with thirty-five assis - tant county home-demonstration agents. In most states the county agent and the county home-demonstration agent direct the work of the 4-H Club boys and girls. The total number of boys and girls now in the 4-H Club work is approaching a million in number. Under these three acts signed by Woodrow Wilson, appropriating from first to last many millions of dollars, educating millions of the youth of the land, restoring to health and strength thousands of soldiers, caring for the comforts of many thousands more in the Federal hospitals, and giving thousands of boys and 'girls, men and women, such physical rehabilitation as to fit them to earning their own living. WILLIAM McKINLEY (When Governor of Ohio) An open schoolhouse, free to all, evidences the highest type of advanced civilization. It is the gateway to progress, prosperity, and honor, and the best security for the liberties and independence of the people.

It is better than garrisons and guns, than forts and fleets. An educated people, governed by true moral principle, can never take a backward step, nor be dispossessed of their citizenship and liberties. BENJAMIN H. HILL ! ■ (Speaking at the University of Georgia soon after the war between the states.) Education is the one subject for which no people ever yet paid too much. Indeed, the more they pay, the richer they become. Nothing is so costly as ignorance, and nothing so cheap as knowledge. Even under the old civiliza - tion, the states and people who provided the greatest educational opportuni - ties were always the most wealthy, the most powerful, the most feared and respected by others, and the most secure in every right of person and property among themselves. And this truth will be tenfold more manifest in the future than it has been in the past. J. STERLING MORTON (Speaking at the University of Nebraska over a third of a century ago in his Immortal Plea for Professionally Trained Teachers, as vital today as when uttered by him. According to Washington, it takes money to hold such teachers in the work. Hence, he argued for Federal Aid public education.) We call no uneducated quack or chlarlatan to perform surgery upon the able character and well-tested abilities. We demand from our legislature laws raising the standard of the profession and exalting the office of the teacher. As the doctor of medicine or the practitioner at law is only admitted within the pale of his calling upon the production of his parchment or certificates, so the applicant for the position of instructor in our primary and other schools should be required by law to first produce his diploma, his authority to teach, from the normal schools. We call no uneducated quack or charlatan to perform surgery upon the bodies of our children, lest they may be deformed, crippled and maimed physi - cally all their lives. Let us take equal care that we intrust the development of the mental faculties to skilled instructors of magnanimous character that the mentalities of our children may not be mutilated, deformed and crippled, to halt the limp through all the centuries of their .never-ending lives. The de - formed body will die, and be forever put out of sight under the ground, but a mind made monstrous by bad teaching dies, not, but stalks forever among the ages, an immortal mockery of the divine image. WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN (Fron Speech on Education, as taken from "Heart to Heart Appeals", Pages 151-152.) </seg>
            <seg id="p045">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Universal education is our national aim — an open school door before every child born in the land, and all encouraged to make the largest possible use of the opportunities furnished. In this day of increasing education the father who denies to his son the advantage of the schools, and sends him out half educated to compete with boys well educated, is more cruel than the father who would cut off a son's arm. Loss of an arm is not nearly so great a handicap as lack of an education. A single brick is a useless thing, but many brick joined together by mortar make a wall, and a wall is of great value. So one lesson seems of little im - portance, but many lessons, joined together, make an education, and an edu - cation is priceless. And, as one brick taken out of a wall leaves an ugly hole, so one lesson missed mars the beauty and strength of education. The boy who drops out of school under the delusion that the money he can earn will be worth more to him than an education, makes a fatal mistake. As the wood chopper can afford to stop chopping long enough to keep his axe sharp, so the student can afford to postpone money earning long enough to complete his education. The difference between meeting life's' problems with a trained mind and a dull mind is even greater than the difference between chopping wood with a sharp axe and a dull one. JOHN A. LOGAN (When United States Senator from Illinois.) Let every child of the nation be sent to a good school, and trained by a proper method in broad, national ideas, and we never need fear either foreign aggression and domination, or domestic insurrection and sectional strifes and jealousies. Strength, peace, harmony, prosperity, nobility of character, pa - triotism, virtue, and happiness, would flow from a perennial spring in the mountains, to fill the land forever. THOMAS NIXON CARVER (Professor of Political Economics of Harvard University from "World's Work," September, 1928.) The largest single factor in American life, either urban »r rural, is in the school. The greatest single advantage of life in the city over life in the country is the superiority of the city schools over those of the country. The greatest single thing that could be done toward making country life as at - tractive as city life would be to place within the reach of every country child as good a school as is provided for the city child. The nation at large has an interest in these country schools almost as vital as the rural communities themselves. This interest is found In the fact that a large proportion of those who are trained in any country school will </seg>

They will use for the building up of cities the education that they received in country schools, and for which country people had to pay. Thus the cities are directly grafting upon the country taxpayers. Of course, no one can tell in advance just which cities are to receive the benefit of the training that is being furnished by any given country school. We do know, I however, that all the cities of the country are going to receive a large part of the benefit of all the good country schools, and a large part of the evil of all the bad country schools. That being the case, all cities should be called upon to pay a part of the cost of all country schools. This could easily be achieved by liberal federal support. ■ , ■ THEODORE ROOSEVELT (At th? dedication of the national institute for the cooperation of agricul - ture and education, labor, capital, homemaking and citizenship, Springfield, Massachusetts November 11, 1908.) Now in striving for the cooperation between the national and state gov - ernments and the farmers, for the uplifting of farm life, I am striving for exactly this principle, the principle of combining self-help with mutual help - fulness. Qf course, the prime thing to be done for the farmer, as for everyone else is to help him to help himself. If he won't help himself, if he lies down on others and tries to make them carry him, we can rest assured that neither nation, state nor neighbors can permanently benefit him. Never - theless a helping hand is often a great service when extended even to those most capable of helping themselves. But now that the more desirable areas of our public land have been settled, the homestead law does not meet the new conditions, and we adhere best to its spirit when we try to modify the system of land ownership in such a way as to insure continuous progress and uplift, so that the American farmer may not only obtain material prosperity, but on it build a high type of civilization. Important as the city is, and fortunate though it is that our cities have grown as they have done, it is still more important that the family farm, where .the home making and the outdoor business are combined into a unit should continue to grow. In every great crisis of our government and in all the slow, steady work between the crises which alone enables us to meet them when they do arise, it Is the farming folk, the people of the country districts, who have shown themselves to be the backbone of the nation. Now, when I ask that the nation cooperate with the states and with the farmers themselves for the steady growth and uplift of farm life, I am not so much 1 asking that the state help the people as I am that it shall pro - vide free opportunity for the people to continue their upward course through so much self-help and associated effort. </seg>
            <seg id="p047">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION All this simply means that the nation ought to cooperate -with the state to help the people help themselves through better educational facilities, the schools being left wholly and directly under the control of the people through their local authorities, but suggestion and general oversight as well as improve - ments being supplied by the experts employed by the nation, so that the children and the young men and girls in the smaller towns and in the country may have the educational facilities now only to be obtained in the wealthier communities. This would merely be putting into effect that cardinal American doctrine of furnishing a reasonable equality of opportunity of education and chance of development to all our children, wherever they live and whatever may be their station in life. Such a federal cooperation in technical education will help in many ways. It will mean much for the country life, for the life of the family farm, for the life of those city workers who seek landed homes in the country near the city in which they work. It will mean much along the lines of the great policy of conservation of the natural resources of our land. Finally, it will mean much to the nation of the future, because it will rep - resent the effort to give exact justice and an equal opportunity for the de - velopment to each of the boys and girls who in the future are to make up the nation. HENRY WARD BEECHER (From the great lecture by Henry Ward Beecher on The Reign of the Common People. He shows the good of democracy in education.) We are not attempting to build Society; we are by Society attempting to build the individual. We hold that the State is strong in the proportion in which every individual in that State is free, large, independent. You have a finer educated upper class than we; you have nobler and deeper scholars in greater numbers than we have; you have institutions, compared with which ours are puny you are educating the top, we are educating Society from the) bottom to the top, we are not attempting to lift favored classes higher; we are not attempting to give to those that already have; we are attempting ten put our hands under the foundations of human life, and lift everybody up. That is a slower work; but when it is done and its fruits are ripe you will never' doubt again which is the wisest and best policy. CALVIN COOLIDGE (From his Fourth of July Address before the National Education Association. Washington, D. C. 1924.) The cause of education has long had the thoughtful solicitude of the Na - tional Government, i While it is realized that it is a State affair, rather than a National affair, nevertheless it has provided by law a Bureau of Education. </seg>
            <seg id="p048">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT It has not been thought wise to undertake to collect money from the various States into the National Treasury and distribute it again among the various States for the direct support of education. It has seemed a better policy to leave their taxable resources to the States and permit them to make their own assessments for the support of their own schools in their own way. But for a long time the cause of education has been regarded as so important and so preeminently an American cause, that the National Government has sought to encourage it, scientifically to investigate its needs, and to furnish informa - tion and advice for its constant advancement. Pending before the Congress is the report of a committee which proposes to establish a Department of Edu - cation and Relief, to be presided over by a Cabinet officer. Bearing in mind that this does not mean any interference with the local control, but is rather an attempt to recognize and dignify the importance of educational effort, such proposal has my hearty indorsement and support. It is thus that our educational system has been and is ministering to our National life. Our country is in the process of development. Its physical ele - ments arc incomplete. Its institutions have been declared, but they are very far from being adopted and applied. We have not yet arrived at perfection. A scientific investigation of child life has been begun, but yet remains to be finished. There is a vast amount of ignorance and misunderstanding of envy, hatred, and jealousy, with their attendant train of vice and crime. We are not yet free, but we are struggling to become free, economically, socially, po - litically, spiritually. We have limited our amount of immigration in order that the people who live here, whether of native or foreign origin, might con - tinue to enjoy the economic advantages of our country, and that there might not be any lowering of the standards of our existence, that America might remain America. We have submitted an amendment to the National Consti - tution designed to protect the child life of the Nation from the unwarranted imposition of toil, that it might have greater opportunity for enlightment. All of these movements are in the direction of increased National freedom, and an advance toward the realization of the vision of Washington and Lincoln. i HERBERT HOOVER (From Address of President Hoover at the opening session of the White House Conference on "Child Health and Protection", Constitution Hall, Wash - ington, D. C. Wednesday, November 19, 1930.) These questions of child health and protection are a complicated problem requiring much learning and much action. And we need have great concern over this matter. Let no one believe that these are questions which should not stir a nation; that they are below the dignity of statesmen or governments. If we could have but one generation of properly born, trained, educated, and healthy children, a thousand other problems of government would vanish.

AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION (At the meeting of the American Bar Association in San Francisco, in Au - gust, 1922, a committee on American citizenship submitted a report, the result of painstaking | investigations wherein the following significant utterances are found:) There is but one remedy for our National ills — education. Knowledge and inspiration are essential to citizenship. The schools of America must save America! But we must not be content with merely imparting knowledge. Ameri - can citizenship should mean patriotism, and patriotism is not of the intellect alone; it is very largely of the spirit and of the heart. It cannot be taught by merely imparting information. It cannot be taught by a mere discussion of principles. Religion is of the spirit; so is patriotism. In teaching citizenship, the real essential is "Atmosphere." An appeal must be made to the heart, to the spirit and to the emotions, as well as to the intellect. America should no more consider graduating a student who lacks faith in our government than a school of theology should consider graduating a minister who lacks faith in God. Socialism is being taught in some of our schools and colleges. We are not afraid of the teaching of socialism as one of many theories of gvern - ment. but we; do object to its presentation as the only true theory. We do object to the teaching of the socialistic premise that our present form of gov - ernment is uiiworthy of respect, and should be swept away. Until the faith of Washington, and Jefferson, and Hamilton, and Franklin, and Madison, and Lincoln has been crushed, until patriotism and loyalty and confidence have been driven out of the heart, there is no room in the American conscience for the gospel of the socialistic agitator. </seg>

Upon his inauguration as governor for the first term he declared to the legislature: The principal mandatory increase in the coming budget will be the additional sum running probably to nine million dollars, required for the extension of the better education of our citizens. The people of the state are unanimous in support of our liberal policy. Under the pres - ent methods of apportioning state funds to rural school districts, the poorer districts in many instances fail to receive their fair share. The method of apportionment should be simplified and made to conform more closely to the relative wealth of the districts. Two months later he expanded this principle in a special message: It is necessary to relieve the rural school districts by decreasing the tax burden now borne by rural taxpayers, principally farmers, through increased state aid to such rural districts. . . . The constitutional mandate that the state shall provide for the maintenance and support of a system of free common schools wherein all the children of this state may be educated, fixes responsibility on the states and implies that equality of educational opportunity sha'l be afforded the boys and girls of the state wherever they may reside. In his 1930 New Years greeting to the teachers of New York state he wrote: What an opportunity is yours for a genuine public service and what a return must come at the close of each working day with the happy realization that you have given something, done something real for the youngster who has been denied an even chance! I need not dwell on the fact that the great forces of the nation, state, and locality are behind you in your magniflcant profession, nor will I include any reference to the vast figures of appropriation that governing bodies have made available. In the matter of furnishing vocational opportunities to children who will have to leave school early and engage in manual occupations he said: We know that the industrial openings for young people between fourteen and sixteen are in most cases blindalley, repetitive jobs, de - moralizing rather than stimulating to the children employed at them. Such use of youth is vain and wasteful. But we know also that our present educational provisions do not meet the needs of all children up to six- </seg>

Newer, more vital, more significant types of preparation for satis - factory' living must be evolved in our school system, so that if we pro - hibit the employment of children up to sixteen we may at the same time provide fruitful experiences to fill these years and turn out more valuable citizens to the state, and to industry when they do enter on their pro - ductive years. He stressed the importance of homemaking and the gospel of better homes as follows: The education here is doing a splendid piece of work in improving living conditions throughout our rural sections and indeed, in the vil - lages and towns also. It is teaching a vast army of girls in the do - mestic [sciences, teaching them to make better homes and to be more suc - cessful daughters and sisters and mothers. Through the kindred work also of the home bureaus in every county in the state, we are stressing the influence that women on the farms and in the homes of our state bear on the state's economic .and social activities. As President he expressed himself on Child Labor and his faith in education in these words: No employer acting alone was able to wipe child labor out. If one employer tried, or if one State tried it, | the costs of operation rose so high that it was impossible to compete with the employers or States which had failed to act. The moment the recovery act was passed, this monstrous thing, which neither opinion nor law could reach through years of effort, went out in a flash. One of President Roosevelt's earliest proclamations was in announcing Child Health Day: CHILD HEALTH DAY Bv the President of the United States of America — A Proclamation I : .

Education on a Federal Scale: We hope that Paul Mallon's prediction when he takes us back of the curtain into the "holy of holies" as given in the Daily Oklahoman and in a number of the metropolitan press, December 12, 1933, is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Mr. Mallon predicts relative to education that "Whenever the 'new deal" gets in full swing, you will see the administration move to develop culture and education on a federal scale. It then will get around to improving conditions for leisure and learning. THE PUBLIC PRESS School Executives Magazine, December, 1933: Depression and false economy have played havoc with the American public school. It is no exaggeration to say that its present plight is serious, if not desperate. In the spring of 1933, more than 250,000 chil - dren throughout the country were on a part-time basis, and approximate - ly 150,000 more children were housed in temporary or portable shacks. Today, the demoralizing trend is even worse. It is estimated that not one city in twenty-flve has any new classrooms under construction, and the construction of thousands of rural schools has been indefinitely post - poned. It is also asserted that 2.000,000 children are either receiving no schooling at all, or else a schooling that is two generations behind the times in practical effect. This state of affairs cannot continue ir American ideals are to survive. The several states and communities have done their part but it has not been enough. Omaha Bee-News. (Nebraska): The real cure, indeed the permanent cure, must come through the federal government.

Many schools have had to go on a tuition basis. Other localities can only keep their schools open four or five months of the school year. The Fall River Herald-News believes firmly that the schools should call on Uncle Sam for help. There is not a city nor county in America that is not pressed for money. Tax revenues have fallen off, both because of the depression and becasc of antiquated tax systems. ... It is a critical situation. The school system is in the process of collapsing, and it is supremely impor - tant that the collapse be averted. If no one but Uncle Sam can do it, it '-oks very much as if he would have to dig down in his pocket for whatever funds may be needed. Honorable Charles A. Lee, State Superintendent of Public Schools, Missouri: Nations Schools Look to Washington! Arc public schools entitled to federal ;aid? In comparison with day laborers, or any business people, the teachers' salaries do not compare very favorably^ More than 15, - 000 public school teachers in Missouri are receiving under $750 a year — less than the minimum yearly wage for common labor provided by the administration's codes. It is charged everywhere that the national rccovcrjy program is failing the schools in the hour of their greatest distress. Minneapolis Tribune, (Minnesota): Just how far the federal government should go in helping the nation's schools through the present crucial period it is difficult to say; but so long as it is lending and giving billions elsewhere, and so long as hard pressed school systems plead with it in vain for aid, the suspicion will linger in many minds that it is overlooking opportunities which thrust their roots deeply into the welfare of the nation. ... A crisis in education does exist, and the way to meet it is not clear. It is little wonder that schools, with fiscal troubles piling high at home, are looking anxiously toward Washington to see them through the crisis. Waterbury Republican, (Connecticut): The executive council of the American Federation of Labor fears that we are coming to a time when there will be no free public schools. Tax delinquency is the principal cause of the breakdown of the school system. The nation's responsibility is clearly set out: for the boys and girls today denied an education in any one state may migrate into another state, and there become social burdens to people who may have ex - pended wisely and well for their public schools.

Washington Star, (Washington, D. C): The federal government's interest in education is paramount. A wise and potentially useful move has already been made by the Federal Re - lief Administration which intends to spend a considerable sum to hire unemployed teachers to instruct adult classes in unoccupied schools. Dean Russell, Teachers' College, Columbia University, urges that Ameri - can education be rescued by Washington so that it may train citizens who will have the background and knowledge sufficient to judge clearly the efforts of our leaders toward economic reconstruction. It begins to appear that, like national industry, national education needs the assistance of the federal government. The people of the country do not care very much about which sort of agency takes care of the task so long as it is done. The point is that, by one means or an - other, the schools must be helped. Syracuse Journal, (New York): Representatives of boards of education of New York who met in Syracuse, New York, recently, stated their belief that the state and national governments must prevent too great curtailment of educational service by financially distressed municipalities. Members of school boards and other educational executives know, better than anyone else, the in - roads that have been made upon school systems. The Syracuse Journal wonders just how the federal government can help. How the federal government can help is not quite so clear, but at least one way was pointed out by former Congressman TenEyck. He reminded the school executives that the federal government is not only able but also willing to cooperate in building schoolhouses, even to the extent of financing the entire cost on easy terms. . . . This threat to the efficiency of the educational system is no "straw man" that Is being set up by school teachers to be knocked down for their own purposes. . . It Is encouraging to see those who appreciate the gravity of the situa - tion taking such steps as they can to deal with it. Raleigh News and Observer, (North Carolina): Perhaps the most hopeful sign of recovery is the real concern and interest in regard to the future of our education system. The fact that the nation is paying five times as much for gasoline as for education, and the fact that we spend as much for tobacco as we do for education, proves that we can still find money to buy what we really want It might not seem, at first glance, that our nation is as interested in edu - cation as it should be but the Raleigh News and Observer explains: </seg>
            <seg id="p058">54 1 REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT We have launched an immense public works program, but not for the purpose of building schoolhouses. We already have more than we have provided the means to pay for. We have started a drive to put millions of men and women back to work, but the ranks of unemployed teachers continue to increase. It would be easy to become pessimistic over the outlook for education, but we need not do so. The very fact that we are discussing education through the newspapers, in conferences at meetings of one sort and another, indicates that our interest is being aroused. It will take time to work out the problems, but we shall work . it out. Los Angeles Herald and Express, (California): Of all the various projects in Southern California that need federal aid. the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce believes that the schools come first. The school system in Los Angeles needs a federal appro - priation of about $25,000,000 to rebuild and to strengthen its buildings because of the earthquake hazard. Part of this must be a direct grant or gift of about $8,000,000. The rest will be supported by school district bonds, of which $6,800,000 has been previously authorized but not yet spent, jand the remainder to be new bonds voted by the people. . . In the March earthquake some buildings were put out of commission en - tirely, while many others must be reconstructed in varying degrees. New York Journal,. (N. Y.): New York City is asking for a federal loan of $30,000,000 to build thirty school buildings. New York City wants to build seventeen gram - mar schools, seven new high schools, and additions to other schools which, are hampered for lack of space. The proposed elementary schools, if built, will relieve congestion in numerous institutions throughout the city, where there are now 552 more classes than classrooms. The new high schools will also enable some 50.000 high school students, now on part-time, to get full-time instruction as soon as they are completed. Moreover, construction can begin 'within sixty days of the approval of the loan. This will furnish a considerable market for materials and labor during the winter, at a time when every cent that can be expended for those purposes repre - sents that much less of a burden on charitable relief. The Government should grant the loan promptly. A SUMMARIZATION 1. The first annual address to Congress by George Washington was less than two pages in length.

He said more in this address in favor of Federal Aid for education than he did in this first address to Con - gress. All he said in both these addresses pointed clearly to Federal Aid for education. In this address he saw Federal Aid for education as a neces - sity to hold the ablest professors in the work of teaching. This is a sore need today. 2. John Adams was the first President to appeal to the American Congress in behalf of public health. The health of the individual as well as the general public is now considered the first cardinal principle in American education. The American Child Health Association has had the good fortune to sponsor May Day as Child Health Day. The Child's Bill of Health Rights is second only to that early bill of rights on which Anglo-Saxon liberty rests. Katherin Glover in her story of May Day is authority for the statement that the toll of death is going down. The toll of life and health is going up. In 1927 only one baby of every sixteen died in the first year of life, instead of one in eleven as in 1919, or one in seven as in 1910. Notwithstanding this wonderful gain in life and health President Hoover told the White House Con - ference in 1930 that there are at least ten million physical defectives among our forty-five million children in America. We surely need Federal aid in promot - ing health education. It was conditions like these here reviewed which prompt - ed Robert L. Owen, a former members of the United States Senate to advocate a national department of health with a secretary in the President's cabinet. The Child's Bill of Rights "The ideal to which we should strive is that there shall be no child in America: That has not been born under proper conditions That does not live in hygienic surroundings That ever suffers from undernourishment That does not have prompt and efficient medical attention and inspection That does not receive primary instruction in the elements of hygiene and good health ■ That has not the complete birthright of a sound mind in a sound body </seg>
            <seg id="p060">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT That has not the encouragement to express in fullest measure the spirit within which is the final endowment of every human being." These "rights" embody seven cardinal points of protection and encourage - ment of childhood: 1. Preparedness for parenthood: motherhood, fatherhood, prenatal care. 2. A wholesome home environment: physical, cultural. 3. Sound nutrition. 4. Physical examination, correction of defects, protection against disease. 5. Training in health habits and knowledge: in the home, in the school. 6. Mental and emotional soundness: through inheritance, through environ - ment. 7. Spiritual encouragement: through the home, through the church, and the school. 3. Thomas Jefferson and John Quincy Adams were both in favor of Federal Aid! for education in some form or other. Ulysses S. Grant favored the appropriation of the net proceeds of the sales of public lands for educa - tional purposes to aid the States in the general education of their rising genera - tion. Every annual message President Hayes sent to Congress had an appeal in it for Federal Aid for the improvement of the common-school system through - out the union. Chester A. Arthur and Benjamin Harrison, both of whom were able constitutional .lawyers, urged Congress to give Federal Aid for the education of! all children of all the people. Their advocacy of Federal Aid for public education is sufficient to settle the constitutionality of Federal Aid for this purpose. As cited in the main discussion of this question, James Buchanan is the only chief executive of our country who ever vetoed an act of Congress pro - viding Federal Aid for education. 4. Abraham Lincoln and Woodrow Wilson sealed their faith in Federal Aid for education by their own signatures to bills that are now laws function - ing for the general welfare and that will continue as long as appropriations are made by Congress. Annually two million boys and girls, men and women, are now under the instruction provided by these laws. 5. We hesitate to consider the plight in which our country would find itself today had the fight to repeal the free school system in Pennsylvania in 1835 been victorious. Thaddeus Stevens was human and had his faults God knows. While we might not be able to Join Governor Wolf in hugging him. we would be delighted to unite with the Governor in warmly thanking him for the great service he rendered our common humanity in saving the free school system of Pennsylvania. </seg>
            <seg id="p061">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Had the rcpealists been successful we would now be .one-hundred years behind the times. As it is the American Federation of Labor fears we are in danger of losing our free school system in the nation. The fear is all too well-founded. With our free school system lost, the days of the American republic are numbered. The American Bar Association saw this danger over a decade ago when it declared. "The Schools of America Must Save Ameri - ca." But the American Congress must save the schools. If the Congress can and will bring those who can use other people's money under proper control as advocated by Justice Grandes the question of available funds for Federal Aid in public education would be easy of solution. 6. There is no higher authority on economic questions in America than Thomas Nixon Carver of Harvard University. His plea for Federal Aid in public education shows dearly the reciprocal benefits that would come to city and country and to the schools of America. 7. We are happy to endorse what Henry Ward Beecher and Theodore Roosevelt have said in behalf of Common-schools. In the old civilization the few led. the many followed. And we are led to believe that our system of education, like the old forms of government, forgets the many to care for the few. If it be so. it is a grievous fault, and grievously must we answer for it. Therefore, let us inaugurate a system in our education that will prepare the ninety per cent for the actual problems of life and the everyday responsibilities of American citizens, rather than to create crowns for the few, make educa - tional aristocrats, and kingly interpreters of the more fortunate ten per cent. "The people must needs take thought of what they shall eat and wherewithal they shall be clothed. An education that fits them best for this, from neces - sity, the best; at least until they are so developed and improved that the people, the great longing, struggling, hungering, needing, hoping, despairing, and yet unyielding people, shall not need to take thought only of what they shall eat and wear." 8. The public declaration of Calvin Coolidge for, a Federal Department of Education with a Secretary of Education in the President's Cabinet has our hearty aproval. Such a Department would be a great service to a larger number of people than any existing department in the Federal Government. With the American Bar Association we believe that there is but one remedy for our National ills— education. Education would function much better if it were raised to the dignity of a Department of Education with a Secretary in the President's Cabinet 9. A sufficient number of newspapers from different sections of the country have been quoted to justify us in saying that the public press of the entire nation, north, south, east and west, is overwhelmingly for better schools and Federal Aid therefore. 10.

If there ever was a time when education was the chief defense of nations, that time is now. If there ever was a time when education was a Better safe-guard of liberty than a standing arm, that time is now. If there ever was a time when education was better than forts and guns, than arsenals and navies, that time is now. If there ever was a time when our nation was paying too little for education, that time is now. If there ever was a time when, the more our nation pays for the education of its people the richer it will become, that time is now. If the characteristic work of the public is that done by the teacher we must have teachers like those demanded by J. Sterling Morton. If we want a good school we must be willing to pay the price as advocated by Henry A. Wise. If there ever was a time when schools of America must save America, that time is now. If there ever was a time when a Bible and a newspaper in every home, a good school in every district, — all studied and appreciated as they merit, — are the principal support of virtue, morality, and civil liberty, that time is now. 12. If there' ever was a time when it was more cruel for a father to start his son out in life half educated to compete with the well educated young men than the father who would cut off the arm of his son, that time is now. For the loss of an arm is not nearly so great a handicap as the lack of an edu - cation. 13. You may ask, "How does the Federal Government come into this scheme for better schools"? Let President Franklin D. Roosevelt answer: "Government includes the art of formulating policies and using the political technique to attain so much of them as will receive general support; persuading, leading, sacrificing, teach - ing, always because perhaps the greatest duty of statemanship is to educate." 14. We await with confidence the policies of our Government that will place American education on a Federal Scale and Save our Schools! ACKNOWLEDGMENT Grateful acknowledgment is hereby made: 1.

            <seg id="p074">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Under the F rovisions of the section just named, a state board of exam - iners was set up in January, 1927. This board visits the private and denomin - ational colleges of the state in order to determine whether or not they may be approved for the issuance of teachers' certificates. The University of Nebraska sets the standard for the four-year certificates, that is, for those certificates which arc based upon graduation from an institu - tion authorized to confer the degree of Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science. The Board of Education of State Normal Schools sets the standards for insti - tutional certificates based upon one and two years of college work. The schools listed on a following page were approved during the past bien - nium by the state board of examiners. Doane College, a senior college at Crete, Nebraska, has not made application for approval as an institution authorized to issue certificates. Graduates of Doane College make application for the regular certificates issued by the state superintendent of public instruction. The college is fully approved and its credits arc accepted at full value in the issuance of teachers' certificates. Credits are also accepted from the Hebron Junior Col - lege at Hebron. All of the colleges of the state granting institutional certificates have been visited at least once each year. The board of examiners at the present time has as its Chairman, Dr. B. E. McProud, Dean of the Teachers' College, Neb - raska Wesleyan University. Other members of the board are Professor A. A. Reed, Director of the Extension Division and University Examiner, Univer - sity of Nebraska and Dr. H. F. Martin. President of Midland College at Fre - mont. The Director of Certification of the state department of public instruc - tion is ex-officio Secretary of the board. * Board members serve without pay and receive only their necessary travel - ing expenses. The state department of public instruction wishes to take this opportunity to express to the members of the board of examiners its very great appreciation for the splendid service which they have rendered to the colleges of the state. </seg>
            <seg id="p075">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION - DIVISION OF RURAL EDUCATION Chloe C. Baldridge. Director of. Rural Education The rural school problems, objectives, and achievements In Nebraska •are of vital interest not only to the rural sections of our state but to all of Nebraska whose basic occupation is agriculture. The importance of the rural schools of Nebraska may well be appreciated when the number of rural school pupils is considered. There are 94,862 pupils enrolled in 6.157 elementary rural schools in Nebraska. -11,0 little one room rural school, though lacking in glamour and show, is still the backbone of the school system in an agricultural state such as ours." For the past eight years, a continuous program has been carried out consistently in the rural schools. The State Department, county superintend - ents, teachers, school officers, and patrons have made an earnest cooperative attempt to provide improved educational advantages for the boys and the girls in the rural districts each year. Decided progress has been made. The success of each individual child has been our goal for it is our belief that education is doing its best only when it helps people to succeed. The work of the Division of Rural Education is to give particular help to county superintendents, school officers, and teachers in f-rmulating and developing county-wide progressive school programs that will result in the improvement of rural schools. Qur efforts are put forth to bring about more efficient teaching and improvement of instruction, standard and superior rural schools, improved equipment, enriched libraries, and greater coopera - tion with the home for better schools. The financial conditions during the past two years have caused our efforts to be directed toward the maintenance and preservation of the rural school standards already attained. As a part of the field work, the director of rural education has ad - dressed county teachers' institutes, group teachers 1 meetings, district teachers - associations, school officers meetings, eighth grade promotion exercises, local, district, and state Parent-Teacher Association meetings, standardization and superior school meetings, schoolhouse dedications, normal training clubs, radio audiences, church, club, and other community meetings. One hundred and fifty addresses have been delivered by the writer during the biennium. Teachers have been visited in the classrooms and individual conferences have been held with parents, school officials, and teachers. The office work of this division has included work on the revision of the course of study, prep - aration of teaching helps for distribution, rural and elementary school cor - respondence, issuance of certificates of membership in the state rural school chorus, preparation of questions for the eighth grade examinations, answer- </seg>
            <seg id="p076">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT ing inquiries as to source material for addresses and discussions, supervisory helps for county superintendents, and preparation of a 153 page manual "Rural Education Looking Forward" and the Fire Prevention Manual. The work of the director of rural education in Nebraska as well as in the other states is concerned chiefly with promoting state policies of rural education, supervision of instruction, research, and inspection. Professional leadership gives encouragement of initiative and creative ability: It stimu - lates professional growth and gives helpful suggestions, new ideas, inspira-, tion. and higher professional ideas to the teachers. The work of this particular division cannot be measured merely in terms of statistical data. It is our desire to realize with the cooperation of the home, the school, and the church the richest dividends for the Nebraska boys and girls, dividends in achieving permanent interests in inspirational and recreational j reading, in developing good habits of study, in the appreciation of good music, and in the acquisition of qualities of good citizenship. Shall we not guarantee to every child the opportunity to grow and develop so that he may be able to fill his place as a citizen of our great state? The efforts of the Division of Rural Education have been directed and are being directed toward improvement of instruction. IMPROVEMENT OF INSTRUCTION Good supervision will result in improvement of teaching. Two general objectives of school supervision arc the improvement of methods of instruction and the unification of school work throughout the county and state. Many of those elected to the office of county superintendent have not had previous training as supervisors of teachers. There are many changes each term. Last term, 28 new county superintendents were elected while during the term before that 31 county superintendents served for the first time. For the new term beginning January, 1935, 46 county superintendents will serve their first term. Intelligent guidance, a helping hand, willingness to assist where needed, the pointing out of a better teaching procedure, and needed encouragement ofttimes change failure into success for the teacher and bring to the boys and girls a year of happy achievement and progress that contributes greatly to their growth and development. A state public school system needs adequate supervision of the rural elementary schools in order that these schools may be administered economically and efficiently just as a state highway system needs ample supervision and direction in economical road construction and maintenance. The promotion of efficiency and professional growth of our teachers may be realized and is being realized by classroom visitation, commendation, constructive individual criticism, classroom demonstrations, tests and measure- </seg>
            <seg id="p077">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION ments. standards of achievement, individual instruction, contests and exhibits, teachers' meetings and institutes, school demonstration days and patrons' days, circulars and bulletins, and emphasis on teaching units, projects! and activities. A county superintendents' supplement of 25 pages, consisting of super - visory helps, was prepared for the county superintendents each year. Annual Conferences with County Superintendents The State Superintendent's annual conferences with county superintend - ents and the County Superintendents' Association were held at Lincoln on January 24, 25, and 26, 1933, and January 30, 31, and February 1, 1934. for the purpose of presenting the educational program of the State Superintend - ent s Office to the county superintendents, and to assist them in organizing the routine work and administrative duties of their offices. Methods for improvement of instruction in scientific temperance, in character education, and in the rural school chorus were presented. Discussions were held on "Leadership of County Superintendents in the Improvement of Instruction," "Interpreting Needs and Problems of Rural Schools," and "The Leadership of the County Superintendent in Service to the Community." The following topics were discussed: "The Rural Teacher and Her Training," "Nebraska's Common School Endowment." "The Financial Condition of Rural School Districts in Nebraska." "Federal Aid for Education," "Beacon Lights for Childhood." "Current Developments from Recent Trends in Education Finance." "Our Public Schools," "Measuring Results in Education." "A State Program for Better Schools." and "The Out - look for Education in America." Participation by all county superintendents on committees was one feature of the conventions. In 1933, the advisory committees reported on objectives of rural edu - cation in Nebraska, reading demonstration day in Nebraska, the rural school chorus, eighth grade examination subjects, and eighth grade examination dates and program. The committee work was continued in 1934 and stand - ards of achievement to be attained by eighth grade pupils in certain subjects were determined by the various committee groups of county superintendents. Inspirational addresses were also given, and delightful musical numbers were enjoyed. Program for Better Reading Our objective in the improvement of instruction is to give every child an opportunity to grow, to develop the ability to read and write, to think, to study, and to act. In order to give every child this opportunity, teachers, superintendents, and our department are striving to develop the finest habits, ideals, and appreciations on the part of the child by the correlation of the subject matter with his experiences, and for more thorough work in the fun- </seg>
            <seg id="p078">REPORT OF STATE SUI'ERINTENDENT damcntal subjects. Throughout the state, the slogan has been "Every child n better reader." In addition to developing a love and desire for reading, the state-wide reading program has consisted of three phases, viz.: first, the diagnostic or testing phase; second, remedial instruction: and third, the observance of Read - ing Demonstration D;»ys. Today reading is recognized as a tool on which all schoolroom activities depend and as an essential tool for intelligent par - ticipation in all activities of modern life. Reading Demonstration Days were conducted last year by 797 rural school teachers as given in Table Number 3. The Reading Demonstration Days have brought about keener interest on the part of the parents, have inspired the children to do better work, and have given the teacher an op - portunity to observe the reading in other schools. A recent comment from the County Superintendent of Dawcs County states that, in her opinion, reading has improved at least fifty per cent in the past year and that Reading Demonstration Days are now becoming a part of the regular school work for they are appreciated by the patrons of the districts. Teachers have reported that better work has been done in reading by certain students by the use of special drills in phonics, by means of vocabu - lary learning contests, by special credit being given for each library book read, and by informal tests in speed and comprehension which were recorded by graphs! Reading circles have been formed and borrowed books were read in spare time. Children formed the habit of doing a large amount of reading and of summarizing the paragraphs read each day. Broader reading on present day problems and current events was one outcome. Library cor - ners and library tables were great helps. Better Everyday English In order to help every child to speak and write correctly, with clear-cut sentences and no misspelled words, standards of achievement in English have been set forth for each grade. Good English Clubs were sponsored by 1.729 rurqj school teachers last year as reported in Table Number 4. Contests for the Improvement of Subject Matter Other incentives offered for the increasing of interest in rapid calculation and spelling were the ciphering contests conducted in 880 schools and the spelling contests participated in by 2,052 schools as indicated in Table Num - ber 3. | .■•.... Good Study Habits Teaching children to study is one of the most important functions of the school. Teachers have been particularly successful in helping the pupils im - prove their study habits by seeing that the assignments were understood before the classes were dismissed, thereby developing habits of exactness, concentra- </seg>

They showed pupils how to study by learning to summarize each paragraph and then selecting the important points. They have kept before the pupils charts of study habits until good study habits became fixed. Citizenship and Character Building As provided in the civics course in our State Elementary Course of Study, boys and girls have been taught to love, respect, and reverence the Constitu - tion of the United States in 4,857 districts according to the reports sent in by teachers as given in Table Number 2. The State Department has published and distributed a number of character education bulletins, viz.: first, a Guide for Teachers; second, a Knighthood of Youth Club Guide; third. Parents' Part in the Knighthood of Youth; fourth, Knighthood of Youth Club Activities; fifth, Junior Service League; and sixth. Character Education and the Adult's Part. We are happy to announce that 3,532 rural school teachers reported splendid work by their Knighthood of Youth and Citizenship Clubs as given in Table Number 2. The Nebraska character education course includes a plan for the organiza - tion of citizenship clubs, particularly the Knighthood of Youth Club, whose objective is cooperation with the teacher in making a true success of school work, growth in character, and achievements and undertakings which are ex - pressions of true citizenship. The benefits of these activities are carried into home and community life. Some of the benefits to the children as summarized by rural teachers are initia - tive, originality, resourcefulness and creativeness developed in the children, responsibility of the pupils for the school, a spirit of service and cooperation, true patriotism, reverence, respect, honesty, courage, assistance to the teacher, closer contact between the patrons and the school, and an atmosphere which makes school pleasant for both the pupils and the teacher.

In order to meet the needs of the present, it is important that constant work be devoted to the revision of the curriculum at all times. Supplementary helps to the Course of Study have been prepared by this division and have been made available to the teachers. County superintendents have cooperated in working on standards of achievement to be attained in the various grades. Progress is being made in the revision of the Course of Study. Actual units that are being used by the teachers will be presented in the revised course which will be available by September, 1936. The nature and amount of subject matter to be covered in each subject throughout the eight years of work are clearly and definitely stated in the Course of Study. The methods of procedure for teaching the required units and subject matter are also included. The State Elementary Course of Study not only takes into consideration the rural environment but it has been made expressly to meet the needs of the rural schools and is rural in setting and in content. It is motivating and vitalizing the school work throughout Nebraska. Pride in our agricultural state is expressed through the Course of Study by means of the activities listed in the course relating to 4-H Club work, the farm account - ing course, the farm marketing problems, the measuring of fields, cost of painting of buildings, the cost of fencing, the making of graphs for the purpose of com - paring rainfall, graphs of the changes in prices, crop surveys, cost of growing and feeding { livestock, suggested correlations of agriculture with English, the enriched course in practical agriculture, and the use of the agriculture bulletins. The Nebraska alternation plan in the Elementary Course of Study does not consist of a required, complete alternation and combination of classes. Lack of time and the short recitation periods previous to the adoption of the alternation plan were great handicaps to efficient school work in rural schools. The law requires that the eighth grade pupils pass in fourteen subjects. If the classes were not combined in any subject, the teacher who has all eight grades in school would have not less than 42 to 48 classes a day. The alternation plan is offered in "Rural Education Looking Forward" and in the State Course of Study. The success of the alternation plan in Nebraska is due to the fact that the system as outlined may be adjusted to fit the child and at no time is the plan permitted to be a "lock-step system." The individual child is given con - sideration at all times. One of the teacher's greatest responsibilities is to help each individual child to develop to his greatest capacity. Eighth Grade Examinations The completion of the courses of study and passing satisfactorily the final eighth grade examinations under the direction of the county superintendent en - title the pupils to the privileges of the free high school law in Nebraska.

            <seg id="p081">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION of free public high school education for all the youth of this stale whose parents or guardians live in public school districts which maintain less than a four year high school course of study, on the following conditions, to-wit: ••First. For the purposes of this article all grades above the eighth grade many public .chool district of this state shall be deemed high school grades. The course of study for the first eight grades in common school, shall be composed of the following subjects: agriculture, bookkeeping, civics, drawing arithmetic, English compositon. geography, grammar, history, mental arith - metic, orthography, penmanship, physiology, reading. The State Superintendent with these subjects for a foundation shall lay out a feasible course of study adapted to rural school conditions keeping in view the good of a thorough education for the child in these branches rather than to the completion of the course in a given number of years. Every pupil after taking this course of study may by applying to the county superintendent take examination in these subjects, such examination to be held at a time and place designated by the county superintendent and held by him or his assistant, and at no time shall be held by a teacher any of whose pupils are taking the examina - tion. The questions used in such examination shall be furnished by the State Superintendent and be the same in all counties each year. The county super - intendent at the close of such examination shall after ascertaining that the name of the pupil is not written on any examination paper, record each set of papers by name and also by number, after which such papers shall be turned over to the examining board who shall consider the papers by num - ber only. Said board to be appointed by the county superintendent and shall consist of at least five competent examiners with qualifications at least equal to those required for a second grade county certificate. Each member of said examining board shall give careful consideraion to the grading of each paper, expense of such grading to be paid out of the general fund of the county, and if such pupils shall have passed with an average of seventy-five per cent in the subjects named in this chapter, no subject leas than sixty per cent, the county superintendent shall issue a certificate stating the pupil is entitled to free high school tuition, providing the ninth grade is not being taught in the district where pupil's parents or guardians reaide. The course of study for the high school grades shall be the Nebraska High School Man - ual issued jointly by the University of Nebraska and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. ••**-••• In compliance with the law, the eighth grade examinations have been pre - pared by the Division of Rural Education and sent out to the county superin - tendents. Examinations have been conducted by the county superintendents on specified dates in January, April, and May. The January examination is a "special" examination in a few subjects, designed to enable pupils to do better work by taking a few of the minor examinations in January. This plan makes it possible for the pupils to devote more time to the remaining major subjects. The purpose of the final eighth grade examinations is to determine the eligi - bility of pupils to receive free high school tuition from the county for high school instruction in public approved high schools. According to the law, all eighth grade pupils, public, private, parochial, town, city, or rural, regardless of the school they are attending, must pass these examinations in order to be entitled to privileges under the free high school law, namely, free high school tuition. The State Elementary Course of Study gives a common basis for the preparation of examination questions. A conscientious effort is put forth in order that these examinations may be a fair and a reasonable test of the pupil's ability to satisfactorily do high school work. These examinations conform with the standards for promotion as listed in the Elementary Course of Study, "Rural Education Looking Forward." and mimeographed standards sent out by the State Superintendent's Office. The examinations also serve for the purpose of diagnosing deficiencies in the pupil's work and are helpful to the teachers in suggesting remedial measures. </seg>
            <seg id="p082">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Standards for Better Rural School Teaching The most important factor in any school is the teacher. "As the teacher, so is the school." A real patriot i£ not always the one who speaks the loud - est in public. More frequently we find that the real patriot is the dependable person during times of "storm and stress." Living patriotism, true citizenship, is not made in the crisis, it is only there revealed. The devotion of the Nebraska teachers to the splendid cause of educa - tion during these times of stress has marked the teachers as real patriots. Salaries have been reduced, teaching loads have been made heavier, living con - ditions have been a problem in some instances but, even under trying con - ditions, the teacher has made definite progress. Recognition certificates for better rural school teaching were issued by State Superintendent Taylor to .121 teachers this biennium and were based on efficiency in classroom management, classroom procedure, classroom achieve - ments, realization of the school as a social center, and professional spirit and personal qualities of the teacher. Patrons' Days In order that patrons may know the school and understand the problems, needs, objectives, and achievements of the school, Patrons' Day is quite gen - erally observed in the rural schools. Two thousand two hundred and forty - three teachers reported observance of Patrons' Day last year (see Table Number 2). School officers and all patrons were urged to visit their respective schools on Patrons' Day for the purpose of hearing pupils in their everyday recitations.' County and State Exhibits by County Superintendents Reports received in this office indicate that counties throughout the state are complying with Section 79-2120, Nebraska School Laws, which provides that there shall be held, under the supervision and direction of the county superintendent and county board, an exhibit of school work done in each school district of each county during the school year. Four thousand and ninety-six teachers reported to this office that they prepared exhibit work last year (see Table Number 4). The school exhibit at the State Fair, held under the direction of the State Fair Board, is very creditable. For several years, the county superintendents have been using the county fairs as a means of acquainting the public with the progress of education. Achievement maps portraying the rural school achievements in the various counties were exhibited in the booth of the State Department of Public Instruc - tion at the State Fair. The interest shown by Fair visitors insures the contin - uance of this booth each year. </seg>
            <seg id="p083">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Circulars, Bulletins, and Professional Helps Many circulars and professional helps were prepared by this division for the use of county superintendents and teachers in the improvement of in - struction in the schools. During the biennium, 116 bulletins consisting of 193 pages were sent to each county superintendent. Most of these bulletins were duplicated for all teachers by this office or by the county superintendent's office. The Rural School Chorus We wish to-express our sincere appreciation to county superintendents for the splendid results that are being secured in the rural school chorus. This work was conducted by 1.793 teachers during the last school year (see Table Number 2). During the biennium, 10.291 rural boys and girls received the Ne - braska rural school chorus certificate signed by the State Superintendent and were eligible to sing in the rural school chorus at the State Fair. These rural boys and girls had previously sung at the eighth grade promotion exercises and at the county rural school choruses. Fathers, mothers, and teachers have been delighted to listen to the beautiful tone quality that has been developed in the singing of the boys and girls by this method. A most appreciative and attentive audience greeted the two appearances of the rural school chorus on Tuesday, September 5. 1933. and Tuesday. Sep - tember 4, 1934. This work is being promoted by our division in order that the boys and girls of the rural school may share in the joys of self-expression and appreciation that only good music can bring. Pictures of the rural school chorus are given on pages 78 and 79. </seg>

            <seg id="p086">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Enrichment of the Rural School Library A survey of 28 counties revealed in 1930 that, out of 1.924 schools who reported, 1,363 districts listed the library books in their respective schools. It was found that 490 reports did not list any library books while reports from 71 districts stated definitely that there were no library books in their respective schools. On the library reports from 1.363 districts. 37,672 books were listed for an enrollment of 25,545 pupils. This means that each pupil in these 1,363 districts averaged 1.47 books. It will be conceded that this is decidedly inade - quate. This survey of the rural school library demonstrates the importance of the 1929 library law. This law provides for the enrichment and enlargement of the school library. "Section 79-515. District Board, Shall Provide School District Library, How Financed. The school board or school trustees of every school district within this state shall set aside annually from the general funds collected for the use of the district the sum of five dollars per teacher .employed within the school district as shown by the annual report to the county superintend - ent ... The amount so set aside shall be known as the district library fund and shall be by the school board or school trustees of such district annually invested in books other than the regular textbooks, which books so provided shall be suitable for the district school library." Two thousand eight hundred and twenty-eight districts purchased library books last year (see Table Number 4). Three of the state organizations that are cooperating to assist in enriching the library facilities this year in the rural schools are the American Association of University Women, the Parent-Teacher Association, and the Nebraska Li - brary Association. Four thousand five hundred and sixty-seven teachers report that pupils are doing home recreational reading (see Table Number 4). HEALTH EDUCATION The goal of our health education program is to develop for each child a sound mind in a strong and healthy body. The difference between success and failure is sometimes the difference between a healthy body and an unhealthy body. In order to achieve this ideal, emphasis is placed on personal hygiene and health habits. The course of study in health includes facts and principles to be impressed in "Nutrition" and sixteen other units, attitudes to be developed, habits and skills to be acquired, and various health activities which correlate health education with all other subjects. A forty-five minute period Is being devoted to health education by the entire rural school system each week this year. There is general recognition of the importance of health work in the public schools. Many organizations cooperate with the schools in this important health work. The State Tuberculosis Association has rendered valuable assistance in making possible through the seal sale the services of a visiting school nurse in some counties. The cooperation of the Parent-Teacher Association, the Junior Red Cross, and the 4-H Clubs, in health education has been very gratifying. </seg>
            <seg id="p087">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Physical Examinations Physical examinations arc given to all pupils as required by Section 79-2113. Nebraska School Laws. Reports of the physical examinations are sent to the State Board of Public Welfare. Supervision of Playgrounds The daily supervision of the playground is one phase of the health educa - tion program. It is a great satisfaction to know that in Nebraska 4,989 rural school teachers supervise their playgrounds (see Table Number 3). It is our aim to insure to every child a happy, congenial school association on the school ground that will help him do his very best work in school and will send him home contented and happy. The State Department has issued a helpful Physi - cal Education Bulletin. This was .compiled by Mr. Herbert L. Cushing, Deputy State Superintendent, and the State Committee on Physical Education. Rural Field Day Rural Field Day was observed in many counties. One thousand three hundred nine rural schools participated in Rural Field Day last year as reported in Table Number 3. Control of Infection Prevention of disease is another step in our health program. The child, the teacher, the parent, and the community should work together to prevent sick - ness. "Control of Infection" is one of the units worked out in the Elementary Course of Study. Hot Lunches The hot lunch enables the pupils to relish their noonday meals and causes better digestion, better health, and greater power and desire to study. We should like to pay a sincere tribute to the 1,785 rural teachers who are super - vising the lunch period, preparing hot lunches during the winter months, or are having the pupils bring food in Mason jars to be warmed by being placed in hot water (see Table Number 3). Safety and Fire Prevention Safety was taught last year in 5.132 rural schools as provided for in the" course in safety in "Rural Education Looking Forward" (see Table Number 3). Fire prevention has been taught in 5,132 rural schools. In accordance with Section 79-1202, Nebraska School Laws, a Fire Prevention Manual was pre - pared and distributed to all teachers in the rural and city schools of Nebraska. Nebraska schools have been recognized as leading in the teaching of fire pre - vention in the nation by the press and by a Michigan fire prevention publication. </seg>
            <seg id="p088">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Scientific Temperance Instruction Section 79—1409, Nebraska School Laws, provides that instruction shall be given in the public schools with reference to the evil effects of alcoholic drinks and narcotics upon the human system. A 1933 Course of Study on "Alcohol and Other 1 Narcotics and Their Relation to Health" was issued by State Super - intendent Taylor. Five thousand two hundred seventy-four rural teachers have reported that they taught the relation of alcohol and other narcotics to health last year as given in Table Number 3. Junior Red Cross Membership in the Junior Red Cross was reported by 638 rural districts. There arc 54 counties organized in Junior Red Cross with an enrollment of 55,256 pupils. This organization has contributed to personal hygiene and com - munity health. 4-H Clubs Pupils in 1.015 rural schools participated in 4-H Club work in Nebraska last year, according to the reports received directly from teachers in Table Number 2. The 4-H Health Clubs have done splendid work. . Our standard and superior rural school program aids in providing healthful conditions for our boys and girls. STANDARD AND SUPERIOR RURAL SCHOOLS Standardization of rural schools is a voluntary procedure on the part of the school districts themselves. No right of self-control is affected by standardiza - tion. Satisfactory physical environment is considered very important to the school life, health, and progress of children and has led to definite standards in buildings, grounds, and working equipment. We purpose to secure the best one-teacher rural schools possible by establishing definite standards which are conducive to greater care in providing healthful educational advantages for rural children. During the past two years, 45 rural schools have been made standard or superior. This is a splendid record of local and state achievement, particularly in view of the financial conditions of the period. It is essential that our schools be properly equipped, that the buildings be kept in good repair and properly heated, lighted, and ventilated. Correct physical conditions are factors neces - sary to good health and good morale. It is even more essential that the teach - ing in these schools be done by teachers who are thoroughly educated and well </seg>

Standard and superior rural schools are effective factors in attracting and holding good teachers and desirable residents. «r P °°r schooIs are d«e largely to the lack of personal interest and support. We should guarantee to every boy and girl a school that is safe from hazards sanitary, well equipped, well lighted, and well ventilated. Improved school buildings, better equipment, better teaching, and definite community cooperation are being realized for the schools by the efforts put forth in standardization A neighboring state appropriates one hundred thousand dollars per year to rural schools meeting certain standards prescribed by the statute. Nebraska school boards, patrons, and teachers have shown great interest in standardization with - out the incentive of state aid. As a result, there are many splendid one-teacher build ngs libraries, supplementary reading material, good equipment for instruc - tional and playground purposes, an excellent teacher, and all that goes to make boys and girls happy while they are being trained for good citizenship. In some schools we find running water, electric lights, telephone, radio, hot lunch equipment, manual training equipment, and kindergarten table and chairs.

Standardization of rural schools will continue for we find everywhere that local school officials and county superintendents are continuing their efforts to standardize rural schools and to make them more efficient. (See list of standard rural schools on pages 98 to 105, inclusive, of the manual "Rural Education Looking Forward.") During the years 1927 to 1932, inclusive, 35,000 copies of Rural School Standards Bulletins were printed and distributed. In 1933, 12.000 copies of "Rural Education Looking Forward" were printed and have been distributed. This bulletin contains the minimum requirements for standardization, the offi - cial score card for standard and superior rural schools, a general explanation of the Nebraska rural school standards, floor plans suitable for one and two - teacher rural schools, the law regarding our flag and flag pole, flag code, play - ground equipment, hot lunch equipment, library books for pupils, music helps </seg>
            <seg id="p090">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT ■ and records, standards for recognition of better rural school teaching, a list of Nebraska standard schools, and program discussion material for rural Parent- Teacher Associations. When a school reaches the minimum requirements, the teacher or school officers score the school and request the county superintendent or State De - partment to inspect and score the school. If a school justifies a score of 75 points, it is classed as a standard school and a standard plate for the school is sent by the State Department to the county superintendent. Legislation should be enacted, -when expedient, whereby the plans of a new rural schoolhouse may be approved by a school architect, working under the direction of the State Superintendent. This department is not interested in dic - tating kinds of material, the type of roof, the size of the building, thickness of walls, and similar details that should be left to the decision of the local group, but this department is interested in regard to the school building complying with the requirements of health and sanitation and is willing to say that a check should be; made relative to new buildings in order that they may meet health requirements. Seventy-eight new schoolhouses have been erected during this biennium. Some of the specific benefits of the standardization of rural schools are: 1. It gives the county superintendent, the school officers, and patrons a common interest. It develops school and community pride and cooperation. 2. It gives school officers an understanding of school needs for the health and education of the children and guides them in the wise and economical ex - penditures of funds. It arouses general interest in school improvement. 3. It secures improvements in buildings and playground. It encourages better care of the school plant and the cleaning up of the school grounds. 4. It helps the county superintendent to make a close survey of the schools and thus become familiar with conditions. 5. It secures needed teaching equipment. 6. It encourages the employment of better prepared teachers. 7. It encourages the organization of Parent-Teacher Association and school and home community organizations. 8. It is an excellent community project for every rural district to score its school in order to determine its efficiency and reveal its needs and achievements. In order that progress may continue when a school has reached the full re - quirements for a standard school, a superior school rating has been established (see pages 66 and 67 of "Rural Education Looking Forward"). </seg>

            <seg id="p092">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT COOPERATION OF HOME AND SCHOOL Home and School Organizations Interest in a better rural school program has been brought about by com - munity organizations and patrons' organizations discussing freely and working on a program of child welfare and school improvement. We have found that the most effective means of advancing rural education is through local leadership. Although developing sentiment takes time, it makes for growth, satisfaction, and permanence in the end, and is in accordance with the guiding principles followed by Horace Mann, viz.: "Education can never be attained in a republic without the consent of the whole people. AH improvements in the school suppose and re - quire a corresponding and simultaneous improvement in public sentiment." Every effort is being made on the part of the State Department and county superintendents to stimulate within our state a public sentiment and desire for better schools. With the public's good will, a school system can do almost anything. Without it, little can be accomplished. The vision, ideals, and sym - pathetic cooperative interests of its people are the measure of the life of the community. One who is seeking a satisfactory place in which to live and rear a family is attracted by a growing, alert, wide awake neighborhood where there is real leadership and a well-balanced community development program in operation, and where there is a united interest in securing the best things In life. Our experience shows that the rural people of the various communities are glad and [willing, in the great majority of cases, to improve their schools as far as economic factors make it reasonably possible for them to do so. Therefore, we urge and encourage the forming of Parent-Teacher Associations, community centers, and kindred organizations that are interested in the home and school. Discussion material for these organizations has been prepared by the Director of Rural Education for the purpose of contributing to discussions on children's reading, health, safety, character education, preventing fires on the farm, thrift, and standards for rural schools. The Parent-Teacher Association is one of the most important agencies for interpreting to the school patrons the aims and needs of the schools. Encouragement and support of progressive school policies may be counted on from parents who take interest in the schools their children attend and who participate actively in the work of the Parent-Teacher Associa - tion. It is not enough that teachers be concerned with educational results. There must be understanding and cooperation with those who provide the money and with those who furnish the pupils. The legislator, the teacher, and the parents must work together for a unified, balanced educational program. In order for this to be done, all groups should be in full possession of facts in regard to the schools, j Legislators are earnestly desirous of doing the thing that will do the greatest good for the greatest number.

            <seg id="p093">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION ciations and similar community organizations last year as given in Table Num - ber 2. In our survey last year, there were 237 teachers in 48 counties who re - ported that their greatest problem had been to secure cooperation of home and school. Many of these teachers stated that they had finally solved this prob - lem by visiting patrons, by school programs, by community meetings, by school demonstration days, and by Parent-Teacher Associations. School Officers' Conventions A county school board association is one of the very best agencies for developing an active interest in the improvement of school conditions through - out the county and for inspiring a more united and cooperative program of work. Since the improvement of a school is so dependent on the school board and community, this department is interested in school officers' meetings being held in order that school officers may become better informed as to the needs of the school, educational progress and policies, plans for modern school build - ings, and financing of schools. Some states require county school officers' meet - ings. Members of this department have addressed school officers' associations in many counties.

PREPARATION, EXPERIENCE, AND SALARIES OF TEACHERS IN NEBRASKA RURAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS Preparation This report is based on the information sent directly to this office by 4,667 rural teachers who are teaching in 88 counties in Nebraska (see Table Num - ber 5). Of the 4,667 teachers reporting, 3,216 or 68.9 per cent were graduates of the normal training courses in the high schools of Nebraska. Less than a year of college training is reported for 2,344 or 50.2 per cent of the teachers re - porting; 2,324 or 49.8 per cent had more than one year of college training. Although there were 838 or 17.9 per cent of those reporting that had had no college training, yet 1,154 or 24.7 per cent had two years or more of college training. Of these, 315 teachers in rural schools had more than three years of college training and 174 of these had four years or more of college work. In a study made by the Division of Secondary Education in 1929-30, 35.5 per cent of the teachers in the rural elementary schools had high school normal training only while, in 1933-34, 838 of the 4,667 teachers reporting, or 17.9 </seg>

This survey impresses one with the fact that teachers are progressing and improving in service. The professional growth of the teaching force is responsible for part of the progress of the rural schools during the biennium. Tenure in Present Position ■ ■ . Of the 4,667 teachers reporting, 2,119 rural elementary teachers or 45.4 per cent were teaching the first year in their present positions while 1,256 or 26.9 per cent were teaching the second year in their present positions. The number teaching the third year in their present positions was 656 or 14 per cent: 287 or 6.1 per cent were teaching the fourth year in their present positions; 132 or 2.8 per cent were teaching the fifth year in their present positions. Those who have taught from six to ten years in their present positions num - bered 119 rural elementary teachers or 2.5 per cent. Sixteen had taught from eleven to twenty years in their present positions. Two teachers, Miss Bird- Claybaugh and Miss Neff, have taught twenty-five years in their present posi - tions. The results of the faithful services of teachers who have given twenty - five yearjs of their lives to certain communities are well illustrated in the achieve - ments of their respective schools, i. e., Ashland Park and Pershing, Douglas County, | growing from one-teacher schools to school systems having nineteen teachers and eight teachers, respectively.

Salaries During the school year 1932-33, the amount paid to the 364 men teaching in the [he rural elementary schools was $217,682.15, an average of $598.03 per year. During this time, the amount paid to 5,938 women teaching in rural schools was $3,508,43734, making an average of $590.84 per year for each woman teaching in the rural elementary schools. The total salaries for teachers of rural elementary schools during the year 1932-33 amounted to $3,726,119.49.

During the same year the amount paid to 5,963 women teaching in rural schools was $2,717,967.38, or an average salary of $455.80 per year. The total of the district school funds paid to rural elementary teachers for the year 1933-34 was $2,893.65736. Approximately $85,000 of federal funds was paid in addition to the district school funds for the salaries of teachers in the elementary rural schools, thereby raising the average salary $15 or $16 for the year 1933-34.

I ■ CONTENTS. — Introduction— Future of American Secondary Education — High School Accredilment- — North Central Association — Approvad Non .Accredited High Schools— -High School Normal Training Program — Character Education. I . .■■■.'■: i The Fhirty-second Biennial Report, issued in January, 1933, includes among other things a short discussion relating to. the functions of this office in the improvement of instruction in the secondary schools and in the further - ing of the rural teacher training program. At that time this office stated that "Leadership in education must be assumed as the most important function of the state. The best leadership docs not depend upon legislative authority, but upon the advice, understanding, sympathy and cooperation of those who in an administrative, executive and supervisory capacity promote the state's educational objectives." In previous reports, this office has set forth the challenge of secondary education as well as information pertaining to the apparent reorganization of secondary education, which reorganization at that time seemed imminent and which rcorganiation we are now prepared to state is actu a lly taking place in many parts of the country, including Nebraska. It does not seem advisable to extend the discussion here into any of the details set forth in the Thirty - first and Thirty-second Biennial Reports. The Thirty-second Biennial Report contained also a brief review of some of the outstanding features of the National Survey of Secondary Education. This discussion included information concerning the growth, organization, ad - ministration and supervision and curricula, and concluded with a brief statis - tical report respecting the growth and development of secondary schools In Nebraska. The reader's attention is called to the statistical summary of public school accreditment for the years 1923 to 1932. The statistics for 1932-33 and 1933-34 follow: 1932-33 1933-34 Total high school enrollment accredited and non - accredited schools ...._ _ 75,283 74,953 Enrollment in accredited high schools '. 1 , 69.730 70,644 Number of accredited high schools 505 516 Number of teachers in accredited high schools J _ 3.386 3,284 Numbjr of graduates from accredited high schools 13,823 14,247 </seg>
            <seg id="p107">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION It will be seen from these data that, whereas the total high school enroll - meat of accredited and non-accredited high schools, as well as the enrollment in accredited high schools, has increased slightly, the number of teachers has de - creased and the number of graduates from accredited high schools has decreased It .s sull greater, however, in both of the past two years than it has been any year heretofore, save the year 1931-32. It is entirely proper to say that Nebraska has in its organization of the secondary schools kept pace with the growing concept of secondary education and that our enrollments, while steadily increasing, do not seem to indicate as great an increase as has been heretofore true. There is no gainsaying the fact that the large percentage of rural boys and girls completing the eighth grade education in those schools has constantly continued to become greater with each succeeding year. This is deHnitely an evidence that the people living in the rural areas are still wanting to see their boys and girls given the oppor - tunity to continue with their high school education. Nebraska has continued to make progress, such as that called to the at - ibt" 0 " .o' I* 6 rCader ln the laSt Biennial Rc P° rt °f this office. (See pages lo/ to 189.) The Future of American Secondary Education G. W. Rosenlof To recount the events of the past is a comparatively simple matter. That is the task of the historian. To properly evaluate the present, to sift the chaff from the whole wheat or to remove the dross from the precious metal is con - siderably more difficult. That is the task of the appraser. To envisage the future and build a structure that does not now exist— whether it be of wood or stone or of ideas or ideals expressed in poem, song or picture, or in man's institutions-is an exceedingly difficult, if not sometimes impossible, task. That is the work of the prophet— of him who combines his knowledge of the past and his appreciation of present circumstances with his hopes and aspirations for the morrow and makes for man a new target to shoot at; a new goal to attain: a new challenge to spur one on to greater achievements. A prophet it seems to me is one who has not only lived intensely while he has lived but he is one who has been endowed with an innate, almost divine insight and can by reason of these superior qualities create the as yet unattained and the un - completed and throw them out to us as ideas and ideals, expecting that some - where along the highway of life some one of a more practical turn of mind will take these ideas and ideals and build them into realities— things that are accomplished and that become a blessing and a satisfaction in the experiences of the many. A prophet in the sense in which' we use the term is one who sees into the future. He is a seer— the one to whom one would go for consultation as to the course of future events. In a certain sense, perhaps, we would be will- </seg>
            <seg id="p108">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT . ' . ■ . - .■ ing to accord to him another responsibility, that of preaching righteousness and of molding public opinion in behalf of higher standards. At the outset we disclaim any right to be considered a prophet. We do not regard ourselves as possessed of unusual insight into the future. The writer is merely a dreamer so far as this particular occasion is concerned and is asking you to follow his thinking so far as you can, not so far as to do violence to your own sense fo reasonableness. The American Secondary School has not existed so long but that all of us can recount many of the events connected with its development. Although there was an effort made in 1621 to establish a secondary school in Virginia, we have no information to lead us to believe that one was established prior to the one reported at Boston in 1635. This was a Latin Grammar School, the function of which was that of preparing a selected group of students for college. Out of this institution grew the Public Academy in Philadelphia, first established in 1751, and intended to provide a broader scope of training. Benjamin Franklin, you will recall, proposed such a school in which stu - dents might be taught "everything that is useful and everything that is orna - mental. But art is long and time is short. It is therefore proposed that they learn those things that are likely to be most useful and most ornamental; regard being had to the several professions for which they are intended." Three schools were provided — the "Latin School", the "English School", and the "Mathematical School". ■ . ■ ■ . The third type of secondary school was represented by the English Classi - cal School, founded in Boston in 1821. The significance of this school lay in the fact that it represented America's first attempt to afford to the' youth a fr'ce secondary education at public expense. This school definitely sought to Inculcate habits of industry and application essential to leading a virtuous and useful life and fit an individual for active living. It is not to be under - stood that this institution did not accept as one of its responsibilities the pre - paring of its students for admission to college. The next development in secondary education was that represented by the upward ind downward extensions of the four year program to Include the upp:r two grades of the elementary school and the lower two years of college. Contrary to common knowledge the first extension of the secondary school was an upward one, first occurring at Joliet, Illinois, in 1902. The extension down - ward was first noted in the reorganization which took place at Berkeley, Cali - fornia, in 1909. Historically, the extension of secondary education has been exceedingly rapid, more particularly in the case of the downward extension. . Evidences prior to 1930 or 1932 very clearly pointed to the time when our junior-senior high school would represent an almost universal acceptance. At the present moment we find ourselves somewhat skeptical as to how soon if ever we will attain to a universal practice in this regard. . </seg>
            <seg id="p109">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION In a similar manner we find the Junior College movement going forward with increased momentum prior to about 1930 to 1932. Naturally, the same factors seriously disturbing our whole educational scheme are very forcefully affecting the reorganization of the higher education. The transition from a highly selective institution — an institution primarily concerned wth fitting students for college to one far less selective and provid - ing an educational program of great extensiveness. has been both rapid and far-reaching. It has been unparalleled by any other development in the entire history of education. From a half students in 1900 the enrollment in our secondary schools has grown to the almost unbelievable figure of five and one-half millions, or thereabouts. Today there are as many graduates coming from our secondary schools as were enrolled in the high schools in 1900. Paral - leling the increased enrollments have been increases in the number of teachers employed, the expenditures for teaching equipments and increased facilities for properly housing all these people. The extension of curricular offerings reads like a fairy tale. Instead of nine courses of study characteristic of the schools in 1890, we now find our schools providing as many as 250 separate courses of study. When one considers the many developments in techniques of instruction, the introduction of activities programs, the differentiated curricula for meeting individual needs, interests and abilities, the extensive programs of health and physical education, the guidance program, character education, the fine arts and the vocations, student counseling and all the rest, one is fairly bewildered by the magnitude of the task which confronts us. It is not unreasonable to say that the task of administrator and supervisor of secondary education has become almost Herculean in its nature. The respon - sibilities are more varied than those of any other profession and require a type of training wholly unlike that of almost any other executive officer that one might name. And as for the future, nothing to our way of thinking presents a greater challenge to one who would achieve a name for himself and a place in the galaxy of professional leaders in American education. Truly to use a Biblical expression, 'the fields are white unto the harvest and the workers are. few". The opportunity for the leader in secondary education was never so great. There never was a time when we were more in need of leaders in this par - ticular field. Consider some of the demands to be made of us as administrators, super - visors and teachers in the secondary school. First of all, we would call attention to our basic philosophy of secondary education. </seg>
            <seg id="p110">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT ■ The secondary school of tomorrow will be an institution primarily con - cerned with the task of not only preparing students to earn a living but to live a life. This preparation wilt be practically universal in so far as it refers to the youth of the appropriate years of the secondary school level. Instead of there being some fifty to fifty-five per cent of our youth enrolled, we will find that because of the extension of the compulsory attendance level to eight - een years, if not higher, our secondary schools .will within the next decade find their enrollments increased to a figure representing seventy-five to eighty per cent or more of those between the ages of sixteen and eighteen years. More than this, instead of twenty per cent of our high school people graduating we will see the numbers increasing until fifty per cent or more will be seeking further educational opportunities on the junior college level. What other answer can there be when the vast changes in industry make it impossible to absorb the present numbers who are waiting to be absorbed. What other answer can there be when government, itself, makes it impossible for business to utilize the children in the activities of labor and trade and denies to youth under eighteen the right, save under the most abnormal circumstances, to become a self-supporting individual. Government and business have thus both made it compulsory upon society to assume responsibility for youth for at least two years longer than has heretofore been the case. There is but one way out and that is to guarantee an extension of educational opportunity. Until very recently there was no such great occasion for concern over this matter. Today, faced by changes in government and society, we are con - fronted by a mandatory condition wherein the schools will be expected and required to provide far more extensive opportunities for education and reduce to a much smaller degree the extent of selectivity now existent. In turn, there will be a consequent extension of curricular and extra-curricular activities to justify and make valuable the school experiences of these increased numbers. The second development in view of the extension of educational oppor - tunity will be the further reorganization of secondary education itself. Hereto - fore all reorganization has, in the main, been prompted by a desire either to insure greater economy of time or to guarantee a greater degree of integration. The first of these factors is no longer quite so valid. An economy of time may have been! important at one time. It is difficult to reconcile this with the lessened demand for new and additional workers. Industry can, as we have already in - dicated, no longer absorb them. The government, itself, has in recent months made the employment of these youth impossible. On the other hand, reorganization on the basis of greater integration is still a potent factor. The bridging of the gap between the three units of our present elementary and secondary schools will continue to be an exceedingly important factor. Similarly, the present gap between high school and junior college will need to be bridged. The time may come when, in the words of Briggs, we have developed an educational program from kindergarten to college that is gradual, continuous and unitary. </seg>
            <seg id="p111">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Just what this reorganization will be is difficult to say. Just now that type of organization which will be most effective in improving educational endeavor must be sought for. It is doubtful whether or not there is a sufficient body of data that will definitely demonstrate whether a 6-3-3. or 6-2-4. or a 6-6 or even a 6-4-4 plan, is best. Of one thing we can be certain, perhaps, and that is that there will be found to be a positive correlation between the quality of instruction and the quality of organization. The administrator of secondary education will determine his organization upon the basis of its contribution to an effective educational program. That there will be any universal acceptance of a single plan is to be doubted. In fact, there should not be and in all prob - ability could not be. From the standpoint of financial considerations, an economy of time will not be so important a factor in the future as in the past. From the standpoint of ability to afford, one type of organization will be found to be more effective than another. It seems very clear that some very certain types of consolida - tion will be effected within the next few years that will tend to materially re - duce the number of separate secondary school units. The continuance of the small two to four or even six teacher secondary schools is more and more being looked upon, by not only our professional people but our lay men as well, as a practice of doubtful value. What, with our improved means of communication and transportation and the demands for more extensive curricula to suit the needs of our more non-selective groups, we will find ourselves forced in the interest of both economy and effective education to provide for the larger units. In fairness to demands of a changing social order, a more complex organization of society and the increased demands being made upon the youth of our day we can do no less than provide for that type of organization that will insure both financial economy and more universal equality of educational opportunity. A recently published monograph dealing with the reorganization of secon - dary education holds to the assumption that comprehensiveness and consistency represent valid criteria for judging the possible effectiveness of school or - ganization. Not only will our philosophy of secondary education vitally affect re - organization of the "framework" of our schools, but it should and eventually will very definitely affect the curricula of our reorganized schools. The program of studies will first of all be greatly extended. The reasons for this are already so obvious as to require no particular defense. In the second place, the ar - rangement of this program into various and greatly divergent curricular pat - ters is equally apparent to all who have given the matter any thought at all. It is exceedingly strange that we have thus far failed to fully comprehend the significance attaching to the new demands being made upon us. Changes in the curricula and extension of the numbers of course offerings, it is admitted, are present in most schools. Recognition of the increased number of course </seg>
            <seg id="p112">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT offerings and the necessity for such increases are much talked about. But if you were to accept the challenge and proceed to an analysis of currlcular patterns now provided for in our seondary schools, we are certain you would be utterly dumbfounded by the discoveries you would make. You would quickly admit that the secondary school is still largely a "college-preparatory" school and not much more. And just now when the economy axe is falling at the root of the tree, the very course offerings that have been provided for that portion of our high school population who will perhaps never find it possible to continue their educational endeavors in an institution of higher learning, are the first to be "laid low" and taken out of the program. An even more significant, were you to analyze the syllabi provided for so-called academic courses, you will discover to your utter dismay that some of them are as archaic in their content and selection of materials of instruction as to do credit to some of the more maligned lecture courses of some of our college professors. A revolution in curriculum reorganization is altogether in order. Nor will this reorganization be altogether directed by college people. The reorgani - zation will begin in the secondary schools and be directed by those who are closely associated and fully acquainted with the youth that are to be educated. Who is better able to take the lead? Utilize the college people? Yes! But not to the extent of permitting them to dictate the policies to be adopted and the subject matter to be accepted. Who is better able to determine objectives of the secondary school than the secondary, school people themselves? But, you say, what of university admission requirements? These will take care of themselves. As a matter of fact, there is a very pronounced tendency for institutions of higher learning to "soft-pedal" specific subject matter require - ments and to "loud-pedal" such matters as the principal's own recommenda - tions in behalf of students who have completed the secondary school curricula 1 and desire to continue in college. The college people will similarly place more confidence in their own methods of evaluation of student ability as determined by general tests of ability to do scholarly work on a higher level and as de - termined by their own program of personal guidance and personal direction. We are disposed to believe that college people have been more ready to go with us in this matter than we have been willing to believe. The secondary. school curriculum of any student will be determined on the basis of individual needs of students and of society's demands as they hinge upon these students. The inclusion of the so-called traditional courses will be a matter of no concern whatsoever save in so far as they vitally contribute to the needs of that student and make him a more effective memb:r of society. To rebuild the curriculum prc-supposes our willingness to experiment and be experimented upon. A scientific attitude and a scientific approach are both essential. That there will be a greater amount of experimentation goes with- </seg>
            <seg id="p113">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION out saying. That there will be a break-down of loyalty to the traditional can - not be doubted and that a lessened emphasis upon specific subject-matter re - quirements as basic to any consideration of a changed curriculum is very cer - tain. Who can doubt that when we have clearly formulated our philosophies; discovered the needs of our modern social order; evaluated the contribution of secondary education to the proper training of future citizens and turned loose our schools to those equipped to carry on researches and investigation in the field of our curricula — who can doubt that we will not have a better instru - ment for society's improvement and for the individual's opportunity for per - sonal growth and satisfaction. The fourth item relates to the library. The time has most certainly come when the library will take its place alongside the gymnasium and athletic field as a core institution within the school. The extension of our vast funds of hu - man knowledge; the complexity of the organization of knowledge; the enlarged demands for breadth of human knowledge; the increased experimental oppor - tunities; the increased facilities of communication which have broken down na - tional and international barriers and made possible the greater approach to a world-mindedness and world-wide neighborliness have all become vital factors in this demand for library facilities. On the other hand, our changed techniques of instruction, our acceptance of a new philosophy of learning, the introduction of the project and problem and unit as bases of organization of subject matter; the organization of the traditional school subjects under such headings as health, social studies, science and methematics, the fine arts, the industrial arts, languages and literature are such as to make imperative another type of teaching. This new technique de - mands not a single basic text but a multitude of texts and sources of informa - tion. These will have to be accumulated in a library of carefully selected ma - terials representing the many major classifications of human knowledge, all of which will have been properly catalogued and shelved and made easily avail - able to the students and instructors. If teaching is to be live and virile; if it is to be challenging to students: if it is to result in activity which, as Kilpatrick would say, leads to further activity; if it is to be vitally related to present day life and living; then that teaching must be dependent upon not a single text but a growing library of properly selected, well classified texts and books of reference in many fields of human knowledge. The writer is fully convinced that in the erection of our school plants in the future we will give as much attention to the building of adequate library quarters as we have, in the past, given to the erection of "stadia" and athletic fields. It may be that the library will become the radiating center of the entire physical plant. Why not? It goes without saying that one of the very important tasks of the teacher </seg>
            <seg id="p114">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT will be the instruction of youth in the proper use of the library and its resources. The fifth consideration is extension of the use of school facilities — the school plant and all its appurtenances thereto. The secondary school of the future will not confine its program of studies and activities to any limited num - ber of hours per day and days per week and months per year. In the first place, the wealth represented in these institutions is such as to require that the fullest possible use be made of all the facilities. , These institutions should not be closed down and kept idle when there is so much need for the training they can provide. In the second place, there will be no limiting of facilities to persons of certain ages — shall we say the years of 1.4 to 18. Not only will all adolescents be given an opportunity for extended educational opportunity but educational advantages will be afforded to all persons, old or young, who are prepared to take advantage of educational opportunities afforded by these schools. If for no other reason than that we will be confronted with the problem of wise use of leisure time, will we be required to extend the facilities of our schools. Many means for thus using our educational facilities will come to mind. Certainly, we are all agreed that part-time instruction, supervised and non-su - pervised correspondence or extension study under public school auspices, the radio, the motion pictures, physical education and health programs, the fine and industrial arts and the various courses of classroom instruction will all find their proper place in such an extended educational plan. It is very definite that all of these factors will have to come in for their proper consideration in the very near future. For example, the promotion of a program of physical education and health and of the fine and industrial arts is as certain to come as anything we might mention. The place of the radio and motion picture are more and more coming to be considered as of first im - portance in any developing program of secondary education. The responsibility of the present generation for the welfare of the coming generation cannot be set aside. We must play fair with the next generation of citizens if the American ideal of good government is to be furthered. High School Accreditment The University of Nebraska maintains a list of accredited schools, the graduates of which are admitted to the University (and to nearly all of the colleges and universities of the United States) without entrance examinations in subjects that are properly certified as completed within these schools. Unless a graduate of an accredited school, a candidate for admission must be prepared to take examination in those subjects in which entrance credits are desired; pro - vided that graduates of non-accredited four-year high schools may be excused from taking the academic examination by passing an intelligence test with a standing that shows ability to do the work of a college freshman. </seg>
            <seg id="p115">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION "Accredited" schools are such as are found to meet the "Standards of Ac - credited Schools" to a degree that meets the approval of the University Com - mittee on Accredited Schools. There is now but one list of schools fully accredited to the University of Nebraska. For the convenience of the smaller communities, the University establishes a list of "Minor Accredited Schools," the graduates of -which may receive from the senior high school eleven units on credentials giving them con - ditional admission to college. Additional credits can be secured by completing satisfactorily thirty hours of college work or by examination. Variations from the standards are being permitted to meet local conditions, as may seem proper to the Committee. ' All standards are considered, and must be met to a reasonable degree. By an arrangement entered into by this department and the University of Nebraska, the University Committee on Accredited Schools receives from and accepts reports of school visitation made by the officials of the State Depart - ment of Public Instruction. Report blanks for making application and for set - ting forth all data necessary to proper consideration of all schools seeking ac - creditment are prepared jointly, this office being responsible for all administra - tive and supervisory details connected with the handling of these reports and the program of school visitation.

The object of this association is that of establishing closer relationships between the secondary schools and the institutions of higher learning within the group of states in the North Central area as well as between other areas of the United States. </seg>
            <seg id="p121">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Membership in this organiration is entirely optional and voluntary It is a mutual society, the Constitution of which provides that all decisons of the associate bearing on the policy and management of secondary schools and institutions of higher education are understood to be purely advisory in char - acter. In order to realize the above objectives, several other immediate aims have been set up, among these being the following: First, to bring about a better acquaintance, a keener sympathy and a heartier spirit of co-operation among the leaders of the secondary schools and colleges by enabling them to meet at personal conferences at least once a year; second, to encourage the free discussion of common educational problems and to devise ways and means of solving these problems through the exchange of views at conferences and through published reports; and, third, to promote the physical, intellec - tual and moral well-being of students in secondary schools and colleges by call- Ing attention to the need for proper sanitary conditions In school buildings adequate library and laboratory facilities, defensible curriculum organizations', high standards of scholarship and professional achievement among teachers, scientific practices among administrators and, finally, to suggest better ways in which adequate financial support may be given to the carrying on of the necessary programs of secondary education. As indicated, membership is purely voluntary. There Is and can be no compulsion. Any school choosing to become a member of the Association may make application therefor and shall be visited by the proper officials authorized to make such visitations and, having been found to meet the desir - able standards or qualifications as set up. will be recognized for approval. The significance of this plan of regional accredltment lies in the fact that the graduates of such institutions as are accredited to the Association are ad - mitted to practically every higher institution of learning in the United States Neither does this Association seek to control the schools when accredited either as regards their course of study, their curriculum, their plan of organization for administration and supervision, the personnel of their faculty, or any other of a number of factors generally considered in accreditment relations. This Association has approved the application of 123 public high schools and 14 private high schools in Nebraska. Schools so accredited are indicated on preceding pages and are designated by a dagger placed to the left of the name of each school. Approved Non-Accredited High Schools Throughout the State of Nebraska in practically every county in the state will be found many communities in which some high school education is being provided. These districts are, however, not able, because of not only financial circumstances but because of the small number of students enrolled, to maintain the same standards as those obtaining in school districts where the high school program has been fully accredited in accordance with the regulations set up by the University of Nebraska and as provided for in the law. </seg>
            <seg id="p122">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Mos of these districts maintain nine and ten grades, with a lesser number maintaining eleven and twelve grade programs. In fact, the approved non - accredited list of high schools issued as of July 1, 1934, indicates a total of 259 approved schools. Thirty of these are four-year schools; 9, three-year schools; 215, two-year schools; and 5 one-year schools. The number of such approved! non-accredited high schools has tended to grow less and less. In 1932-33 there were 292 approved non-accredited high schools, this number being almost 35 less than it had been during previous years. A number of the schools, it is true, have automatically ceased to exist by reason of the fact that there seemed to be no apparent need for continuance of the high school program. The State Department of Public Instruction has taken the position that all youth of the appropriate high school age should have the advantages of the best high school privileges obtainable in any community. It has sought, therefore, to safeguard the best interests of the pupils by seeking to establish reasonable standards capable of being maintained in these districts wherein have been established approved non-accredited high school programs. The regulations or requirements under which these schools operate are such as to lead us to believe that our high school youth are being given an opportunity to secure a high school education of such quality as to insure a continuance of their further education in either accredited high schools or in colleges and universities. It is our belief that these approved high schools have contributed very much to educational progress throughout the state. All such approved high schools complying with the regulations as set up are privileged to col - lect high school tuition for non-resident students and are furthermore exempt from the payment in whole or in part of the county-wide high school tax as provided for in Section 79-902 of the Nebraska School Laws. The | local school district determines whether or not a high school shall be maintained. It is not the province of this office to insist upon the mainte - nance of i these schools nor is it the province of this office to insist upon the discontinuance of high school programs where these have been heretofore estab - lished. It is the function of this office to advise only as to the establishment of such . schools. Once they have become established it becomes our duty to Inspect these schools and determine the extent to which they are meeting the standards as set up. Section 79-902 of the Nebraska School Laws provides specifically for the approval of high schools. In connection with the operation of this law this department has frequently met difficult problems relating to approval for exemp - tion from the county-wide high school tax or for the collection of free high school tuition for non-resident students. The quality of academic work being done in the school, the qualifications of the teachers employed, the general status of equipment and Instructional materials and the financial ability of the local school district to support a </seg>
            <seg id="p123">1 OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION high school program are factors taken into account when making decisions as to approval of these schools. The department has heretofore issued a bulletin entitled, "Rural and Village High Schools", which sets forth the requirements for high school ap - proval. In this bulletin the reader will find ample information for guidance in setting up a school and maintaining a program commensurate with the de - mands not only of the community but of this office. In setting standards for approved non-accredited high schools It has always been the aim of this of - fice to hold to #s high a standard of quality as is commensurate to the ability to afford and as nearly In harmony with the standards now being maintained in accredited schools as is possible. Justification for this is evident to all. Always and everywhere the interest of the students being educated is the first concern. The provisions of the law relative to high school approval read as follows: "Section 79-902. Free High School Education. Free High School Tuition, Tax Levy, Collection, Fund. The county superintendent of each county where a county high school is not maintained shall within thirty (30) days after the annual meeting certify to the county board of super - visors or commissioners the number of qualified pupils as provided In Sec - tion 79-901, C. S. Supp., Neb., 1931, whose parents or guardians have applied to the county superintendent for free high school tuition privi - leges, the amount necessary to pay the high school tuition of said pupils . 'for the ensuing school year at the rate of Two Dollars and twenty-five cents ($2.25) per week or fraction thereof, and a list of school districts which have been approved by the State Superintendent of iPubllc Instruc - tion as schools qualified to grant free public high school education to non - resident pupils under the provisions of this Act. Upon receipt of said certificate, the said county board shall levy on all taxable property in the said county a sufficient tax to pay said high school tuition, as certified by the county superintendent: Provided said board shall exclude from said levy all the actual valuation on all of the taxable property of any district in which is maintained an approved four year high school, shall exclude from said levy three-fourths of the actual valuation of the taxable prop - erty of any district in which is maintained an approved three .year high school, shall exclude from said levy one-half of the actual valuation of the taxable property of any district in which is maintained an approved two year high school and shall exclude from said levy one-fourth of the actual valuation of the taxable property of any district in which is main - tained an approved one year high school. . . ." In carrying out the provisions of the above law, this office supplies the county superintendents of the state with proper application blanks in July. These application blanks are forwarded by the county superintendent to the directors of all those school districts desiring approval of their high school work. Each of these school districts files its application for approval in the </seg>
            <seg id="p124">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT office of the county superintendent. This official, after verifying the facts and approving the application, signs the same and forwards it to the Of - fice of the State Superintendent not later than the 20th of September when the high school in its various grades has been actually organized and in full operation. Final approval of schools is not given until June 1st of each year by the State Department of Public Instruction, at which time county superin - tendents, county clerks, and county treasurers are notified of the approved schools in their respective counties. A school or added grades must be in actual operation before it receives the consideration of this office for approval.. Exemption from the tax levy or any part of the high school tax levy depends upon the approval as reported by the State Superintendent for the year just past. This seems to be the most logical course of procedure under the law as it exists in the statute book at the present time. Classes of high schools. For the purposes of approval, public high schools are divided into two classes: (1) Accredited high schools and minor accredited high schools. Refer to report on accredited schools. (2) Approved non-accredited high schools. In addition to those schools accredited to the University of Nebraska, there are a number of smaller schools offering one, two, three, or four years of high school work. The schools that meet the requirements of the State Department of Public Instruction are approved as one year, two year, three year, or four year high schools, and are eligible to collect free high school tuition for non-resident pupils. Refer to the list of approved non-accredited high schools. This office has sought to keep in as intimate touch with the approved high schools as is possible. It is our desire that all of these schools be visited by representatives of this office to the end that these persons may competently advise as to the b?st steps to take in providing for educational efficiency and the carrying out of regulations and requirements. This office will seek to ad - vise professionally to the end that the schools may at all times operate under conditions that will insure success. [■''■■ Certain denominational schools other than the public schools have been approved by this office for academic purposes only. These schools are not privileged to collect free high school tuition money as paid by the district, county or state. The Constitution of the State of Nebraska, Article VII, Section 11, provides that, "No sectarian instruction shall be allowed in any school or institution supported in whole or in part by the public funds set apart for educational purposes."

            <seg id="p131">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION A comparison of these statistics will show that while there is a decrease in the number of schools providing for the program and approved by this office and while there is a slight decrease in the number of students enrolled, and consequently in the number of graduates reported from the normal training department, the numbers reported do not in any degree indicate a lessened demand for the continuance of the program. There is every reason to believe from the statistics indicated herein that the citizens of Nebraska are determined that their children shall continue to receive the type of training that will pre - pare them for doing a very satisfactory type of teaching in the rural schools. In January of last year this office reported to the county superintendents at their annual meeting certain data concerning the status of teachers in the one- and two-room rural schools and certain other information indicative of the continued demand for high school normal training. This office reported at that time that the typical rural teacher of 1931-32 had had two years of experience, whereas the teacher in 1932-33 had had practically two and one - half years of experience. In 1929-1930 the typical teacher was new to her position: that is, 62 out of every 100 were in new positions. In 1932-33 about 50 out of each 100 were new to their positions. In the matter of training the typical teacher of the earlier period had had about ten weeks of work beyond the high school level. Two years later this median level had been raised to at least thirteen, if not fifteen, weeks beyond the high school level. It is en - tirely within reason to believe that during this past year the number of teach - ers new to their positions had continued to grow less and that the tenure of teachers had continued to increase somewhat It is also very certain that the median level of training of teachers in the rural schools last year was in all probability fifteen to eighteen weeks, with from thirty to forty per cent of the teaching force having one to two years of college training. The salaries were, of course, very much reduced and in the main repre - sented decreases of anywhere from twenty to fifty per cent. Conditions in the current year would indicate that the changes in the status of teachers has tended to improve, although the extent of such improvement is in all probability very small. In spite of the economic stress and strain, the rural population of Nebraska has not seen fit to take any more radical steps this year to further reduce the efficiency of their school program. The Normal Training Program Is Justified The last issued Biennial Report of this office set forth certain conclusions respecting the high school normal training program, to wit: 1 lFor a more complete discussion of each of these points, we would call the read - er s attention to pages 201-205, Thirty-second Biennial Report, January, 1932. </seg>
            <seg id="p132">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT First, that the continuance of the high school normal training program has not in anywise interfered with the normal improvement of the status of our teachers from the standpoint of experience, tenure or training and that its continuance is not at all a factor that has been in anywise respons - ible for the status of the- salaries paid. Second, that the high school normal training classes have not in the past been furnishing an ever increasing flood of teachers for rural school purposes. Third, that the high school normal training program can be conducted on the basis of its having laid the groundwork of professional training that has been most effective in our rural schools. Fourth, that the high school normal training classes have been and are still furnishing the bulk of our teachers for the one-room rural schools. These classes, it will be found, will necessarily continue to function for at^least two, if not four, years to come. Fifth, that the program, itself, has been improved very materially through the introduction of rural sociology and economics as one of the distinct re - quirements. Sixth, that the evidence from the reports on file in the office would seem to indicate that most of the communities now offering high school normal training would continue their program as long as there was a demand on the part of these young people for the training and as long as any portion of these people can be definitely located in rural teaching positions. Seventh, the weight of evidence a year ago was preponderantly favorable to the high school normal training program. Eighth, that the present economic crisis does, in and of itself, justify the continuance of the program. Such, In brief, represents the conclusions at which this office arrived, bas - ing the same on the data which were available to us at that time. The problem of supplying adequately trained teachers to our rural schools has always been an exceedingly significant one and presents a problem, the solution of which is still a matter of great importance to the development of our program of rural education in Nebraska. The most authoritative report it has been our privilege to see has been that of the National Society for the Study of Education which reveals very clearly what the situation is throughout the land. Nebraska, in comparison to these other states, stands in a favored position. It is neither the worst nor the best among the states in the union. In fact, it is. one of fourteen states that reports its typical rural teacher to be a high school graduate with </seg>
            <seg id="p133">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION additional training in college, anywhere from six -weeks to thirty-six weeks in duration. There are seventeen states all much more favored in every other re - spect than Nebraska whose programs rate somewhat higher than that in Ne - braska. There are, of course, states like California. Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Ohio, and Rhode Island, among a number of others, that now require two full years of professional training beyond the high school level. Professor Mabel Carney of Teachers College, Columbia University, in dis - cussing the subject of the preparation of rural teachers, states what in her judgment are the major problems and issues involved in the program for the preparation of rural teachers. Among the problems which she raises are these: First, is specialized training needed for rural teaching, and if so, what amount and type of differentiation is desirable? Second, what follow-up and extension activities are desirable? Third, what type of organization promotes pre-service and in-service prep - aration for rural teachers? Fourth, to what extent do candidates specifically prepared for the rural schools actually locate in these schools and how long do they remain there? Fifth, is our limited certification program for one-teacher and semi-graded schools a wise one? Sixth, why do the normal schools and teachers colleges fail to make ade - quate provision for the preparation of rural teachers? And why are not the trained normal school graduates not attracted to the rural schools? And finally, what is the function and the program of the state in this whole matter? If space permitted we should like to have discussed at length each of these problems and presented the views as set forth by Professor Carney. Miss Carney, however, summarizes her reports and from her summary we draw the following statements: 1. The need for trained teachers today is in our rural schools. Elsewhere there is a surplus of teachers. 2. The graduates of our teachers colleges are increasingly going into our one-teacher, two-teacher and consolidated schools, due to the surplus of teach - ers that we find in America and the accompanying demand upon the part of our urban centers that all teachers employed by these centers be experienced. 3. There is an increased Interest in the differentiated preparation of teach - ers for the rural schools, and there is a growing conviction among executives of teachers colleges that the training of teachers for the rural schools should </seg>
            <seg id="p134">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT be of a differentiated type. This is particularly true in the industrialized areas of the New England and the middle Atlantic states. In the agricultural regions of the middle-west where rural life is less affected by the cities' influence, rural teaching ranks with other phases of the profession on a basis of free choice. The consequence is that differentiation in preparation is no so pronounced. 4. That the American rural heritage as best exemplified in our typical farm life contains elements of essential educational value which should be rightly un - derstood, appreciated and transferred to succeeding generations. Hence, the justi - fication of some orientation course In "Modern American Civilization" which will explain the industrialization that is taking place and its effects upon farm and city life. 5. Approximately 80 per cent of our teacher training institutions have at - tempted in some extent more or less defined to provide for specific training for teachers who will be employed in our rural schools. 6. The preparation of public school teachers is a state function and the educational forces of most states are attempting to unite in working out a comprehensive program for teacher training, with due emphasis upon the needs of the rural schools. In this, the larger economic and social needs of the coun - try are also being simultaneously attacked in so far as possible because of their controlling influence upon all phases of rural education and social work. Miss Carney concludes that the preparation of rural teachers is still the most neglected extensive and challenging program in the whole field of teacher training, involving not only the basic welfare of rural life but much that has thus far been deemed Important and essential in our whole national character and stability. Miss Carney's analysis of the situation is one that should be peculiarly interesting and, certainly, challenging to all who are vitally con - cerned with the problems of rural life and education. The State Department of Public Instruction is no less concerned. We have for more than five years been very much concerned with an adequate solution of this problem. Our position, we feel, has been altogether defensible. We have insisted at all times that so far as our program in Ne - braska is concerned it is not ideal, but it does represent the best practical solu - tion that has as yet been found. The State Department of Public Instruction wishes to clearly set forth that it has no quarrel whatever with any higher institution of learning that seeks to set up and provide for an adequate program of specialized rural teacher training. We believe that it is preeminently, and certainly primarily, in an agricultural state like Nebraska, the responsibility of any one or all of our state teachers colleges to project a program of rural teacher training, a program that would provide the finest training and instruction now considered essential for the right training of rural teachers. This department believes </seg>
            <seg id="p135">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION that it is a distinct function of our four state teachers colleges to select as members of their staff persons who have a very distinct and real interest and appreciation of the problem of rural education. The program of rural teacher training should in all probability be a core function in each of these institutions to the end that there may come from these schools persons not only academi - cally and professionally trained but spiritually minded as regards the signif - icance of the problem of the rural school. Graduates of these departments should be disposed in mind, body and spirit to give most unselfish service in the rural communities. This office is conscious of the fact, however, that such a program in,, ad - dition to the functions now being cared for by the four state teachers colleges would be quite out of the question in a time of economic stress and strain such as that through which we are now passing. There are and would be no number of practical difficulties standing in the way of any immediate carrying forward of such a program. It seems, therefore, that the high school normal e training program should be continued until such a time as the present economic crisis has been successfully passed and until such a time as we have started on the upward climb to a return of more prosperous conditions. For the im - mediate future we must therefore think in terms of the welfare of the rural schools, themselves. The agricultural portions of our population in Nebraska, which comprise from sixty to seventy per cent of our population, have been sorely dealt with in recent months. They are, themselves, in no position to extend their pro - gram of education nor to recognize higher achievements in the way of teacher training programs. They can neither send their sons and daughters away to school to secure this superior training nor can they at the present time afford to offer salaries in the rural schools sufficiently high to justify the additional cost Involved in providing for superior training. It would seem, therefore, that the continuance of the program in the interest of our rural schools is, for at least the coming biennium, a necessity. This office pledges its support to the continued improvement of that pro - gram as now being carried on. The efficiency of the program as it has been carried on under the direction of the present administration needs no defense. The State Department is distinctly proud of the splendid work being done in the high school normal training classes throughout Nebraska. The Depart - ment has no hesitancy in saying that the normal training supervisors as a group represent as fine a staff of trained teachers as one can find anywhere. These teachers are thoroughly conscious of the demands for training; they are in complete sympathy with the present difficulties being faced in our rural areas and are indefatigable In their efforts to provide for the best kind of training of our high school normal trainers, to the end that these may go out wih a specific training for the job and with a fine attitude toward the job. </seg>
            <seg id="p136">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT The Character Education Program It does not seem necessary to here review the historical background attending the development of the Nebraska program of character building. Previous reports of diis office and the several bulletins published set this forth in detail. Senate File 236. which became a law on April 20, 1927. has been observed in so far as it has been humanly possible. This office has no apology whatever to offer for the effort it has put forth during the past eight years in making this law effective. The schools of Nebraska, particularly the rural ones, have valiently endeavored to stand back of the program in its entirety with the result that at the present time there are throughout the state of Ne - braska some four thousand or more rural school districts in which Knighthood of Youth clubs have been oganized and in which there are enrolled certainly not less than sixty to seventy thousand boys and girls. Just about a year ago an inquiry was made into the status of the program. Blanks intended for securing data in connection with this inquiry were sent to each of the county superintendents, certain of these, in turn, to be distrib - uted directly to teachers, school patrons and community leaders. The county superintendent was also asked to report upon certain informations desired. The responses to these Inquiries were most gratifying and a vast amount of material was accumulated which not only gave us a picture of what was being done but which served to direct the efforts of this office in the further per - fecting of the program of character building. A review of the returns from the county superintendents presents a most gratifying picture. For example, in forty-three counties for which complete infomation was supplied, and upon which we reported to the county superin - tendents a year ago, there were organized 1798 separate Knighthood of Youth clubs. In these counties there was an increase this past year of 215 over the number organized the year preceding. For the school year 1932-33 in these forty-three counties there was an enrollment of 24,600 boys and girls in Knight - hood of Youth clubs. In November of the school year 1933-34 this number had increased in these counties by something over 4,000. The organization of county councils in the state, we regret to state, has not thus far shown a great deal of promise. This is in all probability due to the inability of this office to supply sufficient supervisors to carry on the organizational work and work directly with the county superintendents in setting up councils. Three counties a year ago had organized a county coun - cil, these being Chase, Johnson and Keith. Nuckolls County and Pawnee County reported favorably upon the possibility of organization. During the current biennium the Knighthood of Youth Club Guide was revised in its entirety. A Junior Service League bulletin, intended for the guidance of school officials in the development of a citizenship and character </seg>
            <seg id="p137">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION building program in the junior and senior high schools, has been written, and a third bulletin dealing with the adult's part in a character education program has been provided. This last named bulletin is intended to acquaint parents, church workers, community leaders and citizens in general with the part that all of these persons may and perhaps should play in co-operating with the schools in the development of a finer type of citizenship. A fourth bulletin, the Knighthood of Youth. A. Teachers Guide, was reprinted with slight re - visions. The Nebraska program posits good citizenship to be the result of right attitudes of mind and habits of conduct fixed in a natural and normal environ - ment through oft repeated experiences and situations. Coupled with this is the belief that success, or the feeling of success, rather than failure should be a dominant factor in all situations. To the end that there might be introduced into the schools heretofore more or less formal program something more characteristic of life itself, Ne - braska has sought to utilize the so-called "activities program" and has urged the organization of the life of the school into those natural and desirable groups of youth after the manner of the dominant interests and activities of the individuals themselves. A pupil organization for activities, therefore, is essential to the success of the plan. Such a program gives to the students an opportunity for making choices between right and wrong. It gives an opportunity for the exercising of right choices and the fixing of certain desirable habits, all of which occur under the sympathetic guidance of teachers and other supervisory or administrative leaders. It is assumed that wrong choices will sometimes be made, but even these, it is expected, will be decidedly in. the minority. As it is noted In the bulletin. The Junior Service League, "such a program should provide an op - portunity for character building through pupil activities, classroom and school organization, and student self-government." Every organization of the school is thus given its own appropriate recog - nition and receives a stimulus to move forward in its own way and after its own manner. Such a stimulus should lead to a greater rather than a lesser realization of its own possibilities. In turn, each Individual member is thus permitted to exercise leadership without hindrance or handicap with the full consciousness that so long as he keeps in mind the welfare of the group he can go as far in his individual development as his own abilities warrant. The State Department of Public Instruction feels that the materials thus made available are ample for the time and furnish many concrete, helpful and practical suggestions for the guidance of teachers, school patrons and community leaders who accept responsibility for co-operating with the schools in the building of a finer type of citizenry. </seg>
            <seg id="p138">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT - This Department accepts as axiomatic the proposition that the schools alone are impotent to meet the task assigned them by the Legislature. It has a right to, expect that the men and women of every community will share in the responsibility of furthering such a noble undertaking for the develop - ment of a body of fine citizens fully fitted for the more abundant life In the new day. If society is not to disintegrate and become incapable of progress in the interests of a new world order, then certainly that society will have to accept responsibility for developing among its own members those right habits and ideals that are so necessary to its own well-being. Readers of this Biennial Report are urged to acquaint themselves with the character education bulletin dealing with the adult's part. We know of noth - ing that more clearly sets forth the opportunity for a co-operative program of citizenship training. That the reader may know something of the replies of certain county superintendents, we are including in our Biennial Report some of the materials brought to the attention of the county superintendents at their annual meeting in January. 1934. The couny superintendents in evaluating the Knighthood of Youth pro - gram were very positive in their beliefs that the program had been exceedingly valuable. These persons were asked whether or not the Knighthood of Youth program had been favorable or unfavorable or had resulted in but little change with respect to each specific item. The reports of the forty-three county superintendents on these nine items follow: Favor- No Unfavor - able Change able 1. Change of pupil habits and ideals 41 1 0 2. Change of teacher habits and ideals 36 5 0 3. Development of pupil leadership 41 1 0 4. Development of teacher leadership 31 8 0 5. Development of pupil followership 35 6 0 6. Development of teach followership 28 10 0 7. Increased carry-over from home to school 33 6 0 8. Increased carry-over from school to home 36 4 0 9. Increased community interest 33 4 0 An examination the above data will show that in practically every instance there was considerable agreement as to the favorableness of the Knighthood of Youth program in improving upon certain situations in the schools as these relate to the pupil or teacher conduct or as they relate to carry-over activities in the home and community. This office is not so presumptuous as to hold that the program has been completely perfected — far from it. There is much yet to be done. No pro- </seg>

Nebraska is every - where recognized as one of, if not the outstanding states in America, that has sought to attack this problem and do something of a positive sort. This Department recognizes also the splendid work being done in character educa - tion by such organizations as the Boy Scouts. Girl Scouts. Camp Fire Girls, citizenship clubs. Junior Red Cross. Girl Reserves. Y. M. C. A., Y. W. C. A.. 4-H clubs, and the like. Character Traits Developed by the Knighthood of Youth Mr. Kenneth H. Thompson. Superintendent of Schools at Broadwater. Nebraska, submitted, in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in the Colorado State Teachers College, a thesis, "Character Traits Developed by the Knighthood of Youth." In his investigation Mr. Thompson undertook to evaluate the work in character education of the Knighthood of Youth. It was further undertaken for the purpose of discovering what if any specific traits of character children in Knighthood of Youth clubs succeeded in developing. In making thb in - vestigation, Mr. Thompson sought to discover, from inquiries directed to the parents. Just what they thought the Knighthood of Youth program had done in developing better character traits. Mr. Thompson discovered very definitely what were the attitudes and the reactions of the parents of children in the Knighthood of Youth organizations with respect not only to the organization it - self, but with respect to the program and problems of character building. Some 457 replies from parents were received by Mr. Thompson. These were supple - mented by materials which the State Department of Public Instruction of Ne - braska had gathered. Six hundred twenty-four responses received by the State Superintendent's office were, therefore, included in the material studied by Mr. Thompson: To quote from this unpublished thesis, "It appears: (I) that the parents are very much in favor of the Knighthood of Youth because, (a) 95.12 per cent of the parents hear - tily approved of the time spent, (b) 92.34 per cent of the parents, who responded to the writer's questionnaire, preferred their children in a school that had the Knighthood of Youth, (c) 93.86 per cent of the parents think that the Knighthood of Youth has no bad effects, and (d) there were only 19 disapproval remarks to the Knighthood of Youth on the state's questionnaire; (2) the Knighthood of Youth has had a great influence on the thinking of the children who are members because, (a) 82.72 per cent of the parents had noticed a change In the attitude of their children, (b) 86.73 per cent of the parents on the state's ques - tionnaire believed that the Knighthood of Youth is a habit forming ac - tivity, and (c) 94.15 per cent of the responses on the state's question - naire indicated that one or more health habits were formed as a result </seg>

"It appears also: that even though the two questionnaires were sent to two different groups and at different times, the relationship between the questions that could be compared was very close, and In both cases a large majority of the people, 94.77 per cent on the writer's question - naire and 95.56 per cent on the state's questionnaire, thought that the Knighthood of Youth was very much worthwhile as a character devel - oping agency." Mr. Thompson further states, "It must be remembered that this is a study of the opinions of par - ents concerning the trait development which is attributed to the Knight - hood of Youth. It is possible that some of the traits were not developed by the Knighthood of Youth but by some other factor. However, the study covered a wide enough area to be of some value. Ideally there should have been two groups of children who had identical elements. One a control group and the other an experimental group. The experi - mental group would be under the influence of the Knighthood of Youth, while the control group would be under no direct character develop - ment influence. By such a method it might have been possible to meas - ure more accurately the influence of the Knighthood of Youth." </seg>
            <seg id="p141">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION It would appear, therefore, that the efforts of this department in carrying out the mandate of the people as expressed by its legislature has not been without success. It would seem, furthermore, that our efforts in the development of a character education program should not and must not stop at this point. </seg>

The first part will deal with the program for the school year of 1933-1934, the second part will deal with the program for the school year of 1934-1935. This divi - sion Is made because there are certain distinct differences in the programs au - thorized for the two years. PART I Federal Emergency Relief Funds With the passage of the National Recovery Act the Federal Government appropriated certain money for the relief of the needy unemployed. Several billions of dollars were appropriated for a program of public works and similar activities but not one dime was set aside originally for the support of education. Education Ignored The plan seemed to contemplate taking out of the ranks of industry boys and girls who were in need of further schooling and at the same time vacating the jobs which they held so that it might make a place for wage earners who had dependents. In Nebraska local school districts had exercised every possible economy, and this had meant that teaching staffs had been drastically reduced. As a re - sult the problem which confronted many of these school districts was critical, because with teaching staffs greatly reduced their enrollments had been in - creased. Those responsible for allocating the funds evidently Ignored the fact that it is just as vital that the schools be properly manned and that needy teachers be employed as it is that men bs put to work building highways and deepening river channels. </seg>
            <seg id="p144">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Teachers Bear the Brunt Our whole economic structure is directly affected whenever the buying power of the teacher is destroyed. Just why the teacher should have been selected to bear the brunt of our program of economic recovery was some - thing which we could not justify nor understand. We could readily appreciate the necessity for bringing teachers' salaries into line with the salaries paid in the business world, but we could not see any justifiable excuse for bringing them down to a point where they did not compare with wages paid for the lowest levels of employment Funds Are Inadequate The office was reluctant to give out any publicity in regard to the plans for "work relief" in education in Nebraska because it seemed that the sum which was to be made available was so small that with some two thousand teachers in - terested in securing employment, the funds allotted to Nebraska could not possi - bly take care of more than thirty or forty of this number at the most. We were reluctant to do anything which would lead unemployed teachers to believe that teaching positions were to be made available, knowing that so many must ulti - mately be disappointed. On the other hand, we felt it our duty to do every - thing within our power to secure every possible penny which might be allotted to Nebraska. Letter of Authorization On August 25th this office received the following letter from Mr. Harry L. Hopkins. Federal Relief Administrator: FEDERAL EMERGENCY RELIEF ADMINISTRATION Office of Administrator Washington August 19. 1933 To the Governors and State Emergency Relief Administrators: Your relief commission is authorized to use Federal relief funds now available or to be made available by the Federal Emergency Relief Ad - ministration to pay work relief wages to needy unemployed teachers or or other persons competent to teach and assign them to class rooms up through the eighth grade, provided; first, that these teachers are assigned by the relief offices to appropriate educational authorities who will have entire supervision over their activities; secondly, provided that they are assigned only to those schools which prior to this date have been ordered closed or partially closed for the coming school year because of lack of funds; third, this applies only to rural counties. State Relief Administra - tions are also authorized and urged to pay from above funds relief work wages to needy unemployed persons competent to teach adults unable to read and write English. This applies to cities as well as rural counties. Under no circumstances should relief funds be used to relieve counties of </seg>
            <seg id="p145">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION their proper responsibility for education, nor should these activities per - mit the substitution of relief teachers for regularly employed teachers. Yours very sincerely, (Signed) Harry L. Hopkins, - Administrator. A copy of this letter was mailed to County and City Superintendents in Nebraska and questionnaires were mailed out at the same time asking school officials to advise this office as to districts in need of assistance, giving us such information as assessed Valuation of district, mill levy, registered warrants unpaid and other similar information. A great many different things occurred to impede the actual setting up of an Emergency Educational Program. In the first place the responsibilities of administration were too widely scattered. While Mr. Hopkin's letter clearly authorized the use of Pederal Relief Funds for the payment of wages to needy unemployed teachers, and while this office was directed to set up an educational program, our office was not given authority to actually put these unemployed teachers at work, nor were we given authority to fix their salaries. No definite steps could be taken to relieve unemployed teachers until all plans had been submitted to, and approved by the Nebraska Relief Administrator. This office found itself between two fires. Bulletins from the National Relief Adminis - tration at Washington and from the U. S. Office of Education were constantly urging that we make haste in getting an educational program under way. On the other hand, we were unable to make definite headway because of the necessity of submitting all plans to the State Relief Organization. Obviously, we should keep in mind the fact that the whole program was new, not only to this office, but to those who were intrusted with the task of developing a relief set-up. No one individual connected with the State Relief organization had definite authority to act for the committee. While it is doubtful if any useful purpose would be served if we were to recount all of the efforts which were put forth by this office in attempting to get a program under way, it may be well to indicate a few of the adminis - trative difficulties for the benefit of those who might, at some future time, be called upon the deal with the same problem. Shortly after receiving word from Mr. Hopkins, we contacted the Chair - man of the State Relief Committee in order to find out just what steps should be taken to make this money available to needy unemployed teachers. He advised us that he had received no instructions from Washington and that it would be necessary for him to present the matter to the State Committee. Since the State Committee met only every two or three weeks, our first pro - posals could not receive prompt consideration. The State Committee, without definite instructions regarding an educational program, were inclined to move </seg>
            <seg id="p146">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT : . ■ ' ■ ' I ■ ■ ■ " rather slowly, and when we inquired as to whether or not we might proceed with our first plans, we were told that it would have to be submitted to the Relief Authorities at Washington. The first definite accomplishment under the authorization contained in the letter of August 19th came with the appointment of a teacher for a school in Boyd County at a salary of $35.00 per month. This salary was fixed by the State Relief Committee over the protest of the State Department of Education. The Chairman of the State Relief Committee had at first suggested the salary of $2.50 i to $3.00 a week for this teacher. Just how he expected a teacher to pay board and room and clothe herself in a respectable manner on this proposed wage has never been fully explained. | State Superintendent Attends Washington Conference At about this same time a conference of state superintendents of public instruction and commissioners of education was called to meet at Washington, D. C on September 14. State Superintendent Charles W. Taylor, of Ne - braska, attended this conference, at which addresses were made by the Honor - able Harry L. Hopkins and the Honorable George F. Zook, United States Commissioner of Education, and others. In these addresses statements were made repeatedly to the effect that education was to share definitely in the funds set aside under the National Recovery Act. Official representatives attending the conference were instructed to inaugurate programs at once which would definitely bring education into the recovery picture. Upon receiving this information. Superintendent Taylor forwarded definite instructions to the Deputy at Lincoln, directing him to organize classes in adult education and secure teachers for these classes. The Deputy State Superintendent again arranged for a conference with the Chairman of the State Emergency Relief Committee in order to advise him of the program as outlined. The Chairman of the State Relief Committee again advised this office that no definite steps could be taken until the whole plan could be reviewed and approved by the State Committee. Inasmuch as at this time no funds had been made available, and no instructions received as to how the State Department of Education might proceed, all efforts to go forward with the Adult Education Program were com - pletely blocked by action of the Chairman of the State Relief Committee. Relief Committee Rejects Plan For Adult Education For Omaha Under date of October 15, Mr. J. R. Hawke, Supervisor of Vocational Education for the Board of Education of the School District of the City of Omaha, on behalf of the Board of Education and the Omaha Chamber of Com - merce, submitted a program of Adult Education. The. plan was examined and approved by the State Superintendent of Education but was rejected by the State Relief Committee. The plan out - lined by Mr. Hawke follows: </seg>

In Qmaha. according to the National Re-Employment Departments rec - ords of unemployment, there are approximately 10,633 men and women listed m their flies. Of this number 1. 498. are between the ages of 16 and 21: 2.480 between the ages of 22 and 33; and 2,243 between the ages of 34 and 44. In addition to those registered with the National Re-employment Com - mittee I feel sure there are a considerable number who have not registered as being unemployed. For example, I know that there is a group of between 180 and 200 girls, 16 to 25 years of age. who are registered with the Y. W. C. A. Employment Department. I contacted this group last week and organized six different classes for them with an average enrollment of 30 to the class. Sufficient class room facilities are available in the city of Omaha to take care of approximately 10,000 enrollments. The Y. M. C. A the Y. W. C.

In addition, the grade school and high school facilities will be made available after the regular classes have been dismissed for the day. The Omaha plan is based on a minimum program of 150 classes operat - ing for a period of seven months, and the requirements to be met will be as follows: Number of classes 25 (Minimum) Number of teachers 50 (Minimum-it is possible that Average class enrollment 25 this number may be increased Opening Date Nov. 6. 1933 to 100 by giving part-time Closing Date June 6 , 1934 employment) Number of school days 140 (Approximately) Time reuqired for each class I'J^ hrs.

The local prevailing rate of pay for the! type of work performed should be paid if it is in excess of thirty cents per hour." The prevailing wage scale for teachers of adult classes in the city of Omaha is $1.75 per hour. In my opinion we would be following the spirit of the Relief Administration Act if the hourly rate were set at $1.50 an hour, with a minimum weekly rate of $20.00 for full-time teachers. The Omaha program of adult education will be conducted on the same basis that it has been carried on in the past. By this I mean that the Omaha Public School Board is allocating the same amount of money for adult edu - cation that it did last year. This will allow us to carry on our (program and serve the needs of a small portion of the adult population. The Federal Relief Funds will supplement the work of the Omaha public schbols and take care of a large number of unemployed men and women who cannot be served under the present conditions. In view of the foregoing facts, I hereby request, on behalf of the Omaha Board of Education, sufficient funds, dependent upon the amount allowed per hour, to pay for a minimum of 31,500 total teaching hours during the period November 6, 1933 to June 6, 1934. Hoping that you will see fit to approve this request and make a rec - ommendation to the State Relief Committee for funds, I am Very truly yours, (Signed) J. R. Hawke Foster Sets Up 5-Point Program The program outlined by Mr. Foster follows: About November 7, 1933, a representative of the Federal Office of Educa - tion, Mr. Terry C. Foster, called at the office and, after securing certain details as to the manner in which schools in Nebraska were supposed to function under the law, set up a program for work relief in education, which program was finally approved by the Chairman of the State Relief Committee and in turn by the Director of the Emergency Educational Program in Washington. The first program called for a monthly expenditure of $1,600.00, $900 of this sum to be . spent for rural schools. The program had scarcely begun to function when word was received that the amount available had been in - creased to $18,500. </seg>
            <seg id="p149">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION ; ■ ■ A "Work Relief ' Program If you attempt to formulate a local program please keep in mind that this is primarily a "work relief" program and only secondarily an educational program. Teachers to be employed under the enclosed plan must be recom - mended or certified by the county relief organizations. If there are no teachers within a certain county who can qualify under this program for a position in some school within the county, then it is our understanding that a teacher may be secured through the state relief administration. We readily appreciate the fact, as will you, that in working out this program a great deal of patience will be required. If you will refer to the program as approved, you will note that it has been divided into five sections, namely. Rural Schools, Teaching Adults to Read and Write English, Vocational Education, Vocational Rehabilitation of Disabled Persons, and General Adult Education. The first question which an unemployed teacher who is interested in this program will be likely to ask is, "How may I proceed to secure employment under this 'work relief plan?" We regret that it is impossible to outline the exact procedure which an unemployed teacher must follow in order to qualify for work relief in educa - tion. As indicated before, unemployed teachers must bear in mind the fact that the funds are very limited, and they must also bear in mind the fact that in the administration of this program no one singte administrative unit is charged with the responsibility. In other words, whatever is done must be approved by several different individuals or groups. You can readily appre - ciate that the necessity of following this procedure will tend to slow up the matter of employment. I. Rural Schools Standards to be maintained. II. Teaching Adults to Read and Write English The State Superintendent will accept applications from teachers for this type of work who have been certified by the county relief organiza - tions as being entitled to "work relief." III. Vocational Education The State Superintendent will accept applications from those who wish to teach vocational education classes and who have been certified by the county relief organization as being entitled to employment on the "work relief" basis. After teachers have been selected the classes will be under the direction of the state director, for vocational education. </seg>
            <seg id="p150">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT IV. Vocational Rehabilitation The State Superintendent will accept applications from teachers who have been certified by the county relief organizations as being entitled to employment on "work relief" basis. After classes have been estab - lished they will be under the direction of the state director for voca - tional rehabilitation. V. General Adult Education The State Superintendent will accept applications from teachers who are certified by the county relief organizations or the state emergency relief committee as being entitled to employment on a "work relief" basis. Local school districts will be expected to furnish rooms in which the adult classes may meet. Local districts will be expected to provide heat and light. The local districts will be expected to cooperate with the State Superintendent in furnishing the necessary textbooks and sup - plies. City and county superintendents will be expected to cooperate in the organization of classes and after classes are organized, the work will be carried on under the supervision of local school administrators. Conclusion If we are to succeed in any measure in putting this program into operation, it will be due to the common sense and discretion which local emergency relief organizations show in the selection of those who are entitled to "work relief." As we have stated before, the amount of money available to Nebraska is so small when compared with the amounts which are to be spent for highways, river navigation, and other "work relief" projects that we have been inclined at times after viewing all of the restrictions and require - ments, to make no attempt to set up a program. The obstacles have seemed almost insurmountable. The benefits which can accrue even under the most favorable circumstances seem so meager. Our only hope rests in the possi - bility that later developments may make available to Nebraska a sum of money more nearly commensurate with the needs of unemployed teachers and an educational program which is seriously suffering because our accustomed sources of revenue are not equal to the task of carrying the burden imposed by our present economic distress. ■ ■ Plans for Work Relief in Education State of Nebraska In accordance with Letters of Authority — addressed to Governors and State Emergency Relief Administrators, under dates of August 19 and Septem - ber 26, the State Department of Public Instruction of the State of Nebraska proposes to initiate and operate a program of work relief in education. The principal purpose of this program would be to afford work oppor - tunities for needy unemployed teachers and other persons on relief rolls quali - fied to work in this program. The secondary purpose would be to provide </seg>
            <seg id="p151">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION such educational opportunities as will promote the educational, social, and economic welfare of children and adults within the scope of the educational program to be carried on. If * is Proposal meets with the approval of the Nebraska Emergency Relief Administration and the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, the State Department of Public Instruction will conduct the following educational activities on a work relief basis: I. Rural Schools ■ The State Department of Public Instruction will provide work relief teachers for those rural schools in the state for which, prior to August 19. 1933. it had been determined could either not open or could not maintain a school term equal in length to that maintained during the school year i y jkj- j l * H. Teaching Adults to Read and Write English The State Department of Public Instruction will organize classes for adults who are unable to read and write English equivalent to the fifth school grade, and will provide work relief teachers for their instruction. HI. Vocational Education The State Department of Public Instruction will provide classes for unemployed adults who are in need of additional vocational training to make them employable and will provide qualified work relief teachers for their instruction. IV. Vocational Rehabilitation of Disabled Persons The State Department of Public Instruction will provide a service of vocational rehabilitation for such physically disabled persons as can - not now be served by the regular state program, because of lack of funds, or personnel, or because of limiting policies. V. General Adult Education The State Department of Public Instruction will provide work oppor - tunities for needy unemployed teachers and others on relief rolls who are qualified to teach other adults, through the organization of classes, attend - ance at which will result in improvement of the general educational status, give a better appreciation and understanding of social and eco - nomic problems, and better fit those taught to adjust themselves to their environment. In carrying out this program the State Department of Public Instruction will conform to the rules, regulations and policies of the Nebraska Emergency Relief Administration and the Federal Emergency Relief Administration with </seg>

While it is understood that the State Emergency Relief Administration will be responsible for the administration of the emergency vocational re - habilitation program herein proposed, the State Department of Public Instruction will be responsible for the operation of the program and the supervision of the case work incident thereto. 3. Proposed standards for work relief in the emergency vocational rehabili - tation program. a. Qualifications of case workers and other emergency employees. In selecting personnel for the handling of case work in the emergency rehabilitation program, the State Department of Public Instruction in cooperation with the State Emergency Relief Administration will select only such person as are aggressive, energetic, and physically capable of carrying on the work. In addition, the State Department of Public Instruction will select persons who are resourceful, adaptable, and have tact in dealing with others. Only such persons will be selected as have a minimum of education as represented by completion of a two-year college course or its equivalent, and who have had practical experience of at least two years in one or more of the following fields: vocational rehabilitation, education, personnel management, social welfare, or workmen's com - pensation. Persons employed in addition to the regular rehabilitation staff as case workers will be selected from the unemployed, and those who are in need of work relief. Preference will be given to persons between the ages of 30 and 55 years. Clerical assistants employed will be selected from those who have suitable qualifications for the work to be performed. Preference will be given to disabled persons who are unemployed and in need of work relief. b. Provisions for training of emergency personnel. Provisions will be made for intensive preliminary training, covering a period of a week or ten days, for such case workers as are added to the regular staff. They will be instructed in the policies, procedures, and techniques of rehabilitation case work through conferences con- I ducted by the state rehabilitation supervisor, assisted, when possible, by the Federal regional rehabilitation agent. In service, training of the case workers will be provided through personal cooperation of members of the regular rehabilitation staff, who will visit the new </seg>

The wage schedule of emergency personnel in the rehabilitation pro - gram will conform to the rules and regulations of the Federal Relief Administration. 4. Purposes for which Work Relief Funds will be used. The general purpose in the use of federal funds allocated to the state for the emergency vocational rehabilitation program will be: First, to pro - vide work relief for trained and experienced persons who are unemployed and in need of work relief through their employment as case workers and clerical assistants in the operation of this emergency rehabilitation program; and second, to provide a service of vocational rehabilitation to physically disabled persons who are in need and feasible of rehabilitation and who cannot be served through the regular program. In order to accomplish these purposes the funds will be used for the following purposes: a. Wages of case workers and clerical assistants. b. Instruction for persons who are in need of vocational training in order to be fitted for employment. c. Training supplies and materials for persons in training where the train - ing agency does not provide such supplies and materials as part of the training program. d. Transportation of disabled persons who must be transported to and from their place of residence to the place of training. e. Artificial appliances when necessary to the rehabilitation of the in - dividual. f. Living maintenance during the period of instruction for disabled per - sons who cannot be rehabilitated without such provisions. Incidental expenses such as necessary travel of case workers in the performance of their duties. Policies for the Administration of Case Work In the operation of the emergency rehabilitation program, the policies followed with regard to eligibility of persons for service and methods of pro - cedure in case work will be those which obtain in the regular program. In the selection of cases for service no discrimination will be made as to race. </seg>
            <seg id="p158">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT citizenship, residence, religion, political affiliation, and membership in any special or selected group. The general policy will be to serve only disabled persons who are un - employed and in need of work relief. However, in cases where a special service or the provision of an artificial appliance is needed in order to prevent a disabled person from losing employment such service or appliance may be provided. In cases where special preparation is required, every effort will be made in rehabilitating the individual to make his period of preparation as short as is consistent with thorough preparation for employment.

Approved November 9. 1933. WM. H. SMITH State Executive Director of Relief CHARLES W. TAYLOR State Superintendent of Public Instruction. Use of CW A Funds The following letter was received from Dr. George F. Zook under date of November 23: UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Office of Education Washington November 23, 1933. Dear Sir: In my letter of November 16. I stated that at the earliest possible time another statement would be sent to you explaining and amplifying the educa - tional implications of the Civil Work Administration program. " This I am now doing in the accompanying statement. This statement, which has been authorized and sent by Mr. Harry L. Hopkins, Federal Emergency Relief Administrator, to State and local relief administrators, deals with (I) the modification of the emergency edu - cational program resulting from the establishment of the Civil Work Adminis - tration, and (II) the opportunities for repairs, improvements, and extensions to educational buildings and grounds under the Civil Work program. </seg>
            <seg id="p160">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT On the reverse side of this letter will be found certain additional informa - tion to which your attention is called. Very truly yours, GEORGE F. ZOOK. Commissioner. The reverse side of Mr. Zook's letter follows: SCHOOL PROJECTS WHICH CAN BE APPROVED UNDER THE CIVIL WORKS PROGRAM Your attention is called to the opportunities for carrying on various Civil Works projects which will improve the school facilities. These projects are subject to the Rules and Regulations No. 1 enclosed with the letter of No - vember 16. i — These projects are of the same type as those which States and Cities have been asked to develop for giving employment to unemployed persons. Civil Work Administration funds will be used to pay for these projects. Educational authorities should present to the local Civil Works Admin - istration through the proper channels their needs in this respect. Among such projects arc: School building repair jobs, such as painting, electrical wiring, paper hanging, roof repairs, repair of school furniture, construction and repair of school playgrounds and equipment, and modernization of sanitary facilities. Projects developed as a part of the Civil Works Administration Program need not be approved by the State Department of Education, since they are an essential part of the local Civil Work Administration Program. Civil Work Administration funds may be used for repair materials, as well as for wages. This includes schools and colleges under public auspices. ■.■'■'■ . ■ '■ • .' Complying with the request made in the foregoing letter, we forwarded the following information to County and City Superintendents and Secretaries of Boards of, Education under the date of November 27: </seg>
            <seg id="p161">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION November 27, 1933 To County and City Superintendents and Secretaries of Boards of Education: Your attention is called to the letter from Dr. George F. Zook. Com - missioner of the Office of Education, Department of the Interior. We wish to call your particular attention to the school projects which, ac - cording to Dr. Zook, can be approved under the rules and regulations of the Federal Civil Work Administration of which the Honorable Harry L. Hopkins is chairman. This office believes that this is the greatest opportunity which has ever been presented to the schools of Nebraska, both rural and city, to place their school plants and grounds in the best possible condition. You will note the statement: "Civil Works Administration funds will be used to pay for these projects." The projects which they have outlined include school building repair jobs, such as painting, electrical wiring, paper hanging, roof repairs, repair of school furniture, construction and repair of school plagrounds and equipment, and the modernization of sanitary facilities. We believe that every school board in the county should check these items very carefully in order to determine just what types of employment can be made available. As we interpret this program it would seem that it would include such items as putting a new foundation under a schoolhouse, repairing chimneys, grading and leveling the schoolgrounds, the building of new toilets or the construction of inside toilets and cesspools, the repairing of wells and windmills, painting both the exterior and the interior of school buildings, and many other similar items. We believe that it is urgent that boards of education make a careful survey of their local situations and that requests be made promptly to the local Civil Works Administration. Then as soon as the project is approved by the local Civil Work Administration a committee should write or call upon Honorable W. H. Smith, whose office is in the State House at Lincoln, Nebraska, and who is the Chairman of the Nebraska Civil Works Administration. The Civil Works Administration apparently contemplates giving em - ployment to thousands of men and women within the next two or three months. Their program seems to contemplate the purchase of large quantities of materials. We are inclined to believe that the states that act the quickest in this matter will be the states which will receive the greatest benefits. In a project of this sort boards of education and indi- </seg>
            <seg id="p162">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT viduals should leave entirely out of consideration any question of false pride. ' Individuals who arc in need of work should not hesitate to register for work relief under this program. Boards, of education will, in our judgment, be rendering the Government a distinct service by cooperat - ing at this time in the setting up of desirable projects. Urge your unemployed people to register with the local Civil Works Administration. This should be done promptly. If the greatest possible good is to result from this we believe local boards of education should file their requests with the local administration and with the Honorable W. H. Smith within the next ten days. The Federal Civil Administration rules and regulations, para - graph one, dated November 15, 1933, read in part as follows: "The board of Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works has allo - cated to the Federal Emergency Relief Administration $400,000,000 for this purpose." According to the Honorable Harry L. Hopkins, Federal Civil Works Administrator, funds are available for Nebraska. This means employment for cement workers, carpenters, plumbers, plasterers, furnacemen, electricians, steam fitters, glaziers, painters, and such other tradespeople as may be necessary to employ in order to put school buildings in a good state of repair. May we suggest that you move rapidly in this matter, and that your boards of education be urged to present their requests to the local Civil Works Administration so that the local committee may approve them and submit them for the final approval of the Honorable W. H. Smith, who is Chairman of the State Administration. This is an entirely new proposition and does not require the assist - ance of this office in any way, shape, or form. Very truly yours, CHARLES W. TAYLOR, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Shortly after this letter went out the Chairman of the State Relief Commit - tee forwarded a letter to all County Superintendents in which he stated that this office was somewhat in error in leading school boards to believe that funds were available in every county in order to carry on CWA projects for the benefits of schools. Believing that we had not misunderstood the information contained in Dr. Zook's letter of November 23, we sent out a second letter under date of December 13 calling their attention to the projects which had been sug- </seg>
            <seg id="p163">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION gested by the Federal Relief Administration. This correspondence is in - cluded in this report in order that the records may be kept straight: STATE OF NEBRASKA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION CHARLES W. TAYLOR State Superintendent December 13. 1933 To County and City Superintendents and Secretaries of Boards of Education: Under date of November 27th this office forwarded to you copies of communications published by the U. S. Department of Interior. Some superintendents have advised us that they have been criticized because they urged school districts to make application for CWA funds, when according to the statements made by County and State Chairmen all available funds, in at least some of the counties, had been allotted before school boards knew that school projects would be considered. We Have No Apology to Offer This office has no apology to make for having brought to your attention, the question of school projects possible under the CWA. As a result of the insistent demand voiced by many school districts county funds in some cases have been reallotted so that a few of the school districts in the State have had projects approved. Certainly those who were in charge of the distribution of CWA funds for Nebraska knew at the outset that school repair projects could be included, because under Rules and Regulations No. 1, Federal Civil Works Administration, published November 15, 1933, the statement Is made: "All public works projects of the character heretofore constructed or carried on either by the public authority or with public aid to serve the interest of the general public are eligible." In the face of this regu - lation the Committee left out of the picture the greater number of 7,000 school districts, with buildings and equipment valued in excess of $52, - 000,000.00. The following represents a typical allotment for one of the larger counties of the State: A Typical County Allocation Women $ 2,800.00 SI State 1.500.00 S6 State 3,000.00 M65 Village 835.00 General Improvement. </seg>

The claim is frequently made that the public schools spend more than half of the tax money. Let us assume for the sake of argument that this is true. Are not the school districts of the State, with their invest - ment of more than $52,000,000.00, entitled to consideration when Federal grants for repair and improvement are made? Suppose that $100.00 had been set apart to rcfinish each of the 6,040 rural school buildings of the State — that would amount to a total of $604,000.00. We doubt if Nebraska has received her full share of the $3300,000,00 which was set aside under the National Industrial Recovery Act. The act of Congress known as the National Industrial Recovery Act confers upon the President the authority to set up the PWA, the FERA. the CWA, and similar administrations. All of these are based upon the NIRA. It is a very simple matter to allocate funds. The State Emer - gency Relief Administrator and State Civil Works Administrator for Nebraska, can in an hour's time allot these funds to the various coun - ties of the State, and the plea can then be made that no more funds are available. ■ - This office is not opposed to highways. For many years our official publications carried the slogan, "Better roads to better schools." Let's try to maintain some degree of proper balance, so that we may not suddenly discover that we have the better roads and poorer schools. If a fair portion of the funds allotted to Nebraska under the CWA had been re-apportioned to the school districts of Nebraska there would have been an opportunity not only for the employment of men on highway projects but for the employment of carpenters, papers hangers, electri - . dans, plumbers, glaziers, etc. </seg>
            <seg id="p165">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION la many cases funds have not been allotted for the purchase of materials. The letter from the Department of the Interior stated speci - fically: "Civil Works Administration funds may be used for repair materials as well as for wages." Reports have reached us that some counties cannot possibly use on road projects at present the money which has been allotted for this purpose. We believe the Government of the United States intended that a fair share of this money should be available for the repair of schools. If the board members responsible in these various school districts will make an insistent demand, we believe that in many cases county funds can be re-allocated so that the schools may be definitely in the picture. If the demand is persistent enough, we believe that the U. S. Govern - ment will set aside additional funds, if necessary, in order to see this project through. Taxpayer Vitally Interested It is of the utmost importance that the school plants be kept present - able and in good state of repair. This is a matter which is of vital in - terest to every taxpayer in the State. In thousands of Nebraska school districts a small amount of money spent upon repairs would mean an added safeguard for the health and physical well being of the pupils who attended these schools. This is in no sense a question of paying teach - ers salaries. It is a question of the proper maintenance of the physical school plants of Nebraska and a question of securing for the schools that portion of the CWA funds to which we believe they are right - fully entitled, and which are rightfully theirs. School Needs Must Be Voiced We believe that if the school people of Nebraska demand it school repair projects may receive their fair share of the CWA funds. This statement has been made: "In numerous cases, the county's entire allot - ment had been assigned to projects before applications were received from the schools." This no one can deny. Of course, there were no applications from the schools, because the funds were apportioned by the Committee before school people realized that there were funds available for school projects. Conclusion Assuming that you are definitely and finally advised by both your Local and State Chairman that funds cannot be made available for your school repair projects, we still urge that you fill out your application in detail and file your request with your Local Committee Chairman. We urge this because the President was recently quoted as having made the statement that he expected to ask Congress for an allotment of an </seg>
            <seg id="p166">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT additional three billion dollars, or more, in order to continue the Civil Work Program. If the schools receive the share of this money to which they are entitled, it will be only because those who are interested in the schools maintain a constant vigil and keep everlastingly at the problem of securing an equitable distribution. Some people think in terms of river improvement, bridges, of highways — we must think in terms of schools. Very truly yours, CHARLES W. TAYLOR State Superintendent of Public Instruction Emergency Nursery School Program About lanuarv '\, 1934, Dr. Harold H. Anderson, of the Iowa Child Welfare Research Station, called at the office and urged that we include a sixth point in the program — the Emergency Nursery School. We were reluctant to include the Emergency Nursery School Program, for the reason that there had already been authorized, and there were in operation, a number of relief centers for underprivileged children. These relief centers were operating under a progam outlined by a member of the staff of the Home Economics Department, College of Agriculture, University of Nebraska and the plan, in the main, was very similar to that of the regular nursery schools. It really did not seem advisable to have two programs which apparently were so similar, operating in the state under two different con - trols. We felt that it would be better to set up additional relief centers for underprivileged children, rather than to attempt to organize a few nursery schools, and perhaps have it appear that our office was attempting to run another show in competition with the relief centers. At the time Dr. Ander - son secured the approval of the Chairman of the Emergency Relief Committee for the sixth point in the program, the Emergency Nursery School, we were urged to set up these nursery schools wherever there was a need for them. As a matter of fact, one of the provisions of the nursery school program was to the effect that no nursery school should be set up in a town where there was a relief center for underprivileged children, unless there was an apparent need for the nursery school. .Information with regard to the plan for the nursery schools was sent to the" city superintendents and secretaries of boards of education in towns of over 2,500 population, together with the necessary application forms. Chairman Relief Committee Orders Nursery School Discontinued One of the early applications which was received was from Nebraska City, a town lying along the Missouri river where there was' considerable river improvement work under way, and where, as a result, there was a large </seg>
            <seg id="p167">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION transient population. The Board of Education and the Superintendent felt that the need for the nursery school was very great. Accordingly, in keeping with Dr. Anderson's instruction, a nursery school was established at that point It had been in operation approximately two weeks when it was ordered discontinued by the woman in charge of the CWS program. The Chairman of the State Emergency Relief Committee issued an order that no further supplies were to be furnished. Lack of Centralized Authority Brings Administrative Difficulties The whole program really began to function effectively during the month of January, although it was impossible to set up the machinery and get it in complete motion until February. In administering the Emergency Relief Program, this office has been handi - capped by 4 virtue of the fact that the last session of the legislature greatly reduced our budget. County superintendents in many counties were com - pelled to handle many of the details of the program without clerical assistance. Not one cent of FERA funds has been used for administration. We believe that plans for another year should make some provisions for such expenditure. While the various school units of the state which have benefltted under the program are indeed grateful for the assistance which has been, received, there is an abundance of evidence to indicate that the whole matter could have been handled in a much more equitable manner for all concerned, had more definite authority been placed in the hands of the states chief school administrator. Pay rolls to teachers have been delayed, in some instances more than a month, because of the fact that it was necessary for so many people to perform certain administrative details before the checks could finally be issued. ■ ■ &gt;' There seemed to be a certain amount of resentment in some quarters that teachers were being permitted to share in the program at all. Entire days were sometimes consumed in going from one office to another, endeavor - ing finally to fix responsibility for performing certain tasks which had to be performed before pay rolls could be released. In any plan which may be devised for the coining school year, we believe that a large measure of responsibility should be given to the state's chief ad - ministrative school official. We see no reason why a highway commissioner may be entrusted with the responsibility of spending millions of dollars on highways, and at the same time have it assumed that an official chosen by the people of the state on a non-political ballot may not be entrusted to administer the spending of a few thousand dollars on public education. To ask the chief state school official, who is elected on a non-political ballot, to set up a pro - gram and then tie his hands by permitting political appointees to hamper the carrying out of the program at every turn involves what appears to be not </seg>
            <seg id="p168">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT only doubtful economy but very poor administration from the standpoint of the efficient functioning of a desired program. Needy Districts Deprived of Aid Where certain hard and fast requirements are set up, it frequently hap - pens that the districts most needing assistance cannot qualify. To illustrate, in one county of Nebraska there were three towns which made application for assistance. . Two of these districts are traversed by a railroad, the third is an inland town without a mile of railroad in the entire district. The two larger towns having the railroad had made a levy of approximately 20 mills. The smaller town, without the railroad, organized under a different section of the school law, had levied approximately 16 mills, or 8 mills in excess of the regular levy authorized by law. The people of the district, although they needed additional money to run their school, knew that it was useless to levy 20 mills because people would be unable to pay their taxes anyway. To make the higher levy would have, in some cases, practically served to con - fiscate farms and homes. All three districts were carrying heavy indebted - ness, in the form of registered warrants. The two districts which had voted the 20 mill levy could be approved by the Federal Relief Administrator but the others could not. Yet with a return of normal times the two districts with several miles of railroad within their boundaries will be enabled to recover from the financial difficulties much more quickly. This office is of the opinion that no agency in the state is in a better position to know the needs of the various school districts of Nebraska than is this office, by virtue of the fact that this office has on file complete reports covering all phases of the school program, as furnished by secretaries of boards of education to the county superintendent and in turn by the county superin - tendent to&gt; this office. In setting up future programs, we believe that this fact should be kept in mind, namely, that through the machinery which is already set up, this office can in three or four days' time contact every school district in the state. The six points of the emergency educational program wilt be dealt with separately in the ollowing order: .■■•■ 1. Rural Schools 2. Classes for Illiterates 3. Vocational Education 4. Vocational Rehabilitation 5. General Adult Education 6. Emergency Nursery Schools </seg>
            <seg id="p169">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION SECTION I Rural Schools The Deputy State Superintendent of Public Instruction. Herbert L. Cush - mg was appointed by State Superintendent Charles W. Taylor as Director of the Emergency Relief Educational Program for Nebraska. Each of the 93 county superintendents was used in making contacts with officers of the various local districts. Under the first program, all applications had to be approved first, by the local board of education or by the county superin - tendent: then, by the county relief worker or chairman of the county relief commUtee; then, by the Director of the Emergency Educational Program in *e office of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction: and finally, by the Chairman of the State Relief Committee. It is our understanding that all of the funds for the first program was made ava.lable under the FERA. This office has never had any definite con! trol over activities administered under the CWA. or the CWS, nor do we know or any funds which have been made available under the EEP. At one time we were asked to indicate the number of clerical assistants we could use in case they were made vailable for the CWS. In view of the greatly increased load which the office was carrying together with our greatly decreased budget, we asked for four assistants. An unemployed teacher was finally assigned to our office. After working for two weeks, however, she was advised that it was impossible to pay assistants in state offices out of CWS funds. Consequently, this office paid her salary for the two weeks during which time she was employed. Our budget was not sufficient to continue her services, so the result has been a greatly increased load which is being carried by our regular personnel. There has been a greatly increased expenditure of b"': b °; rFERA and not one cent of such admi — «•»- •*- ««« Practically every district which wished to take advantage of the rural program had a building available.

Statistical Data Practically all the school districts in Nebraska must be classified as rural, under the definitions given out by the Emergency Relief Administration. There are but 33 cities in Nebraska with a population in excess of 2,500. Under the first budget which allotted $900 to rural schools, 19 teachers were employed at a salary of $47 per month.

While there is scarcely a co.unty in the state free from illiteracy, persons of this classiBca - tion are rather widely scattered and. whereas it might be possible to find in many of the counties Bve or ten who would be interested in work of this type, it would practically be impossible to get them together in one group. By far the greater number of illiterates in Nebraska are elderly people who would not be Inclined to attempt at this state in their lives to improve their educational status. Time will, in a large measure, take care of the problem if illiteracy in Nebraska. We were further handicapped in any effort to set up classes for illiterates by virtue of the fact that the remuneration authorized by the State Relief Com - mittee was but $20 per month, whereas in practically all other forms of relief employment the salary could range from the minimum of $50 upward.

            <seg id="p176">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT SECTION V General Adult Education In 1929 the Nebraska Legislature created the Division of Adult Immigrant Education, to be operated under the supervision of the Stato Superintendent of Public Instruction. Appropriations were made for the two bienniums, be - ginning July 1, 1929. and ending June 20, 1933. The Legislature of 1933. fol - lowing the recommendation of the Governor, made no appropriation for adult education. Consequently there was a very definite demand for adult educa - tion classes under the FERA. Salary Restrictions Hamper Work Again, however, the office found it almost impossible to organize classes in adult education because of salary restrictions imposed by the Chairman of the State Relief Committee, who refused to sanction salaries in excess of $20 per month. It is true that $20 per month was practically the maximum salary paid under the adult education plan carried on by the state during the 4-year period referred to above. But at that time there were no restrictions with regard to the type of teacher who might be employed. In other words, adult education classes were carried on by teachers who were employed on a part-time basis. It can readily be appreciated that people who were entitled to employment on a work relief basis would scarcely be inclined to accept a position which would limit them to $20 per month when directors of relief study centers, authorized under the CWA and CWS programs, could receive approximately $60 per month. In several instances it was necessary to abandon our plans for carrying on adult education classes because the teachers, upon whom we were counting, advised us that they were offered opportunities to direct study center activities carried on through the university extension division, with the aid or CWS funds. Demand For Adult Education Will Increase We believe that the demand for adult education classes will be greater during the coming year than ever before. Naturally we are making plans to bring the matter very definitely to the attention of the next session of the Legislature in the hope that our state program of adult education may function again. Credit should be given to the city and county superintendents for their splendid cooperation in setting up the few adult education programs that did get under way. Attendance at adult education classes is of necessity bound to be somewhat irregular. Unemployed adults change their residence frequently because they arc, in the main, alert to seek out positions wherever they may be found, and </seg>
            <seg id="p177">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION even a rumor that employment of a certain type is to open up at a certain place will cause a considerable shift among such unemployed. ■ Generally speaking, classes were held for two-hour sessions two evenings a week. The rates of pay per hour ranged from seventy-four cents to one dollar and twenty-flve cents. Teachers were selected by the county and city superintendents and local boards of education, and finally approved by the county relief worker. In the adult education classes registration was not limited to the unemployed. One class was made up largely of boys and girls who had been recently graduated from high school. Another class was largely made up of men and women past 50 years of age. In one instance, we had a farmer and his wife who were some 60 years of age. who traveled something over two miles to attend these classes. This happened to be a class in English literature. Subjects studied by other classes included physical education for men. mixed chorus.

            <seg id="p181">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT The teachers were suggested, for employment, by the local superin - tendent of schools and were unemployed persons. Four are trained in nursery schools work and are graduates of the University of Nebraska. . In the train - ing program two persons from each center have been trained for one month each. All teachers possess certificates. All nurses are registered graduate nurses. The homes of the nursery school children are typical of people on relief. The sanitary conditions of the homes are poor. Families are large. Mothers are ignorant as to the care of their children, their diet and clothing. From visits made at the first of the term, and visits at the last of the term, the entire condition of the homes was found raised. Mothers show great benefit from parent classes. The city superintendents of schools have reported other children in the family have received great benefit. The conditions of the homes are best described by a few examples. When the school in South Omaha. West Side, which is 76 per cent colored, was first organized. Miss Clara Evans, who was in charge of emergency nursery schools under the supervision of the State Superintendent's office, visited the home of one child who was so afraid that he screamed and stayed in one corner during the visit. She found the father, a former bootlegger, living in one room, hardly to be called a room, but rather a boarded back porch. There were no facilities for cooking, toilet, or water, and only a cot as furniture. The child was underweight, had been beaten in order to compel him to stay at home. The father was told that if he kept the child he would have to rent decent quarters and keep the child in a proper way. On the next visit the father had rented two rooms, had a neighbor cook meals for the child, who had gained two pounds each month and, emotionally, is a different child. In South Sioux City the second day that the emergency nursery school v.-as held. Miss Evans noticed one child eating far too fast. He ate all that was served and asked for more. He was served again. He ate everything. He was served once more, and said, "Maw said eat all I could git for nothing." We investigated and found nine children, the father, and mother in a three - room shack. The father fished for a living, the mother washed, and the children were left alone with only coffee for breakfast and cinnamon rolls for the evening meal. The father was aided in securing work and the mother helped in planning her time so that she could keep her house clean. The mother was also given instructions in the preparation of meals. She found that people would employ her if she made a better appearance, and on Miss Evans' last visit her comment was, "The School has taught me how to wash better." In all schools children now sleep an hour and a half. They even have to be called after their nap. The records from the homes show they are going to bed at eight o'clock and earlier. They sleep with windows raised. The children have learned to feed themselves nicely, take care of themselves </seg>

Sincerely yours, (Signed) HARRY L. HOPKINS, Administrator, Federal Emergency Relief Administration, Washington. D. C. * * * - This letter constitutes the authorization for the Emergency Education Pro - gram which is being carried on during the current year. This office had hoped that we might be enabled to aid school districts, which, on account of the extreme drouth conditions, find it almost impossible to maintain a normal school term. As indicated in the foregoing letter, there were only two lines of activity authorized, namely, adult education and nursery schools. About August 1 we were advised by the State Administrator that the sum of $11,600 would be available for the Emergency Education Program in August. We were requested to prepare a tentative budget covering the points in the Program authorized in Mr. Hopkins' letter of July 2. We prepared the following tentative budget: 1. Literacy classes _ $ 500.00 2. Vocational training , 2,500.00 3. Vocational rehabilitation _ 2.500.00 4. General adult education :. 2,500.00 5. Nursery schools _ 3,600.00 I TOTAL ..$11,600.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p185">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Under date of August 30 we were advised that our allotment had been increased to the amount of $22,700 monthly, and we were requested to revise our budget accordingly. Shortly after receiving this notice, the following budget was set up: I Adult Education $18 160 00 1. Literacy classes ...._ $1,000.00 2. Vocational training 3,000 00 3.

Such a nursery school unit, when organized, func- Jons as a part of the local school program and is directed by the local super - intended °f schools. Provision for housing and equipment Is furnished by the local school board. An estimated value varies from 45 per cent to 60 per cent of the total money Invested in the project. Groceries, milk and other ood products for the midday meal are secured through local county relief funds by special arrangement with the State Emergency Relief Administration at a cost of 10 cents per child per day. The emergency nursery schools offer socially useful services as well as providing work for unemployed teachers another workers. The children attending arc provided with nourishing food, clean, warm quarters, sufficient clothing, and opportunity for daily nap periods of an hour or hour and a half Not only daily health inspection and periodic physical examinations are made but immunizations and innovations, eye refractions, tonsilectomies, and many other medical services are extended. Home visits are made regularly by the head teacher and the nurse, to establish friendly relations and understanding between home and nursery school. Acting upon the conviction that the regime carried on at each nursery school might be of greater benefit to the individual child if continued for the periods which the child is not in school, opportunities are provided for parents to visit the nursery school very frequently and attend parent meetings where instructions and demonstrations according to their special </seg>
            <seg id="p186">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT needs and desires are given. In the report for the month of November, 1934, (the latest available) 20 organized classes with an enrollment of 260 mothers meeting regularly once or twice a week were shown. In the same period, 339 home visits were made. This was above the informal contacts being constantly made between parents, children, teachers, and such organized group meetings as are sponsored in various localities of the state by Vocational Home Eco - nomics. Equal to, if not greater than the work of relieving cold, hunger, and sick' ness in these times of unemployment, comes the vital need for relieving the emotional strains and raising the morale of those who are made insecure. It is obvious to almost everyone whose professional work touches at any point these vital human affairs, the critical need for helping back large numbers of our citizens to their former self-respect and efficiency as useful members of the community. The emergency nursery schools through their objective meth - ods of supplying the material needs for the very young children of the unem - ployed, the genuine intelligent interest and assistance shown in the care and management of these children, the therapeutic effect of free discussion in classes on the part of these disappointed, discouraged parents, with regard to the wel - fare of their children and proper home management, are making social con - tributions which amply repay the effort, time, and money spent on their pro - gram. ADULT EDUCATION The adult education program is moving forward along the several lines suggested in the letter of authorization previously quoted. Vocational Education The vocational education program was among the first to get under way, due to the fact that we utilized the regular vocational educational supervisory staff for Nebraska. Approximately 60 teachers are employed in this field, all working under the direction of the regular state supervisors, in the phases of commercial, home economics, agriculture, and the various trades and industries. Vocational Rehabilitation Little has been done in connection with the program of vocational rehabili - tation. This office must depend upon the regular federal supervisor of voca - tional rehabilitation, inasmuch as we were not authorized to appoint a super - visor for the emergincy rehabilitation program. The supervisor of the feder - al government's regular state program is reluctant to undertake setting up an emergency rehabilitation program because of the restrictions which are imposed. He does not feel that he can afford to sponsor something which would not compare favorably with the regular rehabilitation work. A special type of training is required for supervisors in this field and </seg>
            <seg id="p187">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION the state supervisor has experienced difficulty in securing persons competent to direct this work for the salary which has been authorized. A request has been filed with the director of the Emergency Education Program at Washington for permission to pay slightly higher salaries than the relief program has authorized, in order that the rehabilitation work may soon get under way. Literacy Classes While it is rather difficult to get exact figures covering enrollments in the emergency adult classes because of the fact that some are constantly dropping out and others enrolling for the first time, we believe it is safe to assume that the 37 teachers employed in literacy classes are serving approximately 400 adults. There is no project being sponsored by the Federal government that more definitely has the support of the United States Office of Education than does the literacy program. While Nebraska enjoys especially high ranking in per - centage of illiteracy within its borders, the fact remains that there are those in the state whose status as citizens can be vastly improved through the literacy classes. Study Centers At the present time there are 20 study centers operating in Nebraska. Credit for the development of the study center plan which permits adults to earn col - lege credit belongs to Professor A. A. Reed, of the University of Nebraska. Groups are organized at various points in the state with a minimum en - rollment of 10 adults. Under the guidance of a director who is paid from Emergency Education funds, these students carry regular University extension courses. Professor Reed's plan has attracted nationwide attention and the United States Commissioner of Education, and those in charge of the Emergency Education Program at Washington, have made the statement that the study center program represents one of the outstanding achievements under the whole Emergency Education Program. It is altogether probable that 80 additional study centers could be estab - lished, if it were not for the cost of enrolling. There is some expense inci - dent to taking the study center work, and many prospective students find it impossible, under present conditions, to pay the enrollment fees, even though they are very nominal. General Adult Education There are at the present time 21 teachers who are employed in connection with the general adult education work. Under this program there are almost </seg>
            <seg id="p188">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT no restrictions as to the subject matter which may be studied. It may include classes in music, art, literature, arithmetic, or almost any other subject in which a group may be interested. As in all adult education work, time is required in order to perfect the class organization. While superintendents of city and village schools have received complete information with regard to the plans in general, many of them do not feel that they care to undertake the responsibility involved in organ - izing the classes until they can have the advice of the supervisor in adult edu - cation. It is altogether probable that in the next two or three months many adult education classes will be organized, in addition to those already operating. At the present time there are probably 300 adults participating in the general adult education program. When the transient camps and CCC camps were established in Nebraska, the question was raised as to whether this office should undertake to supply teachers for those enrolled in these centers and camps, or whether the Federal government would sponsor a separate educational program for them. An in - quiry was directed to Dr. L. R. Alderman, of the United States Office of Edu - cation and also director of the federal Emergency Education Program, and he advised us that he would be pleased to have this office cooperate In every way possible in setting up educational projects for the benefit of those employed in the camps. Colonel S. M. Ransopher is the Educational Adviser for the Seventh Corps Army Area, and this office has been pleased to cooperate with him in the de - velopment of worthwhile courses and in furnishing teachers for them. Our understanding with Colonel Ransopher is that these teachers shall be mad: available so long as the funds allotted to Nebraska cannot be used for the re - lief of the regular rural school program. In reaching this agreement we were governed by the fact that the Constitution of the state definitely provides for the education of all the youth of the state between the ages of 5 and 21 years. Naturally, the first responsibility of this office is to these children and, should the Federal government eventually authorize relief for needy teachers in rural schools, it probably will be necessary to withdraw teachers from the transient and CCC camps unless the amount allotted to the state should be increased.

            <seg id="p193">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION . . . '■ PUPIL TRANSPORTATION IN NEBRASKA CONSOLIDATED SCHOOLS Early in 1934 Mr. Fuller L. Austin, former Director of Research for the State Department of Public Instruction, undertook a survey of trans - portation facilities in Nebraska consolidated schools. Questionnaires were forwarded to the seventy-three consolidated school districts in Nebraska. Returns were rather slow in coming in, and Mr. Austin left the office before he had time to compile the returns and analyze the information which they contain. During the past summer Mr. Melvln F. Jackman completed his work for the degree of Master of Arts at the University of Nebraska. His thesis dealt with the question of pupil transportation in Nebraska. We asked Mr. Jackman to take the material contained in the questionnaires, compile it and analyze it. The first part of this report represents Mr. Jackman's analysis of the various transportation problems which exist in the Nebraska consolidated schools. The latter part of the report is in a large measure taken from Mr. Jackman's thesis and embodies certain rules and regulations which in his opinion will aid consolidated districts in solving their transportation diffi - culties. It is not to be assumed that these rules and regulations represent hard and fast procedures which must be followed. Any board of education in any consolidated school district may follow some of them or all of them just as it sees fit. This office is of the opinion that the suggested forms for keeping transportation costs should prove to be of very material value. Summary of Survey Number of consolidated schools „ 73 Number of schools reporting in this survey 57 Total square miles in all districts reporting 1,194.75 sq. mi.

            <seg id="p194">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Problems of Transportation The major problems of transportation of pupils in the fifty-seven consoli - dated districts reporting were given as follows: 26 districts reported "bad roads". 5 districts reported "routing the transportation so that it is satisfactory to all". 3 districts reported "unsatisfactory discipline on the busses". 2 districts reported "difficulty in securing reliable drivers". 1 district reported that "their equipment was now wearing out". 1 district reported "crowded busses". 4 districts reported no major problems. 15 districts did not answer the question. Analysis of Transportation Problems Bad Road Problem Nearly half of the districts reporting in this survey consider bad roads their major problem. Districts experiencing this type of trouble should take a careful survey of their district and be sure that they are ' operating their busses over the best roads in the district. It is very bad operating practice to route busses over roads that are sure to be impassable during stormy weather. It might be pos - sible to make arrangements for a car to drive over the worst part of the route and bring the pupils to the bus rather than attempt to use the bus and take a chance on being stalled. All bridges on the route should be carefully checked to see that they will support the weight of a bus. Routing the Transportation so that it is Satisfactory to All When this problem occurs in the. district it is perhaps the most serious problem that can come about. It certainly is a problem that must be met at once, squarely, and in the open. It should never be allowed to go on for several years without some sort of agreement. It must be kept in mind that useless backtracking and long pulls of one and two miles for the benefit of one student are very expensive to the district. Rather than put so much extra mileage and strain on equipment an amicable settlement should be made between the patrons and school authorities. This will enable the board to operate the busses over the best roads and the fewest number of miles possible each day. </seg>
            <seg id="p195">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION One instance was called to the attention of the writer where a bus was required to pull off of a good gravelled road onto a bad dirt road. The bus then went down a very steep hill, crossed a narrow wooden bridge, then turned around and pulled back onto the highway. The house was located less than a quarter of a mile from the gravelled road and all the trouble and expense was for the benefit of two children. Unsatisfactory Discipline in the Busses Drivers of the busses should be placed in charge of the children while they are in the busses. They should take the place of the teacher in the school, or the parent in the home. The driver should assign seats at the beginning of the year and see to it that each child occupies his regular seat on each trip. Any misbehavior in the bus should be reported to the superintendent at once. Difficulty in Securing Reliable Driven Boards of education and school superintendents should be very careful in their selection of men to drive busses. They should not hire men except those who are mature and who have a reputation for good driving judgment. It is best not to hire any driver under eighteen year of age and none older than fifty. These men should be in good physical health and should be required to. furnish the board with a health cer - tificate from a good physician. Normal use of the entire body should be re - quired with special attention to the eyes and ears. Drivers must be of good moral character. They must be clean in habits. They must be clean in dress and neat in appearance. They should not use tobacco in any form around the school busses. Use of liquor at any time should be grounds for im - mediate dismissal. Difficulty in Securing the Proper Type of Bus Bodies When the purchase of a bus or bus body is under consideration boards of education must take every possible factor into account before making their final selection. They must consider the number of children living on the route; where this bus is to be used; the type of road; whether or not the route is hilly, gently rolling or level; and all other factors. Bodies must be as light as possible, but strength must never be sacrificed for lightness. Bodies must only be purchased from the manufacturers who will stand back of their products. Equipment Wearing Out School authorities must recognize that sooner or later busses will wear </seg>
            <seg id="p196">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT out and will have to be replaced. To that end a certain sum should be set aside each mile the bus is operated in order that equipment may be replaced when it is no longer serviceable. In figuring the depreciation on a bus it is a little easier to allow so much a mile. In figuring the mileage all miles operated must be included, whether empty or loaded. All routes in the district may be measured by driving a car with an ac - curate speedometer over all the routes. These measurements should be used for the basis of figuring depreciation. The depreciation allowed should be enough so that at the end of five years there will be enough money on hand to replace the bus. With busses operat - ing a hundred miles or more a day, a cent and a half per mile will replace the bus in five years. For shorter routes, two cents a mile will replace the equipment in the allotted time of five years. Crowded Busses This condition should be taken care of as soon as it Is possible to do so. It is by far one of the greatest hazards of pupil transportation. It is apt to lead to problems of discipline and in the event of an accident will cause confusion leading to serious results. It also causes an unusual and wearing strain on motor and body. About the only way that this condition may be relieved is by purchase of additional busses or the hiring of cars to assist busses part of the way on their routes. The condition should be remedied as soon as possible. SUGGESTIONS FOR INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF TRANSPORTATION System of Records It was noted by the writer, while visiting schools, that districts are not keeping accurate records of their transportation costs. As a result, the districts are unable to tell exactly what their transportation will cost them, what it has cost them, and how to cut down their transportation costs. Before any progress can be made in correcting costs you must first find out where the money is being spent. The writer recommends the use of the following records in order that accurate check may be kept of the transportation costs: FIGURE ONE. The table given in Figure One, on a following page, is recommended in order that an orderly record of the movements of </seg>
            <seg id="p197">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION busses may be kept. Drivers should sign in or out every time a bus is taken on a regular or special trip. FIGURE TWO. This table, found on a following page, is recommended as it is, a joint card used by both the mechanic and the driver. Here an ac - curate record of mileage is available, gasoline, oil and grease used for the week as well as cost of labor and parts. There is space for totaling each item. As a result a very complete record is available for a week of operation. FIGURE THREE. Using the cards or tables recommended in Figure Two as sources of data it is a relatively simple matter for the sueprintendent to make a monthly report to the board of education, letting them know the exact cost of transportation to date. This form, Figure Three found on a follow - ing page, may also be us:d for an annual report to the board of educa - tion, which may be referred to for information when other surveys are made in the future. FIGURE FOUR. This report, given on a following page, is a weekly report from the driver to the superintendent. It covers one week of operation. It tells the numbers of miles operated empty, the number of pupil miles, pas - sengers handled, and condition of the roads. It also has space for a written report of any unusual happenings such as discipline on the busses, cause of delay and events of a similar nature. With the record of pupil miles available it is possible to figure exactly what it costs to haul one pupil one mile. The following example may better illustrate the keeping of pupil miles: A bus goes empty from town, or the garage, to the beginning of the route. The route is ten miles long so you have ten miles of operating cost to be charged up to the bus. At the beginning of the route you have three pupils board the bus to ride to school. As they will ride the entire ten miles to school you will have thirty passenger miles. Nine miles from school two more board the bus. This makes eighteen addi - tional passenger miles, or a total of forty-eight passenger miles. Since the bus had to be run twenty miles, ten out and ten back, the cost is fifteen cents a mile, then you have a cost of $3.00 for rendering this service. Now to find what it is costing you to render this service you divide the total number of pupil miles into the total cost of performing the service and in that way the cost is sixty-three cents per pupil mile. In other words, it is costing the district sixty-three cents to haul one pupil one mile on this route. With this information available on all routes it is then possible to tell which route is operated the cheapest and which costs the most If all districts would cooperate, it would be possible to tell how costs in one district compare with costs in another. </seg>
            <seg id="p198">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Bear in mind that a lump sum in one district may be lower than the lump sum for transportation in another district, yet in the first Instance transpor - tation of pupils may be a costly performance when figured on a basis of pupil miles. The second district, with a seemingly higher cost than the first, really is transporting pupils cheaper when figured on the basis of the number of pupils handled by the district. A Regular Program of Maintenance Too few schools have set up a regular program of maintenance. As a result the equipment in many districts is being operated in very poor condi - tion and is subject to unusual wear. There was evidence everywhere that districts do not exchange ideas on transportation or maintenance. Rather there is a tendency to ridicule what the other districts are doing. Districts should not do this, but should get to - gether and exchange ideas and use the best from other districts. This would tend to make all phases of transportation much more uniform than they are at present. • ' Three plans of maintenance were noted on visits to various schools. Each was quite different from the other and seemed to be a product of the district's attempt to solve its own maintenance program. One Man Maintenance Program In this particular district a board member owned a garage. He was also a very good mechanic He took great pride in keeping the busses in best of condition. He purchased all the gasoline, oil and grease. He did all the repair work. He looked over the motors and bodies each day. The board acted entirely upon his recommendations. Due to this mans efforts the op - erating costs were surprisingly low and fairly accurate. Driver-Boss Plan of Maintenance In this district one driver was hired not only for his driving ability but for his mechanical ability as well. He was given the title of driver-boss, having charge of the other drivers and the checking over of the equipment. He could not buy anything but minor repairs without the board's permission. This sometimes resulted in delay in the maintenance program. Putting the Repair Work Up for Bid Another district placed the work of overhauling and inspection up for bid. All; the garages in the town bid on the work. The lowest bidder was given the work. There was nothing regular about this work however, as bids were posted only after a bus had actually broken down. </seg>
            <seg id="p199">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Recommended Plan After looking over the results of surveys in a good many states and carefully checking methods of commercial companies the writer is of the opinion that the best plan to follow is that in which a mechanic is hired by the district to take care of the busses. He should be on the payroll by the month the year around. Such a mechanic should be required to clean and check each bus each day. A supply of paint should be kept on hand at all times in order that the paint on the busses may be kept up. During the vacation months a pro - gram of general inspection and overhauling should be undertaken. In this way equipment is in good condition all the time and will tend to run longer. As a result over a long period of time, the cost of operation will be cheaper than it is likely to be when operating under any of the three plans suggested. Operation of Busses Many of the districts in the state are operating their busses without any published rules of any sort. It is much better for all concerned when rules are published and each driver and any patron desiring one is given a copy. Drivers should be required to abide by the rules. If the rules are violated the driver is subject to dismissal. Districts will have to make up their own situations to some extent The following rules are recommended as minimum requirements in all Nebraska districts: 1. Safety is the first consideration in handling a bus. 2. All drivers before crossing a railroad track must come to a complete stop and satisfy themselves that no train is approaching before crossing the track. In foggy or inclement weather when visibility is poor the driver must get out of the bus and look and listen to be sure that no train is approaching before attempting to cross. 3. Never back up until you are sure there is nothing back of you. Sound your horn before starting to back up and keep sounding it at frequent inter - vals as long as you continue in a backward direction. 4. The driver is expected to maintain reasonable discipline in his bus. 5. Use of tobacco or intoxicating liquor in a school bus is prohibited. 6. Each driver must fill out the required reports before leaving the school - ground at each trip. 7. All drivers are expected to carry a reasonably accurate watch. This watch must be set by the clock at the schoolhouse each trip. All busses are to be operated by this time. 8. Drivers must not leave a loading point ahead of time. 9. No driver is to wait over three minutes for any pupil. </seg>
            <seg id="p200">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT 10. In operation of the bus, the driver must conform to all state, city, and school laws as to speed and other traffic regulations. 11. Drivers must assign children to seats on the busses and see that these seats are occupied by these students each trip. 12. All drivers must reach their busses early enough in the morning and in the evening so that they may check their busses and see that they are in working order and ready to go by the designated time. 13. All unusual events, such as bad roads and detours, shall be reported at once to the superintendent. 14. All drivers shall make up a schedule of their routes a week before school starts and give it to the superintendent of schools who will publish the same schedule, giving each patron along the route a copy of it. This schedule must be adhered to at all times as nearly as possible. Selection of Drivers So much hinges on the work of the driver that districts should be very exacting in their requirements. The following standards might serve as mini - mum requirements in all districts: Age No one should be allowed to drive a school bus who is less than eighteen years of age or over fifty years. Health No one should be hired to drive a bus who is not able bodied, or who has a communicable disease. Normal use of the body — as use of both hands, both feet, both eyes, and both ears, should be required. A certificate from a reput - able physician after a careful examination should be required annually. Morals School bus drivers must have as high morals as any other employee of the school district Their actions should result in constructive influence over the pupils. Use of intoxicating liquor and drugs should be prohibited. Use of tobacco while on duty should never be permitted. License Drivers in many other states are required to hold a chauffeur's license. The requirements for securing such license are rigid. They require physical fitness, unusual ability to drive, and are revokable after three law violations. They are issued only after an applicant has demonstrated his ability to drive a bus and that he has adequate knowledge of the laws and rules of the road. This knowledge is determined in all cases by either an oral or written exam - ination. </seg>
            <seg id="p201">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION In this state drivers should be required to hold the regular driver's license and should be required to convince the board of their ability to properly drive a bus before being hired. Personal Appearance Drivers should be required to keep neat and clean at all times while oper - ating a bus. Standards for Basses The following is a very brief resume of standards as taken from several surveys and reports in other states. It is included here in order that districts may use it if they desire when purchasing new equipment in the future. If these standards are followed they should tend to eliminate faulty equipment: Engines . [-•- The size and power of the engine to be selected should be determined by the demands to be made upon it. The condition of the roads and the load to be carried will be important factors to be considered. Economy of opera - tion is very important and remember the proper type engine leads to economy in operation. Purchase should be made from a reputable manufacturer and from a local dealer able to furnish service and parts. Frame of &lt;T»Bnsfa Purchaser should require from manufacturers a guarantee that the chassis is of sufficient strength to carry the body loaded to capacity. Brakes All busses should be equipped with adequate service brakes on all four wheels. Each bus should be equipped with manually operated brakes, inde - pendent of service brakes. Lights Each bus should have two headlights of standard type, and two stop lights connected with the service brakes. Other lights should include two dome lights, a dashlight, two rear red marker lights and two front green marker lights. The marker lights give added protection for night driving or for fog. Lights should be checked each time the bus is taken out on the road. Tires Dual tires should be used on heavy busses. Tires should be of sufficient strength to carry a capacity load. A spare tire properly inflated should always be carried. Single tires in the rear are best for operation on soft dirt, sand; or mud roads. ~ </seg>
            <seg id="p202">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT Protection Against Fire Hazards Exhaust pipes should be securely protected against leakage and no heater operated therefrom, unless a standard exhaust heater equipped with a fan such as are installed on commercial busses. Fuel tanks should be located at the rear of the body. The exhaust pipe must not run near the gas tank. A fire extinguisher located by the driver must be carried at all times. No accumula - tion of grease or oil on body or engine should be allowed. Body Frame The bus body should conform to the size and strength of the chassis. The inside height should be between sixty and sixty-six inches, depending upon the size of children to be transported and the width of the bus. It should be made of substantial material, either all steel, steel and wood, wood to be oak or second growth ash, well seasoned, aluminum or any sufficiently strong material that is light in weight. The main thought is to keep the weight low without sacrificing strength. The body must be well braced. Body Covering The body panels should be aluminum, or of body steel securely fastened, and each joint covered with strips of metal. The body should be covered with a good filler and then a good grade of body paint. Top The top should consist of hardwood ribs set about twelve inches apart and securely attached. These should be covered by wooden hardwood strips running lengthwise about a half inch apart. Over this should be placed a good grade of top covering. Doors Regular doors should be of the swinging type and located on the right side of the body near the front, the door to be opened and closed by a door bar operated by the driver. The handle of the bar should be so located that it may be reached by the driver from the driver's seat. The handle of the bar should be of the lock type that locks the door when it is shut. The emer - gency door, to be used only in an emergency or accident, should be located in the rear on the left side of the bus. It should have a secure lock that may be worked from the outside or inside. It must have a window in the upper half of the door. Windows All windows should be constructed of shatter proof glass, well sealed and 'hill disappearing" type. Guards of metal chromium or nlckle-plated strips should cover all the windows except the one on the driver's left These strips must be easily and quickly detachable in case of emergency or accident. </seg>
            <seg id="p203">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Seats Seats should be graduated in size and should be placed in cross rows, two students to a seat. No seat should obstruct the driver's view of the rear. Seats should be of the unit spring type and seats and backs should be well padded and covered with a good grade of leather. Windshield The windshield should be of one piece of shatter proof glass set at an angle to prevent glares and fixed solid in the body frame above the cowl. A power-driven windshield wiper should be included. This wiper should be of the type which may be worked by hand. A small fan should be fixed to blow on the left to give the driver a view of approaching vehicles. Mirror An inside mirror should give the driver a full view of the interior of the bus and the road immediately to the rear. Another mirror should be extended on the left to give the driver a view of approaching vehicles. Ventilation All busses should have adjustable ventilators, two on each side of the cowl, one on the top of the cowl, and one above the windshield and two in the roof for correct ventilation. Heaters All busses should be equipped with a hot water heater located in the front of the bus on the right side of the dash and an exhaust fan heater to heat the rear end of the bus. Without heaters it is impossible to keep frost, snow, or ice off the windshield in bad weather. Means of Identification Schools busses should be colored a standard color for easy identification upon the road. The body should be a deep yellow with the wheels, top of the body, and the hood painted black. Harmonious arrangement of these col - ors should be carried out and should be carefully done so that the result is pleasing to the eye. The legend "School Bus" should be painted in black letters six inches high, on the rear, on both sides, and on a strip across the front The school should add the name of the school, district number, route, and the number be - low these letters. Floor of Bus The wooden floor of the bus should be constructed of a good grade of wooden flooring securely fastened. Over this should be placed a one-piece </seg>
            <seg id="p204">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT covering of a good grade of linoleum. This will aid in keeping the bus clean and the linoleum is easily swept and mopped each day. Other Equipment All busses should have a good horn of distinctive sound, a speedometer in working order, and a set of tools for emergency repair. A set of chains and a shovel should be included if the bus is routed over dirt roads or in a country where there is heavy snowfall. Other equipment may be added as the district sees fit. </seg>

A. Summary of Activities for the Year Ending June 30, 1934. I. Agricultural Education (a) Evening Agricultural Classes Evening classes, giving systematic instruction in Agriculture to adults who have already entered the vocation of farming, are practicable wherever there is a department of Vocational Agri - culture. Methods of farming are changing constantly with the de - velopments in machinery, discovery of new facts and the consum- </seg>
            <seg id="p213">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION er's demands and standards of living. Progress depends upon the rapidity with which the fanner changes his thinking and operations to meet new conditions. His adjustment will be in direct propor - ton to new knowledge gained. The evening class in Agriculture offers an opportunity for the farmer to obtain this new knowledge. A local school maintaining a department of Vocational Agricul - ture may through evening classes extend its influence and use - fulness in the community. The classes arc organized and taught by the regular all-day agri - culture instructor. The number of such classes is increasing. The amount of State and Federal aid is based upon the number of classes and their duration.

They offer suit - able schooling to the large group of boys between the ages of 14 and 21 who are not regularly enrolled in high school, many of whom have dropped out because the courses did not seem to meet their needs. In the part-time school these boys may receive instruction in agriculture and related subjects during the farmer's "slack season." The work is largely concerned with "doing things" rather than book study. Laboratory . and shop work constitute a large part of the course. The part-time school may so interest many boys that they will return to complete the high school course for graduation.

At the present time, Omaha is the only city having a large enough number of employed boys and girls to warrant organizing a sep - arate part-time school. The schedule of instruction in the part-time school is not fixed, as the pupils enrolled are of varying ages and scholastic attain - ment. They are employed in a variety of jobs and their experi - ences are those of workers rather than children. Consequently, to make the school best serve their needs, it is organized on an opportunity school basis to give the pupil the things he needs and can profit by most Federal and School State Aid Omaha $ 4,785.24 591 boys and girls were enrolled in this school.

The aim is both to prepare for advantageous entrance upon an occupation and to assist the potential expert worker to become a thinker having a larger vision of his field of labor. It is not the purpose of the day unit trade school to prepare students to go directly from the classroom as full-fledged expert workers.

IV. Rehabilitation Division The vocational adjustment of persons disabled by disease, accident, or otherwise has always presented a difficult economic problem. The mechanization and speeding up of Industrial and agricultural produc - tion bringing about more stringent physical requirements for workers has increased its seriousness. Concurrent with the increasing use of machines and faster pro - duction methods in industry and agriculture and with the introduction of the motor vehicle and greater speed in modes of travel has come a tremendous increase In the number of those disabled by accidents. The dependent condition of many of these people creates an economic load which Vocational Rehabilitation is designed to relieve by assisting physically handicapped persons to prepare themselves to engage in occupations whereby they may be self-supporting. During the past year, 40 handicapped persons have been fitted for and placed in occupations in which they are earning a living. These were prepared by school training, by employment training and by the provision of artificial appliances, physical restoration and care - ful re-adjustment to suitable occupations. With the aid of this division 202 disabled persons are now pre - paring themselves to engage in new occupations. Applications from many others are pending. </seg>
            <seg id="p223">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION PROGRAM FOR THE REHABILITATION OF CRIPPLED CHILDREN IN NEBRASKA Organization The program Is conducted under the join direction of the State Elks Association Crippled Children Committee and the Division of Rehabilitation in the State Department of Vocational Educaton. This division is supported jointly by the state and federal governments for the promotion of the Rehabilitation of Disabled Persons, a project designed to assist the physically handicapped to become self-support - ing citizens. The Rehabilitation Division assists in the correlation and coor - dination of various public and private services for the correction of physical defects: provides vocational guidance and training for dis - abled persons; encourages their employment by business and industry and aids in their placement. Because of the limited amount of money available. necessitaUna restrictions In the Federal Act. the funds of the division can only be expended for services to persons of employable age. However the successful rehabilitation as adults of persons disabled at early ages depends upon the extent of physical correction that can be given them during their period of growth and also upon the continuance of mental development and general education during the process of physical restoration. To promote better coordination between the physical restoration and general education of crippled children and their later training and placement in specific occupations, a field worker is employed jointly by thV Rehabilitation Division and the Crippled Children Com - mittee. He divides his time between the work of the State Elks As - sociation with crippled children below employable age and work of the Rehabilitation Division for crippled children of employable age. The Committee employs a part-time clerical assistant as needed to maintain their records and handle correspondence. Objectives 1. To correlate and coordinate all public and private efforts for crippled children In Nebraska so that they may be given complete physical and mental examination and adequate physical restora - tion.. 2. To make possible proper institutional care for mentally abnormal crippled children. </seg>
