SHALLENBERGER, Governor of Nebraska. The Honorables SILAS R. BARTON, Auditor of Public Account L. G. BRIAN, State Treasurer, WM. T. THOMPSON, Attorney General. Members of the State Banking Board SIRS: — In conformity with section 3a, chapter 8 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, I beg to submit herewith the Eighteenth Annual Report of the Secretary of the State Banking Board, covering the period beginning November 27, 1908, and ending November 16, 1909. The banks under your supervision were called upon for four reports of their condition during the year, tabulated summaries of which appear in this report. Detailed reports of the six hundred and sixty-two banks in active operation and reporting November 16, 1909, together with reports of banks in the hands of receivers, a tabulated summary of the condition of the National banks of Nebraska on November 16, 1909, compiled from reports made to the Comptroller of the Currency, and abstract of the reports of the condition of both National and State banks combined for the dates referred to above will be found elsewhere in this report The banking law requires at least one examination of banks each calendar year. There were six hundred and eighty-three regular and special examinations of banks made during the year. Including building and loan associations there were seven hundred and fifty-two examina - tions made. </seg>

Ratio of capital to deposits in all banks is 1 to 5.91. A careful examination of the contents of this report will show the banks in this State, as a rule, both prosperous and safe. The spirit and letter of the banking law is generally complied with in a satisfactory man- ner, and the rules and regulations of this Department meet with very ready response upon the part of the banks. During the past year there have been some instances of mismanage- </seg>
            <seg id="p005">SECRETARY OF THE STATE BANKING BOARD. 5 ment, but no serious consequences have followed for the reason that remedial measures were promptly and efficiently applied. Your Secretary believes that it is the province of this Department to prevent bank failures by such close supervision as will prevent in solvency first, and loss afterwards The records of the past year will show not a single failure under the supervision of this Department, and not a dollar of loss to a depositor While the Department claims some credit for this showing It is only fai to state that it is a tribute to the high class of bank management tha generally prevails in the banks of the state. While the foregoing i certainly gratifying the record for the past nine years is even more so Receivers' reports since 1901 show the losses from failed banks in this state, a compilation of which shows as follows: Average annual deposits in etate banks since 1901, 9 years....$50,379,810.0O Total deposits in failed banks 451,557.00 Total unpaid claims, less cash in Receivers' hands 187,995.36 Average annual loss for past nine years 20,888.37 Average annual loss on deposits is less than 42 cents on each $1,000.00 The average deposits in the National banks of this state for the past nine years are $80,101,054.40, which together with the average deposits of state banks, $50,379,810.00, aggregates total average deposits for the State of Nebraska amounting to $130,480,864.40, thus showing the average annual loss to be 16 cents on each $1,000.00, or two, one hundred and twenty-fifths of one per cent No better proof of the value of supervision is needed than is pro- duced by the foregoing record, for it is only fair to assume that during a period marked by such great activity in commercial lines, with rapid advance in prices of everything, naturally leading to speculation with all its attendant dangers, inclines to hazardous investments. It has been the aim of this Department to maintain as intimate a knowledge, as careful conscientious examinations and thorough and searching reports will permit, of the investments held by the banks of this state, and I believe that we can truthfully assert in the main and as a whole they have been carefully made. It would take a financial revo- lution, almost a cyclone in character, to imperil the banking situation in this state. In view of the high prices to which, lands have gone, and in fact all commodities, especially those of agricultural origin, the Department la trying to impress the banks of the state that it is a time when they must be especially conservative in their investments and that values and prices are often only matters of opinion, and we believe that bank man- agements generally are taking this view of the situation. The steady growth of deposits from year to year shows plainly that the wealth of the state is accumulating in a satisfactory manner, for no </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE better barometer or indication of the general condition can be found than in the showing made by the banks. This Department has repeatedly recommended an amendment to the present banking act permitting banks to loan to any one person, partner - ship or corporation twenty per cent of the unimpaired capital and surplus, instead of twenty per cent of the capital only, as now permitted. This would encourage a building up of a surplus fund, which is always a pro - tection to the capital invested, fortifying against its impairment and strengthening the integrity of the bank. I believe the stability of invest - ments in Nebraska have reached a point that fully justifies this privilege. There is one feature of the present situation in this state to which I desire to call your attention, and for which there seems at present no adequate remedy, and that is the establishment of banks where panking facilities are already adequate for the needs of the community. This often results in two or three, or more, weak or poorly paying banks where fewer would be stronger and safer and meet all the requirements. Your honorable Board should have the same privilege as the Comptroller of the Currency in the supervision of national banks. You should have a legal right, when application is made for a charter for a bank, to de - cide on the qualifications, the financial ability, the past record of the proposed management, and to determine whether or not the community where the proposed bank is to be established justifies the venture. Re - peated instances coming to this Department clearly indicate the necessity of some step in this direction. At the last session of the Legislature a law was passed providing for the creation of a fund to protect depositors in banks that fail. This law is now being contested in the courts, having been tried in the United States District Court of this state, which court rendered an adverse decision, and the case now stands appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. Pending a decision from that tribunal the Department is enjoined from enforcing any of its provisions, and is complying with such injunction. This law provides for additional examiners and a levy of a tax on banks for the purpose of creating a fund to be used by the Banking Board where the assets of the bank are insufficient to pay its liabilities. None of these provisions are being enforced, as stated before, pending a final decision of the case. There are other amendments which should be made to the banking law that would materially strengthen the banks of the state. It should provide for a minimum number of persons, not less than five, to entitle to the privilege of incorporation, and not less than three directors residents of the county in which the bank is situated. I believe that the State Banking Board should be clothed with legal authority to approve or disapprove reserve agents for banks under its supervision. These </seg>
            <seg id="p007">SECRETARY OF THE STATE BANKING BOARD. 7 amendments would not constitute any radical change in the present law. A compliance therewith would not entail any great hardship. In conclusion it is only just to commend the most excellent service rendered by Examiners E. E. Emmett, C. H. Beaumont, E. S. Mickey, C. W. Erwin and E. H. Mullowney, and Chief Clerk N. R. Persinger, each of whom has performed his duty with great fidelity and to the credit of himself and the Department. I certainly have reason to thank your honorable Board for the uniform courtesy I have received at your hands and for the careful con - sideration you have given all matters relating to the Department that I have been privileged to bring before you. Very respectfully, E. ROYSE, Secretary State Banking Board. </seg>
