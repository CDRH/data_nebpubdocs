We will now receive the President's message. BY PRESIDENT MILLER: I want to remark that it is with deep regret that I approach the moment when I shall be through as Presi - dent. The co-operation I have received has been wonderful. I realize that we have had many troubles and I must remark that we could not have accomplished much of anything alone. When we have met as a Board of Managers we have had our differences, and many times -we have disagreed on some subject and we have not always voted alike in meetings, but when the meeting was over, then with perfect co - operation we have stood together. And the next time we would meet, we would be glad to get back together. I know, as members of the Board, we have always stood together in co-operation. I have relied upon and highly valued the advice of the older members and the Past Presidents who have served upon the Board with me. I have valued the experience of Graff, Jackson and others, who have served so long on this Board, and I regret, again, I say, to come to the time when I am through my service as President. i i THE PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS In spite of the weather and financial conditions that prevailed throughout the nation, the 1934 Nebraska State Fair was a success. Not as prosperous a terminatory as the Board of Managers had wished or hoped for but a success, never-the-less. Since a Fair is primarily an educational Institution its success can not necessarily be measured by the financial condition but rather by </seg>
            <seg id="p012">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the class of exhibits and the interest the visitors manifested in them. It is true that there was a small deficit in the financial ledger but this was less than the year previous when the depression had not yet reached its lowest level. All the exhibits, agricultural, horticultural, live stock, fine arts, domestic, school and 4-H were as fine in quality as ever had been shown at this Fair. In the live stock departments the number of exhibits were smaller than in many previous years but this was attributed largely to the shortage of forage and the high price of mill feeds. The purpose of the Fair is to show quality rather than quantity. The visitors were pleased to view the splendid exhibits of machinery on display. This proved that the manufacturers and distributors of the various kinds of farm implements have faith in the productive - ness of the good state of Nebraska and that the protracted drouth would soon be broken. While considerable expense is required in maintaining an exhibit of this sort yet the financial returns in the end, without question, far exceed the expense. Because prospective, buy - ers are afforded an opportunity to view a particular piece of machinery in all its working possibilities. While there was a notable absence of grass, yet the grounds pre - sented a fine appearance by the remarkable growth of flowers and shrubs. A great deal of grading and re-arrangement of buildings had been done during the summer. This was made possible through CWA and FERA funds. The old horse barns which had stood so many years near the entrance of the Fair Grounds and as prominent as a hump on a camel, were moved down beside the Swine Barns where they belonged long ago. f ■ . The racing program was up to par with other years. While not as large purses were offered as previously, yet contests were just as keen because a hundred dollars looks almost as big now as a thousand did in the past. After all it is the spirit of the thing rather than the size of the purse that makes a race worthwhile. Customers can enter into the spirit but not enter into the purse which is entirely for the con - testants. If the contestants do not take the customers into consider - ation and give them a race for their money a racing program falls flat. Many races in the past have proved a failure due to the selfishness of those who take part. At this last Fair the contestants were given to understand that it was up to them to make good with the visitors or their services would not be needed. That was a stimulus for good racing. A policy of this sort is worthy of consideration in future race meets. The program before the grandstand was up to the usual standard given by the Nebraska State Fair. The price for the acts was much </seg>
            <seg id="p013">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE less than paid in former years but the quality was good. Financial reverses have caused the booking agents to come down to earth and permitted entertainment at a reasonable figure. At the Coliseum the second annual horse show was given the first (our days. A singular fact concerning the show was that it was a success both as to a contest and as to finances. For the last two even - ings modern wrestling matches were held. The sight of contestants going to the mat like wild bulls was something new to many of the cash customers. From the applause given the program was no doubt enjoyed. As a whole the visitors returned to their homes with a feeling they had been well entertained and that everything possible had been done for their comfort. Complaints and distructive criticism were noticeable by their absence and the management received much praise for the ex - cellent manner in which the Fair was handled. In preparing for the Fair the Board of Managers devoted an un - limited amount of time in carefully selecting a program that would bring the most for the money expended. Economy was the watch word in all their endeavors. A budget was prepared based on the ex - penditures of the previous year and this was carefully carried out. Little savings were made on every corner. But in spite of all this the receipts were smaller than the 1933 fair and a small deficit resulted. It was the general opinion that had the awful drouth not effected us there would have been a balance in the treasury. The management was indebted to the Lincoln Chamber of Com - merce which took $5,000 worth of tickets in an advance sale. This was sort of rain insurance. In addition to this the grandstand bond - holders gave 50% of the grandstand gate receipts. This was a worthy move and demonstrated that these bondholders are keenly interested in the success of the Fair. In this connection it might be mentioned that it is an unfortunate condition that the grandstand is not owned by the Fair Association. Under the present set up practically all the expenses of the Fair must be borne by the admissions at the front gate together with concession fees. No fair can hope to be successful under a working plan of this sort. It is plainly to be seen that had the Nebraska Fair been able to use all of its receipts no deficit which was less than $3,000, would have resulted. It might be noted that this deficit was taken care of by pro - rating amounts due to the different free acts and entertainment. All labor, premiums, electrical, water and garbage contracts were paid in full. What to be done in the future with the grandstand is a serious ob- </seg>
            <seg id="p014">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ligation resting upon the State. The grandstand is a necessary part of the Fair equipment and is located upon the State's property. It was constructed by bondholders of the State who invested their money in good faith for the upbuilding of the commonwealth. Theirs was a ■worthy endeavor. Since the State is the sole beneficiary in this won - derful project it is no more than right and just that the legislature should appropriate sufficient money to refund these bonds together with the interest due. The construction of the grandstand was not an idle whim of any person but was a prime necessity. The old structure had become un - safe because of the rotty condition of the timbers and had its use con - tinued there is no question but that a serious accident endangering the lives of hundreds of men, women and children might have resulted. Something had to be done. After much negotiating the new grand - stand was built by the sale of debenture bonds. Now we have this magnificient structure which has added so much to the comfort and usefulness of the exhibitors and visitors and no adequate method of taking care of it. The responsibility of maintaining this building as a part of state's property should rest with its citizens. This is a matter for serious consideration and everyone interested not only in the Fair but also in the great State of Nebraska should take it upon his shoulders to see that something is done. The Ne - braska State Fair does not belong to any one group of people but to every citizen in the State. Nothing would give a greater stimulus to Fair activities than to have the State' take over the grandstand and pay all the financial obligations held against it. No delegates were sent to the annual meeting of the International Association of Fairs and Expositions at Toronto last December. It was an economical if not prudent move. In the past it has been the custom to send at least two members of the Board to this annual gathering for the purpose of setting the dates and threshing out any difficult problems that may have risen in the conduct of the various Fairs and Expositions held throughout the United States and Canada. It has been- suggested that since the Board is committed to the plan of rigid economy that the Nebraska Fair withdraw its membership to this Association on the grounds that since the meeting was not attended there is no use in paying the annual dues. However, I do not favor this since much good results from these conclaves and we should have a representative present to defend our Fair dates which are among the best in the whole Fair season, and our contracts with the carnival companies and such other matters that arise from time to time: The farmers upon whom the Fair depends largely for its patronage suffered more, the past year from drouth, than in any other year since </seg>
            <seg id="p015">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the state was settled. In the past there have been drouths, grass - hoppers, plagues and general depressions, but none so severe as this, where the farmers in some sections were left almost entirely without feed and forage for their livestock. They have suffered severely but still they are not discouraged. Hope and expectations have always been a concrete part of those engaged in the farming industry. They may be down but never out. Their courage and constancy abides with, them stronger now than ever before. They will not be dismayed or overcome with pessimism. When the fall rains came to sweeten the drouth laiden atmosphere the optimism mounted and they are now . hopeful of a bountiful crop for 1935. In all his endeavors the farmer is not influenced by the widespread demand of industrial workers for a 30 hour week. The farmer has always labored from daylight until dark as well as taking care of his stock on Sundays and holidays. No advocate of these abbreviated days finds favor in the eyes of this tiller of the soil. These schemes desired by the industrial workers has often played havoc with the plans of the farmer. For no farm can be run on a six hour day and five days a week plan. What would the poor stock do during these weekly vacations? There is work for the full seven days a week and 365 days in the year on the farm. Thrift has been an intrical part of him. His motto has been work and save and he has diligently practiced this precept. The old adage that "you can't buy yourself rich, you must sell yourself rich" is as true to - day as in the past, notwithstanding the new deal to the contrary. Much has been written about the unemployment situation. It is a grevious problem with which the people have to contend. But what - ever is done the country cannot become prosperous until these men are given jobs. It has been suggested that industry absorb these men. That is a wonderful scheme. However, its fulfillment is the difficult problem. Whatever is done there is an assurance that the farmers will do their share. In Nebraska there are approximately 118,000 farms. If the price of farm products will reach a level comparable with prices of commodities they must purchase, at least 50% and possibly 100% of these farmers will employ an extra man. This number may not seem large but it means that agriculture at least is doing its bit. There has never been a time, a period in the history of this nation of ours but that the farmer has come to the aid of his country. He has given without stint and sacrificed even that which is most dear to him. As your President leaves this exalted office which he has held the past two years he wishes to thank all those who have worked and cooperated with him so wonderfully in making the fairs a success and the Board of Managers have been with him a hundred per cent in every undertaking. Words can not express his fervent appreciation for their </seg>

His only wish is that all the future fairs may be bigger and better than the past. BY CHAIRMAN VANCE: You have heard the report of the Presi - dent. What will you do with it? BY MR. PURCELL: I move that the report of the President be accepted. Seconded. Motion put and carried. BY PRESIDENT MILLER: We will now receive the report of the Secretary. SECRETARY'S REPORT The year 1934 from the standpoint of holding a State Fair in Ne - braska, probably had no parallel in all the years of the Fairs exist - ence. The management was confronted with some of the most dis - couraging factors ever experienced in trying to plan for a State Fair. Some of the principal difficulties were, first, a limited appropriation from the legislature for the maintenance and upkeep of the Fair; second, the nation wide depression was at its height with thousands of citizens of the state unemployed and at least three-fourths of the entire state suffering from an unprecedented drouth, and the entire state sweltering under an intense heat which lasted almost the entire summer. While many were suggesting that there be no State Fair held in 1934, and with all of these discouragements and many others, the Board of Managers felt it would be a backward step effecting the agri - cultural interests of the State if no Fair was held, so put their shoulders to the wheel and with the cooperation of many broadminded citizens of the State, the Lincoln Chamber of Commerce, the grandstand bond - holders committee, and many others, the most successful Fair from a financial standpoint in the past four years was held. The premiums and expenses of the Fair proper were all paid in full with the excep - tion of some advertising and attraction contracts which were bought with the understanding that they would take their proportionate share of what was left after premiums and expenses were paid. The amount lacking was $2,9 70.00 which we agreed to ask the legislature to ap - propriate. Owing to the small amount appropriated by the legislature for maintenance it was necessary to pay a number of large bills from State Fair receipts which were formerly paid out of the maintenance appropriation. We were also compelled to pay one thousand dollars and interest on a note at the bank which was carried over from former years^ Had this not been necessary, all bills would have been paid in full and a small balance left in the treasury. </seg>
            <seg id="p017">REPORT ()l- NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE We felt that under the circumstances the exhibits in the various departments were very good and the exhibitors as a whole were well pleased when the premiums were paid in full. Some of the depart - ments had more entries than in some of the previous years. In the draft horse department there were 33 exhibitors with 220 entries in 1934 compared with 19 exhibitors with 134 entries in 1933. The exhibitors In this department were very well pleased with the new arrangements of the barns and stated that the accommodations equaled or surpassed any of the other state fairs. In the Beef Cattle Department classes there were 25 exhibitors with 354 entries this year compared with 21 exhibitors with 332 entries in 1933. In the Dairy Cattle Department this year there were 66 exhibitors with 284 entries compared with 47 exhibitors with 273 entries in 1933. In the Swine Department there were 57 exhibitors with 776 entries this year compared with 66 exhibitors with 738 entries in 1933. While the exhibit here was not as large as in other years, it was of a high quality and some very outstanding animals were shown. In the Sheep Department there were 16 exhibitors with 189 entries in 1934 compared with 18 exhibitors with 265 entries in 1933. While the Poultry Department had 30 exhibitors with 319 entries in 1934 compared with 21 exhibitors with 399 entries in 1933, it was probably the smallest show of poultry in many years. The Pigeon Department showe'd a splendid increase in number of exhibitors and entries. In 1934 there were 41 exhibitors with 305 entries compared with 14 exhibitors with 76 entries in 1933. The exhibit was one of the best on the grounds. The Rabbit Department had 3 exhibitors with 11 entries in 1934 compared with 8 exhibitors with 29 entries in 1933. In Class "F"- — Farm Products, which, on account of the climatic conditions was feared there would be a very poor exhibit, there were 84 exhibitors with 820 entries this year, compared with 90 exhibitors with 1,026 entries in 1933. Some of the exhibits even surpassed in quality those of former years. In the Horticulture Department there were an equal number of exhibitors for both 1933 and 1934 — 54 in all with 431 entries in 1934 and 406 entries in 1933. The Domestic Products Department also had an equal number of exhibitors for 1933 and 1934 of 95, entries totalling 1,501 in 1934 compared with 1,474 in 1933. </seg>

J' e u unrac In the Speed events the purses were small and only a few harness horses were on the grounds with about 60 head of running horses The contests were very good and the attendance in the grandstand was much better in the afternoon than it was for the night show. The automobile races which were held the last day of the Pair were a good attraction as usual. a T !)!u' Z l Phyr " WhIch Was exhibIted b y the Burlington Railroad one day of the Pair attracted a large number of people. </seg>

            <seg id="p020">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE two very successful large fairs which have a free front gate but under a law that both Kansas and Oklahoma have had for a number of years the voters of the county wherein these fairs are held have voted a levy to pay all the premiums offered by these Associations with county war - rants. r am wondeHng lf the taxpayers of Lancaster county WQuld be willing to vote a levy to pay all the premiums offered by these Asso - ciations with county warrants. I am wondering if the tax-payers of Lancaster county would be willing to vote a levy to pay all the premiums offered by the State Fair with county warrants in order to have a free gate. The premiums last year amounted to $22,695.54. In December of 1933, application was made by the Board to the CWA officials for some projects to be worked out on the Fair Grounds by CWA workers. From that time until the present time, with the exception of seven weeks during the summer, there has been daily from 10 to 70 men— laborers, carpenters, electricians, plumbers and painters— working on the different projects on the grounds Some of the work that has been done during that time is as follows - the first work done on the grounds was some drain ditches put in on the north side of Salt Creek on the State Fair property and bushes and debris was cleaned off. Eighty rods of fence was built on the north line from the northeast corner west. Between Salt Creek and Oak Creek the old stone walls were cleared away and the ground leveled and much stone, brick and debris cleaned away. North of the Speed Barns the abandoned Rock Island switch tracks were leveled down giving better drainage and cleaning up the unsightly place. The former cottage which had been used by the different secretaries during the summer was torn down and rebuilt into a modern house the CWA furnishing $400.00 for new material. The four draft horse barns were removed from the old location on the south end of the grounds, three of them to the location north of the Swine Barn and cross sections 30x14 2 feet built in containing 12 box stalls, office for superintendent, three rooms for caretakers, two toilets with sanitary sewers and frost proof water connections for winter use. The barns were rebuilt with concrete foundations, new sills, siding, and doors, and the stalls were all rebuilt and the out - side painted. The barn used for the State Fair work horses was moved north of the race track and also was rebuilt. This barn was in very bad condition and took considerable material to put it in good condi - tion. The grounds where the barns originally stood were leveled off and seeded in blue grass and the extra dirt, 1,100 yards, was hauled down and used where the barns now stand. </seg>
            <seg id="p021">KEPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The ground east of the grandstand where the wooden bleachers stood has been filled and seeded to blue grass. The race track has been completely rebuilt and resurfaced, 3,000 yards of dirt being put on it. The furnaces in the 4-H building were moved from the top of the arena as they were not a success the way they were installed, and were put in fireproof rooms on the ground level and doors put in on all entrances and stairways to the arena. New toilets and shower rooms with hot water connections and furnaces have also been added in the east end of this building. It is now fitted up so it can be heated and used for meetings of all kinds during the winter months. The electric line from the southwest corner of the Swine Barn was rebuilt, eight new 40-foot poles being set in this line. The Cattle Barn has been rewired, switch panels and separate con - trols for each floor with power lines added. Transformers and fireproof switch rooms were built in the Coliseum with switchboard and rewiring now under construction. The wiring in this building and the Agricultural Hall has never been safe and was too li,ght to carry the load that was required at times during the Fair. A line as put into the apartments in the grandstand, entirely in - dependent of the light line and the roof or house lights were arranged into three series making it better during the night show. The Auditorium has been rewired with new lead in and switch panels besides several minor improvements have been made in the electric system. The grounds were re-surveyed and the fence along the north side of the grounds south of the Rock Island tracks has been set on the State Fair property line, north of the abandoned tracks and extending north of Salt Creek. The old rails from the street car track were cut into fence posts and used for a new line of fence and about 750 of these posts are still on hand. A shed has been built in the material yards to house salvage lumber and material, the CWA furnished $1SO.OO toward the building. The camp cabins, bus depot, auditorium and many of the smaller buildings have been painted with white lead and oil. The extremely hot weather last summer was very bad for com - position roofs and a great deal of repairing had to be done. Many of the roofs on the buildings are still in bad condition and it will be nee- </seg>

As these roofs cover a space of about 20 acres it will be necessary to spend quite a sum of money in this work. The sewer system under the Women's Building was rebuilt and water piping in the Fish Building was also rebuilt and repaired. When the old Capitol was torn down much of the old brick and stone was hauled out on the dump inside the Fair Grounds. More than 50,000 of these bricks were salvaged and used in the rebuilding and remodeling of the different buildings on the grounds. Much of the stone was also used in repair work. A great amount of the labor for these different projects has been furnished by the CWA and the FERA without cost to the Fair Asso - ciation, the Fair Association furnishing the material and hiring the foreman. Too much credit canot be given to the Superintendent of Grounds, Mr. Morris Reichenbach, for the manner in which he has taken care of the work on the Fair Grounds. He has practically studied and worked night and day to keep the men furnished by the CWA and FERA to work on projects that would be to the best improvement of the grounds. I have had wonderful cooperation and help from the officials of the CWA and FERA, they were always willing to help us in anyway possible and furnish men to do the work. The Lincoln Chamber of Commerce and the grandstand bondholders committee helped us in every way possible. I also want to thank the county fair officials and the members of the State Board of Agriculture for their fine co - operation and help.

Page 64. Lot 10 — Brown Swiss. Lines 468, 469 and 470 eliminate the 3rd prize. Line 472, add two dollars to each of the four prizes making 1st $8.00; 2nd $6.00; 3rd $4.00 and 4th $3.00. Line 476, drop 3rd prize. Page 76. Lot 5 — Chester White. Make the classification and premiums to correspond to the other breed of hogs. Page 87. Poultry.

PRESIDENT MILLER resumes chair: There was another subject considered by the Committee but not incorporated in its report, in regard to the open class on swine only. Will someone present that? BY MR. A. J. WELCH, Seward: I would say a few words. This is with respect to the growing practice of 4-H Club boys being entered </seg>
            <seg id="p033">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE so freely ip the open class. It may seem well for them to have every - thing free but it does not seem to work that way with some of our young people when it comes to the subject of their free entrance into the open classes. Again we can show you and your records will show you, that a great per cent of the 4-H Clubs should enter just barrows, gilts, and sows, and that there should be discontinued, the practice of competition in the free class on the part of the 4-H Clubs, and the 4-H Clubs either barred from the open class or limited to the barrow class. Seventy per cent of the 4-H Clubs' display are from Lancaster County, and eighty-five per cent of the premiums stay in a little group of counties surrounding Lancaster County. But it seems that boys and girls \from clubs further away should have a chance. The State Fair Is meant to be a statewide organization and boys and girls from Thurstom or Thayer, or Keith, or Custer County should have just as much chance as those from Lancaster County. Something should be done to level down these opportunities so that the boys from Lincoln and close' in, would not have all the chance for the premiums. Now what can. be done to eliminate this trouble so that eighty-five per cent of the premiums will not go to a small group of counties sur - rounding\Lancaster? BY PRESIDENT MILLER: Let's get at your proposal. Do you think the/situation might be improved by eliminating competition of the 4-H Club in the open class, or simply by limiting them to the showing of barrovte? I notice Mr. Frisbie, of the Extension Department, is here. Might wd have a word from him, on this matter? BY MR. L. I. FRISBIE: Gentlemen: The 4-H Clubs have definitely brought this up for discussion and at the annual conference of Exten - sion Agents, this matter was worked out with the 4-H Clubs. I could not be present at a meeting of your revision Committee, because we just got back from Denver, from where we just returned on a judging trip this 'morning. Personally I have no recommendation and only want to report what our study has been on the subject. Someone has mentioned that Lancaster County and surrounding territory capture so many of the premiums. You must not forget that Lancaster County has 881 club members. Now second to that, is perhaps, Scotts Bluff County, but they are so far away, we would not expect them to enter into the 'hog competition. So I don't think that the whole matter can be remedied by the restriction of exhibits. The best I can advise is, that you consider all phases carefully, and let the Board of Managers take any action decided upon. For I know the advancement of young people is what we all most desire to attain. BY MR. A. J. WELCH: That is my idea. I don't want to call for any rash action, but I just wanted to bring this matter out for study by all who may be concerned. I did not anticipate, in any way, that </seg>
            <seg id="p034">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE precipitate action should be taken without there being a survey of the matter being made. BY PRESIDENT MILLER: I rather thought that was what you desired, that the matter be taken under consideration and that no undue quick action be taken. I know that no one here, wishes to in any way, injure the feeling or dull the prospects of these future men and women who in time to come, will make our Fair. BY MR. PRISBIE: I would like to ask one question. I listened to this matter discussed, for three hours, among our County Agents. I realize none of you want to hinder the work among the 4-H Clubs. BY MR. EBERS: (Seward County) Somebody just asked if there were any professional breeders here, who could answer, if the breeders welcome the competition of the 4-H boys. I have always cherished having the competition of the young exhibitors, but there may be some phases that should be brought out. Now the purpose in exhibiting animals, of course, is to sell them at a good price when the exhibit is over. I think there are some advant - ages taken in the purchase of some of this stock. There are some buyers who will try to give these young exhibitors a short price. We have always tried to educate these young exhibitors when they come in contact with us, or deal with us, in the value of the article they have produced or shown. Of course we. do not always have an oppor - tunity to do that. Some of the boys, have not come in contact with the breeders or in some other way, have not come to realize the value of their boars or their stock. Then when it comes time for them to sell, they know that it will cost them a lot to take them back home and perhaps no buyers are going back out into the country to see the 4-H exhibitors, so they fear that they best sell at whatever price they can get, so an undue advantage is taken of them by these unscrupulous buyers. BY PRESIDENT MILLER: Well, what do you recommend should be done in this matter? BY MR. FRISBIE: Well, I am sure that eliminating the boar class may create a better understanding than to bar them from the open class. I am sure the dairy class have no boar class, for their troubles are all with heifers. . • ■ i BY MR. R. C. JOHNSON: I would like to say just a word about the 4-H competition, not just as to hogs, but as it affects things over in our department. With us there are some complaints because of the confusion created when the entries have very largely been made, per - haps the ring is full of stock and we are ready to start judging. The breeders then complain about having a lot of entries run in by the 4-H </seg>
            <seg id="p035">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE boys. That is my objection to that practice. I am just giving my point of view. We would suggest, or advocate, that the boars be eliminated and the competition be restricted to the barrows. BY PRESIDENT MILLER: Then as I understand the matter will be left to the consideration of the Board of Managers, for action, under the general authority given for that purpose. Motion made to recess until 9:00 o'clock Wednesday morning. WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 16th, 1935. FORENOON SESSION Ballroom, Cornhusker Hotel, Lincoln, Nebraska Roll call of the Board, disclosed all present, except Atkins and McLaughlin, heretofore excused. Wake, sick, and Lilley, engaged at the Legislature. 25 votes present. Roll call of Counties, showed 24 Counties represented, as hereto - fore noted. 49 votes present. BY PRESIDENT MILLER: We will now receive the report of the CREDENTIALS COMMITTEE. CHAIRMAN R. C. JOHNSON: Mr. Bates, of Custer County, has gone home and left E. R. Purcell, as delegate to vote for that County. Mr. R. C. Anderson, delegate for Saunders County, has also gone and as President of the Saunders County Fair, I will vote for that County. We have no further report to make. I move that the committee be discharged. Motion seconded, voted upon and carried. BY PRESIDENT MILLER: We will now receive the report of the RESOLUTIONS COMMITTEE. BY CHAIRMAN E. R. PURCELL: The Resolutions Committee met and talked over, yesterday, the resolutions and decided that there are no doubt subjects upon which we could present resolutions, but we came to the conclusion that perhaps it would be just as well to re - main silent on most such subjects. There are a large number of leg - islative problems that might affect State Fairs, but we thought it better, not to go on record or to bring out points in writing. For most, we would all agree that the most pressing problems that confront the State Fair, the County Fairs, and the Agriculture in general, is the need of economy, in County Fairs' and State Fairs' management. But it is not necessary to bring out a hand full of resolutions on that subject. </seg>
            <seg id="p036">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE But I would like to have Mr. Graff, of the Committee, give you a word along the line of what the Resolutions Committee have taken under consideration. BY MR. CHARLES GRAFF: Mr. Chairman and Mr. President. I am always ready to give a word, but I think my friend, Mr. Purcell, has pretty well covered the position taken by the Resolutions Com - mittee. I am always ready to resolute, but we felt that the matter is pretty well protected without any written resolutions. BY CHAIRMAN PURCELL: I move the adoption of the report of the Resolutions Committee. Motion seconded, vote taken and same carried. The suggestion was made by a delegate that at the close of the Nuckolls County Fair John Pfieffer, had collapsed and died. Attention was called to the fact that resolutions upon County Officers, fell within the province of the County Fair Managers. BY PRESIDENT MILLER: The next order of business, before the Board will be to proceed with the election. As tellers I will ap - point E. R. Purcell, of Custer County, William Steyer, of Douglas ' J County, and D. W. Osborn, of Pawnee County. Ballots cast, and during the counting of votes by the tellers, the fol - lowing discussions ensued. A few moments recess. BY PRESIDENT MILLER: I am surprised no one has anything to. say during this interim. We have labored hard for twelve months and no doubt we shall have to labor for another twelve months and this is a good opportunity for anyone to air anything they have on their chest. The Chair will recognize, member, S. A. SANDERSON, of Lancaster County. BY MR. SEWELL A. SANDERSON, Lincoln: Mr. President. I 1 might say a word with reference to the situation as found by the audit - ing committee. This is the first time that I have served on an Auditing Committee for the State Fair. For a good many years, the head of ' our firm, Mr. C. H. Rudge, was president of the local Fair and other- I wise connected with the State Fair and with Fair activities. So that ! for a good many years, as his right hand man, I was familiar with many of the Fair activities, but it has only been recently that I be - came a member of this board and more active in this line. Now, as a member of the Auditing Committee, I was greatly inter - ested in what I was able to observe as to the efficiency of your office force in handling the matters of this department. I used to think , when I would hear loose rumors about this being a closed corporation </seg>
            <seg id="p037">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE and a self-perpetuating organization. So I remark that it has been with unusual interest that I went through the books and the records and find things in such good shape. I know I took Mr. Purbaugh, our County Agent, to task, for not having cashed a twenty dollar war - rant. If a man got a twenty-flve cent warrant, he might take it home and frame it for a souvenir, but these days there must be something the matter with a man that doesn't cash a twenty dollar warrant. Again I want to congratulate this organization upon the splendid ability and efficiency shown by its office force. BY PRESIDENT MILLER: We certainly appreciate that compli - ment coming from a business man like Mr. Sanderson. Now we will hear a word from the man who have been taking the place of our Treasurer. BY MR. W. B. BANNING: I would be glad to say a word as to what I find concerning the work of the man who has been handling the Treasurer's office. We find Mr. Wake's accounts to be in perfect order. Every penny of the receipts that are taken in are perfectly ac - counted for. But I might mention one matter on which a little more economy might be practiced. That is in the use of those turn-stiles. Every ticket checker who takes out any tickets, must account for either the tickets or the proper amount of money and there can be no leak there. Now I believe men could be placed at the gate to sell the tickets and that perhaps, six or eight men on the gate could be saved by running the gate without those turn-stiles. When they were put in, some ten or twelve years ago, we had the big crowds that we thought it was necessary to hold back. Now, I just give this informa - tion for your consideration, for I believe now, we could cut a little there by dispensing with the use of these turn-stiles. BY MR. R. C. JOHNSON: I don't know, as we could afford or would need turn-stiles at a County Fair, but we have been talking some about the use of an expedient to accomplish the same purpose. That is, just four wagon spokes to hold the crowd back. We have pretty good ticket takers, but now and them some fellow will rush up with an air of importance as if he had to go right on inside to see somebody and he will never look either way, nor glance at the ticket taker. If the taker was to leave and grab or intercept him, there would be a dozen more people ready to pass through. Of course I have never taken tickets, but I would like to see anybody get by me. I just mention this, for we may or may not use it, but it just fits in along this line. BY MR. J. S. STEELE: (Kimball) I may be a little out of order in bringing this up here, but as one of the three members of the Leg - islative Committee, delegated by the County Fair Association, I might </seg>
            <seg id="p038">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE touch upon the work that we are to undertake. I just want to make this request on behalf of that Legislative Committee. That before each one of you men go home, you get in touch with your members of the Legislature and ask them to withhold judgment of action upon any measures until this Committee has a chance to prepare any bills it may want introduced, or otherwise decide what action it wishes to take on bills now introduced. On the other hand, there may be measures we simply want amended. We don't know whether we will introduce any bills or simply work for or against bills introduced by others. But if you can assist in having the members hold back until we have a chance to decide upon bills, we will appreciate your co - operation in that manner. BY PRESIDENT MILLER: We wish to thank you, Mr. Steele, and we know that your Committee is one that will protect the interests of the County and State Fairs. The pari-mutuel racing, whether we approve of or want it, is something of importance and if there is to be something passed on the subject we know that we are concerned and must see that we are pro - tected. I want to mention one matter. Secretary Reed and I attended the International Conference of Fairs and Expositions at Chicago. There we heard a lot about this pari-mutuel. We heard, how up in Regina and Edmonton, those Great Fairs of the Northwest, that they were brought out of the dumps by the benefits of the pari-mutuel. Like - wise with Montana. Now this is an expensive matter, and it is one we do not know a great deal about. But if they are to have this money, we want to see to it that the interests of our Fairs are protected and I am sure that this Committee, Mr. Steele mentioned, will be on the job to do that very thing. BY MR. R. C. JOHNSON: During the discussion that preceded the vote, last November, a great deal was said about the pari-mutuel being for the benefit of the County Fairs and 4-H Clubs and about ten per cent of it was assumed that ten per cent was to be taken, or given to County Fairs. Now they are rather indefinite on that point. Now if this money is to be handled and it is not carried out along the line indicated, there is going to be something wrong. There has been some intimations that perhaps the Fairs ought to wait for one or two years while somebody gets on their feet. Now, I don't know as any - body needs to get on their feet any more than the County Fairs. Any - way, I want to warn, that while I believe this Committee of Mr. Matzke, Mr. Steele and Mr. Russell, will be on their guard, that if anything is put over on the Fairs, somebody will have at least secured votes under false pretense. </seg>

I was reminded this morning of Senator Dick Regan, who used to be in the House. He was commenting upon the- fact that last week he served on the Committee which escorted the retiring governor to his last appearance before the legislature, and then he recalled the fact that by a peculiar coincidence, twelve years ago, he served on a like committee which had helped to induct the governor into that office.

Despite the fact, there were others mentioned or willing, the name of Mr. Vance was suggested as an available member of this Board. Now I have taken a great deal of delight in serving with him upon this Board, upon the Board of Managers, and with him as a State Senator. He has always filled all of these posts with such efficiency. He has been a credit to the State Board of Agriculture and has advanced the interests of the State Fair, been of so much value to his County Fair, and all in all I take pride as well as pleasure to present at this time, the name of RALPH R.

VANCE: Friends, I haven't much to say, but I do want to say, that I am deeply grateful to you for this honor and I shall exert every effort to carry out my duty. Of course, we realize that the success of the Fair cannot depend on a President, or First and Second Vice President. Three or four members who may become a Board of Managers, nor upon the entire Board. The success must depend on the cooperation of all of you, through all of the counties and every one who is an exhibitor or a patron. And I shall ask for such co-operation. I thank you. Now, we will receive the nomination for First Vice President. BY FRANK SHUBERT: I desire to place in nomination for First Vice President, a man who has served this organization so well in other capacities, that it is unnecessary to further describe him among this group. I just want to nominate, Bill Banning of Union, for First Vice President. Nomination seconded. BY MR. E. R.

            <seg id="p042">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE rules be suspended and the President be instructed to cast the unani - mous ballot for Mr. Reed for Secretary. Motion seconded, vote taken, and motion carried. BY PRESIDENT ELECT VANCE: I take pleasure in casting the ballot of this organization for Mr. Reed, for Secretary. BY PERRY REED: Mr. President, and Gentlemen of this assembly. I wish to thank you for the honor that you have conveyed to me and I want to say that this post of Secretary is one that confines a person to the office and no doubt the Secretary carries a great deal of the brunt of the difficulties that confront our organization. Due to climatic conditions during the past year, there were times when we were almost daily beseiged by those who perhaps, without wanting to be discouraging, would come in and spread tidings of discouragement. They would contend that under conditions that faced ub, we could not possibly hold a State Fair. But we had splendid co-operation of the Chamber of Commerce, of the Bond Holders, the County Fair People and from so many other sources, that we were able in face of all of these difficulties, to go ahead and hold a Fair. But our Board had decided that they would pay all premiums in full, if we held a Fair, and it was only when we felt we could do that, that we went ahead and in tbe face of all of the difficulties we came within three thousand dollars of accomplishing all of that. BY PRESIDENT ELECT VANCE: I believe that Mr. Graff, and one or two others, have a word upon a subject of importance. BY MR. CHARLES GRAFF, of Bancroft: Mr. President, and Gentlemen of this assembly. Last night we had a meeting here where we were not to discuss business, we were just to let loose of ourselves and enjoy ourselves. I believe that was carried out, pretty well. But now, as we come to the close of these sessions, I think we face one more rather serious problem. Now we have conducted our business in the past, very much as average men. But we face one problem created by these conditions we have met in recent years. This organization has met difficulties in the last two or three years that were unforeseen. We had hoped that conditions would change, so that what we had undertaken, under the stress of circumstances, would seem to be less of a foolish business deal and would work out more as had been contemplated when it was under - taken. We had been told so often that prosperity was just around the corner and that the sledding was going to be better. But those things have not as yet come to pass, so we must face these financial difficulties in the light of circumstances that still face us. </seg>
            <seg id="p043">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE It has not been very long since our own State Governor faced a similar dilemna. We had three governors stand up and deny the fact that there was a deficit in the State's finances. They even took the stump and denied this fact, until the final day of reckoning came about and then, what? Why, our State Legislature went on record and faced it in the one honorable way. They made an appropriation to pay for the same, even if it was about four and a half million dollars. Why, right before us, individually, we have indulged in frivolous ways more than that, in the past years. But we holler about paying a little tax. Now, Gentlemen, we understand that debenture bonds were sold in this City by honest men, to people who bought them with honest and with the best of intentions. These bonds were sold on the new grandstand, erected on our Fair Grounds. No one could foresee that the vast crowds that lent every assurance that the plan devised, would work out, as contemplated, would fade away on account of the depres - sion. But in view of what has happened, anyone can see that this organization can not possibly operate under the plan in operation. They can not support the entire operation of the Fair from the front, gate and permit all of the proceeds of the- Grandstand to go to these bonds. Now, I believe that this Committee, of which Mr. Steele is a mem - ber, can present this proposition to the present Legislature. I believe this Legislature will make an appropriation when it understands this matter, so that the State will shoulder this indebtedness. It is only fair that it should do so. But it may become necessary that such be done, if our State Fair is not to be junked, and this organization is not to be compelled to turn back a million dollars worth of property to the State. And even in that event, this very deficit would probably have to be taken over by the State, anyway. For that would be the only honorable course left open to the people of the State of Nebraska. We should be honest with the people. We know there is no other honorable course open. There is no use of attributing any other motives to this organization. There was no other course open when this step was taken, than for the State Fair to build this Grandstand, just as it did. I am sure the people of the State of Nebraska will only sanction facing this in the right way when they know all of the facts and circumstances. Now, in the past few months, the people of the State of Nebraska, have taken action upon this pari-mutuel. In addition to that, there is a great deal of agitation that this organization should stand by and take some part in this scheme. I don't believe that any he-man sup - porter of this Fair will want to support and advance such a proposition. We have thrashed it out in the past and we have taken pride in the fact </seg>
            <seg id="p044">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE that our State Fair would not welcome or tolerate any form of gambling. Now, men, I have worked for twenty-four years, last past, with you In this organization, and I never expected to see the day when we would face this particular question. I am still for sticking steadfast to the policy we have pursued, of running a clean Fair at any co3t. I think we should give Mr. Steele and his Committee this view. Even if we face a deficit, I am not for surrendering the principle for which we have stood. Now just a word, in closing. We have recognized the Fair as an educational institution. I am not for letting down the bars. We want to instill into the minds of the young, that they should live in the right way. I am not for going backwards and losing all we have gained in these many years. This is simply a proposition to foster gambling and we can not face it in any other way. I don't want my children, or my grandchildren, to have a chance to say, that Old Charlie Graff was a quiter. I don't believe I can put this before you any plainer. I don't believe we should surrender to the desires of any city like Omaha, where I understand so many people have suffered from this policy. When they had this matter before, I have been told, by business people there, that women whose husbands were at work have taken the salary given to them with which to pay bills and used it for this gambling and then had to go to neighbors to help them out of their financial troubles, so their husband would not find it out. We know that is not the right way to live. We don't want it to be necessary for us to take part in any such thing. We know that is not for the best interests of our future generations and we don't wish to sanction any such thing. Now, I have served a long time on this Board, and I have heard more or less, intimations that perhaps some of the old heads should get out of the way and let some new blood come in. Now you have just re-elected 1 me. I felt myself, that the time should come when I should get out and make way for some one else. But I am will - ing to stay by my guns and serve longer, but I have no apologies to make for the way in which I shall do it. I don't believe we should compromise or give in on this matter. BY MR. E. J. MITCHELL, of Deshler: Now, there has been some discussion about these debenture bonds. Now, there is something I would like to say about that matter. When that deal was made, I had been Superintendent of the Grandstand, for about six years. I want to say, that it was a condition of fact and not just a theory that con - fronted us. We knew that we faced a serious problem. Perhaps what we did, in pledging the receipts of the Grandstand for this purpose, does not in the light of present circumstances, look like a very good business practice. But when we faced those days, with standing room at a premium and that old worn out condemned Grandstand, we faced </seg>
            <seg id="p045">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE a pretty serious proposition. Why, with that stand filled with thou - sands of people, I have simply sweat blood for fear of a collapse or that a fire might start. Fires did start a couple of times and those in the Grandstand knew nothing about it. I was afraid some fool might holler "fire" and we would have a catastrope on our hands that could not be contemplated. There was simply nothing else to do except what we did. Governor Weaver, understood those conditions. He helped to - work out the plan. Now, I believe that if our Legislators know the situation that there will be no doubt but what they will feel that the State should assume this indebtedness as a moral if not a legal obligation. I think this situation should be fairly placed before them, and I think there will be no doubt of the outcome. BY PRESIDENT ELECT VANCE: It becomes my duty at this time to appoint four members of the Board of Managers. It is quite a problem to pick out any particular one among the membership of this Board and among the many good workers we have, both old and new, who can do any better than the others. I am going to pick these men out, not only for what they have accomplished, but as coming from the different parts of the State. I will then appoint, J. S. SHUBERT, First District, Richardson County; J. A. BO YD, Fifth District, Buffalo County; GATES LILLE Y, Second District, Sarpy County; and J. S. GOLDER, Third District, Burt County. Motion to adjourn, made and carried. </seg>

The Nebraska State Fair is conceded by all to be the greatest advertising medium in Nebraska. We are proud of its record. It not only advertises our resources, but finds buyers for our products. During the thirty-four years residence in Lincoln it has developed to such an extent that the institution is valued at one million and a quarter dollars. </seg>

            <seg id="p067">MONDAY AFTERNOON, JANUARY 14TH, 1935. 2:00 P. M. The Twenty-sixth Annual Convention of the Nebraska Association of Fair Managers was called to order by Vice President R. C. Johnson, of Mead, at the Cornhusker Hotel, Lincoln, Nebraska, on Monday, January 14th, 1935 at 2:00 o'clock P. M. Vice President R. C. John - son presiding. BY VICE PRESIDENT R. C. JOHNSON: In the absence of our president, Otto Pfeiffer, it becomes my duty to call this meeting to order. He may be in bed before the day is over, and while he can be present around the lobby, the doctors will not allow him to use his voice, so he has asked me to preside. We hope he will not be confined and I will do the best I can in his stead. The first order of business on our program this afternoon, will be, the address of welcome by MAYOR FENTON B. FLEMING, Lincoln. MAYOR FENTON B. FLEMING, Lincoln: Mr. President, and members of the County Fair Boards and State Fair Board of the State of Nebraska. I know it is superfluous to extend a welcome on the part of the people of Lincoln, for you know that Lincoln is a city that belongs to the whole state of Nebraska. You are always welcome to Lincoln and it is very fitting that your meetings should be held in this, your own capital city. This city, as the state capitol, belongs to the whole state. It is fitting that we should have here along with the state capitol, the state university, the penitentiary, and other institu - tions that should go with it. Now, you men will have many problems to dispose of while you are here. Lincoln, as a whole, takes an unusual interest in the State Fairs and likewise incidental to that, in all of the County Fairs. The County Fairs are to the State Fair, what the rural schools are to the University. The County Fairs build up to the State Fair, just as the rural schools do to the State University. In the last couple years, as a city, we have had unusual problems, the same as they have had in State and National Government and as County institutions you folks have had unusual problems. If there is anything our city people can do to help you, while you are here, if there is anything that we can do to help solve your problems, we will be at your service. It has been remarkable, the patience that our people have shown in the face of the unemployment situation, the drought conditions, </seg>
            <seg id="p068">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE and all of the perplexing problems that have faced us, local as well as national and even international conditions. These have been a sort of aftermath of World War conditions. Then we were faced with the speculative flurry, then all of the other problems that have since come on. In spite of all of that, we have made advancement and our people have kept their patience and their balance quite remarkably. We have continued to live on in hopes that conditions would change. We are just now coming into a new era. We probably never again will see those days of high prices, high salaries and long profits. We probably will never return to them. Six hundred years ago though, the people lived in a world not nearly as well equipped nor possessed of the great wealth that we have. It has taken all of these centuries to reach the point of advancement we have attained in comforts, and for the world to become as charitable as it is now. City governments have many problems that you would never realize. People ask many things of their public officers. Some of the demands made upon the city, in the way of relief, would be hard for anyone else to under - stand. But when it comes to the more routine matters, we are glad to be of service to you while you are here. We certainly hope it will not be long, until many of these problems we are all facing, in these times, will fade away. Now there is one problem in particular that might be well to call to your attention. Because all citizens of the State can be of some aid in this problem. I now refer to the safety problem. The accidents from automobiles have become a major prob - lem in all branches of government. When you realize that during the past year, over one hundred thousand people have been injured and about thirty-six thousand, or half the number of Lincoln's popula - tion, killed. That means a lot and whatever we can do to decrease the scope of this devastation will be worth our joint efforts. Whatever can be done will benefit municipalities and I beseech your assistance in helping on this serious problem of highway accidents. The people of the whole state can help, and I trust that there is going to be worked out, in this state, as our new governor proposes, a new system of highway patrol and an improved widespread law enforcement force, equiped with high powered vehicles and radio equipment. This morning, we received the gratifying notice of a twenty-eight per cent reduction of our compensation insurance in the water de - partment, because of a good safety record that we had made. Since we employ about a hundred and twelve men in our water and light department, this is quite an item and quite an encouraging reduction in the cost of our premium, which goes to show that some of our records to improve conditions receive favorable reward. Now, there is one other thing that I would like to mention, that might concern our City, our State Fair, and the program of your </seg>
            <seg id="p069">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS own work. I don't know why citizens from Lincoln and vicinity should have to go clear out to Burwell, North Platte, and Cheyenne, to attend good first class rodeo. I don't see why such a show would not be a good attraction before the grandstand of our State Fair, and I would like to see such a project carried out. I notice one of those big hats, back there, and I would like to have one and I trust that this fall we can go to the State Fair and greet you all and have one of those big hats. Now, while you folks are here, feel free to call upon us. Now if you want a good exciting ride in one of our new cruiser cars, that would take you down the street, zip bang, with a hundred per cent thrill. If you want such a ride, just call on our officers, and again I wish to extend our welcome and also our services. I thank you. BY VICE PRESIDENT R. C. JOHNSON: Honorable Mayor Flem - ing, and Fair Managers, of Nebraska. It is with much pleasure that I again have the privilege of responding to this most hearty welcome by the mayor of this city. I am sure that I express the sentiment of all the Fair Managers of Nebraska, when I say there is no place in Ne - braska, in which we would sooner meet in our annual convention, than in our capital city, Lincoln. I believe I also express the sentiment of all when I say that this week, spent in your city, is one of the happiest weeks in the year. Fairs, as you all know, are primarily educational institutions, schools wherein we learn by comparison, schools where we learn the easiest way, mainly through the eye; institutions that city folks as well as those of the rural districts, should take an interest in and be - come a part of. Now, Mayor Fleming, if we fail to enjoy ourselves this week, while we are in your city, it will be no fault of yours or of your city. Assuring you that we appreciate your hearty welcome, we thank you. BY VICE PRESIDENT R. C. JOHNSON: Next on the program will be the Roll Call of County Fair Representatives. We will have the Secretary, first call the list of counties, and you may simply answer as to whether the county has any representatives present. Each county fair is entitled to have its president, secretary and members of the board present, or delegates who present proper credentials. . We will then pass out slips of paper on which we will ask that you write the names and official capacity of those who are present so that the Sec - retary will have those for our report. Those answering to the roll call for the 1935 meeting were: </seg>

            <seg id="p072">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE BY VICE PRESIDENT JOHNSON: We now come to the place on-, the program where we should receive the President's address. As I remarked before, our President is here, but the doctor will not allow him to use his voice, so I will ask our secretary to present this address for him, though he would like to have presented it himself. PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS Otto Pfeiffer "It affords me great pleasure to be here this afternoon and see - so many familiar faces whom I've had the pleasure of working with in the past years, and although my present work has somewhat taken me away from Fair work, I am very much interested in the welfare of our County Fair and larger Agricultural Shows. This past year has been a trying one for a great many Fairs over the State on account of the drought which has prevented some Fairs from holding a County Fair this past year. I believe, however, that there are brighter prospects ahead and our Fairs will again come inta full realm in the year just beginning. It seems to me that in a great many localities people are taking more interest and more of an active part in our Fairs than they have for some time past. Most of the Fairs have gone through great changes. They have advanced from the old carnival type of show to a much cleaner, more desirable type of Agricultural Show; and, if you please, a more neighborly or "get-together" Fair where the people of each county and other counties can come together once a year as a home - coming and have a pleasant visit with their friends, and also talk over their problems relative to the improvement in agriculture; thereby creating a more neighborly feeling and finding out the latest improve - ments and progress that are being made in the different communities. I believe that we should stress more the beautiflcation of Fair grounds; plant more trees so that in the near future better use of them can be made by the people of the county, not only at Fair time, but at different times during the year, for picnics and for other com - munity gatherings. In the past year there has been a great opportunity to receive help through CWA and FERA labor for Fair ground improvement. At our own County Fair in the year 1934, we received something like $15,000 from the Federal Government for the improvement of our Fair grounds and buildings. I believe whenever possible no opportunity should be lost in attempting to improve Fair grounds. I believe alsa that some effort should be put forth where County Fairs are heavily in debt, to approach the Board of County Commissioners for a loan </seg>
            <seg id="p073">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS to aid in helping to pay off some of the present indebtedness on Fair property. I also believe that some effort should be made during the session of this present Legislature to have a bill passed giving the County Commissioners a right to purchase land, pay off indebtedness on land and buildings, for the benefit of the people. I want to say a word in behalf of the boys and girls working in the 4H Club movement, for the splendid work which they are doing in their many projects. These boys and girls are doing their work well, and are being prepared to carry on the work which we are now doing. It is only proper that we pay tribute to our public schools, and our faith in their accomplishments is renewed every year when they bring their fine exhibits to our Fairs. At our election last Fall, by a vote of the people of Nebraska, Pari - mutuel betting again became legal, and is I understand it now, some ■of the money from that source is to be allocated to the State and County Fairs for the improvement of horse breeding, and for premiums on Agricultural products at County Fairs. In our sessions this afternoon and tomorrow, I hope that you will all feel free to discuss the different problems confronting you in the management of your Fairs, and that by free discussions that we may -all go back home and feel that our time here has been well spent, and that we shall be better prepared for the work just ahead of us. I would like to say just a word in behalf of the show people who ■are here. I want you to feel free to meet them, and to get acquainted with them.

Miller) •■■■-■ „ This topic of Draft Colt Classifications opens up a rather big sub - ject. First, I want to say a little about the important place the horse plays in civilization. When you go back in the earliest history when the sea was parted to let the Isrealites go through. They used horses, and they went on over and the seas closed and when the Egyptians came up, the Isrealites were gone. i . . Come on further down in the history, and we find through the cen - turies the Crusaders worked to redeem the Holy Lands. They used horses. Coming down to the early history of our Country; we find that the Indian counted his wealth in the ownership of so many horses. Now in our own day, horses were indispensable until the tractor came into service. Horses began along about war time, 1918 to sort of fade from the picture and the tractor became more dominant. In these days when a farmer wants to reward his son, he doesn't say, here is a fine team with a stylish buggy, but he lets the boy have a Ford, or a Chevy. But within the last couple of years, since we have had this terrible </seg>
            <seg id="p077">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS drought, old Dobbin has began to come back in demand. Farmers have begun to realize that they have these animals on the farm and that they must be led anyway and they might as well go back to work - ing them, for they are the cheapest power they can get. Wayne Dins - more, Secretary of the Percheron Society of America, says that within the last year or two, there has been the greatest demand for percherons. that they have had in twenty-five years." This revival of the horse has been a remarkable thing. Now, along -with, the revival ot the. -work 'horse, Yvaa been like - wise a revival ot the show Iior.se. Thfs is what calls for draft colt class - ncation. This classification of draft animals has come along with the other developments. Now, we come to the subject of whether this is more applicable to State Fairs than to County Fairs. We have always had classification for Colts. But perhaps there has not been so much interest in grade horses. But there is a factor to be recognized when you form an exhibit of colts, you have to have the mare along. Most of the exhibits have been from Lancaster County, practically all of them, though there was one exhibit came from Gering, Nebraska. Now, as I just hinted, when you come to these classifications, we find it to be more of a local matter. There is particular interest in colt clubs. In 4-H work, there is considerable interest evidenced in colt classes same as In calf clubs. Boys and Girls can get considerable enjoyment in that work. But, as I said, you can't take a colt to place on exhibition without bringing the mare. So the territory that a colt club can cover is more limited. This makes the classification apply more to a County Fair than to the State Fair. For, there is consider - able more expense to bring a colt a hundred miles or more to the State Fair. This keeps this work limited more to the County Fair. But 'this work can be carried to a successful conclusion in the County Fair, field. We should encourage it and instil more interest in the young people. They can take more pride in an animal that they have raised. There is also this difference between the work of the Colt club and the Calf club. Because a youngster who has raised a colt and placed it on exhibition is not likely to sell it, but will take it back home with him and raise it to maturity. There is another phase of this work that appeals to us. It helps instil into the young a desire to stay on the farm. There is nothing more pathetic than to see somebody from the country lose themselves in the maze of the city, with no one around to whom they can be in close sympathy. We can accomplish a great deal by just instilling a desire in our young people that they want to stay on the farm. So this all goes to show that our efforts will pay well to promote these </seg>

He hopes for about $75 an engagement and guar - antees good service. BY VICE PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Before we proceed further with the program, I want to call your attention to the item at the end of the afternoon program, marked, "Question Box". If any of you have any question that you would like to ask, or that pretain to subjects that you think should be discussed, we would urge that you write them down, hand them into the Secretary and at the proper time they will be presented to the assembly. Now, the next speaker is one of the best lawyers in the State of Nebraska. We have nineteen attorneys in the little city of Wahoo. I have known him for several years and I never go to his office but what I find several people there waiting their turn. But he has never been too busy to do anything he could for the Saunders County Agri - cultural Society and recently he gave us the service of incorporating that society. We will now hear from him upon the subject of ADVISABILITY OF INCORPORATING AGRICULTURAL SOCIETIES By E. S. SCHIEFELBEIN, of Wahoo. Mr. Chairman, friends and ladies and gentlemen: After such an introduction, I fear you may expect a great deal. But I also fear that my friend, Mr. Johnson, usually comes around to my office about the first of the month, when there are a lot of bill collectors there, for a lawyer has them the same as anybody else. I have been engaged in recent years in work connected with our Fair. Having been reared on the farm, and particularly interested in farming, I suppose I have particularlly enjoyed this work. Last fall, there was considerable interest created at the meeting of our Great Eight, Northeastern Nebraska Fairs circuit, when the subject of the incorporation of County Fairs, was discussed. Like on many other occasions I opened my mouth and got my foot into it. I might have been better off if I had kept my mouth closed and you would not haye been bored with this discourse today. As I said, the subject came up, as to whether County Fairs should be incorporated bodies. Of course on every County Fair Board there are some of the old timers who are pretty apt to be financially responsible. Of course I think a lot of you so far, have been pretty lucky in this respect. Now we will come to a legal consideration of whether agricultural </seg>
            <seg id="p080">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE societies are, or should be. incorporated bodies. Here is the interest that we have in this matter of the incorporation of any organization to which one may belong. No doubt some of you gentlemen have be - longed to organizations that were not incorporated. Perhaps no trouble has ever arisen, but on the other hand at any time you may nnd on your breakfast table, a ten thousand dollar law suit and whether you lose that law suit or not, you can spend a good deal of time and cash in getting rid of it and if you should lose it you can have your own property placed in jeopardy. We have statutes that cover this subject Then the matter has been interpreted by the Supreme Court of the State, which places its construction on the special act. The reason this subject has been brought up is, that there is considerable interest in whether the members and directors of such a society that may be conducting a County Fair, are individually liable upon any such suit that may occur. You might become the victim of a judgment that could be collected. So that in the event of such a law suit, the sub - ject may become one of considerable importance if it should threaten your farm or to absorb the property that should belong to your family. Now this matter has been touched upon by Fletcher Cyclopedia Corporation. Any lawyer can tell you that that work is the last word on corporations. There, he says: "Societies fraternities and clubs are sometimes corporations, but frequently they are unincorporated. When unincorporated they are regarded simply as voluntary associations. An unincorporated club has no legal existence as such. It cannot in the absence of statute sue or be sued. Suit must be brought by or against the individual members." Sec. 22, page 72, Vol. 1, Flecher Cyclopedia Corporation. Lewis v. Tilton, 64 Iowa 220, 19 N. W. 911, 52 Am. Rep. 436, Pipe v. Bate - man, 1 Iowa 369. Under a statute passed in the State of Nebraska, it makes certain organizations such as agricultural societies subject to this interpreta - tion. They must adopt a constitution and by-laws. This must be sub - mitted to and be approved by the State Board of Agriculture and if these conditions are not complied with, your organization is not entitled to be considered a corporation. That question came up a number of years ago in a law suit in which the Otoe County Association attempted to force the payment of a levy by its County Board. It happened in that instance that those conditions had been complied with and the matter had been submitted to Mr. Jackson and had received the O. K of the State Board of Agriculture. In a similar case in Michigan, this was passed upon, in which it was said that such a body is not a corporation. </seg>
            <seg id="p081">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION' OF FAIR MANAGERS "Schuetzenbund v. Agitation Verein, 44 Mich. 313, 6 N. W. 675, 38 Am. Rep. 270. In Lewis v. Tilton, supra, Judge Sievers Baid: "The club is a myth. It has no legal existence and never had. It cannot sue or be sued. Such a body is similar to a corporation in that it possesses the attribute of continuous succession. It is not however, a legal entity distinct and separate from its individual members, unless a statute makes it such. "Vol. 1, Fletcher supra. Voluntary associations of this kind are ordinarily managed by a board of trustees or directors. They enter into contracts and acquire and convey property on behalf of the association. The rights and ob - ligations of the associates depend entirely upon their articles of asso - ciation." In what we may call the Custer County case, our own supreme court reasoned along this line. "Agricultural societies are not corporations, within the ordinary meaning of the term, but rather agencies adopted by the state for the purpose of promoting the interests of agriculture and manufacturing. State — Custer County Agricultural Society vs. Robinson, et al., 35 Neb. 401, 53 N. W. 213, 17 L. R. A. 383." Now along. I think, in 19 27, there was a case came up in Thayer county. A gentleman attented the county fair, with his wife and child. They were in the grandstand and an explosion from a fireworks dis - play caused an injury to his little girl. Her chest was burned. He went to an attorney who brought a law suit. First, against the State of Nebraska and the County, because they reasoned that the Agricultural Society was getting an appropriation from the county, and then against the Agricultural Society, because it got the proceeds of admission that had been paid. The lower court held that two of the directors were not liable. It happened that this society had things in pretty good shape so some of the directors escaped liability. The Court rather held with this society. "A county agricultural society organized under Section 6, Article 1, c-1 (Section 1-80) Comp. St. 1922, (2-201, Comp. St. of Neb. 1929), has the power to sue and be sued and is not a governmental agency exempting it from liability from courts nor is it such part of the county organization as to require it to be sued in the name of the county. Wilson vs. Thayer County Agricultural Society, et al., 115 Neb. 579, 213 N. W. 966, (1927)." So in order to relieve yourself of any liability that may happen in </seg>
            <seg id="p082">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE event of such a contingency, it well appears that it is best to incorporate your society. At Wahoo, we have an American Legion Post, and awhile back, they held an air circus and they put on a parachute aeroplane drop. In this event something went wrong and the performer was killed. Of course, immediately, some one looked up the proposition of liability. It happened that our post at Wahoo was incorporated so that the matter was dropped and we heard no more from it. But if we had not been relieved of liability in that instance, a number of us would have had a law suit on our hands and even if we had defeated the same, it would i have been a considerable annoyance and expense. For the same reason, I incorporated the Saunders Agricultural Society, so as to relieve our directors there of any such liability. This did not cost but four or five dollars in fees for I charged nothing for the work. ! BY MR. JOHNSON: As Mr. Schiefelbein said in conclusion, it only cost us a few dollars to incorporate and render ourselves safe from any law suits. I believe in most any of your communities you can get the services of a good attorney who will do this for you. BY MR. TOOF: (Hamilton County), How is it in case you have liability insurance, then it might not require the incorporation? BY MR. SCHIEFELBEIN: Well, you might suffer a deficiency if there was a judgment rendered greater than the insurance covered. i BY VICE PRESIDENT JOHNSON: I think there is another lawyer present. Perhaps he could give us something on this. BY MR. CHARLES DOBRY, Howard County: I have been secre - tary of the Howard County Fair for about fourteen years. To be true, we have made obligations that have not been met. Now we have members of our society but they have never been put to any expense or test. I am not so sure that I can say anything positive. I have not given this matter thought before it came up, this afternoon, as to just what the liability of an agricultural society, as a corporation, might be. But I believe that under the laws and statutes of the state, of Nebraska, that members of an agricultural society would not be liable in the manner that has been mentioned here. I don't believe that the members of an agricultural society or the members of the board would be liable whether or not, the society is incorporated. As I say, I have not had a chance to study this matter and I can only give it as an off hand opinion. But if you form a corporation, you issue stock. You must have members who will go ahead and buy this stock. So If you incorporate a County Fair, you have stockholders. If you have </seg>
            <seg id="p083">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS stockholders, then they expect to get a profit. So you come to another situation. Without this corporation, I still do not believe that the members become responsible. BY MR. SCHIEFELBEIN: Of course you understand that lawyers will disagree. I do not believe that the point Mr. Dobry raises has much application. For under the laws of this state, it provides for the incorporation of a non-profit society and you do not need stockholders to incorporate a County Fair and it really comes under this pro - vision for non-profit corporation without stockholders. BY VICE PRESIDENT JOHNSON: We have two speakers booked for tonight, and one other subject for discussion. One of those speakers cannot be here until tomorrow morning. I had thought, since there is considerable interest in the subject, many of you might be interested in hearing from one of the executives of the Federal Tree Belt project, which has its headquarters here in Lincoln. BY MR. ALTSCHULER: I move that Mr. Johnson seek to secure one of the speakers upon that subject, preferably Mr. Clayton Watkins, as he is the son of a member of the State Board, Mr. Frank Watkins. Motion seconded, put to a vote and carried. BY VICE PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Before we adjourn, I want to call your attention to the fact that you should secure banquet tickets at once, as we must let the hotel management know, tomorrow noon, how many to expect. The committee, who will have these tickets are, A. H. Miller, E. R. Purcell, R. R. Vance, A. J. Welch, Chet Marshall and R. C. Johnson. Motion made and carried to adjourn until 7:30 p. m. EVENING SKSSION MONDAY, JANUARY 14th, 7:80 P. M. (Held at the Cornhusker Hotel) BY VICE PRESIDENT R. C. JOHNSON: The meeting will come to order. Before we adjourned this afternoon, you instructed me to 'secure a speaker from the Federal Shelterbelt Project. Mr. Watkins had to leave the city on a trip, so while it was short notice, we were fortunate enough to secure Mr. H. D. Cochran, who has a name that at this time is popular in Nebraska. So I will introduce the first speaker of the evening, who will tell you his subject. BY MR. H. D. COCHRAN: Ladies and Gentlemen: I appreciate very much the opportunity of coming here this evening to tell you a little bit about the Shelterbelt Project. I am pinch-hitting for Mr. </seg>
            <seg id="p084">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Watkjns, who I am sure would have given you a better talk if he could have been here, but I am glad to do the best I can on short notice. Recently I was told about a man in Texas who said he had the dis - tinction of clearing single-handed the largest forest area on record. When: asked to explain, he said that he first went to Texas in a covered/ wagon, and that one evening while making camp he cut down a cedar tree, j Upon looking around, he became aware that it had been the only standing tree within a radius of 20 miles, and then he realized that he had that evening destroyed the forest growth on 400 square miles.i We probably shall not be able to plant sheltcrbelts as fast as this Paul Bunyan of the south destroyed forests, but we probably will handle more trees. Tie entire region from the Mississippi river to the Rocky Mountains offers opportunities for shelterbelt planting. However, it would be disastrous to spread our efforts over such a vast region. Therefore, a definite zone has been selected, and our efforts will be concentrated within its boundaries. This zone extends from Canada through North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma, to the southern end of the Texas panhandle — a distance of about 1,000 miles — and is about 100 miles wide. This is not the Shelterbelt, but the area within which thousands of shelterbelts will be planted. The efforts of the government in that zone will carry to a reasonable degree of advance - ment the work that was started with the first settlement in the prairie - plains region, and that will continue as long as the Middle West con - tinues to' be the home of man. No rigid plan can be followed in the distribution and arrangement of the shelterbelts. Conditions in each locality will of necessity dictate such distribution and arrangement. The typical shelterbelt, however, will be eight rods wide, consisting of about 20 rows of trees, and will be planted on a strip of land 10 rods wide so as to provide a margin on each side for the spread of roots. In order to distribute the benefits of planting as evenly as possible throughout the designated zone, a standard has been adopted providing for one mile of such shelterbelt planting in each square mile in which conditions are suitable to the growing of trees. It is recognized that there will be areas in which soil conditions will make planting impracticable, and that there will oe other areas in which, for the present, planting can be done only on an experimental scale. There is no lack of fertility, but soil is the medium through which moisture Is transmitted to the trees, and in a region in which precipitation is not abundant the absorptive capacity of the Boil is of the utmost importance. Sandy soils are most favorable, and as the texture of the soil becomes finer, the suitability for tree growth decreases. </seg>
            <seg id="p085">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS In a tree-growing project extending through 15 degrees of latitude, the selection of species is of great importance. Trees that are suited to the climate of North Dakota are not at home in Texas, and trees that thrive in Texas will be poorly adapted to conditions in North Dakota. We have a list of about 20 species that grow naturally in the region to be planted, each one adapted to the conditions that pre - vail in some portions. We have no delusions about the technical difficulties to be en - countered in a project of this magnitude. Therefore, we are making studies and surveys that will later guide us in our field work. In this connection the accumulated experience of 50 years of tree planting in the Middle West is not being overlooked. Neither is the scientific research of State Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Stations, and of the various branches of the United States Department of Agriculture. From all these agencies we are receiving the most generous cooperation. In addition, the research branch of the Shelterbelt organization has had parties in the field making surveys of soils, of native vegetation, and of tree plantations. The assembled reports covering these investigations will be an outstanding scientific contribution. In addition to the technical information thus made available, there is the basic fact that trees do grow throughout the region to be planted, as is attested by seed collection done last fall, all from trees growing in the designated Shelterbeldt Zone or nearby. This collection yielded sufficient seed to produce all the trees needed for planting in 1936, and from trees that were combating one of the outstanding droughts within the history of the prairie states. You are probably interested to know when planting will begin. The first work will be done next spring, and will consist of a small number of areas, selected primarily for their experimental and demon - strational value. Time was not available after the establishment of the project for the production of nursery stock for 1935. Therefore, the area to be planted will be limited by the amount of planting stock that can be obtained from supplies available in existing nurseries. It is hoped that there will be enough for about 150 miles of planting, about evenly divided among the six states traversed by the Shelterbelt Zone. Meanwhile the selection of areas for 1936 will proceed as rapidly as possible in order to provide time for the advance preparation of soil on the areas to be planted. Such preparation will consist of plow - ing and fallowing, and is necessary in order to get the greatest use of available moisture. In suceeding years, work will proceed on a larger scale. The shelterbelts will require cultivation and protection after they are planted. Cultivation, like advance soil preparation is required as </seg>
            <seg id="p086">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE a means of conserving moisture. Protection will be needed against live- . stock. In order to provide it, each sbelterbelt 'will be fenced. Protec - tion will also be needed against rabbits, gophers, prairie dogs, mice, and other rodents. In order to provide such protection, the young trees will have to be treated with deterrants that will make them less palatable; also, some of these animals, which are common pests on the farm, will have to be reduced in numbers by poisons. • The Biological Survey is now working on methods, and through its efforts will con - tribute in an important way to the final results of the project. Other pests, such as tree diseases and insects, will also present problems, but these can not be anticipated at this time except for those which are most obvious and which will require the elimination of certain parti - cularly susceptible tree species. The chief benefit to be derived from the planting of shelterbelts will be in the improvement of living conditions for the residents of the region affected, and this effect alone will have a strong influence on the social and economic stability of the region to the immeasurable benefit of the entire Middle West. Other results of shelterbelt plant - ing, such as crop protection and livestock protection, erosion control, and moisture conservation are also of importance, and in the end will contribute toward the same ultimate ideal of social and economic stability in rural communities. The effect of tree planting on rainfall .and climatic cycles need not concern us as long as we can produce results of a tangible and specific character that benefit the surrounding region. There is no black magic in the Shelterbelt Project, and there is in it no panacea. The planting of trees alone will not save the country. It is not a substitute for the many other measures of econ - omic and social improvement, nor can it be replaced by them. It must be combined with them for the benefit of agriculture and of the people who live by agriculture. For the present, the cash income provided local residents through wages and through purchases of materials ; and rights will produce much needed relief from the present drought. Tree planting is not new, and it is not a passing fancy. It is one .of the established essential activities of farming in the Middle West, .and will continue indefinitely to play an important part in the develop - ment of the prairie-plains region. The Shelterbelt Project is a timely move to establish this activity on a scale properly proportioned to its importance, and through it to provide some measure of relief from the effect of the present drought. We will observe what has been done in the past. We will avail ourselves of what knowledge the local people have of tree planting. .In that way we feel the work will be started upon a foundation that will assure it of continuing as a long-time endeavor.

COCHRAN: I might say more specifically, we are going to streamline the planting. Everything in these days avails itself of the streamline principle. We will so arrange the trees in the Shelter - belt that the lower ones are at the outside edge, the taller ones in between. This will furnish a solid barrier to winds. BY A DELEGATE: What kinds of trees would you use through this part of the country? BY MR. COCHRAN: Probably the most commonly used tree will be the cedar. We will also use the hackberry and elms, some green ash, with some Chinese elm. That tree has proven itself rather hardy and successful in this region during these recent years. BY A DELEGATE: How about the cottonwood for this region? BY MR. COGHRAN: Yes, we shall have to use the cottonwood some. We can not overlook what the cottonwood has done for this country. It may have faults, but it is sturdy and has been pretty successful here. BY A DELEGATE: If it had not been for the cottonwood, these plains would never have been what they have been. BY MR. COCHRAN: We will admit that. The Russian olive can also be used. We must stick to trees that have been a success here even though some of their qualities might not appeal to us so much. So we expect to be guided by the experience of those who have successfully grown trees here. BY A WESTERN DELEGATE: In what portion of Nebraska do you expect to work? BY MR. COCHRAN: I would say generally in the western one - third of the state. Planting in areas this spring I think have been planned in Custer county, near Broken Bow, and in Frontier county. I might say we plan to go around the Sandhills, since we want to im - prove agricultural and farming areas, rather than the grazing country. BY MR. R. R. VANCE, Hastings: We have had some experience with the Chinese elm and found some trouble with the bark peeling off. BY MR. COCHRAN: Yet the Chinese elm has a good record in these drought years. It has also withstood freezes and drought very well, even though it may sometimes show the effect in the form of scars. BY MR. VANCE: We noticed in Adams county that the Chinese </seg>
            <seg id="p088">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE elm. had a very rough bark. BY MR. COCHRAN: I think there is perhaps a great deal of vari - ation in Chinese elm. But over a period of about 25 years it has stood up very nicely. So in spite of its defects, it will be used. Austrian pine will also be used to some extent, also honey locust and black locust. BY A DELEGATE: How about the lowly box elder? BY MR. COCHRAN: That perhaps does not have a very elegant rank among trees, but it cannot help but have its place, especially in the north. It is only logical to accept these trees on the record of ■what they have accomplished in the past, whether they are the choicest types or not. BY MR. CHARLES GRAFF: Do you anticipate having difficulty in securing the title to the lands you select for these zones? BY MR. COCHRAN: We do not expect much difficulty along that line. We do not intend to use any coercion. This must be a voluntary proposition. If we cannot secure certain lands readily, we will just go around them. There are several ways of acquiring the right to use or the land itself, such as purchase, lease, cooperative agreement, and donation. When it comes to public ownership, we, of course, will accept donations in a great many places. Otherwise, either purchase, lease, or cooperate agreement will be used. BY MR. GRAFF: Then you do not follow in any set direction through an area, from east to west, or from north to south? BY MR. COCHRAN: That will have to depend upon local condi - tions in each case. We might go in one direction a little ways, and turn and go in the other direction. The scheme will be adapted to the conditions that are met. BY MR. GRAFF: If you meet a farmer who objects to having his land cut up? BY MR. COCHRAN: We have no desire to locate shelterbelts so they will cut up the farmer's land. We wish to adjust the planting to his needs. BY MR. A. H. MILLER: If you have too much difficulty in the western part of the state; just jump eastward to Washington county. We have a lot of land that is somewhat denuded of the timber it used to have, and it would make a good region, and I think might welcome a shelterbelt. '- - '.■'■.■.-•'■ BY MR.

            <seg id="p089">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS could well be extended clear to the Mississippi river, but we must first confine ourselves to small zones in the region already selected. I think after we have demonstrated in this limited area what can be done, there may be a widespread demand for similar projects in other regions. We could continue on this subject for a long time, but I know you have other subjects and speakers on your program, and I want to thank you for your patience in listening to me and the interest you have shown. BY VICE PRESIDENT JOHNSON: The next subject for discussion will be assigned to one of our old war-horses. It is RODEO as a COUNTY FAIR ATTRACTION. This will be handled by Senator E. R. Purcell. He has been one of my ideals as a politician. I have always liked to work for him. He will take this subject, which is one with which they have had wonderful success at Broken Bow. . ' ' .:■■■'■' ' I"'-' ' ' THE RODEO AS A COUNTY FAIR ATTRACTION" By Mr. E. R. Purcell I am going to speak of the rodeo as the county fair attraction, not as one of the attractions of the county fair. We have all seen the wild west show the circus puts on after the main show is over with a bunch of overworked, worn out bronchos where the rider falls off to entertain the crowd. Those who have never seen the real thing sometimes get the circus wild west show con - fused with the rodeo. They don't harbor this idea long, however, after they have seen the real rodeo. The usual program of racing with the usual free acts are all right in their way but we see so many instances where they are not strong enough to attract the great crowds and bring them back day after day. The rodeo is just that. The racing may be good, the platform acts may be up to the usual standard but the big thrill is not there. We are now about to enter a new era of pari-mutuel betting. Its value to the county fair is yet to be tried out. This new deal may stimulate the interest of the sports, estimated at from five to ten per cent of the crowd. I do not see, however, how it is going to transform the race itself into any more thrill for the ninety per cent of the people who do not place bets than it did under the old form of racing. Do not understand me as being against racing at the county fair. I am simply for the entertainment, the thrill, that the people seem to clamor for. As a crowd-getter the rodeo registers big. </seg>
            <seg id="p090">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The staging of a rodeo is not a one-man or a one-committee affair. There must be a community spirit. You must sell the rodeo to your community in a big way even after you know your people want a rodeo. If you sell it to your own people first, they will sell it to the world. There is no finer, more wholesouled individual in the land than the typical cowboy. He is a booster; he will help you, but he insists on a square deal. He must get his money won in the contest. We have never had a bit of trouble at Broken Bow, but serious trouble has occurred at some of the western rodeos when the money didn't hold out. I wish it understood that I am talking of rodeo as the whole attraction, the whole entertainment of the county fair, and not just a touch of wild west in connection with a county fair program. How much for rodeo prizes? I would say not less than $3,000. $3,500 is better. The three main contests, broncho riding, calf roping, and steer wrestling, should have a purse of six or seven hundred dollars each. The only way to attract champions is to put it on for four days. Then there are prizes for the wild steer riding, the graveyarding, the calf riding, the wild horse race, the cowgirls race, the cowboy relay race, the chuck wagon race and other western contests, each with a thrill that you do not get at any race meet. To post for the champion all-around cowboy, a prize ranging up to $ 3 0 OJ will bring the champions from great distances. It is better to cut it up into two prizes. To compete the cowboys must enter in two or more events. All entrance fees should go into the finals of the last day. Just see what this means in added prizes. A good rodeo should bring one hundred to one hundred and fifty cowboys. Entries for each of the three main contests at $10. means that every contestant spends from $10 $30. Your finals on the last day with a thousand or fifteen hundred dollars in the pot makes it worthwhile. It is a contest between champions from a dozen states. The record of points the cowboy makes is as accurately kept and as closely guarded by the American Rodeo Association as is the record of the fast horse in racing circles. What about rodeo stock? Three hundred head is necessary. If one hundred cowboys have entered even more stock can be used to advantage. This means bucking bronchos, graveyard horses, both longhorn steers and Brahma Bulls, calves for roping and for boys riding, and nurse cows. It is not wise to depend on getting stock at random, more especially the bucking broncho, in sufficient numbers from the open range even </seg>
            <seg id="p091">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS in a range country. The best actors are picked up here and there by the rodeo rancher who specialized in this class of stock. The Brahma Bulls which they are bringing from Mexico are wonderful fighters. They are a remarkable stock. You really should add $1,500., $1,800 to $2,500. to your expense account if you expect to have an ample amount of the best rodeo stock. One hundred cowboys cannot make a rodeo without real rodeo stock. The wilder and more vicious the bronchs and the Brahma bull, the better the cowboys like it. Now for a very important point. Your judges must be experts. It requires at least three of them. They must know the game, observe the rules and enforce the penalty of points for the mishaps of the actor. The cowboy rides for the money, he knows the game and you cannot fool him on the rules. Then there is a parade on the opening day. Make it a pioneer parade with plenty of floats, if you wish. Advertise it heavily. Your cowboys and cowgirls in gay colors will be augmented by one hundred local horsemen and women. The young folks will clamor to get in the saddle and the older guys like it too. Admit all paraders to the grounds. $300 in parade prizes is money well spent. A big parade, starting downtown and ending in the arena, on the opening day of the fair is a wonderful stimulus. The serpentine drill in the arena as the opening feature of each day is a spectacular sight. Three hundred horsemen are none too many to expect. The number usually increases each day. Then comes the introduction of rodeo officials. Of distinguished guests, of champion cowboys, and of the trick riding talent and clowns, all mounted. The serpentine mounted drill is a beautiful sight. As the hundreds of horsemen scamper to cover, after the drill is over, the chutes are opened and the rodeo is on. The American people clamor for thrills. It is like a football game, the more cowboys that are carried from the field as fallen heroes of bucking bronchos, the greater is the desire to see the excitement the next day. At Broken Bow one cowboy was killed in the wild horse race. At another time a cowboy was sent to the hospital from the bull fight, there were seven in the hospital at one time. Of course, it was re - gretable, but it didn't dampen the ardor or diminish the crowds the next day. A real rodeo should cost not less than $10,000 exclusive of the county fair expense such as exhibit premiums, gate and police expense, etc. </seg>
            <seg id="p092">J REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE b less than 20% of your estimated total expense should be spent in advertising, if you expect to properly enthuse the people and attract crowds from a distance. Broken Bow has made a success of its several rodeos. They have shown a profit each year and have reduced their indebtedness accumul - ated from some bad years of the old time county fair and the erection of fair ground buildings. I . ■ For two years we sold over $3,000 worth of advance tickets each year at a reduced price. They were sold in blocks of ten. This meant fifty cent tickets for thirty-five cents each. Ten thousand tickets sold in advance is some rain check. We know of innumerable instances where these brought additional admissions during the fair because the family wanted to use that last ticket. It goes without saying that as fair managers we must always re - member that the fair is primarily for the purpose of exhibiting our agricultural resources. We lay stress and rightly so on our boys and girls club work, but the big problem is how to get the people inside the gates and how to entertain them after they come. Not all fairs are rightly situated to stage a rodeo and not all com - munities are rodeo minded. Our experience at Broken Bow is that the rodeo is a wonderful crowd builder. If you contemplate a rodeo, however, do not half do it. It takes money, it takes backing, it takes community spirit, and it takes leader - ship jto put it over. If you do not win, bear in mind that you must dig down and pay. The cowboys must have their money. My individual idea of financing a rodeo is first to secure the in - dividual pledges of one hundred or more responsible people who will agree to stand an assessment of at least $25.00 each, if need be, to make up any deficiency caused by adversity of weather or lack of crowds. At Broken Bow we did better than this. We actually collected in advance $1,500 each year for two years as a straight donation without any hope of return. That shows community spirit. I believe in advance sale of tickets. You may not agree with me, but I would sell advance tickets in blocks of ten good at the outer gate for twenty-five cents each with an admission price, positively enforced, of fifty cents after the gates opened. People will clamor for the reduced price tickets. They did it with us. We sold $3,000 worth of advance thirty-five cent tickets each year for two years of our rodeo-fair. The reduced price gives the people admission to the grounds to see the exhibits and take in the carnival and the shows for a nominal sum. I do not believe in a free gate. </seg>
            <seg id="p093">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS The rodeo itself, rather than the outer gate, must gather in the coin. I would tightly fence in the arena. It can be done with canvas walls. I would sell amphitheater tickets at a profit price. There might be a few boxes at a $1.50, but most of the seats at a $1.00 and some at $.75 and the bleachers at $.50. Our price has been a flat $.75. Last year we did not hold a fair at Broken Bow. You know the reason why. This year the rodeo and fair will be on as ususal. The community spirit is there. You can put on a good night show with practically no added expense. We haven't done so up to this time, but we may do so this year. You usually have a good flood lighting system for your ampi - theater and for your arena. We have two distinct departments this year. The fair will be pushed as never before by those interested in the great agricultural and livestock show. The rodeo proper will be promoted by experts who have made it a success in years past. With this setup and with better times around the corner we hope to open the gates to old'-time crowds and perhaps cash in on some of Roosevelt's corn and hog checks. I thank you. BY VICE PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Are there any questions any of you would like to ask Mr. Purcell? BY GEORGE JACKSON: I would like to ask one question. If you put on a day time rodeo, how about putting on a separate night show with the same cast of people and same stock and equipment? Or, I will put it this way, — why could you not put on a night show with say, a pony express? You have the cowboys and you could perhaps put on an Indian fight. It would seem that such a show could be put on along with a rodeo with very little expense, when you already have the people and the same equipment could be used. i BY MR. PURCELL: I realize very readily what George Jackson has in mind. We had a wild west exhibition a few years ago. We wanted a driver for a real stage coach. We got George Jackson, for you know he used to be a stage coach driver. I see why he has that idea. I see no reason that it couldn't be done that way. But we have developed this rodeo business at Broken Bow into almost a business. One of our officials, Mr. Butler, who has a good automobile business, and whose main activity is in that line, took a great deal of interest in this rodeo business, and he got it to where he could go out and put on a rodeo. In fact, he did go to New Harmony Indiana and he put on a rodeo at a place where they had never had a </seg>
            <seg id="p094">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE rodeo and they had forty-five thousand people there. Now, you see what can be done with this sort of a proposition. BY| MR. JOHNSON: If Mr. Purcell lived thirty miles from Omaha and Lincoln, he might have a different sort of a situation to face. When your people can go down, in thirty minutes or less, to Omaha or Lincoln, and they can have any kind of a show and the best kinds of shows that can be put on, it is a more difficult proposition to put up something that will excite them. Are there any further remarks upon this subject? We have one more subject on the program tonight. That is, GATE AND GRANDSTAND CHARGES. Now the other subject that was listed for tonight, HOME TALENT ENTERTAINMENT, has to go over until tomorrow morning, as Mr. J. R. Vinckel, of Arlington, is Superintendent of schools there and his board had a meeting tonight. Now, it is not intended that this remaining subject tonight, should transgress or invade the field of discussion set for tomorrow morning, as we have two of our best lawyers booked to discuss the pay gate and free gate. What we wish to point to, in this discussion for the few minutes left this evening, is whether those fairs that have a pay gate are reaching uniformity or whether there is too much of a spread between the charges at the various fairs. Now we would like to hear from someone who will lead oft this discussion. MR. R. R. VANCE, of Hastings: It is rather sudden, but I will say a few words. We have rather changed our method in Adams county, the last year or two. To start with, we are putting on a free fair. That is, it is free in that we do not charge at the outside gate. We do make a nominal charge at the grandstand. Then we make some charge for automobile drivers, but that is more in the way of a parking charge. After we got through with everything, we had one hundred and fifty dollars left. If you want to put on a free fair, you can get at this, in this manner. We have been pretty well satisfied. You call it a free fair. The normal charge to the grandstand is something like twenty-five cents. The grandstand can work out this way. I don't know whether the same course will be pursued another year, but I rather think we will stay with the free fair. i . ■;"■■■■ BY MR. R. C. JOHNSON: I think we rather got onto the free gate proposition there. What does the gentleman from Furnas county have to offer? DELEGATE FROM FURNAS COUNTY: I just wanted to tell a little about our experience of the past year for whatever it might be worth to the rest of you. Of course the last year was a drought year, </seg>
            <seg id="p095">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS probably the •worst year in our history. Furnas county was probably no worse off and not any better than any other counties, but we got part of the grandstand structure they had in Harlan county and we tore it down and moved it over and rebuilt it on our grounds. We had a free gate, but we charged ten cents for automobiles when they came in. This charge was a sort of a parking charge. There was no admission at the gate, but at the grandstand, we charged twenty-five cents. The last day of the fair, we gave a free barbecue. The merchants put up everything for that. In spite of the times, and the fact there was no money around the country, we had the largest crowd we ever have had in the history of our fair. By the way, we tried a rodeo. Now Mr. Purcell insisted that it wouldn't pay to try one unless you could put on such a show as Broken Bow had. We found that out. We had a kind of a three ring circus or rodeo. No doubt it could be made a success if you have a big enough territory. Custer county could do it, and maybe Adams county could. But in a county like ours, where you are hemmed in on all sides and you are not so big to start with, it is not a profitable undertaking. BY MR. KUHL, of Knox County: I have been wondering as to the difference between charges at different fairs. Our fair has had free gate for two years, but we have twenty-five cents at the grand - stand and twenty-five cents for parking automobiles. BY MR. STRYKER: (Concession man): I might remark on the splendid success the boys have had at Auburn and Wahoo. Now the way the boys have put over the fair at Auburn is something of which the rest of you can take notice. They have been in a bad spot down there. Poor crops, and nothing much in that territory. I think they had a fifty cent gate, it was fifty cents on the grandstand, seventy-five cents for boxes, and thirty-five cents for the bleachers. They put on a good show and they had it well advertised. But, perhaps, part of the secret of their success was, that they had made an advance sale of almost five thousand tickets. Twelve or thirteen hundred dollars, in itself, is a pretty good rain check. But what they did, was to put on these tickets at this scale of prices I named and then sell them in ad - vance at one half. They had close to five thousand tickets sold in advance and that gave them pretty good assurance to start with. Now, you know I helped start out these rodeos. I have helped with Custer county, and if any of the rest of you are interested, I will be very glad to give you the benefit of my experience of fifteen or six - teen seasons. But I wanted to stress this point, that by fixing your grandstand charges, or gate and grandstand charges, if you have both, and selling your tickets in advance, you can have a good assurance for the success of your fair. </seg>
            <seg id="p096">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE BjY VICE PRESIDENT JOHNSON: We don't want to go too far into the matter of the free gate and the pay gate. Because that will be well handled tomorrow morning. The time is getting late, but if there is anything further on this matter of the variation of gate and grandstand charges, we will continue the discussion. If not, we will close the discussion. Motion made and carried to adjourn the evening session. FORKXOOX SESSIOX Tuesday, January 15th, 1935, at the Cornhusker Hotel, 0:00 A. &gt;I. BY VICE PRESIDENT JOHNSON: We are supposed to start this morning, at 9:00 o'clock. We have a long, heavy program and we will have to move right along to get through in time. The first number this morning, is the one we carried over from last evening. This will be given by a gentleman from Washington county. He handled the home talent there, so well, that we thought he could give you some interesting pointers on this subject. When I heard him give an outline of what they did in this work, I thought, that is some - thing that we ought to have at this meeting, so I have asked him to give us that treatment of this subject, this morning. HOME TALENT ENTERTAINMENT, by Mr. J. R. Vinckel, Arling - ton: Mr. Chairman, and Fair Managers: As a school teacher, it is rather customary to follow an outline. So I have prepared this out - line of the subject upon which I will touch. You may be able to follow them and it will save you from taking notes. This matter, of home talent entertainment, has been pretty thoroughly discussed at previous meetings. But in Washington county, at the last meeting of the Fair Board it was decided to put a plan of handling home talent into operation. I thought maybe, in spite of any previous discussion, there were some points about this scheme that would be of benefit to some of you. I have tried to* outline this dis - cussion into four topics. One, the advantages of home talent enter - tainment, two the disadvantages. Three, the types of entertainment — relative merit, — objections, and suggestions for change or improvement, and finally, four, the conclusions. Now, dropping back to the advantages. (A) People in these days are fair conscious throughout a large part of the year. It is well to keep them so. Long before fair time, it is well to begin stressing cer - tain phases. This can be done while you are getting ready for the fair. </seg>
            <seg id="p097">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS (B) In that way, a considerable amount of excellent material is made available at a very minimum of expense. (C) Thus, the Fair is made a real Washington county enterprise. (D) The Pair, in that way, approaches what we believe to be its true purpose, that is, a Fair is always intended to be an educational institution and it thus becomes more nearly an educational institution. You have your program worked out much better and presented to a greater extent, when you plan to present it, in advance, in this way. Now, coming to the disadvantage.?. ■ (A) A great deal of inertia must be overcome before the thing commences to move. It takes considerable effort to get the various communities to take an interest in their respective parts of the program. You are naturally slow in getting a movement. Some parts of the county will get into action a lot faster than others. (B) Some one must devote considerable time to the organization of the program. That requires close attention and plenty of push. All that must be arranged, so that everything is ready for the time the fair starts. : (C) If the program is provided in addition to the regular enter - tainment there may be too much of it. The Concession men object to the crowd being held off the midway. They claim that we keep them in the grandstand for too great a period of timo. We ran into that problem. On the part of the concession^ men, one can rsadily see there may be some basis to that objection. I do not know just what we may do about that another year. That remains to be seen. Now we come to the next point, types of entertainment, and the relative merit of the various types. (A) The County Chorus. This was an excellent feature. In this chorus, with five or six hundred children, there was a groat deal of interest aroused. Much time and effort was required in organiza - tion. But I am sure this will be placed in operation again next year. (2) It required the appointment of a committee consisting of a County Superintendent and at least two of the music instructors in the county. This group is primarily responsible for the feature. Preliminary practice and rehearsal aroused a good deal of interest and ali'orded a good deal of pleasure in planning this part of the program. The scope of such a feature spreads the interest over the county. I hope we will even have more people in this feature next year. (B) Minstrel Show. This is another excellent feature. (1) A good loud-speaker is required. (2) It requires a good enthusiastic </seg>
            <seg id="p098">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE director. Superintendent Montgomery, of the Blair schools, did a splendid job in this respect. (3) To make arrangements with some organization, might in some instances be preferable rather than to depend on individuals as such. (4) The probable cost for such a feature should be around twenty-five or thirty dollars. Of course the cost of this phase of entertainment could vary, according to the num - ber involved in the feature. (C) The County Male Chorus is an excellent feature for adults. (1) There is need of a small group or a capable individual, to act as organizer. This has to be well trained and prepared before the Fair. (2) But this number was very popular. (3) If possible, representa - tives should be secured from the various communities in the county. Of course, it may be some trouble for some of them to attend re - hec rsals, but it is a rather enjoyable enterprise. Now we conducted soft-ball tournaments. That is a form of enter - tainment that has become very popular in recent years. (1) Seven teams were entered from the county. These games were played in the morning and early afternoon, and they filled in on the program, in pretty good shape. ( 2 ) The various towns paid an entry fee of five dollars. . (3) Purses of twenty dollars, ten dollars, five dollars, two dollars and a half, were allowed, for the end positions, or a total of forty-two dollars and a half. ' Every team received something. The first purses were a sufficient attraction to aid the tournament. So thej event practically paid for itself. (4) The interest was keen. It aroused interest in the various rural communities, for it gave them all a part in the program. It is surprising the number of people who would take an interest in eoftball. (5) But there are some objections to this feature. One is, that it takes up too much time. Another is, that it consumes too many gratis tickets. Of course on the other hand, when you have so many players, even though they get tickets, they may bring relatives or friends with them and thus stimulate the attendance. (6) If possible, it might be well to have an athletic com - mittee take charge of this event. (B) The One- Act play was tried, and we found it to be just fair. (I) I would not recommend it in many instances. (2) One of the objections, is, that it does not afford an opportunity for the players to rehearse with the loud-speaker, or hold rehearsals with the micro - phone. (3) Experienced players could probably put it over. (F) The next feature, is the use of children in songs, dances, and acrobatic acts. These can be taken individually or in group. These features can be very easily arranged and are well received. (2) In our experience, we had attractive acts and unusual talent was dis - covered right within the county. (3) These features are arranged </seg>
            <seg id="p099">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS through the schools. The main difficulty with this phase of the pro - gram is to arrange it according to the amount of time that it should take. Now we come to one of the principal features. (G) The Crowning of the Queen of Washington county. In this coronation we had an excellent feature. (1) It was arranged for the last night, which is usually a light crowd. (2) This ceremony drew, what was prob - ably the largest crowd we had ever assembled for an evening show. Of course, Chris Lyck had his fireworks that night and some folks attributed the attendance to that feature. The people of Herman accounted for it in another way, but anyway, it turned out to be a pretty good feature. (3) The arrangements on this item required, (a) a committee of women put in a lot of work on the decorations, the costumes, arrangements for the flower girls, and the crown bearers, and all of the others involved in this feature. (b) It required a lot of publicity before the Fair, (c) We tried to arrange an impartial polling place. Now, there is one objection that has been advanced to this parti - cular contest. But on the whole, that is as to the strenuous com - petition that arises. It happens that our prize was awarded in the form of a trip to the Chicago Exposition or the alternative in cash. The young lady who won, preferred to take her award in cash and apply it on a piano. But so long as she was satisfied, everybody else was. (4) Of course the connection that wants to be made between this feature and the season ticket sale, brings up arguments pro and con. We found that it was a pretty good stimulant to the season ticket sale. Now, in conclusion, our Fair Board seemed to be heartily in favor of the plan. (B) It is felt that the plan will be much less difficult to re - peat this year. Three of the features of the program are already in preparation, for this coming year. Arlington and Blair have already started work on particular features. (C) We shall probably make one change. We shall probably have to cut down on the time, on some of the numbers. (D) Many possibilities have not been touched. Num - erous suggestions have been. made and will be made. Each entertain - ment committee will need to adjust its program to the local situation. We anticipate that it may be well to adapt the time consumed on some of the features to the objection that has been made, by the concession people, that too much time was consumed in the grandstand and that the crowd was held away from the midway for too long a time. It any of you would like to ask any questions as to details I would be, glad to answer them if I can. BY MR. HUNT, of Otoe County: What time do you hold your Fair? 1G851B </seg>

For one candidate they put in too many votes at one time. BY MR. JOHNSON: We will pass on to the next subject. Now, I have had the pleasure of going down to the Pawnee County Fair and I know they have done a wonderful job there. We are going to have a discussion of the PAID FAIR vs. THE FREE FAIR, by Mr. Kenneth S. Wherry of Pawnee City. HOW WE SUCCRKDED WITH A PAY GATE By Mr. Kenneth S. Wherry, Pawnee City I. Definition of the question: There are fairs and fairs — free fairs, half way free fairs and paid fairs. A few of them are absolutely free at the gate. The majority of so-called free fairs, however, charge as much or more on the inside than the general admission of paid fairs charge at the outside gate. The. free fairs that have no charge are, in the main, street fairs. The bulk of the finances are dependent on the sale of concession space, and subscriptions from patriotic merchants and townspeople. Some of tie free street fairs are highly successful, notably among them is the annual free fair at Humboldt, that has attracted, on conservative estimate as high as 40,000 people during the 3 days week period it is held. The half way free fairs depend not only on subscriptions and revenue from the sale of concession space but also on the sale of grand stand and bleacher tickets which the patron is practically forced to buy if the fair is to be seen with any degree of satisfaction. I mention these things to bring forcibly to the attention of the convention that there is no such thing as a free fair. The gate might be free but we should all bear this in mind, that all fairs including the </seg>
            <seg id="p101">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS so called free fairs must be puid for in the end. The history of so called free fairs reveals that they last just as long as the personnel of the board is able to sell high priced concession space and secure adequate subscription from loyal citizens of the community. Likewise paid fairs will last just so long as the patrons feel they get their money's worth. Our fair, which is a paid fair, has adopted a policy of a general admis - sion charge at the gate that the fair might be continuous — not work a hardship on a few, and yet scatter the cost on thousands that feel a small expenditure more than justifies the programs offered at our annual show. This policy has not gone far wrong evidenced by the fact that our fair has been continuous for a period of fifty-five years, and it has grown to what we are told one of the largest county fairs in the state. 2. Well balanced programs mark the success of a Fair: The free fair is staged by finances resulting from the sale of con - cession space and from voluntary subscriptions. Such a fair is at the mercy of concessionists and the business interest of the community. The concessionist must get the money back and make a profit and therefore insists on unregulated operation at all hours of the fair. Contributing business firms must pack their stores, which means the fair crowd belongs to them for a portion of the time. As a result, programs cannot possibly be planned and put over that detract from the ballyhoo of the concessionist nor the success of market week of the subscribing merchants. In other words, those who pay for the fair, demand how it shall be run regardless of whether the fair is a financial success or not. Contrast that with a paid fair at the gate •where the patron pays for a high class show. The patron is the one who helps make the program for the end. The morning, the after - noon and night show belong to those who pay at the gate, and as a result a well balanced program can be put over which will meet the approval of thousands of fairgoers that do not object but rather who enjoy to pay the tariff when they get their money's worth. A successful fair should be built upon such a program-— offering something to all, emphasizing 4-H Club work, agricultural and live - stock displays, educational features, musical productions and unusual entertainment. Stunt mornings, school exhibits, floats, athletic events, and especially high school football games are attractions that make for an ideal morning fair. Horseracing, rodeo events, horse shows, free attractions, bands, musical productions, will provide thrills for your afternoon and night shows if put on in a three ring circus fashion with plenty of human interest which will leave no doubt when the crowd leaves the ground at night that their money has been well spent and they will sell the fair to their friends for the next day. Special attrac - tions should be emphasized and they should be changed next day so </seg>
            <seg id="p102">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE that holders of season tickets might look forward to new thrills and new entertainment. This helps to round out a program which has drawing power and that is the thing that sells the fair. 3. Our Fair should be kept clean: Only the very best talent in all lines of amusement and enter - tainment should be used in a well balanced program.- Our fair should be kept clean. In the nine years that it has been my privilege to serve as president of the Pawnee County Fair, we have not operated a ques - tionable side show, we have not run a public dance, we have not per - mitted the sale of wet goods on the fair grounds. Our board has done its level best to keep the standard of our programs, entertainments, and amusements on a high level and it is my honest opinion that good, clean, wholesome amusement and entertainment still has a drawing power. It doesn't take betting to make a horse race, neither does it take a licensed saloon to develop the interest in a fair program. A fair that will continue to operate on high standards will live years after thoijie fairs that depend upon questionable and shady amusements have passed on out of the picture. 1. Budget assures Financial success: If a fair is to continue it is necessary that it be financially a success. To assure financial success, our Fair Boards, both county and state, should consist of men who are financially successful themselves. You can't operate a county fair nor a state fair unless that fair is operated on a sound financial basis. To have that kind of finance is to have those who know finance and know how to handle the same. Too many fairs are operated in a haphazard manner. No thought of maintenance, bad weather, drought, and a hundred and one things that might come up over night and decrease the average revenue of a fair. The financial committee, headed up by a real finance officer, should be required to audit all phases of receipts and expenditures on a yearly basis that have to do with the fair. A detailed financial statement should be charted just as your expenditures are charted in your business and that expendi - ture should be broken up so that you can visualize the cost of amuse - ments, entertainments, horse racing, rodeo events, agricultural and livestock premiums, musical productions, all general expense, in - cluding labor and policing, maintenance of all buildings and in fact all items no matter how small should be brought to the attention of the directors from year to year so that the incoming Fair Board can put their fingers upon the average expenditure over a five and ten year period of a Fair's operation. Likewise all receipts should be brought down in each column in detail. All tickets should be accounted for whether complimentary or not and most complimentary tickets should absolutely be abolished. Revenues from concessions, single admission* </seg>
            <seg id="p103">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS at the gate, season tickets, grandstand and bleacher seats, all parking space, all quarterstretch sales, and all those items of receipt that make up the total of the fair should be broken up in their respective columns over a five and ten year period. If such an audit is made year after year it will not only throw light on what the average fair costs and what the average fair produces, but a Fair Board can set its budget and keep well within that budget. It will not only keep the fair out of debt but finally a reserve can be set up that will carry the fair through bad weather or some unforseen handicap that often runs a fair into debt in a season. It might not be popular as far as the democratic administration is concerned down at Washington to be con - cerned over a balanced budget, but I want to make this statement with all the force that is in me, that no business has ever been a success unless the budget has been balanced. If your fair is to be a. success, you must know how much money you can expend and the budget must be set accordingly. In any event the expenditure should not exceed the revenue and with most fairs sinking funds should be set up for maintenance and a reserve should be set up regardless of the income that will insure financial success. Financial stability can be assured if those who have the ability can be induced to take charge of ' our fairs. In the nine years we have operated our fair, we have had the best talent we could find in the county to take charge of this institu - tion. During that time we have paid off a debt of $6800.00, we have conservatively put over $10,000.00 into improvements. Today we are out of debt and we have a nice reserve laid up to help us on future fairs. The thing we prize most however is the fact we have built up a patronage which is growing and which looks forward to the first - week in October when our annual show takes place. All of this has been done on a well balanced program and I especially want to empha - size that a paid fair can be made financially successful with a state - ment that during the past two years a period that has played havoc with a lot of fairs, that our fair made $5600.00 a year ago and $3700.00 net last year. It is just a question of the right kind of finance and that finance must be on the same plane used by the prosperous mer - chant and that is to budget your fairs and at the same time put over a program that will produce revenue and plenty of it at the gate. 5. Your fair should be properly merchandised. All sorts of schemes have been used by the special advertisers to put over fairs, car bumpers, pennants, car window display advertis - ing, placards, and a hundred and one things have been developed by advertising agencies to help sell our fairs. No doubt arguments can be advanced that all sorts of advertising is helpful, on the other hand my experience in business has been that unless you can tell the story of your wares in such a way that it creates human interest, then your </seg>
            <seg id="p104">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE advertising is of no avail. This can be done best through bulletins and the newspapers. With that thought in mind we put out 3700 Pawnee County Fair bulletins in 1927. This book contained 32 pages and in it the story of our fair together with its program was well written. We have continued to send out that bulletin each year wh^ch is now more complete than ever and which tells of all those things of interest which we know appeals to our fair patrons. Last year we sent out over 20,000 bulletins. It was sent to every home in the five southeast counties in Nebraska and the three northeast coun - ties in Kansas. We also advertise in every county paper in that sec - tion. This kind of advertising has shown results. It is our guarantee of a program which our patrons know will be put on as advertised. This year we expect to send out 30,000 bulletins for we know that people on the outlying territory will be expecting them. Unless your fair is merchandised, it will not be a financial success. On the other hand, if you want to kill a fair just advertise one year, something you do not have. Three years back the Fair Board of our county felt that we should not put on a fair. It was suggested that we donate our county fair for relief purposes and put on a Pawnee County picnic, but the Fair Board voted unanimously that if we couldn't put on a fair up to the standard, we wouldn't put on any. The fair was not put on. The people were told why and we told them we would put on a fair the following year in keeping with the program of years gone by. This we did, and that year we made more money than any year our fair was operated. Why? Because we have always given our patrons exactly what we have advertised. We have done exactly what we have said we would do. That is our guarantee to the public. The only way a business can operate successfully is to back up their adver - tising with a guaranty, so it is with the fair, give your patrons what you advertise and even more and you will find thousands of satisfied customers coming within your gates, and that patronage is the biggest asset that a fair can have. 6. The successful fair should be dramatized. Recently in the Saturday Evening Post, Jack Dempsey wrote an article dramatically describing his prize fight. He vividly portrayed the efforts of the late Tex Rickard, whom he called the greatest showman thatj ever lived. Recounting Tex Rickards ability in getting ready for a fight, Jack Dempsey mentioned his showmanship and especially his method of obtaining publicity. With a lot of color, Jack Dempsey told of an expression that Tex Rickard would use when he told about the coming big fight. He would say, "Now we must dramatize this fight". In his fight with Carpentier, Tex Rickard conceived the idea that Carpentier was a foreigner, that he had been a soldier, that he had been wounded, that he was an ex-service man. All those special </seg>
            <seg id="p105">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS features were dramatized in such a way that publicity was built up in a big way for the coming fight. The same thing was true with Chic Meehan in putting New York University on the map in the football world. It is said his players were coached so that every step they made was to add color to the game. Their suits, their blankets, their method of playing was done for the one thing and that was showmanship, and almost over night, New York University became one of the out - standing schools in the production of a great football team. This is more or less true in putting over a fair. With the advent of the public address system, the success of a fair, a horse show or rodeo, depends more or less in building that program around the radio announcer. The program should be put on in front of your grand - stand and bleachers. There the radio announcer can pull off the pro - gram with the speed of a three ring circus as far as punctuality is con - cerned. The announcer should be thoroughly familiar with horse racing, rodeo and all those things which make up a fair, so that human interest can be created and the patrons center their interest in the thing or event that is taking place at that particular time. There is all the difference in the world in a horse race. There are those who believe that it takes pari-mutuel betting to create an interest, to some people it is just a horse race but a horse race dramatized as Tex Rickard would say, is to build interest into that race. Why does the Kentucky Derby draw thousands of people annually? It isn't the pari-mutuel betting but it is the interest that is built into that race that is over in about a minute and a half. Showmanship should be used to put over a racing event, the horses should be brought to the barrier in single file, they should be bedecked in their colors, the record of each horse should be brought to the attention of the audience. The owners and drivers should be introduced and every conceivable thing of interest should be built into that race. It is then that the patrons select the animal they want to see win. It is then they become interested in the scoring. It is that kind of a race that the patron follows through the horse on the back stretch and which brings them to their feet in a driving finish and makes the patron feel that he has had his money's worth. The same is true of any special feature. What is a Czechslovakian day if it is not dramatized? It is a waste of time and money to say that this is Czechoslovakian day, Republican day or some other day and then put a group of people off by themselves and expect them to put over the day. But you put five hundred members of the Czechoslov - akian Sokol Team in front of the grandstand at the State Fair Grounds for an hour's performance any morning of the State Fair and build into that Czechoslovakian program the Beseda dance and you will turn just another day into a feature attraction because you have </seg>
            <seg id="p106">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE s^EhIT ?£ eV T- U takeS that 8howman^lp to make the turn - stiles click at the outer gate. If any fair is to succeed it must be headed up with showmanship. To me this is the most important thing in the success of any fair and unless you find that showmanship and your fair can be dramatized, it cannot possibly be the successful fair that it otherwise would be. 7. Conclusion.! Let us then remember that all fairs must be paid for, whether they are so called street fairs, half way fairs, or paid fairs. That the suc - cessful fair is one j that is built upon a well balanced program, with clean wholesome amusement properly budgeted to assure financial suc - cess, one that is well advertised and one that is pulled off with show - manship so that human interest is created. I am sure that if our fairs are, continued on such a program they will be a financial success and will preserve an institution that means much to the social life of our rural community. » B I7 ICE PRESIDENT JOHNSON: I am sure we have appreciated Mr Wherry's painstaking presentation of this subject. The next subject on our program will be the other side, "How Our Free Gate Succeeded." and that has been assigned to Mr. Stanley Matzke, of beward. HOW OUR FREE GATE SUCCEEDED By Mr. Matzke Jl have spoken before this assembly for the last two years, but both times as a pinch-hitter, first, for Mr. Smiley, two years ago, and then for Mr. K. C. Fouts, a year ago. I did express a desire, last year, that I hoped some day I would be able to present a topic to this body on my own right. So I am more than glad to be here today. In approaching the subject that has been assigned to me for this meeting, I desire to offer to those who will not agree with some of the ideas and conclusions that I will express in this paper, the extenuating circumstance that prior to my association with the Seward County Fair as Secretary three years ago my only contact with Agricultural Fairs was a thorough appreciation thereof. That tho I am new in the Fair game and my ideas may not be ripened by years of experience, yet myllove of the game and my appreciation of the worthwhileness of Fairs, both County and State for many years should entitle these few words to your patient consideration. When I was less than two years old my dad and mother bundled me up and started for the State Fair irom the farm near Milford. A short distance west of Emerald the </seg>
            <seg id="p107">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS horses ran away, the buggy tongue came down, and when that tongue hit the railroad track, we were scattered all over the landscape. I am told that mother and I spent the day in a store in Emerald while dad rounded up the horses. Although I didn't get to the fair that time I have not missed very many since. In fact I have attended every State Fair for the past 15 years and several before that, and I've thoroughly enjoyed every one of them. I really feel sorry for the person who excuses his non-attendance of the County or State Fair with the reason that they are all alike — what a reflection that statement is upon his or her ability to observe, to analyze and to appreciate the things that make up the very foundations of our existance in this mid - western country. How satisfying are those memories of the thrill and excitement of attending the Fair as a kid. And how convenient and necessary it is to have the knowledge of the year to year changes that are evidenced in the exhibits, in agricultural methods and ob - jectives, in the daily habits and attitudes of our people, in educational facilities and to a certain, but important, extent, in the people them - selves. Truly the Fair is a Barometer, year by year registering in an effective, pleasing and instructive manner, the development of the state and its citizens. Now, I want to remark that Mr. Wherry and I may seem to agree on some phases and some of the things he said may seem to be about the same view I take, but I want to call attention to the fact, that the views I am giving you are my own, and that these remarks were pre - pared before I heard Mr. Wherry's paper, in fact they were prepared yesterday. ' In giving to you my observations of the Free Gate Fair as we have had it in Seward County for the past four years, I do not want you to form the conclusion that I am in any way advocating that type of fair. I am an enthusiastic advocate of the Agricultural Fair — Pay Gate — Free Gate — or any other kind of gate — so long as the fundamental objectives and results are obtained. The fact that our Free Gate Fair has brought to our Fair grounds hundreds of people who never had attended our County Fair before, has greatly increased the number of exhibiters and the quality of our local exhibits, has enabled us to each year break a little better than even instead of running terrific deficits, has filled our grandstand with satisfied, happy crowds and above all has pleased the citizens of our county, and has created a Fair consciousness throughout every part of Seward county, not only for the County Fair but for the State Fair, does not mean that the same results could not have been obtained in other ways. In fact our experience 1 with the free gate may be merely laying the foundation upon which we can later build the splendid pay gate success that has been attained by Ken Wherry at Pawnee City. </seg>

During the past three years a three day fair has been held owing </seg>
            <seg id="p109">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION' OF FAIR MANAGERS to the reason that we feared we would be unable to get enough home talent for three days' programs. Bach year more and more first class talent has become available and our 1935 Fair will be a four day Fair. The subject of home talent has been discussed at length in this meeting and I will not spend a great deal of time thereon. I know there are a lot of you who will not share my enthusiasm for the Home talent fair — I know a large number of splendid people in the entertainment and concession game whose bread and butter is threat - ened by this idea, and yet, it is my belief that many Fairs that other - wise would have given up the ghost have been kept going by this idea, and eventually this will work to the benefit of these people. In fact for our 1934 Fair we added two paid attractions as head liners, a motor cycle act and an old fashioned balloon ascension and these worked in with the Home talent programs in fine shape. The Balloon ascension was held at seven o'clock in the evening in front of the grandstand and proved the best crowd getter for our evening programs we have ever used. I was amazed at the general interest among old and young, in the balloon ascension and parachute jump. We used ladies kitten ball as an attraction three years ago and its popularity is now proven throughout the state. This year we intend to have another county wide tournament of this interesting game, but will have them play in the morning, about three games each morning, believing that this will bring in the people earlier in the day. We are planning to use a county song group on the opening evening this year, composed of song groups from every part of the county, and to use them in individual group numbers as well as one large chorus. A County Committee is now working on this and we hope to have a group of several hundred voices. To obtain and arrange the talent available a committee on "Entertainment and Program Presentation" is appointed and sub-committees are sent to every town and part of the county. The attention and interest thus obtained for the Fair is highly satisfy - ing. Our grandstand charge is 25 cents and judging from the size and enthusiasm of our crowds for the past four years I can only say that we consider Home Talent entertainment not only a success but absolutely necessary in the building up of a proper County Fair spirit in the County. It is my belief that even when paid entertainment is used that the Home Talent should be worked into the program and used to the greatest extent possible. Either this year or some time in the near future we intend to obtain a first class rodeo, and I am sure that by working it together with a Home Talent program we can contribute greatly to its effectiveness, appeal, and success. In the conduct of our fair for the past four 'years we have used no paid advertising of any kind. For two months previous to the fair our five Seward County Newspapers carry news items prepared by myself. </seg>
            <seg id="p110">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE concerning all phases of the coming fair. Last year these newspapers carried over 500 inches of such reading material— and they were glad to get it. I have here, pasted together, the news items that appeared in just one Seward County Newspaper, the Seward Independent, for our 1934 Fair. This strip is one column wide by about ten feet long If there is one thing that people read it is their home town news - paper and I know of no type of advertising that is more effective. Since we discontinued printing a premium book and financing it by selling so-called "advertising" to the merchants of the county we have had the whole hearted support of these merchants and business men. Our premium list is published in the two Seward newspapers in four installments, one in each of the four weekly issues previous to the Pair, and we find the advertising value of this method far superior to the premium book which nobody takes time to look at except those who^ are already interested in County Fair work. We can trace many of our new exhibiters to the effect of having the premium list appear in tliese weekly newspapers. J'n appreciation of our not holding them up for a lot of worth - less advertising in a premium book, our County Merchants gladly con - tribute several dollars of merchandise tickets each. About $10.00 worth of these are given away at each grandstand program on one pre - text I or another, they are used as prizes in the Horse Shoe Tourna - ment, as minor prizes in the ball games and in many other ways. These have the effect of making the Fair patrons feel that they are getting more than they expected and as good-will getters cannot be surpassed. Except for the eat joints and kiddies' rides we consider that the mid-way contributes very little to our fair, and we find that as interest in the mid-way has faded that interest in the exhibits and grandstand programs has picked up. The mid-way as it is ordinarily conducted is perhaps a necessary evil, we must put up with it, but don't let it run your fair. Your exhibiters are entitled to first consideration in every - thing, your Home Talent entertainment and your paid entertainers are entitled to every bit of assistance they can be given, your grandstand patrons should receive every courtesy possible, and after all of these liave received their every right and benefit let the mid-way have what is left. I am not a prude, and as County Attorney for eight years I liave become very tolerant of human nature and the peculiar ways in ■which it asserts itself, but I cannot see how we are adding anything -worthwhile to our community life by many of the things that we are often told we must have on the mid-way if we would have a success - ful Fjair. Put the midway in its proper place and soon you will find that your Fair will serve its function in the highly satisfying and suc - cessful way regardless of what happens to the midway. The County Fair has a glorious past. From tire time when the </seg>
            <seg id="p111">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS King and his Barons mingled with the peasants on the dusty fields of the Shire Fair, to the present day, it has filled a valuable place in. our social and agricultural and economic life. Many of our present day institutions owe their development to the exchange of ideas, the sociability, the lessons, and the inspiration of the County Fair. Let us not be swayed by interests of commercialism, by the threat of depres - sion, by the glitter and pornographic methods of a certain minority; let us hold true to the traditions of the Fair; let us determine what kind of a Fair will best serve the interests of our people — and serving them best will please them most. The County Fair as an institution will live forever — it is up to us to use it to the best advantage — to mold it to useful purposes. BY VICE PRESIDENT JOHNSON: We certainly appreciate the address which Mr. Matzke has given us, and he has defended the free fair as we expected he would. Our next subject upon the program is worded, "Discussion: Pari - mutuel Betting." It has been proposed to have someone interested in this subject who is a keen student, be here to give us information upon the subject and to explain the workings of this pari-mutuel betting. It doesn't matter whether one approves or disapproves of this proposition, it has been submitted to the voters and adopted. We have it with us. It is here, so we should become informed and adapt our - selves to the task of working with it. I know of no one in Nebraska who can probably better explain the workings of pari-mutuel betting than the man upon whom we are going to call. He dislikes, very much, to take this place on this pro - gram. But I know that as long as we cannot have any of the speakers that we can call upon him to take the place of those we had expected, to be here. I take pleasure in presenting to you, a man who knows the inside of horse racing, Secretary Perry Reed of the State -Fair. As Mr. Reed has to use some charts, it may take a few moments to place them and in the meantime, we will call upon the Committee on Aggrievances, for its report. BY CHAIRMAN EMERSON R. PURCELL: Lincoln, Nebraska, Jan. 15, 1935. To the President and Members of the Nebraska Association of County Fairs. Gentlemen: We, your Committee on Grievance, submit the following report: The Joe Marion Co., of Omaha, through its representative, Grace </seg>
            <seg id="p112">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE M. Russell, appeared before the committee on this date and complained that the County Fair Board of Nance County had not complied with an agreement to pay the sum of $50.00 to the said company. This was a case where the Joe Marion company's attraction was cancelled four days before the opening day of the Fair, for the reason that the Fair was declared off for that year. No member of the Nance County Fair Board was present at the committee hearing and we understand that no officer of that Board is present at this meeting of the State Associa - tion of County Fairs. Mr. R. Widle of Genoa appeared before the committee and stated that j;he said grievance between the parties had been heard by the Grievance Committee of which he was chairman, about three years ago, and a compromise was effected in which the County Fair Board was to pay the Marion Company fifty dollars, to which both sides of the controversy agreed. The Joe Marion Company claim that this amount of fifty dollars has not up to this time been paid. Your committee believes this amount of fifty dollars is justly due to the Marion Company and recommends that the said County Fair Board of Nance County pay its obligation. Respectfully submitted, E. R. PURCELL, G. I. PFEIFFER, ALBERT BENSON. MR. PURCELL: Now the committee did not go into the merits of this case, since we felt that as long as there had been a settlement or agreement made of a five hundred dollar claim, for fifty dollars, that it was probably pretty well considered, though that was upon con - sideration before the Grievence Committee of three years ago. Mr. Widle explained, somewhat, that they had not paid this, but we under - stand that that Fair is now in financial condition to do so and we rather think this matter should be paid. Motion made, seconded, voted and carried that the reports of the committee be adopted. BY VICE PRESIDENT JOHNSON: Now, Mr. Reed is ready. We will ask him to proceed with the explanation of the pari-mutuel betting system L BY MR. PERRY REED: Mr. Chairman, and Gentlemen: I did not wish to undertake, and I did not ask for this job. Mr. Marshall and Mr. Johnson asked me if I would undertake to present this chart and explain the workings of this system. First, may I state, that the State Board of Agriculture took no part during the campaign in regard to </seg>
            <seg id="p113">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS this issue. In fact, we haven't even discussed it among our own people. But it is here and it is up to us to investigate Its workings, so I will try to explain to you, this pari-mutuel betting. I suppose you all know, pari-mutuel is a word from France. It came to this country years ago. It has been adopted in nineteen states and it is about to become a working law in our state. Now, I have taken, for illustration, on this chart, one of the races at New Orleans, two weeks ago. I based this chart on the sale of two dollar tickets. They have two dollar, five dollar, and ten dollar tickets. When the individual comes to wager on a horse, one goes through the list of names and picks out the one he wishes. Now, we will take a ticket on a certain horse. The tickets are all bet on a horse to win. They are divided this way: one hundred and twenty — two hundred, — three hundred and fifty — eighty — six hundred — four hundred and fifty — three hundred — five — one hundred and seventy — and the total $2,410.00. The race is run and a certain horse wins. The way they figure that up, they use a totalizer as it is called, a very expensive machine. The calculations are all worked by machine. At some of the small tracks they may use what is called a calculator. A man must be mighty accurate to figure these things. Now, let us take the results of one race. They take the total, and then they take out the commission. They divide those by the number of tickets. In this race. Urban, won. There were three hundred and fifty tickets placed on that particular horse to win. The total number of tickets, twenty-four hundred and ten, was multiplied by two. That makes $4820.00 that was bet on this one race. That is the cue for the winning figure. Now, ten per cent is about the average that they usually take out for commission. Then take out ten per cent of $4820.00. Then you divide what is left by the number of tickets on the next scale, which was 350. That leaves a figure of $12.39. When they come to pay off, they just deduct and keep this 9c and leave it at even money. That is called the "breaks". I know they will talk in the law, about the "breaks." Sometimes they run as high as nine cents or as low as three or four cents. Whatever is the average, that is taken in addition to the ten per cent. Then, in addition to the horse to win, we have the horse to place. They run either to win or to place. Now we have 1810 tickets that have been sold at $2.00 that are to place. Take out ten per cent. Divide it by the number of tickets bet on the winner. One was to place second. Now there are seven hundred tickets to divide. When that is done, you have $4.65 to place. There are two horses to place, because one is winner and the other places by getting second place or second position. There is one more posi - tion, and that is to show, which amounts to coming into third place. There must be three horses to show, one wins, one places, and the third </seg>
            <seg id="p114">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE horse shows. In this instance you have 1675 tickets at $2.00 bet on the horse to show. That is multiplied by two and take out the ten per cent, and you get a figure of $3.20 a ticket to show. jjot long ago. at Charleston, West Virginia, there was not a single ticket bet on a certain horse to win and the chances were one to twelve hundred. They had no idea that a certain horse would win. The amount there is to divide depends on the number of tickets in the name of any certain horse. There really isn't so much difference in this than if say eight fellows are sitting in the grandstand and they say "Let's put eight numbers in a hat and draw out a number and the one wins the whole pot who hold a number that corresponds to the number of the winning horse." Only in this grand pool, the association takes out ten per cent. The more horses there are in the pool, the less it pays. But sometimes it pays six hundred to a thousand dollars and usually the chances run about one to eighty. I don't know how much this chart will help you, but I think I have explained about what the association gets out of this scheme. I might say a word as to the amount realized by say, the Ak-Sar-Ben. Now, on a race, here, where the total is 11,790 and there are eight horses in the race. You have eight classes. The amount paid to win is $^820.00. The association took out $482.00, or ten per cent, for themselves. $4338.00 that was left to go back to winning tickets. There were 350 tickets sold, so when you divide into the $4338.00 you have $12.39. You take out $12.30. Now, on second, to place, you have $1810.00, you divide by two and have $3620.00. The Association takes out $362.00. That leaves $3258.00. That totals up altogether on that one race, that the Association got $1179.00 and there has been paid back, $10,611.00. I don't know of anything further that I can give to explain this. Of course, you know there Is a lot of expense. At Rockingham Park, Rhode Island last October, they had races for thirty days, on the last day the betting was $948,000.00. Nebraska, of course, can't carry it onj that way. Ten per cent of that would make quite a sum, but when it is spread over a thirty day period, of course, it may not be quite so much money. MR. JOHNSON: Are there any questions that you wish to ask Mr. Reed? DELEGATE asks for a better explanation as to win, place and show. MR. REED explains that win, is in first place, place is in second </seg>
            <seg id="p115">NEBRASKA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS place, and show is for third place. Thus, three horses show, only two place, and one wins. DELEGATE from Antelope County wants to know what percentage County Fairs would get. EXPLANATION made that that is not shown very specifically in the proposed legislation. MR. U. S. RENNE, of Washington County, made some remarks on horse racing in general, he being quite a heavy owner of race horses. He explained, over again, the use of the agitator or calculator. BY MR. JOHNSON: Now, some of you have wanted to know about this proposed legislation, or what kind of a law may be introduced to put this matter into operation. So far, one bill has been introduced. House Roll No. 36. There are copies of that law scattered about the room here. There will probably be numerous other bills introduced. As I remember, there was a good deal said, during the campaign, that if this system was adopted, it would be of great aid and be a great asset to the County Fairs and the 4-H Club work. They got votes by holding out that inducement. Whether we are particularly in favor of this system as an association or as individuals, I think we should see to it that this pledge is carried out. If the County Fairs of Ne - braska are to get anything they will have to be alert and on the watch. For that reason, it has been suggested that we should have a com - mittee who will look after this matter when this association has gone home from this assembly. Now, I have not desired to assume to take authority to appoint this committee, but in order to have this matter in shape to submit to you for action, I have selected a Legislative Com - mittee of three members who will examine these bills that are in - troduced and who may prepare a bill or bills for introduction and in .general look after the interests of the County Fairs in this State. I have tried to the best of my judgment to select men who will work hard and look after this matter, and who will be in position to do so, so I will now submit their names for the approval of this con - vention. On this committee, I would ask, Stanley Matzke, of Seward, who is a lawyer and is willing to devote some time to this work, to act as chairman; J. S. Steele, who is a member of this Association and also a member of this Legislature; and Mr. A. A. Russell, of Geneva. Motion made, seconded, voted and carried that this committee be .approved by this convention and the appointments confirmed. </seg>

            <seg id="p122">PRESIDENTS ANNUAL ADDRESS C. Y. THOMPSON, West Point Members of the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association and friends: In the words of our worthy secretary, "We have jammed this year's program so full of talks that we are going to have to start and stop every speaker promptly. We promise you that the meetings are going to begin on time, and may we urge that you plan on being present on the dot if you attend these meetings." And if you know our sec - retary, Mr. Stewart, you know that he means just what he says. This president's address I assure you is not a self-imposed task, but rather it seems to be the policy of this organization to take time out for the president's address. So, in view of the fact that we are pressed for time and we have such a well-filled program of such an extremely high order, I am going to fulfill my obligations to the organization in as few words as possible. Owing to the drouth and due to the fact that our Secretary Mr. P. H. Stewart and our Asst. Secretary Mr. D. L. Gross, the main springs of this organization were drafted to do government work, our activities this year have not been as great as usual. According to the secretary a report, we had some 300 acres of corn to produce hybrid seed on Nebraska farms this year, but due to the drouth very little of this corn matured, so there will be very little certi - fied seed of Nebraska 238 available. A summary of our 1934 certified seed work reads as follows: SUMMARY OF CERTIFIED SEED WORK 1034.

            <seg id="p123">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION We had no Corn Yield Contest this year, and owing to the drouth we were compelled to eliminate the entire corn and grain show, which has always been the outstanding feature of our meetings here. In spite of this fact, however, we encourage those who could to send exhibits to the International Hay &amp; Grain Show and as usual had a judge, D. L. Gross, there representing our organization. For a number of years, we have appropriated substantial sums from our funds to help bear the expenses of the College and 4-H Club Crop Judging teams, to attend and compete in the crops judging con - tests at both the Kansas City Royal and the International Hay &amp; Grain Show, and I think we have a right to feel proud of the boys, because of the showings they have made this year and other years. We are told that the Lancaster County boys again won the crops judg - ing title at Chicago. It made the fifth Nebraska team to take first place in the national event, while in the other four years, Nebraska placed second. Horatio Erskine, James and Lewis Jeffery who placed second, fourth and. eighth as individuals, made up the team. We are proud of the records of some of the other judging teams also, but we do not have time to go into detail here. I can only say that In most instances, the work of these boys and girls has reflected much credit on this great seat of learning and they merit all the support we can give them. It has been suggested, that since we have no winter show, that the money normally spent for this purpose might be appropriated to foster some sort of pasture contest. Hundreds of acres of pasture land have been ruined by the drouth, and it was thought that such a program would fit in well with the present agricultural situation. There is no question in my mind but what the suggestion is a good one. I believe that we farmers would all be better off if we kept a larger percentage of our farm land in pasture. Wind and rain and heavy cropping have taken a heavy toll on the fertility of our farms. We have reached the stage in farming in Nebraska, even in our best farming sections, where only the most efficient production will produce a profit, and let us not forget, the more we produce at a loss, the sooner we will be asking for relief. If the average 160 acre farmer will cut his corn acreage 10 to 15 acres, and seed this land to pasture, alfalfa or sweet clover, he will make more profit in the course of time than lie will farming all the land, and he will save himself considerable work, to say nothing about the improved fertility of the soil. It is high-yielding acres rather than increased acreage that bring us a profit these days. So I think a well planned pasture program or contest is worthy of consideration, and I would like to see some favorable action taken by the members of this organization, to make a reasonable ap - propriation to properly foster such a contest. </seg>
            <seg id="p124">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE THE MOST PROFITABLE USE OF LAND AS SHOWN BY NEBRASKA FARM RECORDS MR. A. G. GEORGE, Nebraska College &lt;.i Agriculture The main theme of discussion this morning, as you notice in your programs, has to do with land utilization. By land utilization we mean the use of land. Now, Nebraska has a land use problem. I doubt not but what from 60 to almost 100 per cent of those of you who are in the audience are either sons, grandsons, or great grandsons of pioneers who came from their former homes out into this country, into a new and untried land. And why did they come? They came primarily because there was a land problem. It is not my intention this morning to define what the land problem is, as there are speakers who follow who have devoted more time to a study of that than I, and they will outline this problem to you. In coming in to this new territory, these people came, as I say, because of a land problem. The land problem in those days could be met or side-stepped largely by moving out to new frontiers, rather than working out some solution on lands already occupied. Today, land frontiers are obliterated. Land problems must be worked out and solved on the places now already occupied. I Why A Land Problem? Now, why was there a land problem? What is the origin of it? The principal and probably main origin of the land problem was the policy] or perhaps we might say, the lack of policy, established in turning over the public domain to private individuals. The plan fol - lowed was to allot a certain number of acres to an individual who might meet certain requirements, such as residence, construction of improvements, and payment of a small fee per acre for the land he was to take. It made no difference where the land taken up by the newcomer was situated, whether in the fertile rolling plains of eastern Nebraska, or the semi-arid plains of the southwest, or in the broad ranges of the sand hills, or whether it was in the pine clad slopes of the pine ridge. The same number of acres could be obtained, irrespective of the qualities of the land. No attempt was made to classify the land, nor on the basis of classification to provide "different means of turning it over to settlers. It was not classified into mining land, timber land, or other lands not available for use in an agricultural way. Some lands yield their best returns when retained as public domain and used for parks, game preserves, or other public uses. Now, the most productive use of land may be determined on differ - ent bases. In the first place, the productive use of land has to do with </seg>
            <seg id="p125">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION location. One might have very productive land up in the Arctic, but it would possess no productive value to mankind. If that same area were located in the heart of a thriving city, the ground may support a large building which may return greater returns than used in growing crops or producing livestock. In other words, its value so far as location is concerned has something to do with its location with reference to the centers of population. Fig. 1 — The lack of a land policy in the past has caused many mistakes. The Kinkader who built this house finally gave up hut there was much disappointment, financial loss and human misery in this cut and try method of working out land utiliza - tion policies. Another feature that we must consider in determining productive - ness of land has to do with native fertility, and when I say native fertility I mean when used in producing crops or for general farming purposes. It may have inherent qualities of an economic value as minerals, metals, or salt, or something used economically in the busi - ness world. Another factor has to do with its management. We are all familiar with the fact that in all localities are farms which, it operated by a certain individual would yield greater returns than if operated by other individuals. Use IjiiimI For Best Purpose. This land use problem, as I see it, has to do not so much with the management-, of the land, but the inherent properties of the land it - self and what it is adapted for. Land adapted for growing corn prob - ably should be used for that purpose. Lands which are adapted for the growing of wheat probably should be used for that purpose; lands </seg>
            <seg id="p126">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE used for grazing should be used primarily for that purpose. Lands suited for growing timber and lands which contain minerals or valu - able jmetals should probably be used for that purpose, rather than to make farms out of them for growing corn, wheat, or livestock. Now the land problem is not a new one, as I have said before. The land [problem has always existed. Pioneers who came out here moved to new lands as a partial solution of the land use problem. There are no frontiers now. There are no virgin territories where man may now settle. Since the land was taken up by new settlers, the land prob - lem has gradually had to be worked out by the man on the land. Men who settled in the eastern part of the state where the land was fertile, adopted and used certain types of farming suited to the land. Those who settled farther west where rainfall is less abundant and conditions more severe, set up farming conditions which were not the same as in the eastern part of the state. Those in the grazing area adopted a different type of farming or land use. Aiid so we find that others settled in areas which later were turned into Irrigation and there again they had different ways of handling that and in order to make it more productive. S6 the land use problem does work out. The men who are on the ground work out the problem themselves. The trouble with this method is that it takes too long to work out a solution of the problem. Often the savings of a lifetime are lost; and many times the man who has spent the better part of his years in trying to wrest a livelihood from his operations, finds too late that he has been "barking up the wrong tree", and he has probably been doing the wrong thing to that parti - cular piece of land. The land use program has to do with trying to make readjustments before too late, in order to try and get the changes made so that less distress will be wrought on those who now occupy the land. What Farm Record Show. It is not my purpose to discuss the land problem. That will be taken up by those, I presume, who are more directly working along that 1 ne. My subject has to do with the most productive use of land as shown by Nebraska records. The Nebraska agricultural college has been collecting records from farmers for more than 20 years, and in my discussion I wish to call attention to a few figures that were ob - tained from 1914 to 1932, inclusive. These records are obtained from individual farmers in different parts of the state. The early records from 1914 to approximately 1920 were obtained by the survey method where a representative ot </seg>
            <seg id="p127">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION the college visited the farmer and obtained by interview a record of a year's business. From 1920 up to date, the records were obtained by means of records actually kept by the farmers themselves. The books were placed by the agricultural college, the farmers given instructions as to how the books were to be kept, and then at the end of the year, the books were sent in to the college, where they were summarized and then returned to the owners. These records are what we have to use in my discussion this morning, and they might show several ways in which the land use problem might be attacked, or they might show several factors that may affect the productiveness of the land. The Size of Farm. My purpose is to touch on the effect of size of farm on income, or effect of size of farm upon the relative profitableness of a particular piece of land. A study was made a short time ago on this subject, and it is for this reason that I wish to bring these figures to you. They are fresh. I want to call your attention to some of them and bring out the effect of size of farm upon the profitableness of the use of land. ~£2!£_ -g»iJ^^"aga». w^-» -a* '«•♦.. ~== "-"S^IC _j g^ Fig 2— Areas of state in use of land study. Now in carrying on this study I want you to observe Figure 2. The state was divided into five areas. Down here in area 1. Those areas were selected largely on the basis of similar conditions within the area; type of farming, amount of rainfall, average size of farm, and other conditions were as nearly alike as we could get them. There were sev - eral exceptions, but in general that was the basis on which the division was made. I am not going to call attention to each area. Area 1 shows north - eastern and southeastern conditions; area 2 shows southern conditions; </seg>
            <seg id="p128">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE area 3, central conditions, and areas 4 and 5, western conditions. I am going to show you figures for area 1. In connection with those figures, individual records from Cass county were used. That will more^ nearly localize the problem. In area 2, figures were used from Phelps county, and in area 4 from Cheyenne county, not for any parti - cular reason other than that we have more individual records from thesej particular counties than from any other one county within those areas. Area I, Farm Size Indications. Here on table 1, we have a group of figures. I want to explain the table. Over here we classify the farms as to size. In the first line we show the farms that were in size from 100 acres down to zero. Then we increase the size by 40 acres, next is 140 to 180. The last, 640 acres and over. Then in the next column we show the number of farms on which records were obtained from 1914 to 1932 in these different size groups. The next column shows the average number of acres per farm; next, per cent in crops; next, investment in land per acre. That is', the jjctual values given to us by farmers themselves. Land values do not include improvements. Then, total investment which includes land, buildings, livestock, equipment, and stock. Then we have the net income per acre, which has been computed from rate earned on invest - ment' then rate earned on investment. We first obtained the net farm income by subtracting the expenses in cash from the cash received. That gives us the net cash income. Then to the net cash, income we add any increases in inventory which occurred on that farm, and then subtract any inventory decreases. That gives us the net farm income. Then from the net farm income we have deducted a wage earned by the farm operator and by members of his family who did field work, then what we have left after that is computed as a per cent of the capital invested. The figure of rate earned on investment includes the managing ability of the operator. Bear in mind, it is hard to meas - ure this managing ability in terms of dollars and cents, or per cent. We will have to bear in mind that this management wage is included in the rate earned on investment. This figure of $2.57 income per acre is basjed on the rate earned on Investment. Here was the investment per acre of land $62.00, rate earned, 4.16 per cent. That gives the earning per acre based upon that investment. With that explanation of this table, we proceed to look at the figures. It will apply to all tables' We have some starred out here. I want you to notice what size farm has the greatest return per acre. There are two groups which show returns to be large. Over here we find that the group which averages about 118 acres in size and had 74 per cent of the land in crops and the investment at $120 per acre, gave an average return of 5.65% or $6.74 </seg>

The table for Area I shows that farms averaging 118 acres in size were the most profitable. The data show that $6.74 per acre was returned on a farm of that size. Down here we had $6.64 returns per acre on half section sized farms. The point that I want to make in connection with these figures is not that we can state definitely the size of farm to operate in order to receive the greatest returns, but merely to show that there is a tendency or trend within that area for a certain sized farms to bring greater returns than other size groups. Now in Cass county we find the same thing holding true as was found within the entire area. We find for the farms of 118 acres in size that the rate earned was 4 per cent and the income $4.64.

The fact that good management tends to work towards larger farms I think is a fact we can generally accept as true. The man with greater ability can handle more acres and do it profitably than those of mediocre ability. It is more likely that we can get records from men of that type. We probably have a greater per cent of records from large farms than those of the smaller sizes. I am not giving those figure? to give any definite conclusions but merely to give what the records show. But in general, I think we can say that the most profitable sized farm in that area would be the 320 acre size as shown by records. In Phelps county we find the same situation holding true. The 323 acre size group had a return of ¥5.38 per acre. That seems to be the norm by which we should determine what sized farm is most profitable in that area. The Panhandle.

Coming down to Cheyenne county. We think of Cheyenne county as a| wheat county. There is lots of wheat grown in that county. There is also lots of stock grown there, lots of corn, so it is not as much of a wheat county as we might think. Here we have a good many records in this county, only for the last few years. It says up here records from 1918 to 1932. There was only one in 1918, and one or two each year thereafter until about 1927 when a greater number were obtained each succeeding year. I have shown this first size group just as a matter of interest. This was one farm. The record was obtained in 1918 and the return was 12 per cent, or $5.00 per acre. We can not conclude that it represents the proper size farm to have in Cheyenne county, but I show it merely as one of the records. You will notice some minus figures. Come down here and find that the group which had the highest returns was the group of 474 acres, the rate earned was 6 per cent, and the returns $1.49 per acre. r- Now you will notice here that it was probably the same size group in Cheyenne county as shown up here in Area 4 which showed highest returns, except we don't have any records from farms from 521 to 600 acres in size for Cheyenne county.

I have attempted to bring only the records of the relation of size of the farm to productivity of the land. </seg>
            <seg id="p133">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION NEBRASKA LAND UTILIZATION STUDIES ARTHUR ANDERSON 1 It has been my duty and privilege during the past few weeks to conduct a survey of present land-use in Nebraska as a part of the Federal land program, and to make recommendations with respect to possible adjustments. Obvisously such a preliminary report must be very general and concerned largely with co-ordinating and interpreting such information as is readily available. It should be borne in mind, therefore, that this preliminary report will be subject to change as ■additional information is developed. Nebraska is and will remain primarily an agricultural state and hence soil and water form the most important natural resources. More than 95 per cent of the total land area is in farms and ranches and It does not appear likely that any significant portion of it can be de - voted to a more effective use. It would follow, therefore, that such land-use adjustments as are proposed to maintain these natural re - sources and increase economic stability and efficiency will be con - cerned largely with size and type of units, and such problems as erosion, irrigation, and drainage. Under our Federal government, the major portion of the state was sectionized and the land passed from public domain into private owner - ship under the various homestead acts and grants on this basis. During this period of development little or no consideration was given to land-use problems. Due to' 1 lack of information concerning effective land use and the exploitative influence of various interests, numerous mal-adjustments have come into existence. It is now very evident that land in our state was too generally placed under cultivation and too little regard given to the establishment of economic units and to the maintenance of the soils and their inherent productivity. Many of these mal-adjustments have been and are being slowly •corrected. It would appear desirable, however, to attempt an analysis •of our present land-use problems, particularly with reference to main - tenance of soil resources, with the hope that these mal-adjustments may be more rapidly corrected and guarded against in the future. Soil is not merely the material of the land regardless of depth as is ■commonly believed. It is the surface portion and is slowly formed from the under-lying material as a result of weathering processes. It is, therefore, the end product of the parent material, the environ - ment, and time. Wasteful depletion of the soil may thus become a serious menace. 1 Nebraska Land Planning Consultant for the National Resources Board. </seg>
            <seg id="p134">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE IT. Geological Relations and Major Soil Areas. In order to properly evaluate our soils, and land use problems, it would appear desirable to briefly review the geologic influences that have had a direct bearing thereon and delimit the major soil areas. At one time an inland sea 1 extended over what is now Nebraska and beds of limestone, shale, and sandstone were deposited therein. Following these depositions, the sea floor was elevated forming land, which was subjected to erosion. Later, formations of clay, silt, and sand were washed onto western and northern Nebraska from the high - lands to the west forming broad table lands. Soil building and erosion continued with the formation of valleys and terraces. The most far reaching effects, however, resulted from glaciation. Although only the two first ice sheets, the Nebraskan and Kansan, ex - tended into eastern Nebraska, directly modifying the land, the five glacial epochs had a marked effect through their influence on the climate. Soil building and erosion proceeded with the advance and recession of the five glaciers. The two glaciers extending into eastern Nebraska formed drift sheets up to 100 or more feet in thickness. Streams were diverted to the southward and thick sand and gravel formations were laid down in the south Platte country immediately west of the glacial drift area. - . Following the third and fourth glacial epochs, extensive deposits of wind blown or loessial material covered the terraces, hills, and up - land plains of eastern and southern Nebraska. These deposits ranged from a few inches to 100 or more feet in thickness. The first or Love - land deposit was of reddish color. In many places this was capped with the gray or buff-colored second or Peorian deposit. These two loess formations are frequently exposed in the road cuts of the loess hill areas (Fig. 3 and 4). A number of our most productive soils have been formed on this wind blown material. The climatic condi - tions under which these soils have developed were sufficiently great to Justify their differentiation into several soil series on the basis of the soil profile and other characteristics. 1 Condra, G.

Photo through courtesy of G. E. Condra. The glacial drift area extends over and into several of the south - eastern counties. It is bounded on the north and east by a narrow border of loess hills and on the west by the loess plains. The loess areas, in general, occupy the region between the glacial drift' hills and the sand hills. These areas extending from through the Republican Valley Region in the southwest to the extreme north - east are as follows: (1) Keith-Colby, (2) Holdrege-Colby, (3) the loess plains dominated by the Crete-Hastings soils with the Scott- Bulter-Fillmore soils in the poorly drained depressions, (4) Marshall- Knox, and (5) Moody-Crofton. The Colby, Knox, and Crofton soils may be considered as the eroded phases of the more level, productive Keith, Holdrege, Marshall, and Moody soils. The sand hills form the largest single topographic and soil region in Nebraska. These sands which shift in dune formation were develop- </seg>
            <seg id="p137">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION ■ed from the underlying parent material. Between the sand hills and the northeastern loess hills is a large area known as the mixed soil region. The western table lands form another extensive region. In this area residual soils have been developed on the under-lying bedrock which is generally found at depths of several feet but is frequently exposed. Problem Areas. Hedges and Elliott, in Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 244, Types of Farming in Nebraska, have delimited the rather definite type of farming areas and point out the close asso - ciation between these farming areas and soils, topography, and climate. In general, Nebraska farmers recognize the importance and limitations of these soil and climatic factors and have adjusted their operations And land-use accordingly. There are, however, a number of areas where serious and extensive land-use problems occur. These problem areas are shown on the accompanying map (Fig. 5). All land within these areas is not to be considered problem land. Likewise, there is land in the non-problem areas that may be subject to just as serious mis-use as land in the problem areas. It should be borne in mind, therefore, that mal-adjustments or land-use problems as it effects in - dividuals may be just as great without problem areas as within. It is to be observed that there is considerable similarity between the problem and topographic or soil areas. The problem areas were tentatively located through use of the county soil survey maps and the per cent farm area under cultivation as determined on a precinct or township basis. It was thus possible to determine in a general way and delimit those areas where the percentage area under cultivation was too high in relation to inherent productivity and maintenance of soil resources. In a number of instances, these boundaries were changed slightly after completing field surveys, obtaining the opinions and experiences of qualified and interested people, and in the light of such other informations as was available. The areas shown on the map will be discussed briefly with respect to type of problem and desired adjustments. There are several large areas in Nebraska, particularly the glacial drift and loess hills, which are subject to serious actual and potential water erosion. These areas indicated by the horizontal barring in eastern, central, and southern Nebraska cover approximately 25,000 square miles or one-third of the state. Not all land included is subject to erosion but erosion problems are extensive throughout the areas. The Soil Erosion Service has re - cently completed a reconnaissance survey of these areas with respect to type, degree and extent of erosion. The results of this survey will </seg>

            <seg id="p139">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION soon be available. The extent, the .rapidity, and the seriousness of the loss of virgin fertility is not generally realized. Observation of the eroded slope land and its crop producing qualities, however, will readily convince one that erosion is a very serious problem. If not controlled, the eroded areas will increase in both extent and degree. The two eastern areas, comprise some of the most valuable agri - cultural land in the state and undoubtedly justify erosion control methods as such rather than marked retirement of land from cultiva - tion. The problem is more serious in the drift hill area of southeast Nebraska because of the underlying clay pan sub-soil. This clay pan has very undesirable tilth qualities when it is exposed by erosion. In the northeast loess hill area, however, the tilth remains in a relatively better condition after the surface has been eroded. The glacial drift problem area as shown on the map includes the bordering loess hills on the east and north which with respect to erosion problems are more comparable to the loess hills of northeast Nebraska. Proper farm management, including extensive growing of sweet clover on eroding land, contour and strip farming, gully control, and limited terracing may be sufficient to properly control erosion in the greater portion of the northeast loess hill area. Much of the drift hill area, however, will require extensive terracing and retirement of a relatively greater proportion of the land from cultivation together with the other erosion control measures. The loess hill regions of south central and central Nebraska form two similar and extensive problem areas. Large areas of soil mapped in the county surveys as Colby, rolling phase of the Holdrege, Nuckolls, and Marshall are subject to serious water erosion. The line between the northeast and central loess hill areas has been drawn more or less arbitrarily yet a marked difference exists between the two areas. Gullying and erosion are more severe in the central areas even though the rainfall gradually decreases from east to west. Due to the fact that clover and other soil improvement crops do relatively less well and that general productivity decreases with decrease in rainfall, erosion control assumes a different aspect as between the eastern and central areas. It would appear logical that relatively more of the eroding land in the central areas should be re - tired from cultivation as a means of erosion control. On the other hand the difficulty of re-establishing grasses in such areas must be considered. The soils which are subject to erosion in the central areas form from 25 to 62 per cent of the area within the various counties. The Colby series is one of the most extensive soils in the south central </seg>
            <seg id="p140">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE area and in the western part of the central area. It may be regarded as an eroded phase of the Keith and Holdrege soils and as erosion continues the Colby areas extend further into these areas. In some places it occupies rather continuous bodies and in others narrow strips along drainage ways. The Marshall series with the Knox as the seri - ously/eroded phase occur extensively in the eastern part of the central area. . The greater part of these two loess hill regions range from rolling to hilly or broken and a large part of the rolling land and even the steeper slopes are under cultivation resulting in severe erosion. Approximately 70 per cent of the land is under cultivation in the eastern counties and in some townships it exceeds 80 per cent. The per cent of land under cultivation decreases to the westward and aver - ages from 40 to 50 per cent in the western counties. Wherever possible, the steeper slopes and eroding land of the cultivated areas should be returned to grass. This will be difficult to accomplish, particularly in the south central area, since there are no adapted cultivated grasses. If the land is left uncultivated, the native grasses will gradually be - come re-established. Over-grazing should be avoided in order to hold erosion to a minimum under grassland conditions. Project No. 16 of the Soil Erosion Service is located in Boone and Nance counties near the eastern end of the central Loess Hill Area. Work under way on this project involves diversion of water from gullies, terracing with parallel grass strips, contour farming with a prescribed rotation, and retirement from cultivation of the steeper slopes and seriously eroded land. This area covers 70,000 acres and based on progress as of present date 12 per cent or more of the tilled land will be retired from cultivation. This project which is intended primarily as an educational and demonstrational project is indicative of the changes that must be made over much of the glacial and loess hill areas if soil resources and a permanent and economic agriculture are to be maintained. Where slopes are too steep to permit terracing or inherent productiveness does not justify such expenditures, a relatively greater proportion of the cultivated land should be returned to grass in order to maintain and build up fertility and cheek expansion of the eroding area. Next to the water erosion problems of the loess and glacial drift hill areas! the most extensive and some of the most serious land-use prob - lems occur in the sandy soils within and bordering the sandhills and in the sandy soil areas to the east of the main sandhill region. Wind erosion in these areas is a frequent and serious problem. The Sand Hills, the largest region within Nebraska, are not in the main considered problem areas. In general they are being devoted to </seg>
            <seg id="p141">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION their most effective use, which is that of grazing. They should be con - sidered, however, as potential problem areas since mis-use through over-grazing or cultivation would soon become very serious not only within the area affected but also through shifting of the sands to adjoining areas. The main problems of mal-adjustment of agriculture connected with the Nebraska sand hills are around its borders where the crop enter - prises of adjacent successful territory have made invasion. Four such areas covering approximately 5300 square miles have been de - limited wherein cultivation is undoubtedly being practiced too ex - tensively and where over-grazing is rather common.

A similar transition area extends from Cherry county through Garden county along the western border of the Sand Hills. The fourth area extends across the northern part of Brown and Rock counties.

            <seg id="p142">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Sand Hill townships lying entirely without the problem areas. These relatively unproductive sandy soils, particularly those subject to wind erosion should be returned to grass and over-grazing avoided. The more productive of them, if handled in a manner to prevent erosion, may be most effectively used for producing feed crops. Four additional areas covering approximately 4000 square miles and containing a relatively large proportion of sandy and gravelly soils have been delimited. One such area extends from Buffalo into Platte county. The other three areas are contiguous, the one extend - ing from Stanton into Holt county, the second centering in northern Holt county and the third lying between the Niobrara and Keyepaha rivers. The sands range from small isolated areas of dune sand through the fine sandy loams of several soil series involving lowland, terrace, and upland soils. Excessive drainage due to underlying coarse sands and gravels is of common occurrence. Due to the fact that soil types dif - fering widely in their crop adaptabilities are more or less intermingled and commonly associated with excessive drainage, a detailed land-use survey of these areas would be desirable prior to estimating the type or extent of adjustments. It would appear, in view of the rela - tively large areas of unproductive sandy soils and the per cent area under cultivation at the present time, that considerable of the land now under cultivation, especially that subject to severe wind -erosion, should be returned to grass. The area lying north of the Niobrara and Keyepaha rivers In Knox, Boycl, and Keya Paha counties, has been designated as a problem area because of the generally rolling to hilly topography and clayey soils developed on underlying Pierre shale, guch soils, because of eros on and tilth qualities, are not well suited to cultivation. In addi - tion it is frequently difficult to obtain good well water. Land under cultivation in 1933 ranged from 30 to 60 per cent for the various precincts. This is undoubtedly too high in view of the soil resources and considerable of the area should be permanently retired from cultivation. Three contiguous areas, involving approximately 1800 square miles, have been delimited in the extreme northwestern corner of the state. These areas may be described briefly as follows: The area to the north consists of Pierre soils overlying Pierre shale. The soils are generally unsuited for tilling and the land Is used largely for grazing purposes. Unless the areas under cultivation can be used effectively for producing feed crops, they should be returned to grass. The water supply is very limited and frequently becomes a problem in holding livestock within the area. The only solution appears that </seg>
            <seg id="p143">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION of building reservoirs sufficient to conserve the flood waters for such purposes. The intermediate area consists of bad lands, broken land, and soils of several series. In addition there are small areas of Pierre soils extending in from the main Pierre area to the north. Aside from, rather extensive bodies of Dawes silt loam and Rosebud very fine sandy loam in Dawes county, the soils in this area occur for the most part in relatively small intermingled areas. A considerable portion ot the total, especially of the Dawes and Rosebud soils, is now under culti - vation. Due to the heterogenity of soils, the region as a whole should be considered primarily as a livestock area. General retirement of grain farming would appear desirable and tillable soils suited for the production of feed crops should be combined, in the main, with live - stock, units. The third area consists of the rough broken land forming the Pine Ridge Escarpment and the bordering rolling grassland. It is domin - ated by rock outcrops and rather thin soil and is without value for cultivation excepting scattered irregular areas. Much of the area is covered with a variable and open pine tree growth. Aside from the scattered areas under cultivation, it is used almost entirely for grazing purposes. In view of the fact that this is Nebraska's most potential forest and park area, it would appear desirable to place it under organized management. A small area comprising approximately 435 square miles has been delimited immediately north of Snake Creek in Sioux and Box Butte counties. The soils in this area consist primarily of Rosebud loamy - fine sand and Rosebud very fine sandy loam with a relatively large proportion mapped as shallow phase. Approximately 25 per cent of the area was under cultivation in 1933 largely as exclusive grain farms. It came under cultivation within recent years as a marginal development of the successful Box Butte table. Its center Is about thirty miles from the nearest market and excepting to the east, it is surrounding by grazing territory. It would appear desirable to com - bine the grain units with grazing units and return such land to grass as is not required for producing feed crops. A number of Nebraska irrigation projects have serious over-capital - ization, water right, seepage, and land-use problems. Most of the projects are centered in the North Platte valley. The Whitney project of Dawes county may be cited as a project lying without this area. A detailed economic and land-use survey should be made of those projects having serious problems. This will be necessary before adjustment phases can be considered effectively. A rough, broken, gravelley and sandy area covering approximately </seg>
            <seg id="p144">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ■I 1500 square miles has been located along and to the south of the North Platte river. Included in this area are the Epping soils of Pump - kin Creek Valley which are developed on Brule clay. A characteristic feature of these soils is the parent Brule clay which generally lies from three to five feet below the surface and occasionally within the plow layer resulting in droughty soils unsuited to cultivation. The sands range from Dune through the very fine sandy loams of several series. The various soil types generally occur in relatively small areas and are more or less intermingled. Much of the area is being devoted to its most effective use, that of grazing. The per cent of the land under cultivation, however, in townships lying wholly within the area is as high as 25 per cent. Much of it is to be looked upon as marginal development of the successful Kimball, Dalton and Chap - pell tables to the south. Various, more or less isolated, areas may be well suited to cultivation but there is a tendency to cultivate land which should have remained in grass. Where possible such land should be returned to grass and the farm or ranch units properly balanced with respect to tilled and grazing land. An area of about 500 square miles of thin residual soils has been outlined in Kimball and Cheyenne counties. This area is undulating to rolling with frequent rock outcrops. As high as 4 0 per cent of the area of certain precincts was under cultivation in 1933. The rather frequent idle fields suggest that much of this land is not suited to economic grain farming that it should be returned to grass. Natural re-vegetation of the grasses is slowly occuring in the idle fields. T Although the land-use adjustments proposed in connection with the problem areas have been considered primarily from the viewpoint of maintaining soil resources, they would also undoubtedly tend to Increase economic stability and efficiency. Adjustments to properly bring about these conditions will in many instances involve increasing the size of Individual units and obtaining the proper balance between arable and non-arable land. This could be- most effectively done by disregarding section lines and following or crossing contour and soil lines as necessary to form properly balanced units. The proposed adjustments will also generally involve changes in the crop and live - tock enterprises and should be undertaken only after careful consider - ation of economic and other related factors. Inter- Settlement Areas. A second phase of the Federal Land Program calls for re-locating those people released by any land adjustment program that may be undertaken, providing they wish to continue farming. It is not be - lieved, that, under existing economic conditions, any great amount of inter-settlement In Nebraska would be advisable unless it is accom- </seg>
            <seg id="p145">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION panied by a change in enterprise. The trend is generally toward larger operating units. This increase in size has been attributed primarily to the increased effectiveness of man labor made possible through the use of larger machinery and greater diversification. u Farm account studies conducted by the Department of Rural Economics and the Agricultural Extension Service indicate the most profitable size of farm in southeastern Nebraska is about 240 acres. According to the 1030 Census and the 1933 corn-hog program data, the average size of farm for this area is between 170 and 180 acres. It is obvious therefore, that any great amount of inter-settlement in - volving the general farm enterprise would not be desirable. It is be - lieved that similar conditions will hold for other areas. Two areas have been delimited on the intersettlement map, (Fig. 7) however, wherein a limited amount of inter-settlement might be econ - omically sound provided a change in the existing enterprise is made permitting a reduction in size of unit and thus an increase in total number of units. Area A is in the Loess hills along the Missouri and Platte rivers where fruit production may merit more extensive development. Orch - arding units average considerably smaller in size than general farming units and their extension would permit of a certain amount of inter - settlement. Unfortunately the establishment of productive tree fruits requires several years and they should be supplemented by plantings of small fruits. Vegetable crops for canning purposes may be inter - planted among the tree fruits during the early years to increase the income until the orchard comes into bearing. A careful study should be made of moisture utilization by tree crops to determine the per - manency and productiveness of such crops where they must depend altogether on rainfall. Area B lies along the middle and Lower Platte and Missouri river valleys and similar areas wherein more extensive production of certain vegetable crops for canning purposes might prove economically desir - able. In order to remove the hazards from such enterprises, however, it would be necessary to be very selective as to soil type and provide satisfactory moisture conditions either through surface or sub-irriga - tion.. It would be necessary also to develop proper market facilities. In addition to the above, an extension of specialized units, such as poultry, merit further consideration. Inter-settlement possibilities in Nebraska appear economically more desirable in connection with a number of areas where supplemental irrigation may be feasible rather than in the established productive farming sections of the eastern part of the state. </seg>

Conclusions The proposed adjustments should be undertaken only after care - ful consideration has been given to a planned state and national economy. It would appear logical to assume that total physical pro - duction will be decreased in those problem areas wherein the units will be increased in size and a considerable proportion of the area retired from cultivation. On the other hand, production will probably be in - creased in areas where erosion is brought under control without marked retirement of land from cultivation and in the inter-settlement areas. It is possible, therefore, that total physical production for the state may be increased, unless it would be desirable to hold it under control by 'cooperative efforts in retiring additional land from cultivation. Net income, assuming proper balance of production and demand, will be increased to the extent that the adjustments increase the efficiency of production, i MAKING THE MOST OP NEBRASKA J. E. LAWRENCE, Editor — Lincoln Star For one shuddering second I thot Mr. Anderson was going to con - demn the program I have been interested in. I assume I am here primarily because of my connection with the public works program in the state. As I listened to Mr. Anderson discuss the purposes of the soil study made here and the uses of soil in this state, I couldn't help recalling the spectacle that is unfolded before most of us in Nebraska in the last 20 years. For all practical purposes it seems to me you may select the year 1916 as a very fair year in which to compute what we call normal agricultural trends within this state. </seg>
            <seg id="p148">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE We find from our compilations by the statistical bureau maintained both by the state and federal government that in 1916 we had ap - proximately 15,665,000 acres of land under cultivation within Ne - braska. Now that figure does not include the land devoted to the tame hay crop. Twelve years later, in 1928 to be specific, we had slightly in excess of 18,000,000 acres of land under cultivation in Ne - braska, or we had) an increase within that period of 3,0000,00 acres. Practically every for a short time was urging that more land be brought under cultivation. During the time economic factors were increasing the temptation to bring submarginal land under production. We had an increase of 2,500,000 acres. I question if there is a state in the union which can say to itself that all during that peculiar period starting with the World war, running on for nearly 10 years after, less land, less submarginal land, according to comparative figures, was brought under cultivation than right here in the state of Nebraska. I am here primarily to speak a word of defense of our agriculture within Nebraska. I am here primarily to speak a word of defense because I felt that the facts are too little known. As I discovered that those facts were too little known, I tried to argue certain fundamental facts which are necessary to sustain an economically sound agriculture. I mention 1928 as the year when we reached the peak time of 18, - 000,&lt;&gt;00 acres of cultivated land. Beginning in 1930, if you study what actually took place within this state, you see a most absorbing story. Within four years time, two under what we called the Hoover farm program, two administrations actually reduced the cultivated area of land within Nebraska to the extent of three and one-half million acres, so that entering 1934 we came to this situation. We had less actually cultivated land within this state than we had in 1916. We had effected a reduction of 33 1-3 per cent in the one crop which proved most irrit - ating, and that was wheat. We were planting less corn, and actually those 2% million acres which are reflected in figures could be credited to new industries, sugar beets, commercial fruits. So I say that is the primary picture of agriculture unfolding before our eyes within the last 20 years. Some Mistakes in Land Policy. I think if you stop for philosophical reflections you will recognize that when Moses Kinkaid, congressman of the old sixth district, ap - peared in congress and asked for the amendment to the original home - stead act, raising the acreage from 160 to 640, that so far as the western half of this state is concerned, and for many other areas, you had conditional notice from congress itself that the rich valley lands, the more choice soil where the farmer might hope to win a competence, support his family, meet life safely, had passed, and we were going </seg>
            <seg id="p149">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION into a less fertile section In the hope that 640 acres would provide that competence. Now all of that took place, homes were established, and sections of western Nebraska were broken up. I have ridden thru that section many times, and speculated on the disappointment that came to people who had to live upon sub-marginal land. As I reflect upon this problem that is distinctly a Nebraska problem, speaking to you as men interested in agriculture, may I say that my interest starts pri - marily from a selfish one, yet I think a decently selfish one, and I have come to the conclusion that as a state our only hope rests in the success of farming. I have come to the conclusion that after 50 or 60 years which represents most of the time which rural sections form, we are approach - ing a crisis. The program which we tried to present thru the public works with indifferent success was a program tending, I believe, to insure the future in Nebraska. Without it, I think we may soon ex - perience within possibly 20 - 25 years, some of the fate that has be - fallen old eastern sections. Mr. Anderson recalls I asked the national resources board for the map reflecting the soil study they have made back in Washington. Let me present a picture which may be fantastic and may not be found - ed on sound observations, but in pleading for those steps designed de - liberately to preserve and serve the soil within this region, I believe we can say with wisdom and with vision, looking ahead to normal popula - tion increase within the next 25 - 50 and 65 years, and after all that is planning in its highest sense, our region Xhat starts with the west bank of the Mississippi and ends with the foohills of the Rockies, rep - resents the last remaining agricultural domain where the production of food stuffs can be carried on cheaply and economically. Water, Grass and Soil-Maintenance. Now you take on this particular map where you indicate the Tri - county project. We say that a certain amount of that area should be returned to grasses and with that there can be no controversy, but the problem of returning these lands to grasses is not a simple one by any means. These lands, much of them in the Tri-county area, despite every effort of man to return them to grasses, can not be re - turned to grass without abundant supplies of water, and that is the reason that the project is there. There isn't a single unit, starting with the Republican and Arikaree in the southwestern part of the state, reaching to the Frenchman, going up to Blue creek beyond, reaching over the Middle and North Loup, — there isn't a single acre in that area — where it is proposed at all in this program for Nebraska, that the production of grain crops representing the old time surplus shall be increased inasmuch as it is humanly possible. That program is de- </seg>
            <seg id="p150">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE signud to return the land to grasses, to enrich them, preserve them, and conserve them. I said what perhaps you thot was a drastic statement. It is a difficult thing to put your hand on this section of Nebraska, and thru the stretch of years say that the declining fertility with a variant rain - fall that we have in all these sections of Nebraska, represents a steadily declining productivity of the average farm, and yet those of us who have lived in this state and have watched agriculture have seen that taking place. We think we see in the eastern counties, where we have say, 27 inches of rainfall, continuous cropping of the same grain has reduced the fertility of the soil until today in the case of wheat, the average is somewhere between 3 and 4 bushels less than it was in an earlier period. Importance of Wntcr. We see that corn, except in unusual years, on the average does not produce so well. Then we go out thru this central portion, the Tri - county area, designed to be one of the most marvelous farming regions to be found any place in the United States. You can stand there on the bluff in Midway canyon, on a high elevation of the proposed site of the Plum Creek Reservoir, and you can look 20 miles away, level as a table, deep and rich soil, and then your geologist, continuing his study, will show and demonstrate to you convincingly that all of that area has been cropped so continuously that legumes have been taken from the soil, and after you go to a depth of 10-15 feet you find hard dustj dust so light that if you simply place it in the air it will float away as smoke. Now to my mind that presents a distinct problem. I do not in any way disparage the value of soil study or soil value. Had we had an opportunity for that work years ago we would have been in a tremend - ously improved condition in agriculture in the state of Nebraska. My only jword to you today tho is I realize there is a tremendous misunder - standing on the water question within the state of Nebraska. We encountered it in our earlier work. We found one valley arrayed against another; one section of the state arrayed against another section; but if I can say anything of value to you at all, it is simply this. Whether it is North Dakota, or South Dakota, or Minnesota, or Wyoming, or Iowa, or Nebraska, jointly those boards entrusted with public works found one similar condition, and that was a steadily declining water table. In certain areas of the state it had dropped 18-20 feet. In other sections the drop had been more pronounced. One member of the North Dakota board took on the office as governor of the state — Tom Moody. One of Mr. Moody's interesting studies was the study of the lake regions of North Dakota, and in Washington, </seg>
            <seg id="p151">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION he stated the astounding fact that within the last ten years by actual survey It was demonstrated that 3500 lakes had disappeared from those three states, the two Dakotas and Minnesota. They say to us, that happened before all thru the prairie country, these water levels come back. Perhaps they will. Perhaps we are un - necessarily alarmed. Perhaps those lakes in Minnesota at the present time which are down 8 to 10 feet, five years from now will be back to their old level. This last summer I stood on the shore line of one. The cottage I occupied less than 20 years ago was on the edge of the water. Today the water is one-half mile away, and the lake is 8 feet lower in depth than it was then. So I say from an agricultural stand - point in making the most of Nebraska, I heartily endorse these pro - grams that look toward the conservation of water. Erosion A Threat. Those soil erosion projects referred to by the speaker just preceding are magnificent pieces of work. But such little details enter in. Here is the hillside. Because it is easier to plow down instead of plowing around, a natural channel is provided for water to rush off furiously during a storm. We went into the North Loup section. I remember one old pioneer say there, speaking to me of a thing I had observed because I had visited that section some 25 years ago, that on most of the hay flats in the North Loup in the fall and early spring, you could walk along and your hunting boots would have water in them. Speaking to us, he said never a spring came but what all the flats were level sheets of water. So we build good roads. I think good roads are necessary. I also think they provided the most natural drainage system of any device brought in — grading, graveling, concrete highways, and the storm creek. They send the water rushing. In this valley where I have lived most of my life, he said, 20 years ago we had a disastrous flood. We straightened that stream, dredged it out. We had a much heavier rain two or three years ago in this particular locality, and the new channel carried the water off without any difficulty. So I say to you what I have been saying to audiences thruout the state within the last year and a half. We have drained our swamps and reclaimed the land, and we thot we were doing a smart job while we were doing it. We have built our highways and they have served us usefully, yet at the same time we set before us a factor which has been a tremendous influence in determining the water policy in the state. We have gone all thru these steps and I hope it will be the opin - ion of enlightened agriculture in this state, which has been well di - rected, that in the next few years at least, we will retrace our steps and </seg>
            <seg id="p152">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE we (will begin building some of these reservoirs that your last speaker spoke about, for the conservation of water. There are only two things to preserve soil. I think you will agree with me. The first one is a primary one. It is water. The second one is grass. Now entirely aside from our own state, to me one of the most fascinating things that has been happening in Europe has been the complete reversal of an age old policy over there. Europe knew the value of preserving soil, sustaining grass, of keeping areas that should not be cultivated out of cultivation. You have been worry - ing about the fact that Europe, for the last five years at least, has been producing even larger amounts of wheat than we have throuout the United States, not counting in Russia's figures because their figures have not been available. There we see the change, when a dictator is mounting a throne. We see, for example, in Italy, Mussolini de - creeing that Italy shall produce a sufficient amount of wheat to feed her population. One of the marvels of all times was that on the hill - sides, on rocky slopes in that land, they stepped up the wheat from 150j million bushels to 300,000,000 bushels to put the country on a selfsupporting basis. You will not be worried about that very long because if the experience of this state or other states is a criterion, in - tensive cultivation, super-induced by artificial fertilizer, means that our problem of France and Germany in wheat production will cease before many years. But in this state we have only one problem. "We have only one resource. In arguing these cases so frequently I have referred to your agriculture. Here is Kansas directly to the south. Kansas, at the time we were withdrawing two and one-half million acres of wheat from production, brought in five million of acres or two million acres more than we actually had in wheat, and on top of that there is Kansas pro - ducing 77 million annual in minerals, and across the river is Iowa. For the same year Iowa was producing 116 million. We have no in - dustries except those which are based on agriculture. Ninety per cent of all of the production of factories come, so far as the raw material is concerned, from the farm. So I say that agriculture is our salvation in Nebraska. Here is the old state of Ohio. Just about 100 years ago people were pouring down thru the Cumberland Gap. They were settling what we called "Kaintuck", Tennessee, and they were pushing across the river intOj Ohio, and they were felling the forests. They were carving out farms, and they cultivated that soil for just about 80 to 100 years, and I think you can readily imagine what the plight of Ohio with her 6 million people would be if the people of Ohio were compelled to live from the wealth that comes from those worn-out farms. </seg>
            <seg id="p153">NEBRASKA CHOP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION It probably won't be during your lifetime or mine, unless such soil studies as have been read to you are followed, unless the program of conservation of water is pushed progressively, intelligently by the people of this state, I say to you that the problem which would have been Ohio's had they not turned to industry, some day will be the problem of this state. THREE TRENDS TO RE CONSIDERED IN RELATION TO A LAND USE PROGRAM By O. E. BAKER, Senior Agricultural Economist, U. S. Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Agricultural Economics, Division of Land Economics, Washington, D. C. In considering a land use program it will be well to keep in mind the probable continuation of three trends: 1. Advances in agricultural technique. 2. Depletion of soil resources. 3. Decline in the birth rate. These trends are not new. Each has been in progress for more than a century. But these trends have now reached a critical stage and appear likely to influence profoundly not only the future of Am - erican agriculture, but also the welfare of the Nation. Let us con - sider the situation: 1. Progress in Agricultural Technique. A century ago about three-fourths of the population "gainfully employed", to use the Census phrase, were, apparently, engaged in agriculture. By 1870, when the first adequate occupation census was taken, this proportion had been reduced to 54 per cent. (See Figure 8). In 1930 less than 22 per cent of the gainfully employed were engaged in agriculture. During the century the proportion of the people de - pendent on non-agricultural employment increased three-fold. Pro - duction per worker engaged in agriculture concurrently increased three - fold, perhaps more. This release of labor from agriculture and its employment in mak - ing the many things and rendering the various services that people de - sire was made possible by progress in agricultural technique, parti - cularly in the application of power to the cultivation of the land. Primarily the rise in the standard of living which has occurred in a large proportion of the urban population was promoted by this tech- </seg>

Until about 1920 these rural youth, as well as urban youth, found increasing employment in manufacturing, mining, trade and transportation, clerical work and the various personal and pro - fessional services. But soon after 1920 a decline started also in the proportion of the population engaged in mining and in manufacturing and mechanical pursuits. As a consequence trade and clerical work and the various services absorbed many of the y?» n K P e °Ple no longer needed in the basic productive industries. Between 1910 and 1930 the number of persons engaged in trade and clerical services, considered jointly, almost doubled, while the population of the Nation increased only one-third. . Will these trends continue, or must more young people find employment in the basic productive industries, particularly in agriculture? Since the birthrate is highest among the farming people and lowest among the professional, clerical and business groups, the direction of occupational development will have a profound effect upon the future population of the Nation. •..• Jt £ ra P n above is adopted from a diagram prepared by Ralph S. Hurlin and Meredith B.

Migration from the farms to the cities has been the inevitable re - sult of this progress in agricultural technique and of the relatively high birthrate in the farm population, on the one hand, and develop - ment of the factory system of production and of railroad and steamship transportation, on the other hand. For a half century, and perhaps longer] from one-quarter to one-half of the rural youth has migrated to the cities. During the decade of urban prosperity 1920-1930 the net migration from farms exceed 6,000,000. (Figure 9.) About a third of these migrants were under 15 years of age and more than a third were 16 to 25 years of age. These young people were fed, clothed, educated, and supplied to the cities ready for a productive life practi- </seg>

During the decade 1920-1930 only about 40 per cent of the young people who started to work in the factories, stores, and offices of the cities were born and brought up in the cities. Forty per cent came from the rural regions and 20 per cent were immigrants from abroad. jWtt-^^APPROXIMATE NET MIGRATION OF RURAL FARM POPULATION «=W I ffi e 77"~— ~-^ __ January 1, 1920 -April 1. 1930 «~ CH from farms- WMt onf Htaro V ,— » «_J-Z!Lt- *i ~ v "'~\. «"»*»«»■»■■■* Fig. 9 — About 60 per cent of the net migration from the farms during the decade 1920-1930 was from the South. Negroes constituted one-third of this migration from Southern farms. A majority of these migrants were between 15 and 30 years of age. The birth rate is high among Southern rural people and economic opportunity is less than in the North. If it costs only $2,000 in the South to rear and educate a child to the age of fifteen ($135 a year and no allowance for interest), these 3,600,000 migrants from farms in the Southern States represent a contribution roughly of $7,000,000,000 made during the decade by the farm population of the South to other parts of the Nation, mostly to the cities. Map from "Recent Social Trends," 1933, published by Mc- Graw-Hill Book Company. The cost of this contribution which the farming people have made to the productivity and prosperity of the cities, suburbs, and villages is greater than is commonly recognized. If it costs $2,000 to $2,500 (at predepression prices) to rear and educate the average child on American farms to the age of 15, when he may be assumed to be self-support - ing, — and $150 a year does not seem an excessive estimate of the cost of food, clothing, medical services, education, and all the incidental expenses — then the 6,300,000 net migration from the farms during the decade 1920-30 represents a contribution of about $14,000,000,000. This contribution is almost equal to the value of the wheat crops plus half that of the cotton crops during these years. Nor is this all. When the farmer and his wife grow old and die, the estate is divided among the children. During the decade 1920-30 about </seg>
            <seg id="p156">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE one-flfth of the farmers and their wives died, and their estates were distributed among the children. One-third or more of the children had moved to town, and those children who remained on the farm had to mortgage the farm in many cases to pay the brother and sisters who lived in the cities their share of the estate. A rough estimate indi - cates that between $3,000,000,000 and $4,000,000,000 was transferred from the farms to the cities and villages during the decade 1920-30 incident to the settlement of estates. Although it is not intended to draw up a balance sheet of rural - urban contributions, it is worthy of note, in passing, that there are great movements of farm wealth to the cities in addition to those in - cident to migration. Interest on debt paid to persons other than farm operators amounted to about $7,500,000,000 during the decade 1920 - 29, and rent paid to persons other than farm operators amounted to about $10,500,000,000. 'The total transfer from these four sources appears to have been about $35,000,000,000 during the decade, or $3, - 500,000,000 a year, which was about one-third of the average annual gross income of all farmers during the decade. This movement of wealth from the farms, mostly to the cities, helps to explain why the farm houses built in recent years in New England, MOVEMENT TO AND FROM FARMS, 1920-1933 ( BIRTHS AND DEATHS HOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT ) TH0USAHD5 I I I i l I I 1 i | | | ] 1 1920 '22 '2U '26 '28 '30 "32 - 3«* "36 Fig. 10— From 1922 to 1929 migration from the farms to the cities exceeded 2,000,000 each year-probably a larger movement than ever before in the Nation's history. These were prosperous years in the cities and rather hard times for agriculture. But during these years there were many people who returned to the farms. The new migra - tion from the farms during those 8 years averaged less than 800,000 annually, and it was much smaller during 1927, 1928 and 1929 than in the 5 years previous. In 1930, as the depression developed and jobs became scarce, the movement from farms dropped notably, while that to farms increased slightly. In 1931 and 1932 both movements de - clined, but the movement from farms declined faster. In 1933 the movement to farms decreased about 40 per cent; while that from farms increased somewhat, the first in - crease since 1926. In this year the movement from farms again exceeded the move - ment to farms. The graph is based on estimates made annually by Drs. Galpin and Manny, of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. </seg>

Wealth has not accumulated on the farms from generation to genera - tion, but has constantly been transferred to the cities. Moreover, in re - cent years not only has there been little or no accumulation of wealth on the farms, but it is probable also that the farmers have been get - ting deeper and deeper into debt. In many cases these debts have re - sulted in transfer of land ownership to urban residents, with con - sequent increase in farm tenancy. As the recent depression developed, the number of youth leaving the farms diminished, for work in the cities could not be found. In 1930, the first year of the depression, migration to and from farms about balanced. (Figure 10.) But by 1931 migration from the farms had decreased two-thirds of a million below the pre-depression level, while migration to the farms continued at the old level. In 1932 there was a further drop of nearly a half million in the number of migrants from farms, while migration to farms diminished only slightly. During 1931 and 1932 the farm population increased 750,000 by immigration in addition to about 900,000 excess of births over deaths. But in 1933 migration from the farms increased slightly, while that to the farms decreased greatly, with a resultant net migration from the farms of about 225,000. For 1934 early indications suggest that the two move - ments may again be about in balance. Most of these migrants from the farms in 1933 and 1934, however, were, apparently, people who had sought safety with rural relatives or friends during the depression, and now were able to resume their work in the cities, or to obtain aid from the civil works officials or the relief agencies. Relatively few, apparently, were young people going to the cities for the first time. Most of the young people remained "backed up" on farms. These young people will soon wish to establish homes of their own. If the net migration to the cities during the next 5 years balances the migration from the cities during the years 1930 to 1932, there would be over 2,000,000 more males over 20 years of age on farms in 1940 than there were in 1930; and if the proportion of males of these ages operating farms in 1940 is the same as in 1930, there would be over 1,000,000 more farms in the nation by 1940. This would mean in many cases the reoccupation of abandoned farms, in other cases clearing the forest and making new farms, in more cases, prob - ably, subdivision of farms, and in most cases, doubtless a lower stand - ard of living than existed prior to the depression. 1 See Crops &amp; Markets of Bureau of Agricultural Economics, Nov. 1932, p. 440; and July, 1927, p. 254. ; </seg>

Or •will there be a great increase of commuters who live on small "subsistence" farms or in villages, but work in the cities? It is impossible at present to answer these questions, but it is possible to say that there are trends in all three of these directions. Of this we can be sure, that from a strictly economic standpoint more farmers are not needed. Approximately half (49 per cent) of the farms in 1929, a fairly prosperous year, measured by post-war standards, produced less than $1,000 worth of products, including the milk, eggs, etc., contributed by the farm to the family living. (Figure 12). And these less productive half of the farms produced only about 12 per cent of the products "sold or traded" to use the Census phrase. Undoubtedly the other half of the farms, the more productive half, could readily produce this remaining 12 per cent, if prices of farm products afforded encouragement.

But this fourth of the farms contributed less than A per cent of the farm products sold or traded. Nearly half of the farms in 1929 produced less than $1,000 worth of products, but this least productive half of the farms contributed only about 11 per cent of the commercial production of the Nation. Undoubtedly the other half, the more productive farms, could within a . few years, readily produce this 11 per cent. Half the farms of the Nation are not needed to provide the city and other non-farm people with food and fibres. But the less productive half of the farms are supplying most of the children that migrate to the cities, and the cities will soon need people almost as much as food. But it is the least productive farms from the economic standpoint which have supplied more than half of the youth that have migrated to the cities, and the trend of the birthrate, particularly in the cities, </seg>
            <seg id="p160">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE suggests that the need for youth may soon be as great, if not greater, than' the need for food. This subject will be discussed later. Considering the fact that two of the major crops in the United States, cotton and corn, are still harvested by hand on most farms, in much the same way that they were a century ago, and that this is true In lesser degree of the fruits and vegetables, while machinery already exists which could reduce the cost of production if capital were avail - able for its purchase and the farms were large enough to use it effici - ently; considering also that fertilizers have been used on soils in only restricted portions of the country, and that vast improvements could be made in the productivity of the livestock thru better feeding and breeding, it seems safe to assume that progress in agricultural technique will continue. Yet while technique is advanced on the larger commercial farms, there may be a notable increase in the number of so j called "self - sufficing" farms, most of which are located in areas of hilly surface or on poor soils. Many of the people living on these little farms on poor land will try to maintain a decent standard of living, even if it in - volves getting deeper and deeper into debt. And this debt, in many cases, will result in transfer of the title to the land to urban creditors. Formerly tenancy tended to decrease on poor to fair land in long estab - lishing farming areas, notably in the northeastern states; but now it is increasing in many poor as well as in good agricultural areas, notably in the South. Tenants even more than owners tend to forget the future in their effort to make ends meet. And when farmers forget the future the fertility of the land declines. Even for farmers who are owners the^e is less incentive to prevent erosion and keep up the fertility of the land after the children have gone to town. The tenure of American farms is probably more transitory than that in any other nation in the world. This is true of farms operated by owners as well as of farms operated by tenants. So long as this condition continues the soil re - sources of the nation may be expected to decline. 2. Depiction of Soil Resources. For a half century acre-yields of the crops in the nation as a whole showed no significant trend up or down, until about two decades ago. During the World war crop yields dropped slightly and have not re - covered. (Figure 13). In 1932, 1933, and 1934 unprecedented drought had a devastating effect on agricultural production. These effects of drought, however, may be accentuated by the erosion of the surface soil in many areas, and depletion of the organic matter (humus) in the soil nearly everywhere. The subsoil is less capable of retaining moisture than the surface soil, and soils low in organic matter have a much lower moisture holding capacity than those which are well </seg>

It is worth noting, how - ever, that owing to drought in 1933 and 1934, the acre-yields were lower than in any year since 1881. The acre-yields of corn have trended downward during the last de - cade. During the last five years acre-yields averaged lower than in any preceding five years since the Civil War, though they were almost as low in 1890-1894. The acre yields of oats have been fairly well maintained, hut in 1933 and 1934 were the lowest on record. The acre-yields of cotton trended downward as the boll weevil extended its ravages, but in 1931 and 1933 were notably high. The average acre-yield of hay has in - creased, largely because of shifts from the less productive grasses to the more produc - tive legumes. In 1930, 1931, 1933 and 1934, however, yields were low. Up to the present the Improvement in agricultural technique, including the use of artificial fertilizers, have almost overcome the effects of soil erosion and leaching, and of crop removal upon crop - yields. The forces of the research and extension services in the state agricultural colleges and the Federal Department of Agriculture, plus the powerful aid of tha agricultural press, have nearly counter-balanced the forces tending toward depletion of soil fertility. But looking to the future, it is not certain that the farmers, with the aid of the various agencies, will be as successful as in the past in counteracting the effects of soil depletion upon acre-yields of the crops, considering the Nation as a whole, unless higher prices of farm products permit extensive use of fertilizer on the less erosive lands. For the depletion of soil fertility by erosion is advancing at an accelerating rate. The Secretary of Agri - culture in his annual report for 1933 makes the following statement: "Unrestrained soil erosion is rapidly building a wilderness of worn - out land in the United States. The wastage speeds up with the removal of the absorptive top soil down to the less absorptive, more erosive </seg>
            <seg id="p162">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE subsoil. Approximately 35,000,000 acres of formerly cultivated land have been essentially destroyed for crop production; 100,000,000 acres of land now in crops have lost all or most of the topsoil; 125,000,000 acres of land now in crops are rapidly losing topsoil; and an additional area is suffering from erosion in some degree." These figures indicate that an area equal to nearly one-tenth the present crop area of the United States has been destroyed, so far as crop production is concerned, by erosion, that about one-quarter of the present crop land has lost all or most of the topsoil, while a third is rapidly losing its topsoil. It may help to visualize the extent of the destruction to note that the 35,000,000 acres already rendered un - tillable are greater in area than all the crop and pasture land of Great Britain and more than twice that of Japan; the area is equal to all the crop land and plowable pasture of New England, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,, Maryland, and Delaware. Erosion has been most severe, however, in the South, owing in part to the fact that the two dominant crops, cotton and corn, are intertilled, which results not only in exposure of the soil to the rain and wind during most of the season, but also in lowering the organic matter in the soil, and organic matter is very important in retarding erosion. (Figure 14). In addition, the rainfall is heavier in the South than in the North, and as the soil is not frozen nor covered with snow during most of the winter, erosion can occur throughout the year. In Oklahoma a recent survey revealed that of the 16,000,000 acres of crop land in the State (including land which was formerly in crops) nearly 6,000,000 acres had reached the stage of gullying, and that about 1,400,000 acres had been abandoned largely because of erosion. 1 There was a decrease of over 10,000 farms in south central and south eastern Oklahoma between 1920 and 1930, and of almost as many more in north central and north eastern Texas, where erosion is also becoming severe. It is the opinion of the experiment station workers in Oklahoma that fully two-thirds of the erosion losses in this State have occurred during the last ten years. In the Piedmont of Georgia and the Carolinas erosion has been in progress for a much longer period. Dr. Bennett, of the Soil Erosion Service, states that "probably not less than 60 per cent of the upland . . . has lost from 4 to 18 inches of its soil and subsoil . . . (and) many of the gullies have cut down to bed rock."* In the Georgia and South Carolina portions of the Piedmont area depletion of soil fertility, in association with the advance of the boll - weevil and other factors, has exerted a devastating effect. The num - ber of farms in the area decreased 50,000 between 1920 and 1930. In seme counties nearly half the farm population migrated to tht </seg>

Undoubtedly erosion was a factor also in inducing migration in much of North Carolina and Virginia, in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Arkansas, and even in parts of Missouri, southern Iowa, and Illinois. In Illinois, there are at least 9,000,000 acres of low value land subject to serious erosion, more than one-half of which is hardly suitable for cultivated crops, and there are more than 14,000.000 acres of high value land in which erosion is gradually approaching a stage where gullies are being formed. 4 On these eroding soils the tendency is toward self-sufficing farming. Less and less surplus remains for sale. A surplus of population, how - ever, persists. In times of urban prosperity much of this surplus has migrated to the cities. But during the depression many of these mi - grants have returned seeking shelter and sustenance with relatives or friends. The major portion of the recent movement back to the farm, apparently, has been to these poverty-stricken areas of depleted soilfer - tility, high birthrate, and dense population. As a result many coun - ties in these areas have over 50 per cent of their rural population on the relief rolls, and in a few counties the proportion exceeds 75 per cent. 3. Decline in Births The depletion of the human resources of the Nation, as measured by number of children born, has been more rapid, however, during the past decade than the depletion of natural resources. In 1924 the number of births in the Nation was nearly 2,900,000; in 1934 only about 2,200,000 children were born. The decline has been over 20 per cent. It is doubtful if the depletion of soil resources has been 10 per cent during the decade, perhaps not over 5 per cent. Every year during the past decade births have been fewer than in the year preceding, except in 1930 and, possibly, in 1934. From 1930 to 1933 the decline averaged 100,000 a year, but the consumation -in 1934 of marriages postponed during the depression, and probably also the widespread extension of relief, may result in a slight increase in births in 1934. But this rise will very probably be transitory, for the birthrate has been trending downward for more than a century, and at an ac - celerating, rate in recent years. (Figure 15).

From 1920 to 1930 the decline was over twice as rapid as in previous decades, except those ending in 1830, 1870, and 1890, when it is evident there was an abnormal under - numeration of young children. From 1930 to 1934 the decline was a'most as great as in any previous decade. The significant fact shown by the graph is that the declining birthrate is a long-time trend, and that the rate of decline has become more rapid in recent years. The uncertainty with reference to the continuation of the downward trend of the birthrate is that associated with the future direction of rural-urban migration. Everywhere within the European sphere of civilization the urban birthrate is much lower than the rural. In every State of the United States without exception the ratio of children under 5 years of age to women 15 to 45 years of age (childbearing age) was lower in the urban than in the rural population, and this was true also of every country of Europe for which statistics are avail - able, also for Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. In the United States in 1930, according to the Census, the number of children under 5 years of age in the large cities (those over 100,000 population) lacked nearly 20 per cent of being sufficient to maintain permanently the population of those cities without accessions from outside. In the smaller cities (those of 2,500 to 100,000 population) there was 6 to 8 per cent deficit. But in the rural non-farm population (village and small suburb population) there was a 30 per cent surplus of children, and in the farm population at 50 per cent surplus (Figure 16.) Urban </seg>

In 1930 the seven cities largely of American stock, represented in the top bar of the graph, lacked, therefore, about 38 per cent of having enough children to maintain their population permanently without accessions from outside, and all cities of over 100,000 population had a deficit of nearly 20 per cent, while the smaller cities had a deficit of about 6 per cent. On the other hand,! the rural nonfarm (mostly village and suburban) population had a surplus of 30 per cent, and the farm population a surplus of 50 per cent. In 1932 urban deficit and rural 'surplus about balanced. ■ The primary cause of the difference in birthrates between city and country is to be found, in my opinion, in the fact that the family is the economic unit in agriculture, whereas in modern urban industry and commerce the individual is the economic unit. In farming a wife is almost essential to success, and contributes notably to the family in - come, while children can help with the work and probably pay their way j in most cases from 10 years of age onward. Parents and chil - dren! are jointly concerned in the success of the enterprise. Moreover, mechanization has strengthened rather than weakened the integrity of the family farm. Among urban dwellers, on the other hand, the wife seldom increases the family income unless she works outside the home, in which case it is difficult to raise a family. Children are </seg>
            <seg id="p167">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION seldom self-supporting until high school age, and in many cases until marriage. Moreover, the family generally can not help in the work of husband and father, consequently the members of the family tend to have divergent interests. In addition, the cost of raising a child, particularly house rent and food, is much greater in the cities than on the farms. These differences in the economic situation between farm and city tend to be reflected in differences in ideals and customs. Business or professional prestige and social recognition are more readily ob - tainable through conspicuous expenditure in the city than in the country, and such expenditure reduces the funds available for raising a family. The lowest birthrate in the cities is among the business, clerical, and professional classes. Invariably a much higher birthrate is found among the unskilled labor groups. (Figure 17). The quali - tative aspect of the declining birthrate is fully as serious as the quantitative. Children born Per 100 Wives, Classified according to Occupation of the husbands, selected counties.

Unfortunately this question was not continued in 1920 and 1930, but there is little doubt that the difference in fertility between the classes of people noted above would be similar today.

            <seg id="p168">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE So long as these conditions persist it seems likely that the birth - rate will continue to decline in the cities, though, probably, at a dim - inishing rate. And to the extent that these urban ideals and styles reach into the rural regions, the birthrate is likely to decline there also, — indeed, it is already declining, in some States for many years. But the population of the Nation will continue to increase, though at a lessening rate, for at least 5 years, probably 15 years, possibly 25 years, because the increase in number of middle-aged and old people will exceed the decrease in number of children. Between 19 20 and 1930 the number of people over 65 years of age increased 34 per cent in the Nation as a whole and 50 per cent in the urban population, and a similar increase must continue for several decades. These people are living now and the number that will be living each year in the future can be estimated rather closely by applying expectation of life tables, such as are used by life insurance companies. On the other hand, the number of children under 5 years of age decreased only slightly between 1920 and 193 0, and only about 10 per cent since 1930, while children 5 to 10 years of age have decreased 8 per cent since 1930. Should the decline in births continue at the depression rate of 100, - 000 a year, and immigrants into the United States be balanced by emigrants, the population of the Nation would reach a maximum of about 130,000,000 — only 3,000,000 more than at present — in 1941. Should births decline at the gentler rate of 70,000 a year during the 5 years preceding the depression, the peak of population — about 131, - 000,000 — -would be reached in 1944 or 1945. (Figure 18). But most students of population trends think that the decline in births will slow up soon, and that the maximum population will not be reached before 1950, or possibly 1960, when the Nation may have 10,000,000 to 15, - 000,000 more people than it has today. Practically all students of the subject, however, are agreed that a declining population is very like - ly to occur within 30 years, unless the restrictions on immigration are relaxed. Some believe that when the decline sets in there may de - velop a great revival of interest in the future welfare of the Nation, and in the family as an institution for the preservation of the race. Such an interest, partaking of the character of a religious conviction, has developed recently in Germany; but in Great Britain, where the popula - tion will reach a maximum next year or the year after, no such move - ment jhas yet appeared. </seg>

But births started to decline in 1922 and by 1932 an estimate made by Dublin, also the medium estimate of Thompson and Whelpton, indicated that the population of the United States probably would never exceed 156,000,OUO and that the stationary condition would be reached about 1980. The Thompson and Whelpton mini - mum estimate indicated a maximum population of 136,000,000 about 1956. This minimum estimate appears now the safest, although the figure for January 1, 1934, exceeds the actual population by about 300,000. Should the average decrease of 70,000 in number of births each year during the past decade continue, and should immigration be ba.anced by emigration, the population of the United States will reach a maximum about 1946, and then begin to decline. But the decline will be slow for a decade or more. The prospect is that the population of the Nation will not diverge more than 10 or 12 per -cent from the present number within the next 25, possibly 50 years. </seg>
            <seg id="p170">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The Prospect Meanwhile the farmers of the Nation may well keep these three things In mind: (1) The prospect is for further progress in agricultural technique, with resultant migration from the farms, as economic condi - tions improve in the cities. (2) The prospect is for further depletion of the soil resources, despite the vigorous efforts that are being started to control erosion. (3) The prospect is for further decline in births, which will event - ually result in a declining population, unless immigration in - creases greatly. Since it requires a generation for a declining number of births to be reflected in a declining population, and since the depletion of soil fertility is developing at an accelerating rate, it may be that some decline in agricultural production will precede the decline in popula - tion and result in fairly prosperous conditions for awhile for farmers on fertile, non-eroding land. (Figure 19). It is possible also that immigration may increase greatly, or the birthrate rise, as it has in Germany this past year. But considering the trends in the past, and that the forces inducing these trends appear to be as strong as ever, the only safe conclusion relative to the future need for farm products seems to be that the demand for food and fibres will remain more or less stationery for a few decades and then decline. For there has been a slight downward trend in per capita consumption of food for at least 25 years, associated doubtless with the decreasing proportion of the people engaged in outdoor or manual labor; while the per capita consumption of the non-food farm products (principally cotton, tobacco and flaxseed) has remained almost stationary, except for the decline during the depression. And the prospect for a notable increase in exports of farm products is not bright. So long as the urban people hold their present philosophy of life, and this seems likely to persist so long as the individual remains the econ - omic unit, the farmers of the Nation appear to be faced with these alter: latives, — (1) a declining national demand for farm products after a few decades, if migration from rural to urban areas is resumed, (2) an immediate increase in number of persons engaged in farming, if migration from the farms to the cities is not resumed, associated with a declining commercial demand for farm products probably within a decade. A third course may supplement these alternatives — the farming people may further restrict births, as the French rural people havefdone, until births on the farms nearly balance deaths. This would result within a few decades in a rapid and persistent decline in </seg>

But in recent years the decline in births, supplemented by the restrictions on immigration, has caused population to increase much less rapidly. Agricultural production on the other hand, has fluctuated notably. From 1909 to 1914 it increased as rapidly as population; from 1914 to 1921 the trend of production was horizontal, from 1921 to 1926 a probably unprecedented increase occurred; from 1926 to 1931 the trend was horizontal again. Since 1931 the trend has been rapidly downward. The recent decrease in production is attributable mostly to extraordinary drought, but it seems not unlikely that soil erosion and depletion of organic matter, as well as of the essential elements of fertility in the soil, is beginning to exert an influence on crop and pasture yields. national population, unless the urban birthrate rose rapidly or immi - gration increased notably. It would not solve the problem facing com - mercial agriculture. The solution to the problem of maintaining, after a decade or two, a commercial agriculture of the present magnitude can be found only in one or more of four developments, — (1) a rise in the birthrate, (2) an increase in per capita consumption of farm products, (3) increasing immigration from abroad, (4) increasing exports of farm products. Since these developments appear unlikely, except, possibly, a modest increase in exports, it would seem well for the farmers of the nation . to consider the best way of adjusting commercial production to demand, of conserving the fertility of the soil so that the children of farmers will not be deprived of their proper heritage, and the standard of liv - ing of the Nation need not be lowered, of learning to produce at home or in village and small town centers more of the processed foods and fabricated articles that farmers need, and of developing those economic and social institutions which will not fail to obtain a more equable dis - tribution of wealth, and the reproduction of the race. </seg>
            <seg id="p172">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE At least a quarter century remains, probably a half century, before the impact of a rapidly declining urban population will seriously affect the economic and political institutions. Indeed, the period of prac - tically stationary population which the Nation has entered may be characterized by exceptional prosperity. For during the next twenty years there will be a larger proportion of the population in the pro - ductive age groups, 20 to 60 years or 15 to 65 years of age, than there has been heretofore or there will be thereafter. (Figure 20). If em - ployment can be provided for a normal proportion of the people of work - ing age, there should be an increase in production per capita. The number of unproductive children will be greatly reduced, and time will not yet have brought the full harvest of the aged. All may seem well with the world, and the people may say to each other, let us eat, drink, and be merry.

By 1950 these children and young people probably will constitute only) 30 per cent of the population and by 1980, or before, only 25 per cent. In 1870 about 5 per cent of the popu'ation was over 60 years of age. By 1930 the proportion had risen to 8.6 per cent. By 1950 these old people will constitute 13 per cent of the population, and by 1980 probably 20 per cent. In 1870 about 45 per cent of the popula - tion was between 20 and (0 years of age, which may be considered the productive years of life, taking the people as a whole. By 1930 people in these productive ages constituted S2.6 per cent of the total population. By 1950 they will constitute about 57 per cent, and by 1980 perhaps 55 per cent. During the next few decades, when population will be a most stationary, a larger proportion of the population will be of productive age than in the past, or, probably, in the more distant future. In 1930 only about 30 per cent of the people were over 40 years of age. When population starts to decline about 4 0 per cent of the people will be over 40 years of age. If the births then continue to decline at a gentle rate for 25 years longer, fully 50 per cent of the population will be over 40 years of age, and more than 25 per cent will be over 60 years of age. This would be three times as large proportion ol </seg>
            <seg id="p173">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION old people as was reported in 1930. On the other hand young children are declining in number 2 per cent a year (3 to 4 per cent during the depression). Undoubtedly this rate of decline will diminish, but it seems not unreasonable to look forward to onlyrhalf as many children 25 years hence as there were 10 years ago. Suddenly, the people may realize that the children are few and the aged are many, and may say to each other, tomorrow we die. The youth, particularly the farm youth, are the hope of the Nation. May they see the opportunity to build a new civilization. In this civilization let us assume that no scientific knowledge or technical practice will be lost, and that nearly every person, even though he work in the city, will have a home on the land. For the land is the foun - dation of the family, and the family is the foundation of the State. The Agricultural Surplus and Depletion of the Ration's Resources Three thoughts in conclusion: 1. The agricultural surplus 3 has been produced at the price of rapid depletion of soil resources, and at the sacrifice of future produc - tion. If the soils that are rapidly eroding away, and these comprise probably half the total crop land of the United States, were restored to permanent grass, where a grass cover will control erosion, or to forest, where this is necessary to prevent erosion, there probably would be no surplus, at least of cotton, wheat, and pork products. In other words, the agricultural surplus is the product of a profligate waste of natural resources. The conversion of this eroding crop land to permanent pasture and forest of necessity would occur gradually and should be accompanied by increasing production of needed commodities on the non-eroding and generally more fertile land. Shifts in type of farming and progress in agricultural technique, particularly in fertilization of the soil, afford ample assurance of no lack of production on a smaller crop acreage. Such changes are more likely to increase than to diminish the number of farms. It is very likely that in many cases more intensive use of the land would lower costs of production. Whether this proves true or not, no nation should permit such a rapid depletion of resources as is now occurring in the soils of the United States. 2. This surplus of farm products has made agriculture generally unprofitable, and this has tended to induce migration to the cities, prior to the depression, of the more ambitious and better educated of •The word "surplus" is here used in the sense of agricultural production in excess of that which would result in an income for farmers equivalent to that obtained from similar labor in other occupations. </seg>
            <seg id="p174">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the farm youth particularly. Ambition and education are, in all likeli - hood, correlated with innate ability. This selective migration tends to reduce the quality of the farm population, especially in the poorer agricultural areas. Moreover, it is resulting in increasing tenancy among those who remain on farms. It is degrading agriculture and endangering rural progress. The importance of maintaining the quality of the farm population is evident even on the assumption that the difference between rural and urban birthrates becomes no greater. At present 10 adults in our large cities are producing about 7 children. These 7 will produce, if the birthrate falls no further, only about 5 children, and these 5 only about 3% children. In three generations, or a century, the progency of the city population would have fallen to about one-third. In the rural population 10 adults are now producing about 13 children. Should this birthrate persist, these 13 will produce 17 children, and these in turn about 22 children. A century hence the progency of the rural people would have doubled, and would be six times that of an equal number of city dwellers of today. 3. The land and the rural people are the very foundations of national strength. The nation can not permit these foundations to be worn away. But it should be recognized that the control of agricultural production through the altered utilization of eroding lands is a long - time program, not an emergency measure. It has been started in an emergency, and this is well. But it will be completed by the youth of today, principally the farm youth who have seen and felt the conse - quences of the old economic system. They can approach the problems with fairly open minds. IS THE RAINFALL OP NEBRASKA DECREASING? NELS A. BENGTSON, Ph. D. Chairman, Department of Geography, University of Nebraska -All through human history the rainfall of the area wherein Ne - braska is now located has been a subject of confusing and conflicting opinions. It is generally admitted that Coronado was the first white man to visit the section of the country which is now a part of this state. In 1541 he led an expedition which extended as far north as Kansas and perhaps southern Nebraska. Upon his return from that expedition he reported that "It was the Lord's pleasure that after having journeyed across these deserts 27 days I arrived at the province that is called Quivira." 1 •Wtnship, George Parker: Coronado Expedition, 1540-1542.

            <seg id="p175">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION For more than 200 years following this time no expeditions of any particular consequence visited the area. Our next definite hint comes as a result of the Lewis and Clark ex - pedition of 1804-1806. Inasmuch as this expedition visited only im - mediate environments of the rivers the results were somewhat disap - pointing. Shortly after, however, Lieutenant Zebulon Pike received instructions to explore the region drained by the Arkansas and Red Rivers, going westward to their headwaters. In 1807 he returned and gave a fairly comprehensive description, part of which stated: "Here a barren soil, parched and dried up for eight months in the year, presents neither moisture or nutrition sufficient to nourish the traveler. These vast plains of the western hemisphere may become in time as celebrated as the sandy deserts of Africa But one great advantage may arise, namely the restriction of our population to some certain limits and thereby a continuation of the Union. Our citizens being so prone to rambling and extending themselves on the fron - tiers, will through necessity be constrained to limit their ex - tent on the west to the borders of the Missouri and Mississippi, while they leave the prairie, incapable of cultivation, to tho wandering and uncivilized aborigines of the country." 1 A report, written by a young eastern author, after extended travel through this section of the country, was published in 1816 which stated in part, "It is an extensive region of open plains interspersed with bare untillable hills having some resemblance to the steppes of Tartary or the Sahara of Africa . . . The natives will probably remain in quiet and untroubled possession . . . until our country becomes surcharged with population. There is scarcely any probability of settlers venturing far Into those regions. This country it is certain can never become agricultural but it is in many respects favorable for flocks and herds." 1 Even at this early date, however, differences of opinion were de - veloping among observers as to the potentialities of the plains. While Pike and Brackenridge were interpreting this country in tones of despair other travelers began to have views which were hopeful, almost optimistic, in nature. John Bradbury, an English naturalist, carried on investigations of the plant life of the trans-Missouri region during the years following 1809. In 1817 his report appeared In book form Note: The writer is indebted to Mr. Walter Kollmorgen for data given in the first part of this article.

Among other things he said: " The belief in America is that the prairie cannot be inhabited by the whites. . . . My opinion is that it can be cul - tivated; and that in time it will not only be peopled and cul - tivated, but that it will be one of the most beautiful countries in the world." 4 "Various other writers described the country in similar terms and numerous quotations could be given to emphasize the different points of view held by the early travelers. Some were impressed by the ap - parenu bleakness of the landscape; others, seeing it probably under more favorable weather conditions were impressed by its verdant beauty. Some wrote pessimistically, others hopefully. T. J. Farnham "was perhaps the first man who attempted to organize a group of settlers for this new country. That he did not rank as a great optimistic booster is indicated by a quotation out of a book which he published in 1839: "The remainder of this Great Wilderness lying . . . be - tween the Platte and the Rocky Mounties is the arid waste usually called the Great American Desert. ... L It is a scene of desolation scarcely equalled on the continent when viewed in the dearth of midsummer from the base of the hills Below you spreads far and wide the burnt and arid desert, whose solemn silence is seldom broken by the tread of any other animal than the wolf or the starved and thirsty horse which bears the traveler across the wastes."" Even Jefferson Davis, one of the best informed men of his time, in a discussion of the Pacific Railroad December 14, 1858, stated: "I believe that that country between the Mississippi aud the Pacific, which has been well denominated the desert, is to remain so; that from its meteorological conditions it can never be densely populated by an agricultural people; and that, therefore, the road will never be a paying one, except as it is required for the uses of the Government The period is remote, too remote for any man now living to foresee it, when that desert will so far be peopled that private capital can afford to build this road across it.'" Following the building of the Union Pacific Railroad and the migra - tion of people across the plains came what was essentially a real estate boom period. It was fostered by many well-meaning people but whose words served the purpose of bringing tragic consequences to thousands who came to look upon the picture painted as a reality instead of the * Bradbury, John, in Thwaites, op. clt.

            <seg id="p177">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION mirage which it was. Among the most prominent views which became current was that breaking the sod and cultivating the land would in - crease rainfall. A prominent Nebraska horticulturalist stated: "There is some foundation for the belief that rain follows the white man. Providence seems to encourage the advance of men as they push westward. The mythical desert will un - doubtedly be covered with beautiful groves and fruitful or - chards even to the base of the Rocky Mountains." 7 Another writer of the same period stated: "From the increasing rainfall of the state it is also evident that at no distant day the whole state even to its western limits will have an abundant rainfall for all the needs of tho agriculturalists."" That scientists even then doubted the argument is indicated by Major J. W. Powell's report of 1879 wherein he stated: "The limit of successful agriculture without irrigation has been set at 20 inches At 20 inches agriculture will not be uniformly successful from season to season. Many droughts will occur It may be doubted whether on tho whole agriculture will prove remunerative."" Many Nebraskans challenged the report, among them Mr. Robert W. Furnas and Martin Dunhan, both of whom were prominent educators and political leaders of the state. In response to a letter of inquiry sent by these gentlemen to Professor Aughey asking what facts there were to sustain such a report, the following reply was made: "Observations, experiment, and the highest scientific auth - ority demonstrate that the climates in the west are becoming moister; that rainfall is increasing steadily. This increase must extend until the plains east of Denver and Laramie re - ceive rainfall sufficient to produce farm products without irrigation For these reasons we are compelled to say that any evidence of present dryness where dryness exists is evidence only for the present and should not be used to cover these areas with the undeserved reproach of the curse ol desert lands." 10 Professor Aughey was an able scientist of his time and a competent ■observer. He did, however, accept the idea of increase of rainfall due to cultivation of land. Among his statements the following may be quoted: 7 "Tree Culture" in the Report of the State Board of Agriculture, 1873, pp. 465-467. '"Nebraska as It is" by L. D.

            <seg id="p178">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE "It is the great increase in the absorptive power of the soil wrought by cultivation that has caused and continues to cause an increasing rainfall in the state."n As we study the descriptions prepared by the early travellers through this part of the Great Plains and those written by the pioneers we are struck by the contradictions presented. These undoubtedly were due in part to differences in points of view. To people accustomed to forested lands, the prairie almost devoid of trees seemed bleak and dreary indeed, and therefore suggested almost a desert. But this was not all. Undoubtedly there were then as now great fluctuations in rainfall in different seasons and in different years. Those who saw the country when rains were scarce and the landscape brown became impressed with its bleakness and lack of promise, whereas those who were here during wet seasons or rainy years saw a green landscape and one promising great abundance when placed in cultivation. These varying amounts of rainfall led to the false conception that the climate was changing. The late seventies and early eighties were compara - tively wet years and during those years westward expansion of set - tlement was rapid. Thus arose the common belief that "rain follows the plow". The early nineties were extraordinarily dry, and thus the everoptlmistic faith in rainfall Increasing as a result of cultivation of crops was followed by painful disillusionment. A review of the climate record of the state since 1850, in so far as it is available, shows that we have had several periods of abnormally low rainfall. (See Fig. 21 ). The first such period of prolonged drought occurred from 1859 to 1864 inclusive, six years of rainfall below normii with four of them so far below that severe drought conditions must havej existed. Sharp recovery occurred In 1865; during the next 20 years only relatively minor oscillations occurred. This was the great settlement era for most of the state and the heavier rainfall which then prevailed gave Impetus to the belief held by many that breaking the dod and cultivating the land would result in increased rainfall But alas fhe years following 1885 were years of disillusionment. The wish for increased rainfall was father of the thought, but the decade from 188^ to 1894 failed to support the hopeful theory. Instead, it was a decade of diminishing rainfall, with the exception of 1891 and 1892 and culminated in the record-breaking drought of 1 8 9 4. The last long swing experienced in the state to date may quite properly be said to have begun with the drought of 1894 and to have extended to that of 1934. While minor fluctuations have occurred and fhere have been wet years and dry years sometimes singly and sometimes in series, the general form of the 40-year record when re - duced to a curve has been that of a broad arch. 11 Aughey, Samuel: Physical Geography and Geology of Nebraska, 1880, p. 44. </seg>

            <seg id="p180">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Following 1894 the annual rainfall increased quite consistently reaching a high peak of 31.65 inches in 1905. Then occurred a short period of rather violent fluctuations but with general decline culminating in 1910. Following the low point of 1910 with rainfall of 'only 17.18 inches, the general curve for the next 20 years evidenced a rise to 25.63 inches in 1930. During this 20-year period the out - standing departure from the ordinary yearly fluctuations occurred in 1915 when the average rainfall for the state reached the record point of 35.160 inches; in 1914 it was only 20.78 inches and in 1916 it dropped back to 19.08 inches, the latter remaining as the low point until the severe drought of 1934 struck. From 1916 to 1930 the fluctuations were typical of the rainfall variations which have been observed since white settlements began, and therefore they may be considered to be quite normal. Similar fluctuations may be expected to take place in the decades to come. Since 1930 the general trend has been downward, reaching a low point in 1934 which lacked but little of touching the all-time low of 1894. It should be noted also that '31, '32, and '33 marked a period of little change, and that we have had three similar periods since 1870, two of which were followed by sharp decreases in rainfall and then decided upturn. The third of the periods of stability preceded 1915, the extraordinarily wet year. The record as presented applies to the state as a whole. When we study the average distribution of rainfall over the state as shown by the records, we face the fact that a decrease of approximately 50 pel cent is encountered from east to west. The average annual rain - fall of southeastern Nebraska is about 32 inches; of the western part of the panhandle it is about 16 inches. On the basis of the record to date the western one-third of the state has an average annual rain - fall of less than 20 inches. The rate of decrease westward is fairly uniform although it appears to be somewhat more rapid just west of the eastern fourth of the state than it is either farther east or west. </seg>

I Fig. 22— Average annual rainfall for Nebraska 1850-1934. The efficiency of the rainfall is somewhat affected by the prevail - ing temperatures in the different parts of the state. Since the average annual temperature in western Nebraska is 6 to 8 degrees lower than in the eastern part, the effectiveness of the low rainfall in promoting plant growth is greater than if higher temperatures were prevalent. This factor is not however sufficient to overcome the handicap of the less than 20 inches of rainfall. The maps of absolute maximum and absolute minimum rainfall reveal clearly the extent of fluctuation which has occurred within the period of recorded data. The extremes at Falls City have been 50 and 24 inches; in Thurston county, 42 and 20 inches; at Minden, 48 and 16 inches; at McCook, 34 and 8 inches; at Sidney, 28 and 8 inches. On a percentage basis, the fluctuation between maximum and minimum has generally been somewhat higher in western than in eastern Nebraska. As a general statement it may be said that in the eastern, part the absolute maximum rainfall at any place has seldom been much more than doubled the absolute minimum, whereas in the western part the absolute maximum has usually been three to four times as great as the absolute minimum. The maps show the highest and the lowest amounts of yearly rainfall ever recorded in the various parts of the state. </seg>

            <seg id="p184">REPORT OF -NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The question with which we began "Is the rainfall of Nebraska de - creasing" can be answered only in terms of the record. That record is clear. The low rainfall of 1934 was not record-breaking as to amount but the drought effects were probably more severe than had ever been experienced before. The unfavorable seasonal distribution of the little rain which did fall, and the extremely high summer temperatures were factors which made the effects of the drought disastrous to all forms of vegetation. Two previous periods of exceptionally low rain - fall, and several periods where the deficiency was serious but not quite so devastating in results have been experienced since I860 In all these cases recovery has followed quite promptly. There is no evi - dence, either scientific or statistical, to justify any other answer now. Thkt climatic changes have occurred within geologic times we know. That similar changes may now be in progress is quite possible but such changes are slow, too slow to measure in terms of decades or of generations. For the years ahead, that is for the coming decades we are justified in stating that there is no evidence of any permanent change in rainfall conditions. We may expect the usual irregular fluctuations of dry years and wet years, and that recovery from the abnormally low rainfall period of the present decade is due to begin soon.

Forest Service for establishing strip shelterbelts through the agricultural sections of six </seg>
            <seg id="p185">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION plains states should be of interest to residents of Nebraska. This tree planting program, although larger than any previous undertaking, is only a planned expansion of what has been going on in this state since the beginning of its development. Nebraska has been transformed, almost in one generation, from open prairie to one of the most produc - tive agricultural states. Trees have played an important part in this development; not in bringing a great deal in direct returns but in furnishing shade, shelter and fuel for those who were far-sighted enough to see the agricultural possibilities in the state. There are people living yet who remember eastern Nebraska when it had very few trees except along streams, but today even the uplands of this section are well broken up with groves and fields shelterbelts. The early settlers here came from states to the east where trees were quite common and naturally the lack of shade and shelter caused these people to attempt planting around their homes. In fact many of the covered wagons that were dragged through the Missouri River contained bundles of cuttings or small seedlings to be used in starting windbreaks or groves around new homes. If records were available they would show that many of the fine groves of trees through Nebraska now are the result of stock brought here by ox teams when Nebraska was being settled. Nebraska is internationally known for its interest and success in tree planting. Nebraska Can Grow Trees. It is true that some of the trees that were planted did not grow because wind and drouth had their effect on plant life then just as they have now. Further, there was very little information in those days on hardiness of varieties or cultural methods necessary. Yet in spite of these handicaps there is ample evidence of the results from much of this early planting. We should appreciate this development and give credit to our pioneer settlers for their faith in the future of Ne - braska. In times like these we need a little more of the old-time faith and spirit which together developed the moral fibre that character - ized those who pioneered this state. Soil Preparation For Planting. The plan for establishing this gigantic shelterbelt is not yet com - plete. However, fundamentally it is not a fantastic dream but a sound practical program not only to start trees but to give them the best possible chance to grow. This will involve a soil cultural program based on the best information available and applied to the locality where the work is being done. In addition every known method of moisture con - servation will be employed in order to store in the soil all precipitation (summer and winter) because for any plant to grow there must be moisture for its roots. This soil culture and water conservation pro- </seg>
            <seg id="p186">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE gram will call for fallowing the strips to be planted with a lister or similar implement and these will follow the contours of the land even though such a method makes very short rows. Terracing of slopes that might otherwise wash or allow a heavy run-off will be an important funbtion in some sections. Snowfences will be set up on difficult or exposed sites as a temporary measure to hold winter moisture. To some these may appear as extreme measures, but if we continue to farm all of Nebraska's agricultural area these same measures will, before many years, be part of the agricultural program for the production of ordinary grain crops. In other words, we cannot continue the exploita - tion of soil or continue to permit this loss of moisture through soil erosion, drainage ditches and careless farming practices, and still expect the same production that has in the past been possible when subsoil moisture stored up over long periods was available. Annual precipitation is limited in this section; in fact, there is probably not more than one year out of fifteen when rainfall exceeds the crop needs. After the experience of 1934 it is unnecessary to mention much about the other extremes. Therefore, to grow any crop in an area where we know from experience that the limiting factor is moisture, it is good business to begin with a program that will conserve all that nature sees fit to send. The growing of trees is not unlike, nor any more difficult than the growing of other crops. The same principles that apply to one will apply to the other — good husbandry practices. During this present drouth period trees that were planted on well - prepared soil and given regular cultivation lived through with very little damage. As a matter of fact, an acre of trees requires less mois - ture to live and grow than many of our common grain crops. Therefore, this shelterbelt program where soil preparation may be carried on for one or even two years for the purpose of storing up moisture and then planted with a definite program of cultivation can be made successful. Trees as a "Windbreak. The purpose of this planting even though it is on a large scale is the same as that of smaller windbreaks that have been planted or are being planted around farms in the state to divert wind and check its velocity. What effect a hundred narrow shelterbelts, one planted each mil&lt;j in a strip one hundred miles wide, will have on wind velocity is not definitely known, because no such planting has ever been made. It is known that such a planting will have a very beneficial effect on the area within and adjacent to the belt. </seg>
            <seg id="p187">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION Fig. 25 — A pine and mulberry shelterbelt in Adams county. The question as to how soon a planting of this kind will be effec - tive is difficult to answer except to compare it with smaller plantations of the past. A windbreak including rapid growing trees properly - planted and cared for will offer some protection within five years. Railroad snowfences consisting of two rows of trees planted in various parts of Nebraska in 1929 and 1930 are now serving in place of wooden fences. Therefore, it is safe to assume that within a period of from eight to ten years these shelters will be effective. The Planting Plan. The plan which will be followed in developing one of these in - dividual strips will be first to prepare the ground as previously dis - cussed, together with the fencing of the area against livestock. Next a careful selection of planting stock of hardy varieties including native trees and shrubs wherever possible. The outside row on either side will be a low spreading shrub which will grow up quickly and serve as a snowtrap for the belt Itself. Next a row of hardy evergreens such as red cedar or possibly ponderosa pine. Then a row of rapid growing broadleaf trees, and the interior of the plantation will be hardy, tall - growing varieties. This belt when complete will have the low surface winds checked from the outside by the evergreens and the shrubs, and the central part of the windbreak will give height to slow up and divert winds for a greater distance. The strip fenced for this planting will include sufficient area to leave some ten to twelve feet on either side between the last row of trees and the fence, and the trees within the belt will be spaced sufficiently wide to permit cultivation and to elim - inate the danger of serious root competition. A belt of this kind with low growing trees on the outside together with the strip of cleanly cultivated land between the trees and the adjacent fields will not effect crops by root interference, but this crop will have the beneficial in - fluence of protection against the drying out of soil and the mechanical damage of wind. </seg>
            <seg id="p188">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE These shelterbelts even though they will be given regular cultivation as long as their growth will permit will serve as bird and game cover. This use, of course, will be of minor importance by comparison, but certainly will serve to replace brush lands, etc., which until they were removed by the progress of civilization served for these same pur - poses. To the individual farmer game may not be of great importance, but to the state as a whole it is very important and we have no moral right even though it may be legal to so handle our lands that the propagation of game is very difficult and in some cases impossible. Every community in Nebraska from east to west or from north to south now has plantings which demonstrate that trees can be grown. These are often small isolated groves or windbreaks which have been subjected to the rigors of a climate which we must accept as normal and have still made a very creditable showing. A mass planting such as that proposed in this shelterbelt will have a decided advantage over in - dividual plantations because each strip will be a self-protecting unit and will more nearly approach natural forest conditions. It cannot be denied, however, that many of the early plantations in this section were failures, partly because of improper or no cultivation, or damage from livestock and in many cases a poor choice of species. This is not a criticism of those who attempted early tree planting because there was very little plains tree planting information available at that time In fact these failures have furnished a great deal of the informa - tion now serving; as a basis on which this present program is being built. — i _ pig. 26— A windbreak of this type protects both fields and farmsteads from wind discomforts and damages. The strips to be planted will be about eight rods wide following the half section rather than the section lines, thereby eliminating the possibile interference with highways. This method of location will also give each quarter section a part of the shelter. The strips will run east and west or north and south depending on the prevailing winds in the particular locality. No farmer will be required to permit this strip to cross his land; his land will be included only after he is convinced </seg>
            <seg id="p189">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION that it will be an asset to the farm and after some form of contract or lease is drawn. The strip will be fenced to keep out all livestock. Local labor will be hired to construct the fence and prepare the ground. With present moisture conditions it will probably be necessary to fallow these strips for at least one season before, planting is started. This fallowing will be done with a lister rather than a plow as a mois - ture conservation measure and as a check against wind erosion. Kinds of Trees to Be Planted. The trees to be used will be selected with the greatest care and these will vary with localities and sites. They must not only be hardy but also be of a type that will serve best as windbreaks. This group for Nebraska will include the following: red cedar, ponderosa pine, Austrian pine, mulberry, Russian olive, Caragana, buffalo berry, Chinese •elm, American elm, ash, cottonwood, honey locust, wild plum, choke cherry, hackberry, burr oak, and black walnut. Tig. 27- -A sheltcrbelt of Caragana, Russian Olive and Chinese Elms on light soil in Lincoln county. The fact that this proposed belt is to run from Canada to northern Texas does not necessarily mean that the strips will run north and south. In many places it will be necessary and advisable to run them east and west. These tree belts will be made to fit the community through which they run rather than attempting to make the com - munity fit the tree belt. The purpose of this undertaking is to locate and develop shelterbelts that will serve best in resisting prevailing winds. In other words, there is no "cut and dried" plan or checker - board layout which will have to be followed. </seg>

That something must be done toward checking wind and water erosion and in conserving the moisture that, falls and runs out of the state is not a guess if we expect the soil of Nebraska, which is its only source of income, to continue production. VaLUE OP TERRACING, CONTOUR FARMING, STRIP FARMING AND OTHER PRACTICES in CONSERVING PRECIPITATION IVAN D. WOOD, State Extension Agricultural Engineer, University of Nebraska Since the dawn of history, man has impounded run-off water and div ;rted it into his fields to supplement the normal rainfall. The Incas of South America built massive bench terraces to provide level agri - cultural lands and diverted water from mountain streams to them for irrigation. In our own southwest, there is abundant evidence of canal systems, reservoirs, dams and other means of water conservation built by Aboriginal hands in the dim and remote past. Ruins in the Mesa Verde National Park of southwestern Colorado tell us of communities of cliff dwellers who existed on the fruits of the soil and not of the hunt but how they could have grown sufficient grain in so dry a climate, without some comprehensive means of conserving rainfall is not apparent. White man's first attempt at supplying supplemental moisture to cropped areas in the Great Plains Region was confined to direct irriga - tion from streams. Later, as settlers took the higher and drier land, a need for better knowledge of saving the limited moisture from rain - fall was keenly felt. Gradually he has added to this store of knowledge bui. much yet remains to be learned. What Becomes of the Rainfall. A very small portion of the total season's rainfall becomes avail - able for plant use. When it is considered that moisture is the limiting factor in crop production in all parts of Nebraska, it becomes apparent that more attention should be given to conserving as much of the available moisture as possible. </seg>
            <seg id="p191">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION The major portion of the season's rainfall is disposed of in one or the following ways: 1. Run-off. 2. Evaporation from the ground surface. 3. Transpiration from the leaves of plants. 4. Joining the permanent body of soil moisture. It is interesting to note the small portion of the whole which goes to actual use by plants. The disposition of the 17-inch average annual rainfall at the Goodwell, Oklahoma Experiment Station is found to be about as follows: 5.3 inches comes in showers too small to be of value and evaporates soon after falling. 11.7 inches comes in moderate to heavy rains which penetrate the soil or runs off. The disposition of the 11.7 inches has been found over a period of years to be as follows: 2.3 inches runs off and is lost to plant use. 6.5 inches evaporates either at the time of cultivation or at other times. ■ ■ 3.0 inches remains in the soil, available for plant use. A part of this remaining in the soil is wasted by weeds. A study of rainfall at the Spur Texas Experiment Station reveals that during a seven year period the 20.9 inch precipitation was disposed of in about the following way: 5.2 inches came in small showers too small to be of value, soon evaporating. 3.1 inches ran off and is lost to plant use. 12.6 inches entered the soil of which further evaporation and weeds account for some loss. While time does not permit of an exhaustive study of moisture losses, the above statements should be food for thought. The per - centage of losses from the various sources will, of course, vary with climatic, cultural and soil conditions but it may be seen that run-off is not by any means the 1 largest loss. It is however one of the losses which can be more easily curbed. </seg>
            <seg id="p192">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Vaporization Losses. It is not the purpose of this paper to discuss vaporization losses as other speakers will no doubt cover this point. Certainly the fact that 25j% to 30% of our rainfall comes in showers too light to be of much value in adding to the body of soil moisture should cause some concern in a state where moisture is the limiting factor in crop production. Cultural practices in the great plains region, particularly with re - gard to summer tillage are gradually changing in agreement with proper principles to conserve a part of the moisture given in these light showers. The duck foot summer fallow tool, the blade harrow and the rdd weeder have a tendency to leave a mulch of clods on the surface which provides shade and wind protection to the moisture from small showers which would otherwise evaporate immediately. The trench made by the lister or the furrow drill sheds some of the water from the light rain from the ridge to the depression where, due td concentration, some of it will penetrate and be available to root systems of growing crops. The ridge provides some shade and wind protection which aids in preventing rapid evaporation. Contouring of Rows. The placing of the rows on the contour is not a new idea by any means. It has been practiced since time immemorial by races of men existing before history was written. When the lister was first in - troduced, it was soon found that rows running down long slopes often ' Erostoi 8 Ex1rrfment f StaU^? Uring S0U a " d WBter '° SSeS at *•*«*■■» Ml"** Soil </seg>
            <seg id="p193">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION had to be, replanted several times. The practice of using the lister in this manner, however, has not entirely disappeared. In Nebraska, the land was laid out in square sections and fractions. Farmers soon took great pride in straight rows and it is common practice today to lay out rows parallel with the fences regardless of the slope of the ground. Contouring of rows has its disadvantages at least in the minds of the land owners. Unless a hillside has a uniform slope, the rows will be crooked and, in some instances, may run diagonally to the fence line. Such a wide departure from common practices may excite the ridicule of the neighborhood and, although it may result in increased crop yields and prevention of erosion, it is a difficult practice to introduce. Contouring of lister rows as ordinarily practiced has not produced the best results. Unless excellent precision is used in location of rows, there will be some places where erosion will occur and others where crops will be drowned out or covered with mud. Water which is de - sired in an even distribution over the field runs to low places and accumulates or breaks over the ridges. It has been the common ex - perience of those who have attempted contour farming on a practical scale that! terracing of the land was necessary as a guide to proper row location. Cultural Practices to Which Contouring Is A&lt;lupte«I. No doubt some advantage would result from planting a'.most any crop on contour lines in an area having proper climatic and soil condi - tions. In areas where the lister is used for corn planting, contouring of rows has been practiced to some extent for many years. In other sec - tions, as in western Kansas, the lister is used on stubbls ground di - rectly after harvest as a means of preventing weed growth as well as to help in the preparation for a fall seed bed for the succeeding wheat crop. No doubt contouring in this case would result in moisture con - servation where slopes exist. During the process of cultivation, sur - face planted corn and cotton is rid^od to some extent and there is every reason to believe that planting around the slope would result in some benefit from an erosion control as well as a moisture conserva - tion standpoint. Potato culture demands a certain amount of fairly high ridging of the rows and should lend itself well to the practice in dry land sections. In the wheat belt of western Nebraska, tha furrow drill is uqed to a great extent. Wheat is planted in rows 12 to 14 inches apart and at the bottom of a furrow 4 inches deep. It would seem that contouring these rows might result in some benefit in holding water from melting snow or from rain in the early spring when the ground is frozen as well as at other times of the year. It has been noted that erosion sometimes occurs due to the fact that water has </seg>

Here contour cultivation would no doubt be an advantage. Terracing. Terracing in some form has been practiced in all countries since the dawn of history. It is reasonable to suppose that nature would not in all cases make such an arrangement of slopes as to be ideal for agricultural purposes. The Incas of South America not only built bench terraces of rock but carried the soil to fill them from long distances In baskets. Water from mountain streams was diverted to these bench terraces in times of drouth. By this means, they were able to support ciuies in what would today be considered Impossible locations. The broad base or Mangum terrace is a product of the southern part of the United States where it has been in use for many years. It consists of a ridge of dirt thrown up by a grader or other machinery and follows somewhat on the contour of the slope.

            <seg id="p196">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE climatic conditions, amount of slope and length of terrace. The modern 'practice calls for a terrace from 25 to 30 feet wide at the base and 18 inches high at the ridge. In almost all parts of Nebraska where slopes occur, hillsides are traversed by ditches running up and down the slope. If actual ditches have not formed, at least depressions are present where water con - centrates in times of excessive rain. The terrace is carried directly across these depressions where fills are made with slip scrapers. The modern tendency in terrace building is toward flatter grades. In the beginning, the grade of the terrace was often made as steep as 6 Inches per 100 feet of length. At present, this has been reduced to flai grades in some instances or, in tighter soils, to four inches or less. It will be pointed out later how water and soil losses have been reduced by the practice. With a carefully laid out terrace system, contour farming can be accomplished more easily. In one Nebraska community, a group of farmers whose land lies in, the central Nebraska Loess hills have attempted contouring of rows over a long period of time. The strip cropping and lister rows were in some instances laid out with a leveling instrument. Two of the men have in the last few years built terraces to I facilitate the contour farming as gullying in many places in each field still persisted. The torrential rain still broke over the ridges and finally ran down the hillside. Strip Cropping. The planting of alternate strips of row crops and grass corps across the slope on contour lines undoubtedly has a great many advantages. Farmers Leaflet No. 85 of the United States Department of Agriculture describes somewhat in detail this practice. Many adaptations of the plan could be thought of for Nebraska conditions. Alternate strips of listed corn, sudan grass, sweet clover, small grains and the grain sor - glmms could be used. The above mentioned circular reports the ob - servations on a considerable number of fields in Texas. The author comes to the conclusion that for a long time the permanent cropping system terraces should be constructed to serve not only as permanent guides between strips but to protect against the torrential rain which sweeps the entire slope. Diversion of Run-off to Agricultural Lands. There is abundant opportunity in many sections of Nebraska to divert the run-off from certain water sheds' for irrigating lower agri - cultural lands. When a rainfall of considerable intensity occurs, the run-off may be excessive and the actual benefit received from the </seg>
            <seg id="p197">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION water which falls is not great. . It has been successfully demonstrated that this run-off water can be diverted to pasture and hay lands and used as a supplemental water supply. At the Spur, Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, the run-off from a 1,200 acre water shed was diverted by dikes in such a way that a strip of land one-fourth mile wide and one mile long was irrigated. In traversing this strip of land, the water must travel six miles. The irrigated area receives enough moisture to grow feed crops luxuriantly. There are undoubtedly many fields of alfalfa in western Nebraska which could be' given considerable supplemental water in the manner just mentioned. In attempting to lay out such a system, however, the land owner should seek the advice of someone who has had experience with running levels and laying out ditches to the proper grade. There is also abundant opportunity to impound water by means of -earth dams and use this impounded supply for irrigation of wood lots and gardens in areas where the natural rainfall is insufficient. Results to Be Expected. Experiments have shown that there is considerable run-off even where the slope of the ground is not great. At the Spur, Texas Experi - ment Station, the results obtained were as follows: Slope of the Ground in Per cent Inches of Run-off 0 .86 1 2.68 2 2.91 From the above figures, it appears that even with a flat grade of -approximately 1 foot in 100 feet, 13% of the average annual rainfall ran off the land. Similar results have been shown elsewhere. Experiments at varied locations have conclusively shown that grassed areas or, in fact, any thickly growing crop reduces run-off to a considerable extent.

            <seg id="p198">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Fig. 31 — Construction of terraces on a badly eroded hillside. The runoff water is intercepted and carried slowly around the terrace to a protected outlet ditch. Con - tour farming in conjunction with terraces will control erosion on such slopes. By a properly designed system of terraces, combined with contour farming, soil and moisture losses can be reduced to a minimum. The land owner who would follow a careful rotation system on land farmed in this manner should be able to maintain a high state of fertility and conserve enough moisture to guarantee much higher yields than is ordinarily obtained on such land. To do contour farming efficiently, it will often be necessary to abandon the practice of laying out rect - angular fields. A complete rearrangement may be necessary and it has been found that the farming operations can often be carried on more conveniently with the new lay-out in which field' boundaries follow contours. Future Development. It is the opinion of the writer that future development in the field of moisture conservation so far as the agricultural engineer is concerned will come with the further development of the terrace and of contour farming. There will come development in machines, the use of which will prepare the soil surface to prevent practically all run-off and check at least some surface evaporation which costs so heavily. A machine which digs 10,000 holes per acre each having a capacity of three gallons is now in the experimental stages. Land worked with this machine would be capable of holding one inch of rainfall without loss if it fell in one minute. Professor J. C. Russel of the Agronomy Department, University of Nebraska, suggested in 1932 that it would be possible to make an </seg>

This would form a series of basins which would hold considerable water, even on sloping ground. With such a machine, it would not be nec - essary to place lister rows exactly on the contour in order to prevent erosion and conserve considerable moisture. The stubble fields could be immediately listed after the grain was removed and very little moisture lost by run-off until corn was planted the following spring. By proper spacing of the dams, it would be possible to collect all the water which would fall in a two-inch rain, except on the steeper slopes. Such a machine, known now as a basin lister, was developed re - cently at Iowa State College and has been given experimental trials over the state. Apparently the principle is sound and should be attended with some success. Undoubtedly, there will be other machines developed which will prepare land for moisture conservation and prevention of erosion. Undoubtedly all states in the drier sections will give more intensive studies to the problem that has been done in the past. Man's quest for moisture will go on through the ages in those por - tions of the earth's surface where the normal rainfall will not regularly produce grain without special means of conservation. It is now being realized that neither the soil nor the moisture has been conserved to any appreciable extent by present methods of farming. No doubt, the coming decade will see a great change in present practices. MAKING THE MOST OF RAINFALL THROUGH SOIL AND CROP MANAGEMENT J. p. RUSSEL Department of Agronomy When I was a youngster on the farm, and father would send me out to plow, and I would ride the beams to keep the points in the ground, and the soil could turn up in lumps like rocks, and roll up between the gangs and bruise my toes, I would wail, "Let's quit, — there is no sense working when it is so viciously dry." Father would say, "Keep on son, we will put out a lot of wheat this fall; we always raise a big crop after a dry year." Later when I became a soils investigator I remembered this par - ental dictum and when opportunity offered put a graduate student at the study of the effect of extreme drought on soil fertility. It turned </seg>
            <seg id="p200">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE out that father was right. Prolonged dessication of soil and subjection to high temperature has a stimulative effect on certain bacteria. During - the drought they are inactive but when rains come again they get to - work and produce nitrates in quantity out of all comparison with the normal. As a consequence crops grow luxurlent and green, and the sad and disheartening effects of drought soon disappear. This program is evidence that drought has a stimulating effect on humans as well. And, when it starts to rain again as it already has in parts of the state, we fully intend to get to work and produce, abundantly. Today we are optimists. We believe we have passed through a dry cycle, and are passing into a wet one, probably one just as favorable as that which followed the drought of '94. We are forgetting how little - rain we have had in the past. We are not talking about the mistakes, we made in not using that little wisely. We only want to know how to make the most of what we are going to get in the future. In eastern Nebraska throughout the glacial and loessial region generally, and in a portion of the high plains area of the state we have a subsoil that will hold from 2 to 2 V&gt; inches of available water per foot. This means, that starting with soil as dry as plants can make it, we can store in the upper 4 or 5 feet as much as 10 inches of water for the use of crops. This water, if we would lose none of it by evaporation or through weeds, in a normally humid season would produce 55 bushels of corn, per acre. As a matter of fact, the state average yields of all our crops exclusive of alfalfa are produced on only about 5 inches of water. The old Scotch recipe for rabbit pie starts out with the wording "First catch your rabbit." The first step in converting rainfall into crop growth is to catch your water. Water Conservation. The previous speaker has emphasized runoff losses. If we could at sorb in our soil at the point where it falls, all of the water that is normally lost by runoff, that alone would suffice to grow an average crop. After a season when we have literally prayed to God for rain, and beseached the President for sustinence for man and beast, it is incon - sistent in the extreme to see water running off our fields, down our gullys, and ponding up along roadsides. We ought to be doing some - thing to keep it back at points where it fell. On the face of it contour farming about which the previous speaker has told you would appear to be a trouble maker. I am not absolutely </seg>
            <seg id="p201">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION certain that as generally advocated it is precisely the right thing. Students of farm management would have us make operating units larger, and use bigger machinery. This has always seemed sound. Larger units and larger machinery mean larger fields. Contour farm - ing on farms as they are now laid out means smaller fields. Somehow we must find a compromise, for after all I am convinced that it is highly sensible to run rows, back lands and dead furrows across slopes, in - stead of up and down. I would propose to you representative farmers from throughout the state' that you go home and survey your farm with the aid of an ex - tension engineer or county agent with a good farm level, and figure out some method whereby you can do your farming across the lines of drainage. Runoff accounts for only a part of our moisture loss. An equally large portion is lost by evaporation because it never gets into the ground deeply enough to get away from the evaporative influence of sun and wind. In the summer, after a rain the soil dries out quickly to a depth of about 3 inches, particularly if it is bare or if it is loosened by cultiva - tion. We get a ruin. It takes at least a half inch in eastern Nebraska to wet this dry layer. If it rains 1 inch, only half of it gets down deeply enough to be saved. The other half is in position to evaporate before another rain comes. For this reason summer fallowing is very ineffective in this region (Eastern Nebraska). At Lincoln we have summer fallowed a piece of gentle slope land for 5 years continuously.* These are the percentages of the annual rainfall stored each sea - son; 24.4, 18.8, 1.3, 12.3, 19.1. During the five years 127.67 inches of rain fell. We stored in surface and subsoil only 21.42 inches or only 16.8 per cent 61 what fell. In the driest year, 1930, we stored only .20 inch out of 14.97 inches precipitation. In no year did we store much more than to raise an average crop and we could have raised that much crop anyway without fallow. You can set it down as a general principle for this section that in order to make the most of summer rainfall, land must be in crop. Crop shades the ground, and reduces wind velocity, and thus reduces evaporation. It rains, and there are roots to compete immediately ■with evaporation for the water in the surface soil. To be sure, you cannot store water in the soil ordinarily while crop is growing, but you can grow crop on the water that otherwise would go to waste . * Kiesselbach, T. A., Arthur Anderson, and J. C. Russcl. Subsnil moisture and crop sequence in relation to alfalfa production. Jour. Amer. Soc. Agron. 26:422-442, 193t. </seg>
            <seg id="p202">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE There are sections of Nebraska where normally the rain is not enough to safely produce a crop every year. An additional supply is necessary. Therefore summer fallowing must be employed. The west - ern part of the state is such a section. Farmers there have learned that the very best way to summer fallow is to corregate the land by tillage with duck foot implements. Thereby a small rain is concen - trated in furrows where it soaks deeper than on level tillage and to thai extent is better conserved. To a limited degree they have come to sparsely plant fallow land to crop or leave it sparsely covered with Russian thistle. Planting corn or sorghum in rows 3 or 4 widths apart is said to be very successful. In my opinion, one of the best times to make the most of precipita - tion is in the interval between the planting times of wheat and corn. It is an interval in which we get about 40 per cent of our precipitation. And it is the interval when we have the least to do to conserve the most. Some of this precipitation comes as snow. We cannot always keep it just where it falls. We can use furrow drills and probably should in Western Nebraska, and be particular to drill east and west, and thus keep some of the snow in our wheat fields. We can do more strip farming than we do, particularly in strips east by west and reduce the breadth of wind sweep. We can subscribe to the shelter belt program and catch the snow with trees, and thus grow trees with the moisture. But for stubble ground and stalk land, we need do nothing. It is surprising how many people there are who think that it is necessary to stir the ground or do something to conserve water over winter and through the spring. Election day or there abouts, I saw a man in Custer County in a sandy field with a tractor, discing. The field had a good covering of dead grass sufficient to hold drifting snow and prevent soil blowing. What good did he think he was doing? Every spring just as soon as frost disappears, farmers get out and disc up stubble fields, and cut stalks and rake them up and burn them. and start discing. Is it spring fever or do they think they are doing something. What do they think they are doing? A great many will say that it is necessary for water conservation. Butj every season there will be in the same neighborhoods a few who will say that it is necessary to get the land cleaned off so it will dry off so that plows will scour, or to loosen up the ground that got water logged and compacted over winter, or so they will not be caught by a lot of wet land just when they must rush their spring planting. This only goes to prove that after all there is nothing better for conserving </seg>
            <seg id="p203">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION late fall, winter, and spring precipitation than stubble, stalks, and dead vegetation. Fall and Winter Tillage. I am opposed to late fall and winter plowing ordinarily in regions where the object is moisture conservation. Late fall plowed fields are always drier in both surface and subsoil than spring plowed land. Consequently they are warmer. Consequently nitrates develop more rapidly, and crops make more vigorous early growth. On thin soil and in wet years this may be advantageous. But normally, in a country where moisture is a limiting factor in the summer time, it is a dis - advantage because such crop later wilts and fires and under-yields spring plowed land. However, in a wet summer when there would be wasteage of water from weeds growing in stubble fields that are to go into spring crops, something should be done, either mowing or discing, or blank listing. The latter is very sensible and is to be recommended. It is one prac - tice that can advantageously be done on contours. Observe that I am not condemning early fall tillage. Farther west in the state where winter precipitation is less certain and where spring precipitation is frequently insufficient, the very best thing a farmer can do to insure his next season crop of spring planted grain is to blank list or otherwise till his stubble ground immediately after har - vest or later if the earlier date is impossible. But he wants to do it early enough so that there is some cover of volunteer or weeds on it when fall comes to catch snow and prevent wind blowing. In general if he has not got around to do it by three weeks of frost, he had better not do it at all. When weeds begin to sprout in the spring, then is the time to get busy. May and June, normally are our wettest months. Then is the time to put the finishing touches on water conservation. Felds then had better be "black". Soil in the spring of the year has a decided tendency to run together. Just as soon as enough rain has come that frost cracks close up alto - gether, the ground had better be stirred. If it is plowed it had better be harrowed Immediately. Otherwise it may bake into hard clods, and the entire water content of the furrow slice, about 1 inch of rain may be lost. This is serious for seed bed preparation and germination. I will not say that spring seed beds should always be packed. In a dry season they should. If wet, they should not for they will get compact enough anyway. Land that is going into late row crops should be listed as soon as weeds begin to grow and as often as necessary should be cultivated </seg>
            <seg id="p204">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE precisely as a corn field. Here again is an opportunity to practice contouring. Prom June 1 to September 1 the sole objective of moisture con - servation is weed control. I well remember another dictum of my father, "Son", he said, when I objected to going to the field with a hoe "all there is to farming is fighting weeds." And I well remember an aged Bohemian in Dodge county who said, "The matter with agri - culture is that the young generation won't go down on their knees and pull weeds." As a boy it was always a mystery to me how dragging a light har - ro\jr over the lister ridges could possibly be any benefit to corn down in thej furrows when the harrow teeth did not come within a foot of stii-ring up soil around the plants. My father always taught that if you want to cultivate a thing you should do some digging around It. I knew then that farmers who harrowed corn once raised better corn than we, and farmers who harrowed twice raised better yet. I know now that done early enough a little loose dry soil around a plant prevents weed seeds germinating a plant, and that weed seeds except sunflower, cockle bur, and morning glory are very slow to germinate if there is a loose dry layer of soil at the surface, even only a half inch deep. | Why is it, that you have a nice clean corn field all laid by, and then you get a heavy July rain, and in a few days the ground is a solid mat of kprouting fox tail and crab grass. Simply that these seeds require compactness and moisture at the very surface to germinate. It is largely true that water in a cornfield can be as well conserved, and crop will yield as much if weeds are removed by scraping, as if the ground is cultivated. And yet, as a practical proposition, ground must be stirred, rather deeply in summer weather if weeds are to be in - expensively controlled, for shallow cultivated soil compacts more quickly in a heavy rain than deep and so weeds start faster. ] The compact se'ed bed conditions that we all want for alfalfa, sweet clover, and tame grass is precisely the conditions that favor the germination of weeds. The problem of weed control for newly seeded alfalfa, sweet clover, and tame grass is a bad one for the very seed bed conditions we want for those crops are precisely the conditions that favor germination of weeds. There are three ways to avoid it. (1). Seed the crop on weed free ground, made so by previous thorough preparation. (2). Seed in the fall when weeds will be killed by frost before they do damage and trust that the crop will grow faster than weeds the next season. (3). Plow in the spring, pack firmly, and seed the same day, and give the crop a chance to germinate and get growing before the deeply buried weed seeds get through. </seg>
            <seg id="p205">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION For wheat production the moat sensible things to do to make the most of rainfall is to prepare the seed bed early. Normally we can count on pretty fair rainfall during June and up to the middle of July. About June 10 wheat and oats stop using water extravagently. From then there is accumulations that in wet years amounts to a great deal. Then wheat is cut. Immediately grass begins to grow for the soil is compact and in ideal condition for weeds to germinate. If plowing can - not be begun at once, it is extremely sensible to disc, even right behind the harvester. Even a second discing may be advantageous. However, the sooner plowing can be done the better. Needless to say the weediest and wettest field need this most. In a dry season when there is no moisture to conserve it need not be done at all. If it were not for the weeds, stubble need not be plowed early, nor until weeds begin to grow for its shade and wind break effect are more meritorious than a soil mulch. I hope my remarks have not been confusing. I have mentioned certain practices. But practices must be modified to meet soil and weather conditions. If all soil and all weather was always just the same, and if all farmers were alike it would not be impossible to give a formula for the very best thing to do for each crop for every month of the year. As it is practices that are good once may be bad the next time. There are two ways out. First do consistently those things that experience on the average shows to be the best. That is what stations are for; to do the testing that farmers cannot do themselves. Second know the basic principles, and apply them to meet conditions. The basic principles are simple: Water soaks into ground if the soil is granular in structure or of a sort that does not swell shut when it gets wet. All you need to do is to handle it so that the water does not run away faster than it can soak in, and so handle it as to make the water soak deeply in spots at least. Water stored below 6 inches is safe against loss except through plants. To make it useful see that no plants grow except those that are of use to you. Water in the upper 3 inches may be quickly lost by evaporation. Shade, windbreak, low temperature, and high humidity are the essen - tials to the control of evaporation. It takes a half inch rain to wet the top six inches and any rain is % inch less effective when it must first go to wet up a dry 3 inch layer at the surface. I said that 10 inches of water will raise 50 bushels of corn per </seg>
            <seg id="p206">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE acre Normally we get about 25 which means that we grow corn on only 5 inches of our total rainfall. This same 5 inches of water will only produce 2-3 tons of alfalfa hay. Here at Lincoln after the subsoil has becoma thoroughly ex - hausted and the crop must grow on rainfall only like corn does, we still get as much as 2 tons per acre for an annual jrlald. This means that rainfall for alfalfa has about 3 times the efficiency as for corn. Why should this be? What are the phenomena connected with alfalfa cul - ture whereby it so increases efficiency of rainfall. First, it occupies the land continuously and all year round there is either a growing crop or a dense stubble standing in the way of water running down hill. Second, it begins to grow in March and from then on to November its rootlets in the surface soil are competing with the old sun for every small rain and for whatever water there is in the upper few inches that might quickly evaporate under bara conditions. Third, during a large portion of the season it densely shades the ground and keeps it cool and maintains a highly saturated static air blanket over the soil which further prevents evaporation of each and every rain. I ■ fourth. If it is a good stand, there are no weeds to compete with it, a;id rainfall goes only for u eful crop. TJVhen you are depressed at the inability of humans to grow more cropp on the rains that come, see no way out except to live in a wetter climate, go out and look at your alfalfa. It somehow makes a good job of it, and all the lessons of how to make the most of rainfall can be read out there in your alfalfa field. THE GEOGKAl'HIC DISTRIBUTION OP BINDWEED P. H. STEWART Extension Agronomist University of Nebraska There is in Nebraska a growing realization of the seriousness of bindweed as a weed pest. Many people are of the opinion that because bindweed showed up much more extensively and plainly in 1934, that it had suddenly spread very greatly. This is not true. The College of Agriculture and the County Agricultural Agents have for some fifteen years been_following the spread of bindweed and warning farmers of the seriousness of allowing it to get a foothold. (j)n the Wheat Improvement trains operated over the state in 1926 - 1927 and 1928, talks on bindweed were given at practically every stop, yet many who heard the discussions believed that this was "only </seg>
            <seg id="p207">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION a fool idea of the College professors" and that the bindweed menace was not a serious one. For the past several seasons, weed control meetings have been held over the state, and each year the interest and attendance has increased. Fig. 32 — The distribution of bindweed in Nebraska as shown by Agricultural Afients reports anil farm surveys. The dots show the relative distribution of the pest. What will the situation be by 1950? Due to the drouth in 1934, the annual weeds did not make their normal growth. Crop covering on the land was light or entirely absent. This condition put the deep rooted drouth resistant bindweed into prominence as it made its growth on subsoil moisture and stood out plainly on the landscape, not being masked by the normal vegetation. Because of this condition, folks noticed bindweed patches when before they escaped attention. For this reason folks believed that bindweed had suddenly spread greatly. The facts are that it has been present for several years, but the 1934 drouth was the "ride of Paul Revere" that called it to the public's attention. Bindweeds have been known in the United States for more than 150 years, and were reported in Nebraska nearly fifty years ago. A survey was recently made, through County Agricultural Agents, in an effort to determine the areas of infestation. Figuer 32 shows the relative bindweed infestation in the various Nebraska counties. It has been found on the Gumbo Pierre Shale soils of northwestern Nebraska. It is in the sand-hill towns and villages, and also about the farmsteads in some cases. ' Numerous patches are to be found in the irrigated valleys of the Platte River and on the high plains of western Nebraska. East central Nebraska has several badly infested areas, and the same is true of northeastern and southeastern Nebraska. Hardly a town - ship in the state has escaped infestations. </seg>

MECHANICAL, METHODS FOR BINDWEED ERADICATION 1 by C. W. SMITH Agriculture Engineer, University of Nebraska The Agricultural Engineering Department of the University of Ne - braska has been called upon repeatedly in recent years to suggest and even to assist in constructing machines to be used for the eradication of bindweed. Professor E. E. Brackett, Chairman of the department, sensing the need of investigational work along this line, suggested to the author early in 1934 that he tackle the problem. In June, an effort was made to lay out a plan of work aimed to assist farmers in selecting tools for mechanical control. </seg>
            <seg id="p210">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ■ Commercial duck-foot machines were loaned to us by the Allis- Chalmers Manufacturing company, the John Deere Plow company, the International Harvester company, and the Oliver Farm Equipment company. The field work was begun on June 13th for which two farms were used, one the Shuman farm three miles southeast of Denton, and the other the Albert Retzlaff farm three miles southeast of Walton. The former was used only for the purpose of observing the operation of tools in the field and no obligation was assumed for continuing the work further than what was necessary to serve our own purpose. The latter place served as the basis for a three-cornered cooperative agree - ment between the owner, Mr. Albert Retzlaff, The International Har - vester company, and the Agricultural Engineering Department; the substance of which agreement was that work was to be continued on a 30-acre field until the weed was practically destroyed. The vines of the bindweed were large on both these farms at the time the field work was begun. The vines and roots wrapped around the shanks of the duck-foot machines and catised considerable trouble. ThiB trouble only occurs the first time over such a field if the cultiva - tions are made frequently enough to prevent vine growth. A trial of several types of equipment in fields with large vines and unmolested roots indicated that the rod weeder is one of the best tools for such circumstances. It cleans itself of the vines and roots fairly well. After the first time over it was felt that it did not do quite as satisfactory Fig. 34 — One of the commercial duck-foot machines for bindweed eradication. 1 Paper presented before the Joint Meeting of the Nebraska Farm Equipment Association and the Nebraska Crop Growers Association, January 9, 1935— Organized Agriculture. » </seg>

The rod weeder destroys most plants to a depth of several inches but occasionally one will merely be buried slightly and these make it necessary to cover the field sooner than otherwise would be necessary. At this point it must be recalled that it would have been better if work for the season of 1934 could have been started at least by May 1st instead of June 13th, and, if that had been done, the large, troublesome vines would have been avoided and much of the need for the rod weeder eliminated. The conventional (pushed) duck-feet cause trouble, occasionally, of another sort. They fail to scour. Dirt begins to accumulate near the heel where attached to the shank and gradually builds up on the blade until finally the loose dirt is being pushed along much like hay is pushed by sweep teeth. Where this trouble proved quite serious in Lancaster County and also at Hampton, Nebraska, though somewhat less troublesome there than in Lancaster County, there are many regions of the state, not necessarily sandy, where the duck-feet scour Fig. 35 — Typical Duck-foot shovels on a commercial machine. satisfactorily. Mr. Brown's duck-foot machine of Geneva was observed after being used and all duck-feet had scoured perfectly. The rugged construction of most commercial machines, their flexibility and one's ability to interchange various widths of duck-feet on them make an appeal to the farmer who has a large acreage to summer fallow. Some have found uses for these machines in seed-bed preparation. There seemed to be a tremendous urge on the part of farmers to be able to adapt some of the machines which they already owned to this summer fallow work and thus save a considerable part of the price of a new machine. Looking at the problem from that standpoint, it seemed that the lister was one of the most common implements on Nebraska farms. Our first effort was an attempt to make an attachment for the Chase two-row tractor lister that would do the job. By referring to </seg>

Figure 36, the result of this effort can be seen. A V-Blade, 7 foot, 7 inches from tip to tip, was hung beneath its frame. In fact, it was a large duck-foot. Having observed the dirt accumulated on the center portion of the conventional duck-foot and vines and roots cling to the shanks, it was aimed to avoid these difficulties by making a pulled duck-foot instead of ; a pushed duck-foot. A leading shank having the general shape of a sled runner but with a knife edge was attached to the point of the large V-blade. That this would tend to clear itself of trash is obvious and it did in tests. Little trouble in regard to scouring occurred. Taking the whole season thru, Mr. Retzlaff pro - nounced this tool the most satisfactory. There are times when the ground is hard that it must be weighted to get penetration. The V-blade and shanks were made of old grader blades. The material used in making this conversion was a small item but there is a considerable amount of labor requiring the facilities of a blacksmith shop. . One year before this program was started, Mr. W. J. Runnalls made a 6-foot straight blade and attached it to a two-row, horse-drawn. Chase lister for the Animal Husbandry Department. This has been used two years by that department. It has been pulled by a large, four-horse team. Figure 37 is an illustration of it. When the ground is loose and free from trash, it is quite satisfactory. Otherwise it has little or no tendency to clean itself. Penetration is extremely hard to get with it. While it is the most easily installed, it should not be recommended without its shortcomings being fully realized. </seg>

This machine was used satisfactorily at the Agricultural College for bindweed eradication. The gang plow is even more common on Nebraska farms than the lister. It could not be seen at first how this implement could be adapted to summer fallowing. Not until after all field work of this past season had been completed did we attempt to convert a gang plow. Figure 38 shows the result of this attempt. A V-blade having a cut of 6 to 8 feet was hung on the two beams of the regular gang and a third beam attached on the furrow wheel side of the plow. The V in this case consists of two perfectly flat blades which can be removed individually and sharpened. The V-blade on the lister had right angle bends on the ends of the two blades where attached to the center sled-runner shank, and can not be sharpened as easily. This conversion took more labor than any other job thus far tackled. The side furrow wheel had to be moved out to give room for another beam. The rear furrow wheel had to be replaced with a large one running upright. Its mount - ing was moved to the center beam and in general reconstructed to give a greater lift. Inasmuch as the plow normally runs with two wheels in the furrows and one on the land and for this new duty all wheels run on the surface, considerable thought must be given to the changed conditions. This machine has not been tried. It is merely shown as one of our efforts to help farmers see means of converting present machinery to this new duty. In addition to our own efforts, we have observed several conversions made by farmers. Mr. D. R.

When making such arrangements It is very important to get duck-feet to overlap enough to avoid miss - ing plants. Several farmers are using regular moldboard plows. It is difficult to make plows work satisfactorily when the dirt gets as dry and loose as it was this past season. We plowed 50 acres of bindweed-infested ground once but did not attempt to repeat with the plow. A plow does splendid work in that it cuts everything and gets greater and more nearly uniform depth than summer fallowing machines. It stirs the soil much more than is necessary. Some are using the one-way disk plow. Many efforts have been made to construct a simple machine without any reference to an adaptation to present farm machines. We made such an effort, the first result of which is shown in Figure 39. It is called the A-Prame machine. The same idea was used in this machine as was used on the V-Blade lister, namely a pulled duck-foot, only three smaller duck-feet were used instead of one large one.

During the summer while the ground was in a fine, powdery condition, this machine was the most popular with the operators. After the rains it was not quite as satisfactory as the V-Blade lister. When the ground is hard, this machine has to be loaded considerably to get penetration. There was much of promise in the machine. It cleared itself of trash fairly well. It skipped no plants. It had a minimum of stirring or tilling action on the soil. </seg>
            <seg id="p216">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE k second effort to construct something entirely apart from an adaptation to any other machine resulted in what came to be called The Grasshopper-Sled.

It will operate, though not as satisfactory as the A-Frame machine. It proved to have the heaviest draft per foot of cut of any machine we used. It would have a place where it could be supplemented with a plow when the ground becomes hard. The dust about a summer fallowing machine and cultivator was unusually bad this past dry season. The punishment a driver must take under these conditions was lessened very materially by the use of pneumatic tires which were used on the tractor at the Retzlaff farm the greater part of the season. One caution is very important in preparing a field for summer fal - lowing and that is to destroy all trash or stubble. Do not plow it under. Such materials when plowed under wrap on the knives and shovels of summer fallowing machines during succeeding cultivations and become terribly aggravating. We would recommend burning trash and stubble.

            <seg id="p217">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION the honor you have done me in again inviting me to address this joint session of the Nebraska Crop Growers Association and the Nebraska Agricultural Engineers. As a former president of both societies I am gratified to note the continued growth and interest shown by such a large attendance as is here this morning. I probably appreciate better than you do the opportunity that you have as a society to focus public attention on real farm problems. I recognize that this power of your societies is growing, and with the same breadth with which I con - gratulate you I feel that I must throw out a warning that with your increased power goes an increased responsibility. The difficult times in which we are living have brought to us. new problems. As the program today so well points out, many of our present difficulties and problems involve not only production but have to do with a very large degree of conservation. As I have pointed out before at these meetings we must concern ourselves not only with the present but we must look into the future in order to safeguard the trust which we, as farmers, of Nebraska soil have inherited. Folks Now Bindweed Conscious. This morning we had a fine presentation of the situation here in Nebraska as it is effected by the presence of perennial Bindweed. It delights me to find so many men interested in this subject and willing to talk about it, for some of us who have lived and worked with this pest can recall the time not so many years ago when farmers generally were unwilling to talk openly about this noxious weed for fear that it would depress the value of their farms or give them a bad reputa - tion with their neighbors. I can remember with what difficulty County Agent Maxwell of Douglas county and myself hunted for a farm on which to demonstrate chlorate treatment of bindweed, and finally had to give it up and put our demonstration on a highway, a railway yard, and a school ground; and in those instances the attendance of farmers was very limited, and we found it expendient to put up signs along the road telling what we had done and pointing out what could be done with this treatment for eradication of bindweed. However, that apparently has all been changed and now we are willing to get together and talk these matters over, and even discuss programs which will lead to mutual cooperation and benefit in the communities where this weed has taken a foothold. It may well be said that we cannot legislate these weeds out of Ne - braska. However, that reminds me of a story which a friend of mine, who recently died, loved to tell. It appears that a bright young man had been forced to take a girl friend of his sisters out to a dinner party, and it is to be noted that the young lady was none too bright nor enter - taining. So when the young man called for his forth cup of coffee. </seg>
            <seg id="p218">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE she cjoyly remarked, "won't that coffee keep you awake?" to which the young man replied, "I don't know, but it may help." So it is with our laws for weed control. I think that if they are on the statute books they may help, and I know that talking about them and focusing public interest in such meetings as we are having here, will bring the presence of these laws to the attention of those who may benefit by them. Our Present Bindweed Law. I believe that the enforcement of bindweed laws such as we have on our statute books revolves not so much around the draftmanship of the law as around its interpretation and administration. By that I mean that good laws have failed in their purpose because of poor administration, and poor laws well administered and fearlessly in - terpreted have brought about the desired results. Tjhe present bindweed law introduced in the last session as House Roll No. 74 by Hon. C. F. Overbeck of Gage County, has much to com - mend it. With the will to carry out the provisions of that act, and with enough forceful men resident in a community working with the county organization who will cooperate, the law as now on our statute books, could be made to do a great deal of good. However, without an ideal set-up and working with county officials who are not farm minded there are some changes which to my mind would make the present law more workable, and which I do not believe, if incorporated, would be harmful. tender Section I. of the present act authorization and direction is delegated to the county authority, "to provide material and equipment for the eradication and control of field bindweed." I would make that section stronger and more mandatory by specifying definitely what was to be done and when it was to be done by the county officials after they have received a precinct petition in proper form. I believe that a pro - vision for action by the county officials forthwith or within 10 days following the filing ,of the petition would be a wise provision, and I would provide a place such as the County Agent's office, or the office of the County Clerk, in the absence of the County Agent, where the supplies mentioned would be made accessable. The reason for this is that any board of County Commissioners who did not care to be forced into this work could very easily sidetrack the effectiveness of this law by merely postponing action, or they could point out probably without danger of contradiction that there was no money available, and the law having made no provision for funds would become inoperative. While it is undoubtedly expedient to lodge discretionary powers with somebody it is equally true that procrastination is a human trait, and unless there are provisions which are mandatory I feel that many county boards would have difficulty in getting around to take up this </seg>
            <seg id="p219">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION matter in the face of the many demands which are now being made on their time. Must Provide Funds. Section II, in my' opinion, should make some provision for not only the promulgation but the dissemination of the rules and regulations after they have been formulated. My suggestion is that it would b« well to have them published and made the subject of local discussion so that the farmers can learn where and when they can expect the "material and equipment" will be forthcoming, and how they are to use it. These regulations might well be made part of the public record and a copy lodged with the Secretary of State. It might well be pointed out under the criticism of Section II that no provision has here been made for the funds which are to be used to pay for the "material and equipment." A provision in the law might well be Incorporated which would provide for the purchase of these materials and equipment out of the general fund, or by through some trust fund set aside for this specific work. It is probable that if the purchasing was to be done through the regular county machinery there would be less opportunity for abuse provision for which could be well incorporated into the original statute. It is to be inferred from a cursory reading of Section III, that the method of attack contemplated by the law is limited to the chlorate treatment and no account is taken of the fact that in at least some sec - tions of the State it has been demonstrated that the best methods of eradication can be carried on with the use of horse power in a pro - gram of starvation. I note also in this section that provision has been made for charging the expense to the property owner in case the land is badly effected, but there is no provision for the collection of the charge after it has been mads. While I am mindful that it might be con - fiscatory in some instances to provide for the collection through the use of the same machinery which is used to collect taxes, yet I can but believe that no elected county officer would see fit to avail himself of such provisions, were they incorporated in the law, and it surely would make it possible to bring extreme cases to time where local con - ditions warrant. Under Section III., there is also the provision for the amount of work that should be done on badly effected farms, and it strikes me that the amount of growth which is normally present in the plant, to say nothing of the spreading by artificial means which is con - tinually going on, warrants an increase in the 2% provision. I mean by that that we should .have a law which allows us to kill the plant at least as fast as it grows, or we will never get out of our present infection. </seg>
            <seg id="p220">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Must Cooperate in Program. Of course I am a rugged, to say nothing of being a ragged in - dividualist, and while I cannot support much of the present agricultural program with their attempts with doing away with individual initia - tive, yet I must recognize that there are functions of government which should make it possible for the greatest good to the greatest number, that we provide for government control, or at least an opportunity for the government to set up the machinery in communities where gov - ernment control of such programs as bindweed eradication may well be the subject of legislation, for I am certain that if we do not all pull together in a program of control, whether we are forced to by law or not, we will have bindweed encroaching on every farm in the state, as it has already encroached on every county. I think that the man who selected the motto engraved over the door of our new Capitol had the bindweed in mind when he caused to he there engraved, "The Salvation of the State is Watchfulness in the Citizen." UTILIZING GRASS IN FATTENING YOUNG CATTLE FOR MARKET C. W. CAMPBELL. Chairman — Dept. of Animal Husbandry Kansas State College Cattle feeding is looked upon by many as a gamble. Not long ago there appeared in a prominent agricultural paper the statement that *'it looks as if the cattle feeding game is becoming more and more a certain way to lose money". This attitude is the result, in the main, of two outstanding facts. ( 1 ) Cattle feeding lends itself more readily to speculation that most any other farm project and many cattle feed - ers have followed a speculative rather than a sound plan of feeding. '•' (2) Large numbers of cattle feeders have suffered heavy financial losses. The financial status of cattle feeding can, however, be materially improved by a more general substitution of (1) a long time feeding program based upon major demand for a program that too often ignores major demand or an in-and-out attempt to outsmart the mar - ket, and (2) up-to-date methods of feeding and management for methods no longer adapted to present day conditions. Degambling Cattle Feeding. Cattle feeding based upon the program suggested is just as stable </seg>
            <seg id="p221">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION as any, and more stable than most, agricultural activities. In other words, cattle feeding based upon major demand and proper methods of feeding can be made a dependable and profitable farm enterprise. Today major demand calls for good quality, well finished steers weighing less than 1,000 pounds when marketed and good quality, well finished heifers weighing less than 750 pounds. In this connection it might be well to remind you that packer representatives have repeatedly stated that 80 per cent or more of the beef cattle demand today is for the kind just described. It is true that markets accept any kind of cattle one offers for sale, but the price for kinds other than those for which major demand exists is often a ruinous price to the feeder. It is also true that heavy cattle occasionally bring a higher price per pound than light cattle, but it should be remembered that the demand for heavy cattle is lim - ited as to numbers; also, and of even more importance, that a 1200 pound or heavier finished steer must sell for $1 to $2 more per hun - dred than a 900 pound or lighter finished steer to insure the same return for feed, labor, etc. It is fortunate that the kind of cattle for which major demand exists (light cattle) can be finished for market more economically than the kind for which major demand does not exist (heavy cattle). As a matter of fact, it requires approximately only two-thirds as much feed to produce a hundred pounds of gain on a 6 to 8 months old calf as it does on a three year old steer. Cattle Feeding Methods. Methods of feeding also have a tremendous influence on cattle feeding returns. Despite the fact that great progress has been made in methods of feeding, one of the tragedies of agriculture today lies in the fact ill-adapted methods of feeding and management are so often used in finishing beef cattle for market. The time has come when a feeder must know why he feeds what he feeds and why one method is profit - able and another is unprofitable. This is not an impossible task. The information needed is readily available. The thing most needed is a willingness to study, accept, and apply this information. Cattle feeding operations may be grouped under two general heads — winter feeding and summer feeding. Summer feeding may be fur - ther grouped under three sub-heads: (1) feeding in a dry lot, (2) feeding on grass, (3) feeding on grass part of the time and in a dry lot part of the time. This discussion is based largely upon the possibility *of utilizing grass in fattening young cattle for market. This subject is worthy </seg>
            <seg id="p222">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE of thoughtful consideration for at least three reasons. (1) The pro - duction of more grass throughout the middle west is absolutely essential in meeting the new conditions confronting agriculture. (2) The methods of utilizing grass that have been followed in the past are becoming less and less profitable as the years come and go. (3) Any new methods developed for the utilization of grass by beef cattle will, of necessity, have to be based upon marketing finished cattle at a young age and since young cattle will not get fat enough for slaughter purposes on grass alone they must be fed concentrates somewhere along the line, if one hopes to use this class of cattle in utilizing grass profit - ably in the production of finished beef. Calf Management. Keeping a cow herd and creep feeding the calf crop and what we term the deferred full feeding method are means of utilizing grass in fattening young cattle for market that I want particularly to bring to your attention today. Creep feeding is an intensive method that requires careful atten - tion to many details. Usually men handling comparatively small units are most successful, although, men handling as many as 150 cows have been outstandingly successful. Success in creep feeding calves also depends upon several fundamental factors, including: (1) Good quality calves — This is imperative; poor quality calves simply will not get this job done satisfactory. ( 2) Early calves — dropped in January and February. Later calves just do not fit into this plan. (3) Starting calves on a creep as soon as they will nibble grain and before they go to pasture. Waiting until they go to pas - ture or until they are two or three months old to start them on grain means sure and certain disappointing results. (4) The consumption of 8 to 10 bushel of grain per head by October 1. Materially less consumption of grain before this date means a loss of early cheap gains. (5) Full feeding 30 to 9 0 days in a dry lot after October 1 to insure the finish necessary to command the most profitable prices. Using Grass in Feeding Program. The possibilities that lie in this method of utilizing grass in fatten - ing young cattle for market are seen in the experience of one of our farmers for the past three years. During this period the average calving date of his cows has been January 31; the calves have aver - aged 283 days of age and 687 pounds in weight when marketed and the net profit for the entire herd has averaged $16.01 per cow per year. </seg>
            <seg id="p223">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION It should be emphasized that this profit of $16.01 per cow per year is over and above all costs, including interest on investment; depreci - ation; bull service; labor; a most liberal charge for all feeds con - sumed, etc. These results are not exceptional. They are typical of those secured by several farmers in your state as well as mine. This is not only an excellent way to utilize grass; it is the best way possible to utilize roughage, especially those of low value or entirely unsaleable, for the cow has no equal in handling this type of feed. Management Pointers. A so-called deferred plan of full feeding as a method of utilizing grass in fattening young cattle for market has engaged our attention for several years. Our early studies indicated that a method including wintering, grazing, and full feeding, that would enable one to produce fat yearlings for market by or before the middle of November might be worked out. Many questions arose relative to procedure. Five in particular recurred with increasing frequency. (1) Which will be more satisfactory for this purpose, calves or yearlings? (2) How well should they be wintered when this general plan is followed? (3) How long should they be grazed before starting them on full feed? (4) Should they be full fed on grass or in a dry lot? (5) Should the winter allowance of grain be discontinued abruptly, grad - ually, or not at all when they go to grass? Since it was a long step down from the aged steer, which so many had been handling, to a calf, one of our early tests involved a com - parison of yearlings and calves, wintered well, grazed 90 days and then full fed 100 days in a dry lot. Both groups produced nicely finished cattle that dressed approximately 61 per cent, but the calves returned a profit of ?3.73 per head more than the yearlings. Anticipating a continued trend toward lighter cattle, the Kansas Station has since used calves exclusively in its study of this problem. In view of the fact that for many years cattlemen who utilized grass in fattening cattle for market had been interested in maximum gains on grass and knew from experience that a thin steer will gain more on grass than a fleshy steer, it was difficult for them to become recon - ciled to the idea of wintering cattle as well as we had in our experi - ments. This situation demanded a series of tests having for their main purpose a comparison of wintering with and without some grain, graz - ing 90 days, then full feeding 100 days in a dry lot. Two lots of calves were used each of three years in making this comparison. The only difference in the method of handling these two lots of calves lay in the fact that one lot received an average of 4.55 </seg>
            <seg id="p224">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE pounds of corn per head daily during the wintering phase and the - other lot received no grain. The calves that received the grain during the winter returned $3.00 per head more profit than those that re - ceived no grain, demonstrating the fact that greatest returns from this genpral plan will be secured if calves are wintered well before grazing and then full feeding. jCattlemen in general had the feeling that better results could be - secured if cattle handled in accordance with this general plan were fed on grass after August 1, rather than in a dry lot. A series of tests were started in the fall of 1929 with the hope of finding a definite answer to this question. Three lots of calves were used each year. All three lots were wintered well, each calf gaining around 270 pounds during the wintering period. They were turned on pasture May 1 each year. Lot 1, grazed 90 days then full fed 100 days in a dry lot, returned a profit that averaged $11.78 per head per year. Lot 2, grazed 90 days then full fed 100 days on bluestem pasture, returned a profit of $4.17 per head. Lot 3, full fed on bluestem grass 150 days after May 1, returned a profit of $0.69 per head. The general appearance of the cattle in Lots 1 and 2 at the close of each year's test, particularly the hair, justified a discrimination in favor of those full fed in a dry lot. It should, however, be mentioned that the cattle finished on bluestem grass were found to be better on thej hooks than they appeared to be on foot, there being less than 1 per cent difference in their dressing percentage and no material difference in covering or color. The cattle full fed on grass 150 days after May 1 made the least profit. This is in keeping with several other tests conducted at the Kabsas Station. In all cases, full feeding on bluestem grass the entire grazing season has proved to be a decidedly unsatisfactory way of full feeding cattle of any age at our station. A test finished at the Kansas Station November 7, 1934, helps to ans wer the question as to whether the winter grain allowance should be descontinued abruptly, gradually, or not at all, when cattle handled along these lines go to grass in the spring. I Three lots of calves were wintered well, grazed 90 days and then full fed 100 days in a dry lot. In Lot 1 the winter allowance of grain was discontinued abruptly when the calves went to grass. These calves made a profit of $9.8 7 per head. In Lot 2 the winter allowance of grain was discontinued gradually over a period of 28 days. These calves made a profit of $5.17 per head. In Lot 3 the winter allowance of grain was continued through the entire grazing period. These calves made a profit of $3.0G per head. </seg>
            <seg id="p225">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION We also have one year's results with calves wintered well, grazed 90 days and then full fed 100 days — 60 days on bluestem grass and the final 40 days in a dry lot. This lot did almost as well as the calves wintered well, grazed 9 0 days and fed 100 days in a dry lot. This plan looks promising but this test must be repeated at least twice more before definite conclusions may be drawn. Summary. A summarization of the more important features which this study has developed include the statements that follow. The best method we have tried to date over a period of ten years is to winter calves well, graze without other feed for approximately 90 days, then full feed in a dry lot around 100 days. Some of the ad - vantages of this method are: 1. Large amounts of roughage can be utilized during the winter - ing phase. 2. Grass can be utilized to its maximum capacity during that portion of the year when it is at its best. 3. Young cattle dressing 60 per cent or better can be produced. This is the kind the packers really want. Only a very small percentage of the trade demands a higher finish. 4. A maximum of gain can be produced from a minimum of grain. This method requires the feeding of approximately 40 bushels of corn per head and we aim to produce 600 pounds of gain for each 40 bushels of corn fed. Our average over a period of several years has been around 625 pounds. Blue grass, mixed grass, bluestem grass or sweet clover, as well as bluestem, pasture are equally suitable for this method of handling cattle. One fact should be emphasized — this method of producing beef demands the use of good quality cattle. Plain cattle will not get the job done. A portion of the cattle from these tests have been killed in our own laboratory where an intensive study of the effects of grass on the color of beef was made. In making this study the carcasses of the cattle under discussion were compared with the carcasses of similar cattle that had been full fed in a dry lot without having had access to grass after they were weaned the previous year. These studies showed that grass had had no influence whatever on the color of muscle tissue and very little on the color of fat. The small effect on the color of fat detected by laboratory apparatus was not sufficient to lessen the grade or result in any discrimination by market men. </seg>

When -one attempts to analyze and appraise all the available evi - dence represented by the cold statistics relating to the current live - stock and feed situation in this country, the resulting conclusion reached seems almost unbelievable in the light of what the situation has been in previous years. Yet, to you stockmen of Nebraska and adjoining states, who have been forced by the drastic feed shortage of 1934 to reduce your herds and cut down on your livestock feeding operations, and who are wondering how you are going to manage to get through the winter until new feed and pasture becomes available next spring, there ia ( no doubt, I am sure, as to the grim reality of present conditions. There ia a possibility, however, that you may not realize what the present situation means with respect to probable developments during the next two or three years, and in consequence thereof you have not considered fully the steps you should take to maintain the proper balance in your feed and livestock production program. I am certain that most of the consuming public of this country have little apprecia - tion of what has transpired because of last year's drought, and are not prepared for the inevitable reduction in meat supplies and advancing meat prices that are in prospect very shortly. It is with the thought in mind that possibly you have not given full consideration as to what is likely to develop out of the present livestock and feed situation, that I have attempted to bring together such evidence as we have and to analyze it in relation to what has happened in the past. It is not my purpose, however, to attempt to present any suggestions whatever as to what you as individuals, or as a group, should do in the way of mak - ing readjustments, or of formulating your own program of action, be - cause that is something which you must determine for yourselves on the basis of your own individual circumstances. Summary of 1934 Crop Production. Primarily because of unfavorable weather and crop conditions in some sections in 1933, and because of the very widespread drought in 1934, the supplies of all feed and forage for livestock at the beginning of the present winter were the smallest in many years. The supply of feed grains was the smallest since 1881, and the 1934 hay crop was the smallest in the 16 years for which comparable figures are avail - able. Since the feed shortage is more serious with respect to grain, especially corn, then it is with hay and forage, the position of hog producers is more critical than that of a producers of other kinds of </seg>
            <seg id="p227">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION livestock. After allowing for a minimum carry-over of feed grains at the end of the season, for increased imports, for somewhat larger feeding of wheat, and for the apparent supply of other grains, concen - trates, and mill feeds, it has been estimated that the total quantity available for feeding livestock during the 1934-35 feeding season will hardly exceed 60,000,000 tons, and may be several million tons less. The significance of this figure is appreciated when it is realized that it is nearly a third less than what was fed in the previous season and nearly 40 per cent less than the average fed in the preceding nine years. This feed shortage is largely west of the Mississippi River and is most acute in the two Dakotas, and in Missouri, Kansas, and Ne - braska. Feed grain production in Nebraska last year was only about 7 per cent of the average of recent years; in South Dakota it was 11 per cent, in Kansas 13 per cent, and in Missouri 15 per cent. Livestock Numbers. The feed situation would be much more serious if livestock numbers had not been so greatly reduced this past year. The combined number of livestock on farms at the start of winter in terms of grain-consuming units was 19 per cent less than that of a year ago and total numbers of meat animals at the beginning of 1935 are probably the smallest in 35 years. The reduction in livestock numbers which occurred last year was the greatest for any single year of which we have record. Further - more, this is probably the first instance of record that the numbers of each species of livestock were reduced in the same year. Heretofore, a reduction in one species was usually accompanied by an increase in at least one of the other species. Although the official estimates of total numbers of livestock in this country at the beginning of 1935 will not be made until the middle of next month, it is probable that they will show cattle numbers to be near the low level reached in 1928, hog numbers the smallest in many years, and sheep numbers reduced con - siderably. These reductions resulted partly from the operation of the Government's hog-adjustment program and partly from the influence of the drought which had its beginning in 1933 and became so wide - spread last year. Because the time factor is such an important element in livestock production this great reduction in livestock numbers is much more serious than a similar reduction would be in other major agricultural enterprises or in any of the manufacturing industries. With favorable climatic conditions a crop shortage of one year can be made up by good yields in the following year. Most manufacturers usually can speed up operations quickly and increase their output in short order to meet any scarcity or any increase in demand. In the case of live - stock production, however, biological laws continue to operate and </seg>
            <seg id="p228">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the rate and volume of output of finished animals ready for slaughter is regulated by the amount of time required in the production process. The time element as you well know is shortest with respect to hogs and greatest with respect to cattle. In other words, hog production can be expanded more quickly than that of cattle or sheep, hence we can expect the existing hog shortage to be corrected before that of cattle. A study of the factors involved, however, indicates very clearly that there can be no expansion in hog production until the 1935 fall crop is farrowed and that the expansion must be very limited until the 1936 spring pig crop is produced. The Hog Situation. In order to visualize clearly the real significance of the present hog situation we need to examine some of the statistics on hog production in past years and compare them with the figures for 1934 and the probable figures for 1935 and 1936. For several years the Bureau of Agricultural Economics has been making estimates of the spring and fall pig crops based on records supplied by hog producers through the rural mail carriers. In the years from 1926 to 1933, inclusive, the annual pig crop of this country ranged from 74,000,000 head to 82,000,000 head and in more recent years it averaged slightly more than 81,000,000. Three fourths of this crop is produced in the North Central States comprising the Corn Belt, and half the crop is produced in the seven Corn Belt States west of the Mississippi River. During the last half of 1933 the relationship of corn prices to hog prices became unfavorable for the feeding of hogs. Furthermore, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration in the fall of 1933 inaugurated its program for the curtailment of hog production in order to bring about an improvement in hog prices. These factors caused hog producers to breed fewer sows, with the result that the spring pig crop in 1934 was about 28 per cent smaller than that in 1933. The feed shortage resulting from the drought caused producers to make an even greater percentage reduction in the fall pig crop of 1934, with the result that the total pig crop of last year numbered slightly less than 53,000,000 head as compared with nearly 82,000,000 in 1933. The crop in the Corn Belt totaled less than 40,000,000 head as com - pared with more than 63,000,000 in the previous year. It should be kept in mind that the 12 Corn Belt States usually furnish about 90 per cent of the hogs that go into commercial slaughter. With a reduction of about 24,000,000 head in the 1934 pig crop in - dicated in this area, it is obvious that hog slaughter during 1935 will be greatly reduced. The spring pig crop of last year began moving to market early last fall and because of the feed shortage the propor - tion of the crop marketed prior to January 1 was much larger than </seg>
            <seg id="p229">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION average. This means that the proportion of the 1934 crop remaining to be marketed is very small and that hog slaughter throughout 1935 will be the smallest in many years. On the basis of the indicated size of the 1934 pig crop, it is estimated that federally inspected slaughter of hogs from this crop which will be marketed during the 12 months ending with next September will total only about 30,000,000 head. Since about 11,800,000 head were slaughtered during the last three months of 1934, the slaughter under Federal inspection during the first nine months of this year is expected to be not more than 20,000, - 000 head. During the corresponding period of last year the total was more than 31,000,000 head. The pig survey conducted last month indicated a decrease of about 17 per cent in the number of so.ws to farrow this coming spring. A decrease to this extent would mean that the spring pig crop in the Corn Belt States would be about 5,500,000 head smaller than the spring crop of last year and 17,000,000 smaller than the spring crop of 1933. Such a decrease would be certain to result in smaller slaughter supplies of hogs during the last three months of 1935 than in the corresponding period of 1934. If the corn crop this year should be average or better, producers undoubtedly would feed their hogs longer and to heavier weights than usual. This would tend to further reduce hog marketings next fall and would increase the proportion marketed late in the winter. It appears, therefore, that total federally inspected slaughter of hogs during 1935 may be as small as 27,000,000 head, as compared with a yearly average of more than 45,000,000 during recent years. The significance of such a marked reduction in hog slaughter can be appreciated when we recall that there has been only one year since the present Federal Meat Inspection Service was established in late 1906 that inspected slaughter was less than 30,000,000 head, and that was in 1910 when the total was only 26,000,000 head. We have to go back to 1921 to find a year when the total was less than 40,000,000. Hog Price Prospects. , A reduction of at least one-third in hog slaughter is certain to result in a much higher level of hog prices. Some idea of the effects of a sharp curtailment in slaughter supplies on prices can be obtained by noting the records of 1924, and of 1925 and 1926. Inspected hog slaughter in 1923 and 1924 was the largest on record, averaging about 53,000,000 head in each year and hog prices in those years were forced down to the $7.00 level. In 1925, slaughter was reduced by 10,000,000 head and hog prices advanced more than $5 per 100 pounds. In that same year a big corn crop was raised, and with fewer hogs to </seg>
            <seg id="p230">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE fatten the price of corn dropped sharply. The price of hogs, there - fo*e, was high in relation to the price of corn and this caused farmers to breed more sows. However, it was not until the fall pig crop of 19,26 came on the market in the spring of 1927 that the efforts to ex - pand hog production were reflected in increased market supplies. So far as we can see ahead now we may expect the hog situation during the next three years to be very similar to that which followed 1924. Hog slaughter this year will be greatly reduced because of decreased pig production last year. Hog prices will advance because of the reduced slaughter supplies. Pig production will be reduced again this spring because of the feed shortage. Fewer hogs will come to market next winter and hog prices then will be at the highest winter level in several years. If a big corn crop is raised this year the price of corn will be very low next winter in relation to hog prices and there will be a strong demand for feeder pigs and brood sows. It is very apparent, therefore, that the hog and corn situation will be as badly un - balanced next winter as it is now, the difference being that there will be too much corn for the number of hogs to feed, whereas now there is too little corn for even the very small number of hogs on hand. Not until the winter of 1936-37, or two years from now can we expect to, see corn supplies and hog supplies in something like a proper rela - tionship. This situation should be considered carefully by every hog and corn producer, and every effort made to bring about a balanced relationship as quickly as possible and to prevent those wide fluctua - tions in the production of both hogs and corn which are wasteful and uneconomic. Cattle Situation Also Unbalanced. A study of the cattle situation reveals a rather unbalanced condi - tion somewhat similar to that for hogs and corn. Because of the slow turnover in cattle production, cattle numbers increase and decrease in such a manner as to form cycles about 16 years in length. The low points in the last two cycles were 1912 and 1928, and in each of those years numbers at the beginning of the year totaled between 55,000,000 and 57,000,000 head. From the low points of the cycle, numbers usually increase for about six to eight years and after reach - ing a peak they decline for eight to ten years. At the high point in 1^18, cattle numbers totaled more than 71,000,000 head. This number was excessive, not only from the standpoint of its relationship to feed supplies in years of below-average feed production which must always be anticipated, but also from the standpoint of potential meat pro - duction and the probable outlet for such production at renumerative prices to producers. Most of you probably recall the long period of painful liquidation in the cattle industry which took place from 1921 ta 1926 and which kept cattle prices at a relatively low level until </seg>
            <seg id="p231">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS 1 ASSOCIATION numbers on farms were reduced by 14,000,000 bead. Tbe reduction in cattle slaughter In late 1927 and 1928 caused cattle prices to advance sharply and they were maintained at high levels until the business de - pression reduced consumer, incomes and thus curtailed consumer buyer power. Cattle prices then started downward even though pro - ducers held their cattle on farms and slaughter supplies continued to decrease. Cattle slaughter in 1932 was the smallest in many years but because of the great decrease in consumer buying power the prices of cattle fell to the lowest levels in at least 35 years. During the six years, 1927-1932, inclusive, cattlemen held back breeding stock, consequently cattle numbers were at their low point at the beginning of 1928. In the six years which followed, numbers in - creased about 10,000,000 head and most of this increase was in female stock, as steers were sold for slaughter almost as rapidly as they were produced. Most of this increase was in the area between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains, and it was especially large in the states north of Oklahoma. Much of the increase was in cows and heifers kept for milk, as dairying was relatively profitable in the early period of the depression because of the relatively low prices of feed. Beginning in the spring of 1933, cattlemen started to expand marketings and later in that year there was evidence that some liquidation was getting underway. Too many cattle on feed in the second half of the year made a bad market situation throughout the fall of 1933 and all of last winter. By the spring of 1934, cattlemen recognized that they were confronted with the difficult problem of making readjustments which involved reducing cattle numbers. Various plans for accomplishing this objective were under consideration when the 1934 drought developed and it became apparent that immediate action had to be taken to prevent disaster. It is unncessary here to review the details of what was done. In brief, the Federal Government purchased more than 7,500,000 cattle and calves in 24 States and these were slaughtered. The meat of those suitable for food has been and is being used for relief purposes. In addition to the slaughter of cattle for the government, there was a very marked increase in the slaughter of cattle and calves for com - mercial purposes, with the result that there is every reason to believe that cattle numbers are now down to the low level of seven years ago. In other words, the increase of 10,000,000 head in six years was wiped out in a single year as a result of the government buying program. Most of the reduction in numbers was in breeding animals and in young stock. The cattle industry, therefore, is back where it was at the beginning of 1928, insofar as numbers are concerned. The shortage of feed has made it impossible for cattle feeders to </seg>
            <seg id="p232">REPORT OK XEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE finish out the usual number fed cattle for market this year and this is now being reflected in reduced marketings of high-grade cattle and in advancing prices of such cattle. Normally, prices of such cattle decline during the early part of the year. The shortage in fed cattle is expected to be most pronounced next summer, hence much higher prices for such cattle are in prospect. The demand for all kinds of stocker and breeding cattle is expected to be unusually strong next spring if pasture conditions are favorable. In general, therefore, those who are in position to carry their cattle through this winter are likely to experience much more favorable con - ditions for their industry during the next few years than they witnessed in the last four years. In expanding production, however, they should keep in mind the dangers of over-expansion and endeavor to prevent a recurrence of an unbalanced relationship between feed supplies and numbers, and between output of beef and consumer demand. Sheep Prospects. Nebraska producers are interested in the sheep industry primarily from the standpoint of feeding western lambs. Sheep numbers have been reduced about 3,600,000 head through the operations of the gov - ernment buying program. Numbers also may be reduced somewhat this winter as a result of larger than usual death losses. The 1935 lamb crop, therefore, is expected to be considerably smaller than that of any other recent year. Demand for ewe lambs for breeding purposes is likely to be unusually active next fall, and because of the relatively small supplies of other meats, a strong demand for slaughter lambs also is in prospect. This means a higher level of lamb prices and that Ne - braska feeders will have a smaller supply of feeder lambs from which to make their purchases. Summing up briefly the thought I wish to leave with you: We have a very unbalanced feed and livestock situation this winter because. of the vagaries of nature in curtailing crop production by means of drought. We are likely to have an equally unbalanced situation next winter through a reversal of present conditions if this year's crops are average or better, because of the tremendous reduction made in live - stock numbers last year in order to bring livestock supplies in better relation to the decreased feed supplies. In view of the time required to increase livestock production we are likely to see feed prices low in relation to livestock prices throughout 1936 and probably throughout 1937. </seg>
            <seg id="p233">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION GETTING THE MOST FROM PASTURE DELMER S. ANDERSON Lexington, Nebraska The subject assigned to me covers a great deal of territory. I will only attempt to touch upon one phase of the subject — that is, grain feeding weaned calves, or older cattle utilizing some grass during the feeding period. I will first discuss the kind of cattle that feed to best advantage using some grass. Second, how to fit such cattle before going on grass, and last, how to handle on grass. What I say will be based upon my own experience, which I find checks closely with the work carried on not only by our State Agricultural Department, but by other State Agricultural Departments. First, I will say that there isn't any set rule that can be applied at all times. Over a term of years, I have found that good quality yearling steers have proven more satisfactory to utilize grass during feeding period than other classes of cattle. Yearling heifers often get too heavy before finished to sell well. The cost of gain for a heavy steer is too great to permit feeding the time required to finish when grass is used to any extent, as a heavier steer will consume much more feed than a light steer and the daily gain is not much greater. As a stated before, yearling steers have proven more satisfactory than have any other class of cattle so I will base my talk upon this class. I want to stress quality. Poor quality long fed cattle often come in competition with good quality short fed cattle, which are often quite plentiful in the late fall months when yearlings fed on grass should be marketed. If yearlings fed on grass any length of time are to be marketed in the fall as finished cattle, they must carry some flesh, but not necessarily a great deal of flesh when going on grass in the spring. A real fleshy steer going on grass in the spring will not be any fleshier in the fall than a steer going on with a fair amount of fish, and will not show as good a finish by fall. Calves can be started any time trgm Oct. 1 to Febr. 1 and be flitted for grass feeding by spring. The later they are started, the heavier grain ration they will require. Regardless of when started, up until the time they go on grass the daily grain ration should not exceed 7 or 8 pounds per day in connection with other feeds required to make up a balanced ration. If one raises their calves, or buys them in the fall at weaning time, they should be fed a growing </seg>
            <seg id="p234">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ration during the fall and early winter months, not allowing them to lose flesh. Where calves are fed good ensilage or ground corn fodder with some corn in either the"ensilage or fodder in connection with other feeds required to make up a balanced ration, it is not necessary to feed additional corn until Febr. 1. Then start them with from 3 to 4 pounds per head and increase so that by the time grass is ready they will be getting 7 or 8 pounds per day. Where neither the ensilage or corn fodder contains corn fed follow - ing weaning time, some grain or cake should be added to the feed from the beginning to hold up the calves' flesh. In most cases, I think grain best. As for calves bought in late fall or 'early winter a little thin in flesh, they are all right for the man that buys them, especially when they are bought by the pound. Although, the owner that allows them to get thin makes a mistake. By feeding such calves a little more grain, as they respond well, they can be fitted to be fed on grass by spring. JAs to the grain fed during fall and winter to fit a calf for feeding grass, I prefer ground snapped corn or ground ear corn. The feed that should be fed in connection with grain depends upon the feed available and the cost. First I will say that a pasture of any kind is good in the fall and early winter even if there is not much available feed. The exercise seems to be good for the calf. Some seasons, corn stalk fields can be used. If alfalfa is available at a cost in line with other feeds, it should be fed freely. If out of line with other feeds, it should be fed in somewhat limited quantities. But only in rare cases, do I think it could be profitably entirely eliminated. Where alfalfa is eliminated, cake should be fed. Ensilage or ground corn fodder is usually about as cheap a feed that can be had in this section, and is a very satisfactory feed when fed in connection with some protein feeds such as alfalfa or cake. As for the kind of pasture, I prefer wild grass or where cattle are on full feed alfalfa can be pastured safely and I think it is much better than wild grass, or better yet connect the two. Sweet clover and w Id grass are good. Now, how to handle cattle to utilize grass. There are three methods that can be applied to utilize grass with calves, or yearlings as they would tie when going on grass. First, full feed on grass sixty to ninety days, then finish in dry lot. Second feed some grain sixty to ninety days then bring them on full feed before taking them off the grass. This should require about an additional thirty days. Then finish in dry lot. </seg>
            <seg id="p235">NEBRASKA CROP GROWERS' ASSOCIATION Third, turn on grass without grain from sixty to ninety days, then if possible bring on full feed before removing from grain. Then finish in dry lot. I will use calves fed in dry lot as the check lot to determine the practicality of feeding on grass. I will eliminate time as it will require a longer period to feed calves utilizing grass than if dry lotted. I don't think that there is any advantage in full feeding cattle sixty or ninety days on wild grass over dry lot feeding, as far as the cattle are concerned, but where hogs are following, there is a big advantage for them as they are out on a clean field. They will clean up the drop - pings much better on grass than on a dry lot where there is loose dirt. Light hogs can be carried along and will do pretty well with the droppings from the cattle and green feed. Where alfalfa pasture is used along, or in connection with wild grass, I think there is an advant - age to graze sixty or ninety days on full feed as compared with dry lot feeding. Not only for the hogs, but also for the cattle. Feeding yearlings a light grain ration on grass doesn't seem to be practical, but running on grass sixty to ninety days without grain seems to be the best method of all to utilize grass. If such yearlings go on grass carrying the flesh that is necessary so that they may be marketed as finished, or nearly finished cattle in the fall or early winter, they will not gain much over one and a quarter lbs. per day. Yet that gain can be put on for about two cents per pound, depending somewhat upon the cost of the grass. Yearlings fed in this manner will respond so well when put on grain feed that by fall they will show about the same gain as cattle dry lotted and full fed for the same length of time, but to have the same finish they would have to be fed thirty to sixty days longer. Cattle fed this way can be finished on new corn at the time it averages about the cheapest. The advantage of this feed method depends a great deal upon the cost of grain. It is more profitable with high cost grain than low cost grain. Where one is feeding several loads of cattle as I have described, not including light feeding on grass but including dry lot feeding, I think it is well to sort them in three groups for weight. Dry lot the heaviest, full feed the next group sixty or ninety days on grass, and run the smallest group on grass without grain through the spring months. Handling yearlings in this manner, one can market a uniform class of cattle, both in weight and in finish, over a period of time from about September to December and will get an average of the market. And the buyers learn to know how the cattle will kill. Cattle fed on grass, as I have described, will always kill better than they appear. In order to clear up a few points I will make a short summary of </seg>
            <seg id="p236">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I what I have said. First, good quality yearlings properly wintered have proven more satisfactory than any other class of cattle to utilize grass during feeding period. Light feeding while running on grass has not proven as satisfactory as full feeding or grazing without grain the same length of time. Under no condition has it proven practical to graze cattle fed the different ways I have described longer than 120 days! There must be hogs following cattle full fed on grass if they are to show any advantage over cattle dry lotted. It is much better for the hogs' if they can be kept away from old yards and yet have plenty of shade and water. Cattle can be safely grazed on alfalfa when on full feed of grain and they will gain better than when grazed on wild grass. A combination of the two is very good. An old field of alfalfa that is about ready to plow up can be utilized to an advantage in this way. Feeding cattle on grass distributes the fertilizer over the land where it belongs. I have based my talk from my experience as I stated in the beginning that I would. I also stated at the beginning that there isn't any set rule that can be applied at all times to cattle feeding. So if some of you folks have had different experiences than I have and differ with me I will be glad to get your views. ANNUAL MEETING January 9, 1935 The meeting was called to order by the president, Mr. C. Y- Thompson. The minutes of the 1934 meeting were read and approved. The report of the treasurer, P. H. Stewart, for 1934 was read and approved. Mr. Gross reported on the International Grain and Hay Show. Ne - braska took first, second, and third, and champion for the district on yellow corn. Nebraska, of course, took first on alfalfa. The 4-H club work from Nebraska seems to be able to run away with it all. The 4-H Nebraska crops judging team at the International show has never been less than third place, and usually first. They were first again this year.

The president reported that owing to the drouth, we did not have a grain show this year. Also owing to the drouth, a good many pas - tures were practically ruined, and it has been suggested that we spend some of our money, which Mr. Stewart has reported we still have on hand, as a premium for encouraging a pasture contest. It seemed a good idea and money well spent. The opinion was expressed that most of us would be better off if we did put a little more of our land into grass and pasture of various kinds, and getting the experience of these various farmers having this contest, we would have brought to our attention the best ways of bringing this about. The Board asked that the members take action either authorizing them to go ahead with this pasture contest or vote it down, just as they saw fit. The Board did not see fll to take action unless authorized to do so, and before anything was done they thought it advisable that Mr. Stewart give some idea as to what the plans are for the season. Mr. Stewart then gave a brief outline of the plan of the contest. Mr. Val Kuska , mentioned briefly the conditions of the pastures as he had seen them over the state. He made a motion that this proposed plan be approved and the appropriation made by vote of the members. Motion carried. Mr. Mott, chairman of the resolutions committee, composed of C. A. Suneson and Herman Ebers, read the following resolution: "The Ne - braska Crop Growers' Association assembled in annual business meet - ing at the Nebraska College of Agriculture take cognizance of the fact that — Whereas, it is an accepted fact that due to unprecedented drouth during the past year from seed stocks of all the common spring sown cereal and forage crops are deficient in practically all sections of the state, and Whereas, the financial status of a large number of our farmers is such as will necessitate borrowing to finance the purchase of seed. Be it resolved, that the Nebraska Crop Growers' recommend that a Federal seed loan act be passed to tide farmers over this acute emergency, and solicit the support of the Nebraska delegation to the National Congress to work toward this end. Bf it further resolved, that copies of this resolution be sent to each of the Nebraska Senators and representatives in Congress." Motion carried. </seg>

            <seg id="p259">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION THE NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION PROCEEDINGS OP ANNUAL MEETING Held in the Dairy Building College of Agriculture University of Nebraska Lincoln, Nebraska WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 9, 1935 PRESIDENT H. P. DAVIS, Lincoln SECRETARY L. K. CROWE, Lincoln MR. H. P. DAVIS: Will the meeting please come to order. This is a new feature in our association. In the years gone by there has been a dairy cattle judging contest during this time, but this year it seemed best to try an innovation and start out by having a meeting during which matters of vital interest to dairymen could be discussed. To present each phase of the problem, I have asked a man who is very familiar with that problem to bring out the important phases of the subject. I hope that it will be a round-table discussion. It will be more useful to you if you will ask questions. The discussion is divided into three headings: 1. Balancing the Ration with Drouth Rough - ages, 2. Vitamins and Minerals in the Ration, 3. What About Protein Supplements. I will now introduce to you one of our Dairy Extension Specialists, Mr. M. N. Lawritson who is very well known to you and who can dis - cuss the balancing of rations with drouth roughages as well as anyone else I know. Mr. Lawritson. MR. M. N. LAWRITSON: Mr. President, and members of the asso - ciation: Ordinarily I prefer to stand down by the audience, but today I have listed these rations on the board and it will be more convenient to discuss this topic from the platform. There are many farmers who are asking how to utilize the feeds they have available. Under normal conditions, successful feeding from an economic standpoint consists of furnishing an abundance of feed </seg>
            <seg id="p260">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to dairy herds. We are faced with abnormal conditions now and it Is not a problem of feeding as we would like to feed, but utilizing the feed available and getting our herds through the winter in the best possible condition. In deciding the ration you want to use you will have to consider the feeds available and keep in mind that during a -drouth such as we have had, that roughage is going to consist of material made up of low protetin. In balancing the ration you are going to use high protein supplements and it is with that point in mind that I put a few of the results on the board.

In these results we have tried to utilize feeds available on most of the farms in the state and you will have to decide what one will suit your needs. These rations to the right are maintenance rations; that is, rations that are required to keep an animal alive without milk production. These rations to the left are maintenance rations plus feed enough for the cow to produce 20 pounds of milk per day. If you have more production than that you will have to raise these rations. It will not be necessary for us to go into detail on the main - tenance rations because most of you have cattle producing 20 pounds of milk or over per day and are not facing the maintenance problem. It is not advisable to skimp the dairy cow when she is dry because that puts her in a poor condition when she freshens. This year be - cause of the failure of most pasture, cows have come into the winter in very poor condition. We have some results of ration balancing listed on this mimeographed sheet prepared by Professor Davis. There are ten maintenance rations and ten that would furnish nutrition for a high producing cow. I have figured out the daily cost of some of these rations and out of the ten I have picked out the cheapest ration and the highest priced ration. I figured these prices out two or three weeks ago and I have not had time to inquire about the prices at the present time, but they probably will vary a little. At the present time corn meal and tankage are a little higher. You can adjust the cost of the rations according to the changes in the feed prices. The lowest priced ration was one consisting of 20 pounds stover, 5 pounds corn meal, 2 pounds tankage; which on your sheet is ration Number 4. The next cheapest is 20 pounds stover, 4 pounds barley, 2 pounds tankage; which is ration Number 8. The most expensive of these rations is 40 pounds silage, 5 pounds stover, 5 pounds alfalfa, and 6 pounds corn meal, and 1 pound tankage. The present prices will be just a little higher than these but you can decide which ration is most suitable. There has been some talk and we have had many farmers inquire about tankage tainting the milk. That will be answered later. Now perhaps 40 pounds silage is a little bit too high for Jersey cows and I wonder if we could cut the 40 pounds silage down to 30 pounds. For Holstein cows 40 pounds probably would not be too much. With stover, it is a paying proposition to shred it and sprinkle it with a little molasses because you don't have any waste, but if you throw it out to </seg>
            <seg id="p263">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION the cattle in a bundle they will pick oft the leaves and then eat at the stalks but will not eat it up as clean as if you have it shredded. The cost of molasses was 1 VI cents a pound. Probably in mixing that with water, one-fourth molasses to three-fourths warm water is the best. In feeding tankage with grain, mix it in with the grain and in feeding it with stover, sprinkle it lightly over the roughage. The rea - son for tankage in place of linseed oil meal or cottonseed meal is because it is the cheapest at present and has a high protein content. Whether or not it will taint the milk will be discussed more in detail later on. From the cheapest to the highest priced ration we have a range of 22 cents to 31.1 cents. If the highest priced ration is cut down to 30 pounds silage that will bring the cost down to 30 cents. Most of you men have cut down on the feed for the low producers and fed the better cows in your herd more, which was wise. If you are interested in the prices of these feeds I will read them again: Alfalfa, $20, Stover, $10, Silage, $6, Straw, $8, Tankage, $40, Corn meal, $32 and Molasses, i'Ac pound. I don't imagine wo will have any questions. on the maintenance rations so I won't go into those in detail. This brings out then that we must pay more attention to minerals in the ration and for the smaller breeds of cattle 3 0 pounds silage may be used in place of 40 pounds for the Holstein and larger breeds. Now if you have questions to ask as we go down the program, just jot them down and ask them when we finish our discussions. MR. H. P. DAVIS: Mr. Lawritson has very kindly presented this matter. One question that I would like to see taken up now is how much use is a grinder and how much more value is grinding this year. That is a question well worth considering because in a year of this kind when roughages are of low protein content it does pay to grind your feed because the cows will use it better and eat it up cleaner, which is particularly true with stover, and you will have much less waste. This is one year when grinding of feed should be emphasized. Some farmers use a grinder, some use a shredder and some even use a thrashing machine. In the extreme drouth area we find farmers using the Russian thistle, and in order to remove the stickers they use the thrashing machine. Others put the thistle in the silo. I checked up the results and those who have seen it will agree it doesn't look very appetizing and is quite dark in color and doesn't have a good odor, but cattle take to it very readily and we are expecting good results. QUESTION: How do you add molasses? ANSWER: You dilute it with water, one part molasses to three parts water, and sprinkle it over the feed. </seg>
            <seg id="p264">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE mH. H. P. DAVIS: Thank you Mr. Lawritaon. The next discus - sion and one that I think is particularly necessary in a year like this Is "Vitamins and Minerals in the Ration" and we have asked Mr. Hathaway to prepare this question, Mr. Hathaway. MR. I. L. HATHAWAY: Mr. President, and members of the asso - ciation. I believe we will agree that under normal conditions the problem of the mineral and vitamin content of feeds is one that we do not have to worry so much about because normal feeds will supply these materials. Under the present drouth conditions, however, we have a different proposition. The feeds which we normally depend upon to supply these materials are either lacking entirely or are too high priced to purchase. The other reason is because under these drouth conditions plants are not able to take minerals from the soil. Plants can manufacture carbohydrates, but the minerals in the plants come from the soil in solution, so when we lack moisture the plants are unable to take these elements from the soil. There are especially two classes of cattle in which we may en - counter a mineral or a vitamin problem, namely, the pregnant animal, and the growing animal. If minerals are not fed to pregnant animals the bones become brittle and reproduction is very unsatisfactory. The growing animal needs an abundant supply of minerals. One and one-half to four and one-half per cent of the animal body is minerals. The skeleton is over 90 per cent calcium and phosphorus. On an average there are twenty-one pounds of calcium in a thousand pound ox. These minerals must be supplied if we are to have a well developed animal. The chemist has found many different elements, but there are only four with which we need to especially concern ourselves in dealing with cattle. From the practical standpoint we need to supply calcium, phosphorus, chlorine, and iodine. Normally the legume hays supply the bulk of the calcium and the phosphorus in the ration of the dairy cow. The ration should contain from .45 per cent calciujn for the dry cow to 1.5 per cent for a forty pound cow. If a cow is producing more than forty pounds of milk, the per cent of calcium should be still higher. Except for some of the straws, roughages are richer in minerals than are the grains. Legume hay, cottonseed meal, and linseed oil meal are richer in calcium than, are the cereals. The feeds that are rich in proteins are also rich in phosphorus. Tankage, bran and middlings are feeds which belong in this clas^. Bran is the most potent source of phosphorus. The amount of phos - phorus and of calcium in meat meal and tankage are dependent upon the amount of bone in these materials. In general, meat meal is not as good a source of calcium or pnosphorus as is tankage. Straw, </seg>
            <seg id="p265">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION beet pulp, and molasses are low In phosphorus. In some cases the cow can utilize inorganic minerals as well as organic minerals, so if necessary we can supply these minerals in this form. Calcium may be supplied by the use of precipitated calcium carbonate, ground lime - stone or wood ashes. Phosphorus may be supplied by the use of steamed bone meal, bone flour, or precipitated bone. The best source of phosphorus is steamed bone meal as inorganic forms of phosphorus have been shown to be less valuable than phosphorus in this form. In other words some form of bone is the best source of phosphorus. If you have a mineral problem such mixtures as one part salt, 2 parts lime and 2 parts of bone meal, or one part salt, one part lime, and one part bone meal will generally correct it. Many of the mineral mixtures which have been used are not practical since they are too expen ive and supply minerals which are not necessary. If the calcium and phosphorus content of the ration is low three to four pounds of bone meal per 100 pounds of concentrates may be added. Two pounds of bone meal per 100 pounds of concentrates will be sufficient if the ration is only fairly high in calcium and phosphorus. In this region chlorine must be supplied since feeds are very low in this material. Ordinary salt furnished in ample quantities will supply an abundance of chlorine. We have had some reports of a lack of iodine. Large necks indicate the over-growth of the thyroid gland which is indicative of the lack of iodine in the ration. Iodized salt or two grains of potassium iodide per head per day will correct this defect. The salt will take care of the requirement of chlorine and potassium iodide will furnish iodine. Neither of these materials are expensive. The vitamin question is more simple. There are six vitamins, but we have to worry about only two or possibly three of them. Definite information shows that growing cattle do not require vitamin B or vitamin C. No information regarding the vitamin E or the vitamin G requirement of dairy cattle has been obtained. We do know that growing dairy cattle require vitamin A and vitamin D. The sources of the vitamins (as in the case of the minerals) are those feeds which are quite scarce and expensive. Alfalfa and clover are the only feeds which supply vitamin D. If vitamin A must be purchased, good green alfalfa meal or good cod liver oil are the best sources. About three - fifths of a pound of alfalfa meal per calf per day will be required and at present prices ($30 per ton) will cost about one cent. The 30 pound cow will require about four pounds at a cost of six cents per head per day. If cod liver oil is used, feed about one ounce per calf per day. The cost will be from one to two cents per calf per day. The 30 pound cow will require about four ounces at a cost of four to eight cents per head per day. Alfalfa meal is probably the best source since the meal furnishes </seg>
            <seg id="p266">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE minerals as well as vitamins while cod liver oil supplies only the vita - mins A and D. Vitamin A deficiency is likely to appear in calves when they are put on skim milk and poor hay or when they are nursing cows on rations very low in vitamin A. Vitamin D deficiency may be encountered when calves are kept inside and fed on poor hay. There are some who believe that vitamin D supplements are beneficial to the high producing cow. In closing then may we say that the wise dairyman will give con - sideration to minerals and vitamins when feeding cattle under drouth conditions. I . - ; ■:■. ■-■ : MR. H. P. DAVIS: Thank you Mr. Hathaway. Since Mr. Morgan is not in the room at present we shall have to depart from our rule made and discuss these topics until he comes in. Do any of you have questions you would like to ask at this time? QUESTION: Can lime flour take the place of alfalfa hay? ANSWER: There is quite a difference, but I would say no. Lime flour can supply lime and they can use that, but it is better to use the hay too. QUESTION: Various ones feed the lime alone and some put it on the top of the silage before each feeding. ANSWER: It is all right, from the point of calcium. QUESTION: How many pounds of alfalfa hay will be needed to take the place of lime? ANSWER: Alfalfa hay is a source of lime, but it is much better to feed both lime flour and alfalfa hay. . QUESTION: Do cattle utilize lime in the water? ANSWER: Yes they do. MR. H. P. DAVIS: Whether you are supplying the calcium needed will depend upon the production of the cows. If they are producing 80 pounds of milk a day they can't eat enough alfalfa to produce as much lime as they should have. If the cow is making a high produc - tion of milk or butterfat the probability is that it is difficult for you to feed enough lime. If the cow doesn't have enough minerals in stor - age the probability is when she finishes the end of her lactation period she will have taken it from her body and will be in a weakened condition. QUESTION: Do you think 400 pound cows get enough minerals around here? </seg>
            <seg id="p267">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION ANSWER: That is according to how you feed her. Corn meal or stover is not sufficient, but hay and cottonseed meal would be. There is a definite indication that in the Scottsbluff valley where the land is deficient in phosphorus, those cows are suffering from this deficiency. QUESTION: Will the feeding of more minerals correct abortions? ANSWER: Not all abortions can be traced to the lack of minerals. MR. H. P. DAVIS: They have had difficulty in Dakota due to min - eral deficiency particularly phosphorus and lime. Some of the indi - cations of that are the failure to breed regularly. With a serious deficiency in lime or phosphorus they do not breed. That is not the cause of all cases though. MR. I. L. HATHAWAY: In one of the northern states there was a dairyman who had been in the dairy business for 40 years and he was using the same methods as he had always practiced, but the cattle would not respond. He was advised to feed phosphorus and the trouble disappeared. So we may have the same trouble here. MR. H. P. DAVIS: We are going to have more necessity for adding lime and phosphorus to our rations because as our land becomes de - pleted we will see the result of the lack of it in the cattle. We have had fertile soil in Nebraska, but as crops are planted and harvested we are going to run more and more into these cases. In Seward county they were having trouble and we suggested bone meal to clear it up. One of the other minerals that is important once in a while is iodine. We have cases now and then of hairless calves or goiter conditions. MR. M. L. FLACK: We have found in the two year old cows that they developed goiters and the use of iodized salt has corrected that condition in two or three months. An animal can only utilize so much. MR. I. L. HATHAWAY: According to Wisconsin, that is the method to use. Montana, Kansas, and Iowa also recommend it. MR. H. P. DAVIS: One more thing about iodine. There are some indications that some cows retain the afterbirth with regularity. There is some reason to believe that the use of a little potassium iodide will correct that under normal conditions. QUESTION: Can you put iodine in drinking water? ANSWER: That is all right. You can also put tincture of iodine on the back of the cow, but don't put it on the same place each time. I don't like that method however. MR. H. P. DAVIS: Are there any other questions on minerals and vitamins? </seg>
            <seg id="p268">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE QUESTION: Can you feed too much bone meal? ANSWER: I don't think so. Two other minerals can be men - tioned in the southern states which if they are not found in the diet result in anemia. Copper and iron. QUESTION: How should you feed lime, phosphorus, and salt? ANSWER: It depends upon how much you have outside the mix - tureJ If the ration is very low in minerals then you can supply be - tween one and two pounds a day. QUESTION: Can a cow self feed herself on minerals? ANSWER: A high producing cow will not. In mixtures, one per - cent salt and one per cent steamed bone meal and one per cent lime flour are used. Our practice is to feed salt in this way. QUESTION: What is the difference between lime flour and sacked lime? ANSWER: Lime flour is precipitated. QJUESTION: If you feed cattle a ration rich in vitamins will she produce milk rich in vitamins? ANSWER: She will produce milk richer in the vitamins. If we feed the cow a ration deficient in vitamin B she will produce vitamin B in the milk anyway. It is true though that the vitamin content in - creases when the cow is turned out on green grass. MR. H. P. DAVIS: There is a possibility of fortifying cows against diseases by increasing the feed content with vitamin A. That is, the addition of this vitamin is a protection against disease. QUESTION: On these mimeographed rations No. 5 is lacking in minerals. The ration reads, 15# alfalfa hay, 30# silage, 3# corn meal. ANSWER: That is short in phosphorus. Nearly all of these rations are short in lime and phosphorus. We know they are not perfect, but we hope that we can make up the deficiency in pasture. MR. H. P. DAVIS: Mr. Morgan has just come into the room and we will ask him to discuss the question, "What about protein supplements." Mr. Morgan. MR. R. F. MORGAN: During the past summer the dairy farmer experienced one of the worst drouths in history. Due to lack of proper feeds many dairy animals suffered severely from lack of proper nourish - ment From the standpoint of the farmer there is one important point </seg>
            <seg id="p269">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION to rememter, that It is natural for the dairy animal to produce mUfc' to Teed her young. The dairy animal is going to get the minerals an* proteins somewhere and it is necessary for the farmer to realize thi# natural tendency. The result is that she is going to take milk pfo- - -ducins elements from her body, and with the drouth causing depletion in the feeds high in these elements the farmer cannot afford to feed them. There are instances where the cows are -still producing a con - siderable amount of milk, yet they are not very well fed. Some farm - ers say they get 15 to 20 pounds of milk a day and they can't afford to buy good feeds, but their cows are doing pretty well on stover and straw. They think nothing of the results which will be that the animal has a storage in her system of the various milk producing; elements, hut the farmer cannot afford to feed more than straw an* she is depleting her body. That means that all this will have to be made np, since straw is low in the elements for producing milk. She: will have to replace these when feeding is again resumed. The farmer must also realize that the cow in milk must maintain herself each day from the feed she receives. This is called maintenance or the amount of feed required to keep a cow alive for 24 hours. From a given amount of feed" the cow will first take from it enough elements to keep her alive and the balance is utilized for milk production. If the feeds she receives are lacking in these elements it is natural for her to take them from her body which will cause depletion. The drouth has brought about the subject of tankage in many localities. We find there has been very little work done in dairy re - search from the standpoint of utilizing tankage for cows. We are preparing some work in our dairy herd with the use of tankage. We have been feeding tankage In small quantities and getting the cows accustomed to it. Usually the animal at first had no desire for it. They would smell of it and refuse to eat it, and some of them would eat it readily. The dairy animal will mince around and have its likes and dislikes as we do. Tankage varies from 40 to 60 per cent protein. The most that we have varies from 40 to 45 per cent and by feeding it with other feeds most of the animals will eat it quite readily. Farmers inquire about feeding tankage alone. Usually we do not recommend the feeding of a high protein alone. Farmers say that they have been feeding high amounts of cottonseed meal. You may be able to follow this pracice for a while, but udder difficulties are likely to result from that type of feeding. The high protein will break down the udder tissues and will cause other udder troubles. For the average cow 1 %, pound is the safe side. For high producers milking from 40 to 60 pounds a day a little more can be fed. Keep this in mind, a variety will not cause so much trouble. Wheat bran, tankage or linseed oil meal may be fed but not alone in abundant amounts because it wilL </seg>
            <seg id="p270">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE cause difficulty. The high producers especially should have a variety of feed. You cannot afford it at the present time, but it is quite nec - essary. Roughage such as alfalfa hay is the ideal dairy feed from the standpoint of a hay carrying 12 per cent protein and that at $20 a ton is really cheaper than other feeds at a lower price per ton. There are various products, cottonseed meal, for instance that are quite con - stipating and the feeding of it alone may cause udder trouble. Lin - seed meal is quite laxative and should not be fed in large quantities. Soy bean meal from the standpoint of drouth conditions at $45 a ton is as economical a product as any of the concentrates mentioned, but it should be fed with other feed not so high in protein such as corn or barley. In Kansas they found it caused a softness in butterfat so there is a criticism against this high protein feed when fed alone. Sooner or later you will find difficulty especially on high producers and it is not economical in low producers. One other point is care of our young stock under these conditions. The farmer hopes he will have a lot of females in the herd, but some - times he does not know how to care for them. I am sure it was brought out in a previous discussion about the importance of minerals and vitamins in the ration and the growing individual has to have certain products in order to develop bone so that at freshening time it will be in proper condition, to carry on. One other point, the heifer, if she is to be developed from the standpoint of bone structure must be given the proper attention during the first two years of her life. If by some method you can feed a little grain until the animal freshens you will have a good individual that will be able to go through the regular milking periods. If you skimp along you are going to have a small underfed heifer that freshens and she will lack in development the rest of her life. Many farmers do not realize the importance of grow - ing out the young animals. If you fail to develop the animal the first two years you will not be able to correct this defect later on. You realize of course that good alfalfa will develop very well the growing heifer. Since alfalfa is not available other feed like corn, fed at the rate of one-half to three-fourths pound daily to a yearling heifer will help materially. The older ones need more. I am especially interested in the farmer that has growing heifers because many of them are being neglected and they must have some type of protein mixture. It has been found that a dairy animal producing milk, if given all the alfalfa Bhe can eat can get Along on alfalfa and corn year in and year out and will give in the neighborhood of 25 pounds of milk daily, pro - viding corn is fed at the rate of one pound grain to three and one-half to four pounds milk produced. Many farmers feel that they get more. I think very conservatively that with stovers, straw, and other low protein roughage you must supply one-half pound of some protein sup - plement such as tankage or linseed oil meal to bring the dairy animals </seg>
            <seg id="p271">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION through this drouth stage, and I believe It Is important to remember that to feed limited amounts of high proteins you will get the best results. With these few remarks I am sure there will be some questions on points I have not mentioned. So I appreciate your attention and if there are any questions we will be glad to discuss them with you. , MR. H. P. DAVIS: Thank you Mr. Morgan. There is quite a likeli - hood that we will have to grow soy beans this coming year. How will that and corn be for a rations? ANSWER: Soy beans from the standpoint of protein will work very well. The difficulty is whether or not they can be grown in this part of the country with any success. If they can be grown and har - vested they can be recommended. QUESTION: What about tankage with reference to tainting the milk? ANSWER: I have found no effects of tankage tainting milk. We have not fed it in excessive amounts however. There are some though who have fed it alone and there have been some criticisms about its tainting the milk. MR. H. P. DAVIS-: We feed tankage during the milking period and we have had no difficulties. Milk will absorb odor of tankage though and if the tankage is loose in the barn it will taint the milk. The best kind of tankage to use is the dry process. QUESTION: Is a 17 per cent ration too high in protein? ANSWER: If you use roughage it isn't. Alfalfa hay and corn sil - age should be used with such a ration. That isn't too much protein especially for high producing cows. Crude and digestible protein are different. On the sack, if you are buying prepared mixtures, you should find the per cent of protein. MR. H. P. DAVIS: For years we have used rations of 14 per cent digestible proteins and we think we are getting very satisfactory re - sults, just as satisfactory as when we used higher percentages of proteins. There is some indication that when you use too high protein rations you are wasting it and possibly you will injure your cows. How much protein do you feed your Guernseys, Mr. Egger? MR. FRED EGGER: I feed 15 per cent protein with alfalfa hay and silage. MR. E. W. FROST: I feed 14 per cent protein. QUESTION: How should these feeds be fed? The corn first or </seg>
            <seg id="p272">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICL'LTLKE silage and alfalfa. ANSWER: In feeding grain, ordinarily grain mixture is ground and should be fed before alfalfa or silage. QUESTION: What about tankage causing tuberculosis? ANSWER: No serious results can be obtained from feeding tank - age.! The processes used in preparing it will remove all harmful ingredients. QUESTION: Regarding protein supplement, would skim milk be practical? • ANSWER: Yes. Skim milk can be utilized very well in that re - spect. A gallon will weigh 8% pounds and it will equal 1 pound of cottonseed meal in feeding value. Not all cows will drink it, but it can be mixed with grain. QUESTION: Does alfalfa hay grown in drouth years contain less food value? ANSWER: We have been running analysis on feeds, but we do not have them completed. There is reason to believe that it may not. QUESTION: Is there any difference in the different cuttings of alfalfa? ANSWER: Yes. Alfalfa in the third or fourth cutting is much better than the first two. Later cuttings have more leaves and nutrients are in the leaves. MR. H. P.

AFTKRXOOX SESSION - Dairy Industry Building aJTR. H. P. DAVIS: It is my pleasure to call to session the 50th Anniversary meeting of the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association. At a time like this I am told a president sometimes delivers an address You are going to be favored by the fact that I am not going to do that! It is printed in the program* which you have before you The sec - retary's report of this entire meeting is printed each year and sent to the members of the association. If there are any members who do not have a copy of the report for 1934 it will be furnished to you upon request. Now is there any business to come before the house at this time? </seg>
            <seg id="p275">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION MR. M. N. LAWRITSON: A number of the members of the asso - ciation have been discussing the advisability of changing our by-laws to enlarge the number of members on the Board of Directors. Our membership has been increased in the districts in the state and we want to have the breed organizations in the state represented on the Board of Directors. In our by-laws in Section I of Article 5 it reads "The officers of the Association shall consist of a President, Vice Presi - dent, Secretary-Treasurer, Assistant Secretary, and five Directors." It is proposed that we enlarge the number of members to seven, one of which shall be the chairman of the Department of Dairy Hus - bandry of the University of Nebraska as an ex officio member with voting privileges. In order to put it before the convention I will move that the by-laws of the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association, Section 1 of Article 5, be amended as follows: "The officers of the Associa - tion shall consist of a President, Vice-President, Secretary-Treasurer, Assistant Secretary, and seven Directors, one of which shall be the chairman of the Department of Dairy Husbandry of the University of Nebraska as an ex officio member with voting privilages." MR. H. P. DAVIS: The motion has been made and seconded. Is there any discussion? Are you ready for the question? All in favor of the motion signify by saying Aye. Opposed, no. The motion prevails. MR. M. N. LAWRITSON: Article 8 reads as follows: "The Treas - urer shall give bond in the sum of Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000), the same to be approved by the Board of Directors, and to be in the custody of the President." It so happens that we have never used that article because of the fact that the funds available to the Nebraska State Dairymen's Association are appropriated through the state and the only duties our treasurer has is to take care of membership dues. Inasmuch as we are not using that article I wonder if it would not be advisable to take that out of the by-laws. I move that we strike Article 8 from our by-laws. MR. H. P. DAVIS: The motion has been made and seconded and called for. All in favor signify by saying Aye. Opposed, no. The motion prevails. We will have at this time the report of two committees. I am going to call for the report of the Resolutions Committee, Mr. Lawritson. MR. M. N.

            <seg id="p278">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In 1885 the ex-governor Hoard was here to speak before this association and now fifty years later we are going to listen to one of his associates, Mr. A. J. Glover. Mr. Glover. MR. A. J. GLOVER: It is a pleasure for me to participate in the program commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the Nebraska Dairy - men's Association. It has been my good fortune to have appeared on several of your programs, begining thirty or more years ago. The in - fluence of this association can never be measured. The good men who formed this association and visioned its opportunities for service did not fully comprehend all the opportunities for developing our industry. It was not necessary that they have a clear conception of just what goal we would reach in the future. It was enough for them to com - prehend that an institution of this character, bringing together the leaders of the industry for the purpose of exchanging ideas and con - ference, would make the necessary contribution to the advancement of the greatest branch of agriculture. We sometimes get the feeling that meetings of this character ac - complish but little. This is due to the fact that all substantial progress is slow in movement. To measure our accomplishments, we must note dairy conditions as they existed fifty years ago and compare them to our present conditions. It is not my purpose to enter into a discus - sion of all the changes that have been made and how they were brought about It is enough to relate a few outstanding things that we may reflect upon the distance we have traveled, or rather what we have accomplished. Fifty years ago the cream separator was just making its way into the creameries of this country. Very few were in operation on farms. Cream was obtained very largely by the gravity system and most butter was made on the farm. The few creameries that existed gathered most of the^ cream and only a few of them had taken the advanced step of purchasing a separator. A moment's reflection will reveal to us the marvelous progress we have made in buttermaking, for all of us are familiar with the modern creamery and many of us know the simple institutions called creameries that existed fifty years ago. After the advent of the creamery, came registered dairy cattle. It was but natural that better talent for milk production should be sought when we began to make dairying an industry. The advent of better cattle brought further responsibilities on the part of their owners. It was declared more than once when discussing the necessity of better bulls that a good bull was a great educator. It was realized early that blood alone could not develop a profitable dairy industry, but that it was necessary to bring the proper treatment to this dairy talent. It meant better barns that the cattle could be given the comfort and </seg>
            <seg id="p279">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION attention necessary for the production of profitable flows of milk. It meant a better system of feeding and that led to a better system of farm management. Little attention was given fifty years ago to the eradication of such diseases as tuberculosis, Bang's disease, and mastitis; in fact, little was known about them. Cattle died of tuberculosis, cows aborted, and they had udder trouble, but the reasons for these difficulties had not been fully discovered. Bringing cattle together for the purpose of greater milk production induced our scientists, as well as the men owning cows, to turn their attention to the causes of these diseases that they might be eradicated. Tuberculosis' was the first disease to be tackled on a large scale. Not until 1918 were plans instituted for the area test that bovine tuberculosis might be eradicated. For twenty-five years prior to that a few herds here and there were tested and some had become accredit - ed, which means that they were free from the contagion which causes tuberculosis. Few people appreciate that tremendous undertaking of eradicating tuberculosis from herds and flocks. No other nation in the world has ever dared to attempt this on so large a scale. It does reveal the vigor of a democracy when directed by the right kind of leadership. Many states are now tuberculosis-free, meaning that their herds contain less than one-half of one per cent of tuberculous animals. It will be only a matter of a few years when we will be a tuberculosis - free nation, for the owners of cattle everywhere see the wisdom of get - ting rid of this scourge, for it was they who bore the losses. We are now tackling Bang's disease. The federal government at the present time is appropriating money to pay indemnities to those who submit their herds to the blood test. It will perhaps take more years to eradicate Bang's disease than tuberculosis because it is more widely spread and a higher percentage of our herds are infected. If we can use sensible procedure, this disease will be ultimately eradicated from our herds. There is another disease which is perhaps even more costly than tuberculosis or Bang's disease and that is mastitis. We know so little about it that we haven't been able to tackle its eradication intelligently and effectively. We know germs cause the disease, but just how to destroy them has not been discovered. We are told the germs of mastitis live in the barn much the same as the pneumonia germ lives in our houses. When conditions become right, they make their way into the udder of the cow. Our only method so far is to dispose of those cows whose udders become infected with the germs causing mast - itis. Serums are being used in some cases with satisfaction, but since there are several types of germs which cause mastitis, we have by no </seg>
            <seg id="p280">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE means discovered how this disease can be effectively handled except to dispose of the animals suffering from mastitis. TJo build a profitable dairy industry, it was not enough to eliminate diseased animals from our herds. It was equally essential that we be devoted to the elimination of low producing cows. In the year 1904, the first cow testing association was organized. In 19 01 the Dairy De - partment of the Illinois College of Agriculture sent a man into the field for the purpose of getting farmers to weigh and test the milk of each cow. The purpose back of this was to get the farmers to see that they were milking many poor cows and that if they were to have a satis - factory industry, these must be eliminated. This work of testing cows has Jbeen going forward slowly, but surely, during all these years. There have been some slight setbacks, due to the depression, but it is my opinion that when more dairymen fully appreciate the value of herdl improvement work, there will be a more rapid growth of these institutions. We must look upon them as the forerunner of better dairy farm management. No man can be given information concerning the production of each | cow in his herd and observe the kind and quantity of feeds she consumes without ultimately going to the fields and beginning to di - rect his attention more earnestly to growing the kind of crops that will produce the most nutrients per acre and supplement each other to best [advantage. In short, he will become a better farm manager and a deeper student of every phase of his endeavor. The cow testing asso - ciation or herd improvement association, like the good bull, is a great educator. We haven't yet fully comprehended its true value and how far reaching its influence. Vfe have much to be grateful for in what we have accomplished in the development of our industry, but we have some things that shou d challenge us to greater effort. Our national dairy herd con - sists of 25 million cows which average 160 pounds of fat a year. The efficiency of this herd has not kept pace with the efficiency in many phases of our industry. If dairy farming is to be made profitable so that it can maintain modern conveniences in the home and barn, operate automobiles, and provide the right kind of living which we all desire each individual to have, we must be directed to raising the pro - duction of our national herd to at least 300 pounds of fat, and better, 350 pounds. We already have men who have bred herds capable of maintaining an average production of 400 pounds fat a year. Some herds in your own state have produced over 500 pounds, but let us be reasonable and strive for an average of at least 300 pounds of fat. This type of herd will, if other things on the farm are properly handled, bring a return that will maintain the dairy farm home upon a basis in keeping with national standards of living. </seg>
            <seg id="p281">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION But high production is not the only factor to be considered. We may have herds averaging 400 and 500 pounds fat and still the farmer may not have a sufficient income to make his industry remunerative. There is something more than simply cow production in successful dairy farming. We must devote our attention to growing feeds suitable for the dairy cow. In your state alfalfa is one of your great crops. There is no better forage grown for the dairy cow than alfalfa. It yields more per acre and is richer in protein than any other hay we can produce. Moreover, it supplements corn silage admirably. With corn silage and alfalfa hay, and a cow of good dairy inheritance, the dairy farmer is in a position to produce profitable flows of milk. It is not wise to require cattle to produce on roughage alone, for in - variably we can supplement these roughages with grain or mill feeds with profit. Alfalfa and corn silage however, help to make the dairy farmer master of his own business. We should ever be directed to making people conscious of their own responsibilities because I can - not conceive of any industry being properly developed unless the in - dividual has very largely under his control the various phases of his industry. Supplementing home grown grain and roughage with mill feeds invariably is profitable, but there are times when prices of dairy products are such that it is better to omit mill feeds. This can only be done when the dairy farmer has seen fit to produce such roughage as alfalfa hay and corn silage. This past year when the drouth cut down the feed supply, farmers everywhere rededicated themselves to the silo. In good years when there was an abundance of alfalfa hay and good corn fodder, many began to wonder if it paid to maintain a silo. It is unnecessary for me to relate how the drouth the past season has emphasized the necessity of a silo. Instead of having fewer silos, we should build more that we can preserve a sufficient quantity of silage to carry our herds for a year. Feeding silage through the summer is advantageous, especially in sections where there is likely to be drouth during the months of July and August. We need, too, to give more attention to pasture. So many dairy farmers pasture poor lands that have been in pasture for so many years that little return is obtained from them. We need to change our con - ceptions of what constitutes good land for pasture and be directed to growing more grass. There is no feed superior to pasture for the dairy cow. She gathers it herself, which saves much labor, and other expense. I am quite in sympathy with the government when it advocates growing more suitable roughages for livestock. The dairy cow is cap - able of handling roughage to splendid advantage, but we should exer - cise care to produce the right kind of roughage if we expect the best </seg>
            <seg id="p282">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE returns from our cows. I ' "Wje have beard so much about over production that perhaps saying something regarding the increased production per acre is not good taste. To me, this country will never become prosperous by producing a scar - city. Further, I sometimes wonder if we really have an over produc - tion. On April 1, 1934, there were 900 pounds of oats, wheat, and corn for each mule, horse, i dairy, and beef animal. Now, 900 pounds of feed apiece for these animals, on April first, as everyone of us knows, is a very small quantity. It is my opinion we have not had a sufficient surplus to protect the welfare of our livestock and people. One year's severe drouth has forced us to sell between eight and nine million head of cattle in order to have enough feed to maintain the balance. One state has gathered Russian thistles, as high as 400,000 tons, to provide something to keep cattle alive. This situation reveals to me that our surplus is not great enough. It has been in the wrong form and in the wrong place, however. We need more surplus in silage and alfalfa hay and more corn and wheat and oats in the farmer's bin and less wheat!, corn, and oats in the elevator. We need to learn how to handle a sufficient surplus to protect ourselves against years like last year, then these surpluses will become blessings rather than evils which penalize those who produce food. An effort was made to reduce the production of dairy products fifteen per cent through a control program. This was turned down by the dairy farmers of this nation and it was a wise action. In 1934, the federal government estimated that milk production was between four and six per cent less than the previous year. This has materially raised the prices of dairy products. In fact, they have gone so high as to cause underconsumption, due to low wages and unemployment of many citizens. We dairy farmers can do little toward controlling employment but it is important for us that all people be employed at good wages, for we cannot hope to sell our products at good prices and have a sufficient demand for them to maintain a healthy dairy industry unless people are at work. It seems to me it would be well to emphasize here the necessity of breeding better cattle. We need to raise the average production of our national herd above an average of 160 pounds fat. To do this we must be directed to the production of seed stock that will transmit higher production. Denmark, through a breeding program, has raised the production of its cattle to 260 pounds fat. If Denmark can do this, surely it will not be impossible for us. But we need to change some of the ideas which have been used in breeding these' many years. It has been reasoned that by selecting a bull, for example, out of a high producing cow and by a sire out of a high producing cow, we would </seg>
            <seg id="p283">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION improve the production of our cattle. This reasoning may be sound up to a certain extent. When our cattle averaged around 100 pounds fat' a year, the selection of a registered bull invariably improved pro - duction, but we now have herds that average 300 and 400 pounds, some of them 500 pounds fat a year. This means a different method of selecting bulls must be followed, otherwise we will make no great progress toward increasing the average production of our national herd of dairy cows. Let me cite an example of a breeding project with chickens which the Maine Experiment Station carried on some years ago. Cockerels were selected from the best laying hens and mated to pullets from the best laying hens. At the end of ten years, this flock was not producing quite as well as at the beginning. What was the trouble? Just this. A cockerel may have a mother that is a good laying hen, but she may not transmit to her son the ability to transmit her good inheritance. The same may be said of pullets. Then what is to be done? Try out these cockerels; so did Mr. E. Parmalee Prentice, the owner of Mount Hope Farms. Locate the cockerels that have the ability to transmit good inheritance; locate the pullets that will transmit good inherit - ance, and mate them. When Mount Hope Farm began its breeding work, the flock averaged about 160 eggs per bird per year. The average production now is 225 eggs per bird per year. Some years ago when traveling in Scotland, I visited a prominent Ayrshire breeder. As I viewed his forty-five talented dairy cows com - ing up the lane, all of splendid conformation, I said to him, "Mr. Barr, how did you get so many cows of excellent type and dairy talent?" He replied, "Mon, Oh, mon, I keep many bulls and I sample them a bit." No bull was placed at the head of his herd until he was known to be an asset. He was first proved to be good before he was used extensively. Here lies the crux of breeding better cattle. To bring about this desirable situation, a breeder must keep records of all his cows. Not records of the herd for one or two years, or three years, but records of every animal in the herd year after year. There are three outstanding reasons for testing all cows: (1) to prove the bulls; (2) to prove the cows, that is to locate the brood cows; and (3) to eliminate the culls. In no other way can accurate and sufficient breeding information be secured except through testing; testing the dams to know their talent, testing the daughters to know theirs, and then comparing the records of the dams with their daugh - ters. The results of the daughter-dam comparisons will give the meas - ure of the bull, provided of course the records are unselected. It is unnecessary for me to relate the many tragedies that follow when bulls of apparently good pedigree have been placed at the head </seg>
            <seg id="p284">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE of good herds only to find that they did not possess the inheritance to transmit high production to their offspring. It Is not uncommon to find splendid producing herdB ruined because of some poor, no account bull. The dairy farmers of this nation desire the opportunity to purchase bulls from breeders who give attention to the inheritance of their cattle; that is^ locate the animals able to transmit the production of their ancestry. The time will come when they will guarantee bulls to trans - mit a definite amount of fat on twice-a-day milking. Breeders who direct themselves to a program of this character will find no trouble in sellingjall their bull calves. It means work to bring about a herd of this character. Such herds exist now in our country, but we need thou - sands of such herds to furnish the seed stock essential to the develop - ment of a national herd that will average at least 3 00 pounds fat per cow per year. What a challenge this opportunity should be to every young man, for securing such a herd will give the greatest enjoyment and at the same time prove a remunerative undertaking. Thank you. MR. H. P. DAVIS: I speak for the association and those present in saying that we have been delighted to have listened to you again, Mr. Glover, and we appreciate very much your effort in appearing here today. Fifty years ago they had a break in the program at this point by having a little music and it seems only natural that we would have Miss Dean sing for us the same songs that were sung at that meeting. Miss Dean. (Miss Dean sang "Auld Lang Syne", "Are You Sleeping Maggie" and "Comln' Thru' the Rye".) MR. H. P. DAVIS: Miss Dean, I am sure you can see how our members have appreciated your singing and we wish to thank you for bringing back to our memories those songs. Our program, I think, is always fortunate when we can cover dif - ferentj phases of the dairy industry, and one of the most important phases is to be brought before us by Mr. R. W. Balderston of the National Dairy Council and he will address us on "The Future Con - sumption of Dairy Products". Mr. Balderston. MR. R. W. BALDERSTON: Mr. President and members of the Dairymen's Association. At our Annual Meeting in 1933, Mr. M. D. MunnJ President of the National Dairy Council pointed out that for several preceding years the proportion of gross farm income from the dairy cow had continually increased in amount. That in 19 25 milk supplied 14.51 per cent of the gross farm income and in 1932 </seg>
            <seg id="p285">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION this had increased to 24.5 per cent. While gross farm income from all sources other than the dairy cow dropped more than 60 per cent between 1929 and 1932 inclusive, that portion of farm income derived from milk had decreased only 45 per cent or one-fourth less than from all other sources. Some fundamental reasons were pointed out why this industry had progressed and because of which we believed it would continue to • progress. Kncouruging Picture of the Dairy Industry In his 1934 annual address, he presented a little different picture, but one which is equally encouraging and assuring so far as confidence In and hope for the dairy industry are concerned. I have been asked to present those facts briefly as part of my remarks today. Let us go back to the production of milk in the year 1924 because that is the year to which the U. S. Department of Agriculture has re - vised its yearly estimates of milk production. These are the best esti - mates that are now available and I expect they are the best that will ever be available on milk production in this country during this period of time. Let us consider for a moment the facts presented by these revised estimates as disclosed on this chart. PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION of DAIRY PRODUCTS 1924 to 1933 INCLUSIVE " '£j- . •JttSurptui 1924 1925 1926 1927 1928 1929 1930 1931 1932 1933 B ol&lt; 00UCTi0N SScOISUMPTiOM Source USC 'i. Chart 1. Milk production steadily increased (rum 1924 through 1933. t" msumption, in the main, kept pace with production. In 1924 we produced 91,489,000,000 pounds of milk. Following Chart 1 through from 1924 to 1933 inclusive we find that milk produc - tion steadily increased year by year and in 1933 had risen to 105,135,- </seg>
            <seg id="p286">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE OOOJOOO, an increase over 1924 of 14.9 per cent or approximately 14 - 0001000,000 pounds of milk. During this entire period, with the exception of two years, the increase in consumption has kept even pace with increase in production. In 1930 there was a small surplus of less than one per cent which showed up in a surplus of about 45,000,000 pounds of butter above the year before, and somewhat above the five - year average. The butter industry took hold of that situation and with the expendi - ture of a small, amount of money increased the consumption of butter sufficiently to dispose of this surplus fn three months. During 1931 and 1932 production and consumption remained In noTma\ balance. During 1933, however, there again appeared a com - paratively small surplus but one which depressed the price of dairy products, especially butter. During the year 1933, according to the bestjestimates available, we had about 2,500,000,000 pounds of surplus milk, i.e., during that year there was a production of approximately 2,500,000,000 pounds of milk in excess of what was consumed in various forms and this resulted in a surplus of about 100,000,000 pounds of butter and approximately 30,000,000 pounds of cheese. Butter, as you know, is always the place to which most of any surplus of milk finally finds its way. When the consumption of milk is below the market milk supply, it flows mostly into butter production. This surplus of butter from 1933 together with all that was pro - duced during 1934 has been consumed in this country and this industry now |finds itself with a production below consumption requirements. Of this 100,000,000 pounds of surplus butter, which appeared during 1933 r the government bought approximately 51,000,000 pounds and supplied it to people on relief. The butter industry also took hold of this situation, and expended $33,000.00 in promotive efforts to increase the consumption of butter in order to help dispose of this surplus. I am not going to make any claim as to what extent this educational work contributed toward the disposition of that surplus beyond stating that we know it did make a substantial contribution. The outstanding fact, however, is that production is below con - sumption requirements at the present time. This condition is probably due in part to the fact that consumption of butter increased during 1934 and in part to the fact that drought conditions, which are liable to come at any time, have somewhat reduced production. I hope that you will keep in mind the facts disclosed by this chart showing the balanced relationship between production and consumption of dairy products over a period of ten years because of its relation to what jfollows. </seg>
            <seg id="p287">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION We have been asked this question many times during the past year. "What is wrong with the dairy industry? While I shall not attempt to answer this question directly, I do wish to present some facts which I think, in part at least, do answer that question. Progress of Dairy Industry Compares Favorably with Other Basic Indnstries Chart 2 shows the trends in production, consumption and use of the products of five basic industries. We have gone back to the year 1924 so as to embrace five years of the prosperous period -preceding 1929 and five years of depressed condition following 1929. This gives us a tair basis tor comparisons during a period of both prosperity and depression.

Dairy products have continually increased in volume of production and consumption, in contrast to other liasic farm food products and tn other certain basic industries. This chart is based on three basic farm food products, namely, milk, beef animals and hogs, selected because of their volume and promin - ence, and the products of two other industries which are considered both basic and barometrical, namely, steel and automobiles. Starting with 192 4 as a base of one hundred per cent, we find, ex - pressed in terms of milk, the dairy industry has continually increased its volume of production and consumption without any recession so that at the end of 1933 production of milk was 14.9 per cent or about 14,000,000,000 pounds greater than in 1924. The two other basic farm products, beef animals and hogs, during </seg>
            <seg id="p288">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE this period of ten years have never equalled the 1924 volume of pro - duction and consequently of consumption. They have remained below 1924 and sometimes dropped very much below. The estimated production of both beef animals and hogs, as dis - closed: on this chart, is taken from the government's estimate of the number of animals on farms each year during this period. There is no other way of estimating the production or consumption of these products. Of course, whether domestic or foreign, the consumption necessarily follows each year the number estimated to be on the farms the preceding year. Based on these estimates, we find that the production and consump - tion of beef animals between 1924 and 1933 inclusive have ranged be - tween 7 per cent and 20 per cent less than 1924 and during no year has production equalled that of 1924. The same thing is true regarding hogs, excepting that the range in production and consumption of hogs during this period has been be - tween 7 per cent and 22 per cent less than 1924. Turning now to steel and automobiles, we find facts which are amaz - ing when compared with the stability and progress of the dairy industry. You will recall that steel is usually referred to as the barometer of in - dustrial conditions. It seems safe to say with equal correctness that the automobile industry is a barometer of luxury and industrial progress. It is interesting to note that between 1924 and 1929 inclusive the production of steel never dropped below the year 1924 and reached the peak of production in 1929 when it was approximately 48 per cent above 1924. During this same year, the manufacture and sale of automobiles was 43 per cent above 19 24. The havoc wrought by the depression on these two industries between 1929 and 1933 is appalling. Doesn't the continued progress and stability of the dairy industry throughout this period of depression, in comparison with these other industries especially steel and automobiles, give us reason for assurance and confidence that is heartening and convincing? The facts disclosed on this chart should be a source of great con - fidence in this fundamental industry of agriculture. The startling fact that during the year 193 3 milk production and consumption was nearly 15 per cent greater than 1924 while steel production was nearly 39 per cunt less makes of the dairy industry a haven of confidence in these times of distress.

So far as butter and cheese are con - cerned, prices are based on New York quotations. The change in wholesale price of butter is based on extras, New York market; cheese wholesale price of Daisies, New York market, which are generally accepted as fair estimates of the average price of cheese.

Chart 3. Prices of liuttcr, cheese and milk increased appreciably in 1934 over the same period for 1933. Taking these two products, based on monthly averages o£ New York market quotations, we find that for the first ten months of 1934, as compared with the same period of 1933, the wholesale price of butter has increased 14.8 per cent, for cheese the wholesale price has in - creased 6.4 per cent. There is no way of estimating the average of wholesale prices of milk so we are using two comparisons, the average retail price of bottled milk and the average price paid farmers for Class 1 milk. The average retail price of milk in one hundred cities in the United States during the first ten months of 1933 was 9.9 cents per quart. For the first ten months of 1934 it was 10.7 cents per quart, an increase of 8 per cent. These prices are flat and not weighted averages. Chart 4 shows the average increase in price paid farmers for Class 1 milk during the first ten months of 1934 as compared with the first ten months of 1933. This covers the same cities and territory on which the average retail price already stated is based, and is also a flat not a weighted average. 10 </seg>
            <seg id="p290">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE This chart shows that for the first ten months of 1933 the average price paid farmers for Class 1 milk was $1.56 per hundred pounds and for the same period of 1934 it was $1.86 per hundred pounds or 19 per cent more than producers received during the first ten months of 1933. You will observe that the 19.0 per cent average increase in price paid producers is above the average increase in retail price or price re - ceived by distributors. This changing trend in the prices paid for dairy products is also a very favorable sign and should lend encouragement to this industry.

This also applies to any increased cost of distribution that may exist. The Dairy Industry in a Sound Condition Now, friends, in view of all these facts is any conclusion possible other than that this industry is sound? We are forced to the inevit - able conclusion that nothing is intrinsically or basically wrong with the dairy industry. Food fads will come and go, but science has disclosed that the nec - essity of milk and its products in the human diet is as eternal as the </seg>
            <seg id="p291">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION sun; and the food elements milk contains are as essential to growth and health as sunlight itself. The Opportunities Open to the Dairy Industry. In considering opportunities for the future there is one outstand - ing fact before this industry at the present time which I wish to present as earnestly as possible. Science has placed before this industry op - portunities which I firmly believe will, if taken advantage of, remove and dispel much of the doubt and uncertainty now retarding industry progress. As nearly as can be ascertained from the best sources of information, the average daily consumption of milk at the present time is six-tenths of a pint per person. To illustrate what this means to the industry, let us use a visual illustration. We will do so because it presents in vivid and accurate form these facts better than can be done by statements of amounts and percentages. * TOTAL MILK RECOMMENDED • FOR FAMILY OF FIVE » PRESENT CONSUMPTION '^ SCIENCE ADDS - ' I'/a Quarts - Daily Avarag* 2/2 Quarts in Form of Milk For Family of Fivo And Other Dairy Product* Chart 5. The two bottles, one quart and one pint, on the left side of this chart represent the average amount of milk now daily consumed by a family of five. How that is consumed we do not know. Possibly in some cases, most, if not all, is consumed by the three children who make up this family of five but in many cases we know the children get much less 'than a pint per day. </seg>
            <seg id="p292">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I ' Science, however, has not left us in doubt on this question of how much milk should be consumed by a family of five. I think I can say with utmost assurance that nutrition authorities agree the daily con - sumption should be one quart for each child in some form, but mostly milk, and one pint or more for each adult, a part of which may be in milk equivalents such as cheese and ice cream. This chart is completed by adding the increased amount recom - mended by science which fills the picture of four quarts of milk per dayj in some form, for a family of five. That is the goal that lies ahead of this industry. That is the opportunity that should lead to effort and impel action. In using the term, "milk equivalent", we mean that some of this increased amount of milk by a family of five can be taken in the form of cheeses and ice cream or possibly some other forms of milk, but not butter, because butter is not in fact a milk equivalent. Butter does not contain the mineral matter, sugar and other elements contained in milk but does contain the fat in which is wrapped, in some mysterious way, vitamin A and some vitamin D, so essential to growth and health, and which makes butter an indis - pensable food fat. Food authorities estimate that each person consumes or should consume each year, forty-six pounds of fat from all food sources in order to supply the heat and energy requirements of the body. Of this amount, approximately two-thirds, or thirty pounds, should be in the form of butter. This amount of butter is recommended by food authorities because it supplies not only the vitamins already referred to but a flavor or palatability which is so essential as well as satisfying. In order to provide the quantity of milk necessary for this in - creased amount of butter and also the added amount of milk which science recommends, would require about 60,000,000,000 pounds more milk than was produced last year. What an opportunity that affords this industry! What would the production of that increased amount of milk mean on the farms of this country? More Dairy Products Needed to Meet Requirement Set by Science If this great dairy industry could achieve what science says it should, it would require 10,000,000 more dairy cows than are now on the farms of this country and these cows would have to be at least 50.0 per cent more efficient in production than the average cow in the United States today. What an immense contribution even a partial fulfillment of the opportunities that lie ahead of this industry would make to the stab - ility of agriculture! </seg>
            <seg id="p293">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION With these facts and opportunities before us how futile it is to talk about a reduced production or even a controlled production beyond that which would come from the removal of inefficient or undesirable animals and the establishment of an economical system of feeding. I wish that every producer of milk and everyone engaged in this industry, could realize the full import of the facts here presented. I firmly believe that if this industry would begin at once an adequate program for increased consumption of its products, it would dispose of the troubles that have been hanging over it and retarding its progress during the past year and one-half. This desired goal cannot be reached in a single year. But great yearly progress can be made and the goal finally reached. CONSUMER APPEALS 10S5 MODEL: With this goal presented to the industry — a goal which means a 50% increase in the production, manufacture and sale of all dairy products — the question arises, "how are we going to attain it?" What appeals are we going to use in urging the consumer to consume larger quantities of our products? When the Dairy Council movement was started fifteen years ago, the American people were just beginning to understand the newer knowledge of nutrition. The research had developed previous to the war — now with the war over our health and educational authorities were interested in applying this new information to American food habits. It was really at the request of dietary scientists like Dr. McCollum that in 1918 the dairy industry undertook a campaign of consumer education. At this time there was a widespread interest in a new type of health education which included the observance of right food habits, including the consumption of a quart of milk a day by each child and adequate amounts of milk and equivalent products by adults. This movement enabled the dairy industry, through the Dairy Council, to cooperate with the great health agencies in the country in a new health education program. Furthermore, the international food shortage during the war and the consequent malnutrition in Central Europe brought thoughtful leaders in health education to a fresh realiza - tion of the importance of an adequate diet. Therefore a first appeal was that of food value, to emphasize such facts as the importance of vitamin A in butterfat and milk is the best source of calcium. Associated with these appeals was, of course, the importance of growth in children and therefore Rrowth was emphasized in the material to be used by teachers and for distribution to school children and by them to be taken home. The Council chart called "Milk Made the Difference", showing the difference in growth of dogs, pigs and </seg>
            <seg id="p294">REPORT OF XEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE chickens, the one fed on a diet containing dairy products and the other on a diet without, has been very widely used. This chart has been said by health educators to be the most striking piece of material ever put out by the Dairy Council. Personality Appeals Found Effective As time went on, public reactions were studied. It was found that in order to reach every member of the family that the story of the food importance of dairy products had to be rephrased in many instances to discuss health in terms of Immediate and personal interest to each mem ber of the family as well as to all groups in the community. Jhe importance of milk for strong bones and sound teeth gave the dairy industry a splendid group of cooperators among the dentists and dental hygienists, as well as public health officials generally. Adults, especially women, are interested in weight control and we must stress the importance of milk in all diets, whether for reducing or gaining or maintaining body weight. Correspondingly, it is pointed out that, with all the modern aids to beauty, after all, beauty comes from within and the importance of sound health based on proper food selection is stressed in much of the Council material directed particularly to the young woman and adolescent girl. We all know young men like to achieve, so we point out the importance of right food for a sound body in athletes. Milk for longevity and for efficiency always appeals to the middle-aged of both sexes. Milk and Its Products Are Economical With the coming of the depression the dairy industry faced a very serious situation in that all groups of the population were feeling the pinch and were practicing economy. Much of this newly-needed eco - nomy was necessarily unintelligent and misdirected. Those who sud - denly lost their positions or who had their incomes sharply reduced now had to count their every penny and did not know where to cut in an economy program. For this reason the milk supply was very often a place where false economy was practiced. Therefore, much material has been produced and many projects initiated by the Council during the last five years touching on the importance of milk in any economical food budget. It has been extremely valuable to the industry that we are able to tell the consumer that a quart of milk a day furnishes one - half jjf the daily food needs of the adult, the other half being supplied by the other foods furnished by the varied American diet during the de - pression. One quart of milk did not cost over 10&lt;! to 12&lt;S in most mar - kets, while the other food products which made up the balance of the </seg>
            <seg id="p295">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION diet of the adult cost from 30tf to 40£. Furthermore, in milk and its products, there are food properties, such as calcium,' phosphorus and some of the vitamins which cannot he adequately and economically - supplied in other common American foods. Therefore, we have been pointing out in all types of publicity that it is false economy to cut the milk supply below the needs of adequate nutrition. It is difficult to fully appraise the results of this type of consumer publicity respecting the economy of dairy products such as milk, butter and cheese. It would be safe to say, however, that the stability of the industry throughout the depression period, as shown by chart 2, is to a considerable degree the result of this cooperative effort on the part of the dairy industry through its Dairy Council. People Use Dairy Products Because They I^ike Them A major emphasis of practically all of the adult material published by the Dairy Council at the present time is the fine flavor of milk and its products. For instance, in the butter consumption campaign of 1933 a slogan, "Butter makes good foods taste better" caught the fancy of every one, and to the vigorous campaign built upon this slogan we can attribute some of the credit for the fact that butter consumption remained remarkably high throughout 1934. Government estimates show that butter consumption during the first ten months of 1934 was 3.4% above that of 1933, and in the face of steadily increasing prices. Likewise, we must bear in mind at all times the importance of this matter of flavor in milk. In the recent consumer survey made in Philadelphia, of the adults who drank milk 75% said they drank it because they liked it and of those adults who did not drink milk 49% said they disliked it. In the light of this illuminating information regarding the attitudes of average city consumers, is it not safe to predict that any further in - crease in the consumption of dairy products will be obtained very largely through the emphasis on this matter of fine flavor? Another feature of recent surveys in city markets, particularly the one in the Philadelphia market, is the direct evidence that most of the Increased consumption obtained during the last fifteen years has been by the children under twelve years, particularly those living in our large consuming centers. This increase has been obtained largely through the splendid cooperation of the public schools. Program Must Include For these reasons the Council program of publicity includes not only work with school children, one which will carry the child through the period of adolescence and until his adult food habits have been </seg>
            <seg id="p296">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE firmly established, but also a program to reach the entire family. Emphasis on flavor is likewise timely today because the industry is making such studies in improving the flavor of all its products through standardization of method, both on the farm and in the plant. Therefore, on the threshold of this great opportunity which lies ahead for the industry, we find ourselves with products which in the main will recommend themselves to each member of the family be - cause of their fine quality and we find the consumer more and more willing and eager to utilize combinations of all kinds; the splendid flavor| of butter in cooking and as a spread on bread; cheese, a flavor for every taste; and ice cream, the national dessert, a real food, as well. More Organization Needed In order to attain as rapidly and as completely as possible this goal of fifty per cent increase in consumption, the industry should utilize every possible publicity avenue. Each branch of the industry and each unit in each branch can do many things individually but much jof the work will have to be done through local publicity organiza - tions-pthat is, under Council auspices. The best results from this regional work can be obtained only when they are closely co-ordinated in a national way. Furthermore, there are certain types of publicity that can be done only through a national program. At the present time there are a number of movements in the industry looking toward the develcpment of a nation-wide program. Those who are interested in promoting the sale of products nation - ally — jthe breed associations, the machinery groups, and the manu - facturers and distributors of butter and cheese — are primarily inter - ested in a program of national scope, while those interested in fluid milk production and distribution and the manufacture and sale of ice cream can develop a very effective program in the local market In which they are particularly interested. Methods of Work Effective methods of general publicity have been thoroughly demon - strated and a national program has been approved by the national and regional units of the Dairy Council movement, making a complete family, approach through all available groups of the community. These projecus include at the present time: Health Departments and Medical Profession Schools Home Economics </seg>
            <seg id="p297">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION Work with Adult Groups, such as Parent-Teacher Associations • Industrial Workers, Relief Organizations Dental Groups Work with dairy industry At the present time the Council movement reaches approximately 61% of the city dwellers through the regional Dairy Councils. The other 39% need similar regional organization. The rural population of the United States must be reached by extension methods either from the National office or one of the regional offices. If yours is a market that is not organized for this work, full plans of such organization are available with such variations as fit the con - ditions in your city. On the other hand, if you are interested in and can help individually with rural work there are publicity projects of an extension type which can be carried on by community leaders in any rural section of the United States. Permanent Program Necessary All this publicity work must be carried out in an intelligent and well-organized fashion and there must be a permanent organization. Sporadic campaigns are good but the effects soon wear off. It is true there should be at frequent intervals some spectacular endeavor such as milk parades, newspaper campaigns, cooking schools, exhibits, etc., to supplement the regular work. However, substantial results come from a year in year out type of publicity. One of the Councils has as its slogan for 1935 "Every Week Is Milk Week". So today, at the beginning of 1935, with an industry which is fun - damentally sound and stable; in fact, more stable than any other agri - cultural and industrial endeavor — with an unequalled opportunity for expanding during the years to come — this goal can and will be reached just in proportion to the support which the entire industry gives to a program of consumer education and the activities which its various branches display in carrying their movement forward. MR. H. P. DAVIS: Mr. Balderston, we sincerely appreciate your coming here today and addressing us in place of Mr. Munn and we feel that you have brought us a message of great importance. If the people can sell an article like gum by advertising so widely, why can't the consumption of dairy products be increased by the same method when we can incorporate the element of health in our advertising.

            <seg id="p309">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION Story of Trip to Waterloo We left Lincoln Tuesday morning, October 3, for Waterloo, Iowa, about 9 o'clock. Included in the party besides myself were Mr. Friable, my team mate, Dale Theobald, and two boys from Gage county who made up the Dairy A demonstration team. We arrived In Waterloo about 6:30 that evening. We had a little trouble finding a place to stay and finally wound up in a private home. We originally had planned to stay at the U. M. C. A., but for some reason rooms were not available there. The next morning, Wednesday, October 4, we were scheduled to demonstrate at 11 o'clock. It was very cold and we did not care any too much about making ice cream but we had to make it anyway. We watched several other teams demonstrate that morning, all girls. That afternoon we looked over part of the fair grounds and that evening we attended a program in the Hippodrome at which there was a great parade of horses and cattle as the feature of the evening's program. Thursday we spent the day looking over the exhibits at the show./ There was a large number of entries, all of excellent quality. In the evening we were invited to attend a banquet given to all 4-H Club members and their leaders. This banquet was sponsored by the busi - ness men of Waterloo. It was at the banquet that we were to find out the results of the judging and demonstration contest. We were greatly surprised and also very much pleased to discover that the dairy B demonstration team of which' I was a member received first place. For this I was presented with a very nice Elgin gold watch. My team mate received a similar watch. ■ . ' ■ ■ I That evening, immediately after the banquet, we left for Ames, Iowa, arriving there about 12. The next morning we left Ames for Lincoln. We arrived home a little tired but very happy over our achievement and with a great deal of praise for the National Dairy Congress. ■..-■•••■ - . ■ • . ■ •;/ MAX BROWN. Fillmore County.

            <seg id="p310">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE My Trip to the National Dairy Congress The Nebraska demonstration teams which consisted of Dale Theo - bald and Max Brown of Fillmore County, and Ivan Frantz and myself from Gage County, left Lincoln Tuesday, October, 2nd with Mr. L. I. Frisbje, at 9:05 A. M., from the Agricultural College. Soon after we got started the fun began. Mr. Frisbie told us that we would play "Zits'f on the road to Waterloo. I suppose most of you have played the game. This kept us awake the entire way to Waterloo. Tuesday noon we stopped for lunch at Atlantic, Iowa, after which we continued our journey by way of Des Moines. We arrived in Waterloo at 5:30 P. M. and immediately went to the U. M. C. A. to get rooms for the week. However, we were unable to get a room there |&amp; s they were full, but we were fortunate in finding rooms at a residence where the Nebraska judging team was also staying. Thus all of Nebraska was together. Wednesday morning we arose early after having a good night's rest, and started to the Fair, as the Fillmore County boys were demon - strating at 11:00 A. M. We finally reached the grounds of the Fair, but all of us but Mr. Frisbie were turned in our directions. As we found out, the streets are most all crooked thus making it hard to keep directions. At 11:00 A. M. the demonstration was given by our Dairy B team from Fillmore County, and they gave it well considering the place J:he demonstrations were held. After we had eaten lunch we went to the Ayrshire barn where we heard the world series baseball game. After the game we looked over the Fair until about 7:00 o'clock when we went to the Hippodrome where a fine entertainment was given us. This Hippodrome is similar to grandstand performances at small fairs. However, this building was all inclosed and had a seating capacity of approximately 15,000. Their entertainment featured their livestock parade and the judging of riding horses, together with high grade stage performances. After the show we went to our rooms and tried to sleep, but I kept thinking about the next day when our demonstration was to be given. I managed to sleep most of the night and again the next morning we had to rise) early and prepare for our demonstration. We did not give it until about 12:30 so we had all morning to get ready. For awhile we watched the livestock judging which lasted through the entire week. At 12:30 we were so hungry we went right after our demonstration and gave it better than ever before. Thursday afternoon we were getting slow on our feet so again we listened to the world series. About 5 P. M. we left the Fair grounds and went to our rooms and packea our grips and loaded our car. That </seg>
            <seg id="p311">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION evening we went to a banquet given for the 4-H teams, which was held in Black's Tea Room. After a lovely dinner had been served and an address had been given, the awards were made. This was the most exciting part of the trip. We were well pleased with our placing of third as were the Fillmore County boys with their first prize gold watches. Nebraska was fortunate in taking a prize with every mem - ber that was represented at the Dairy Show. The banquet was over at 10:30 and we immediately left for Ames, Iowa where we put up for the night about 1:00 Friday morning. Fri - day, after we arose, we stopped at the College for nearly one hour. This was the best looking college I had ever seen. It made one feel right at home with its many flowers and green grass to aid in its beauty. We continued driving until we reached Omaha at 1:15 P. M., where we ate lunch. After lunch we continued to Lincoln where we bade our pals good-bye, and my team mate, Ivan Frantz, and I were motored home by Ivan's father. I reached home at 8:00 Friday evening after having" had a fine time on my trip to the National Dairy Congress in Waterloo, Iowa. Many thanks to the Nebraska Dairy Breeders' Association for financ - ing our trip, and to the National Committee for our medals, and to Mr. Estel and the Cattle Congress for their fine show and an oppor - tunity to contest with 4-H club members from other states.

            <seg id="p312">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Production of Clean Milk". The finances of this trip were furnished by the Nebraska Dairymen's Association. The champion Nebraska dairy B demonstration team from Pill - more county, my team mate and myself along with Mr. Frisbie left Lincoln at 9 A. M. October 2, bound for Waterloo. As we were traveling by auto we got a good view of the country as we went. Having paid the toll and crossed the Missouri river at Omaha we began a trip almost across the state of Iowa. We ate our first meal in Iowa at Atlantic. We continued the journey through Des Moines. We saw several coal mines operating in this vicinity. We saw the beauti - ful capitol of Iowa in Des Moines. As we advanced toward Waterloo, we were in a different kind of country than Nebraska. They will have a corn crop although it will be small for Iowa. The trees were at their height of beauty when we were there. The hillsides with all colors of foliage from yellow to a bright red presented very beautiful pictures. No wheat was coming up there while wheat fields at home were green. Wj arrived in Waterloo at 5:30 that evening. We ate at the Y. M. C. A. that evening. We were planning to room at the Y. M. C. A. but as their rooms were all filled we went to a private home where the other Nebraska delegation was staying. This delegation consisted of the dairy judging team, coach, and state leader. We went to the exposition grounds Wednesday morning. We began a toui of inspection of the grounds that morning. The large exhibit of fine dairy animals was very interesting. I was able to see several fine classes of dairy animals judged. The large display of Belgian horses was also very fine. The interstate demonstration contest began at 10:30 A. M. The Nebraska dairy B team demonstrated at 11 A. M. I heard most of the class B demonstrations. Most of my interest was centered on the Ne - braska team. That evening we attended the Hippodrome performances through the courtesy of the exposition management. The grand cattle and horse parade was an outstanding feature. The very fine cattle of the show were led into the arena until it was filled. It was next filled with fine horses. The circus acts were of the finest to be found anywhere. Thursday morning was spent in preparing to give our demonstration. We demonstrated at 12:30. As ours was the last one to be given I was able to hear all of the class A demonstrations. After getting our demonstration equipment packed we bade farewell to the demonstra - tion part of our program. After giving the exposition our farewell that </seg>
            <seg id="p313">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION afternoon, we left it to conclude a happy two days there. At 6:30 P. M. that evening we were entertained at the interstate judging and demonstration team's banquet. It was held at Black's Tea Room. Mr. Frisbie proved to be a very good toastmaster. The awards of the interstate contests were announced here. It was a great pleasure for my team mate and myself to accept the handsome silver medals which were awarded to us for winning third place in the dairy A dem - onstration contest. It also gave me much pleasure to learn that the team from Fillmore county placed first in the dairy B demonstration contest for which they received handsome gold wrist watches and to learn that the Nebraska judging team ranked first in judging Guern - seys and Brown Swiss breeds. We began our homeward journey immediately after the banquet at 10:30 P. M. Since we were traveling at night it was impossible to view the country. We arrived in Ames at 12:45 A. M. to spend the early morning hours in Hotel Ames. The next morning we paid a short visit to the beautiful college campus at Ames. We continued with our homeward journey, again seeing many beautiful scenes. We traveled several miles in the bluffs north of Council Bluffs. We arrived in Omaha for a late dinner meal. While in Omaha we paid a short visit to the South Omaha stock yards and the Exchange Building. We arrived in Lincoln about 4:30 P. M. October 5, to complete the trip. I had a very enjoyable trip from start to finish. It was very educa - tional in developing a better taste for good dairy animals such as I saw there and the value I received from hearing and giving dairy demon - stration. This trip made me a very happy vacation. I sincerely wish to express my appreciation to those who helped make this trip a possibility and a success and to those who have helped us to be able to take our demonstration to the national contest. I wish it could be possible for every 4-H Club member to take this or a similar trip. The small amount of effort which is necessary would be well paid for. IVAN FRANTZ, Gage County. "As a member of the division B dairy demonstration team that com - peted at Waterloo, Iowa, I wish to thank the Association for the trip, for it was certainly wonderful. We had a chance to see new country, in all its autumn splendor, the opportunity to see some of the world's finest dairy animals and </seg>

We enjoyed every single minute of it, both for the educational benefits and for the pleasure that we got out of the trip. Tjhis trip gives something more for teams to work for, and the value of it is priceless. It gives a person a chance to work in new sur - roundings, and to work on his own initiative. 1 1 hope that next year Nebraska may send new groups to the Dairy Cattle Congress, and, if so that these folks enjoy the trip as much as we did this year." Yours truly, DALE THEOBALD, Fillmore County. October 1st, 1934 came blowing in and brought with it the opening day of the National Dairy Congress at Waterloo, Iowa. To some people this Congress meant no more than just another 'one of those things' but t^&gt; Max and me it sounded like a second Christmas, or something Monday night, October 1st, we were taken to Lincoln by Miss Runnalls. The next morning we were taken out to Agricultural College Campus, where we were to meet the rest of the group, Mr. Frisbie, our state 4-H Club Leader, Ivan Frantz, and Fred Gish of Gage county the other | members of our group. The Gage county boys were members of the state champion division A, Dairy Demonstration team. The five of us, with our cargo of luggage and equipment left Lin - coln at nine o'clock, by car. We crossed the state line at Omaha We passed through Council Bluffs, which was a new experience for most of us boys. On our way to Waterloo, which is in northeastern Iowa we took the route through Des Moines. A characteristic of Des Moines is its narrow streets. The buildings seem almost to press together But for all of that, it is a nice city. The farther eastward we went, the taller the corn seemed to grow Most of the pastures were very good, and we couldn't help noticing the Plentiful supply of roughness. The farms, as a whole, at least had the ear marks of being prosperous. One thing certain, Iowa has some high hills. We noticed several coal mines working at a distance from the highway, but as time didn't permit, we didn't get to see any at close view. We arrived in Waterloo safe and sound about five-thirty o'clock Tuesday evening and then the fun began. Waterloo, a city of 46,000 </seg>
            <seg id="p315">NEBRASKA STATE DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION is built on the Fox river, a swift little stream, and most of the streets set crosswise with the world. We knew which way was up, and which was down, but . . . ! After supper we were taken to our rooms in a private home. The next morning, which was Wednesday, and incidentally, the day that Max and I were to demonstrate, we hurried around getting ready. We reached the grounds of the Cattle Congress about nine o'clock and immediately prepared our materials. We were scheduled to demon - strate at eleven o'clock. Somehow eleven o'clock rolled around and we shivered and shook through our little act. Boy! Was it a relief to be through? Wednesday afternoon we listened to the World's Series and visited the barns. There were six huge barns of very fine dairy cattle and three barns of wonderful Belgian and riding horses. Outside of this wonderful stock, .the Congress resembled a large Pair with exhibits of machinery, concessions, etc. Wednesday night we attended the performance at the Hippodrome. A very interesting Horse Show was staged, followed by a number of interesting acts. The entire program was worth seeing many times. Thursday the Gage county boys demonstrated. After they had finished we watched the judging of cattle and looked over the Fair Grounds some more. Thursday evening we packed our belongings and then primped up for the 4-H Club banquet held at Black's Tea Room in Waterloo at seven o'clock. This was a banquet 'as was a banquet'. Mr. Frisbie acted as toastmaster which fact gave us Ne - braskans something to be proud of. After partaking of the all too bounteous supply of food, winners were announced and awards presented. More than one person had the jitters, and you may lay to that. Nebraska's judging team won a silver cup for being high team in judging Brown Swiss and each a gold medal for being the high team in Guernseys. The Gage eounty demonstration team won silver medals for placing third. We (Max and I) are still rather hazy as to what happened after that but, any - way, we're back home with the watches. After the banquet we drove to Ames, arriving there about 1 o'clock Friday morning. After a few hours sleep we started homeward, stopping at the State College at Ames on the way. The college campus is a very beautiful place and is well worth seeing. We arrived back in Omaha at late noon, ate dinner, and started for Lincoln about three o'clock. In Lincoln we left the other boys and came back to Geneva with Mr. Thompson. We were home, tired, happy, and proud as two old hens. The whole trip had been deliglitful. The </seg>

We owe much to him for our success. He not only gave us invaluable assistance and encouragement while on our trip, but helped us very much by coaching us before the trip.

            <seg id="p346">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE HOME ECONOMICS SECTION PROGRAM TUESDAY MORNING Mrs. Ernest Overton, Presiding I he session was opened by a musical number sung by Miss Marg - aret KImmel, who was accompanied by Mrs. Mary Hall Thomas. The se lee ion was "The False Prophet" by John Prindle Scott. This was followed with a reading, "The Dressmaker," given by Marjorie Thomas. Mrs. Overton introduced Rev. Walter Aitken, pastor of St. Paul's Meth jdist Church, who pronounced the invocation. Mrs. Ernest Overton extended the president's greetings to the asso - ciation. President's Greetings T^day we open the thirtieth session of this Home Economics Sec - tion of Organized Agriculture. We welcome you and hope that it will te of benefit to all and when you return to your homes, we will be belter acquainted and better friends. The following verse, I think helps to express my thought: "Life is sweet just because of the friends we have made, And the things which in common we share. We want to live on, not because of ourselves But because of the people who care. It's the giving and doing for somebody else; On that, all life's splendor depends; And the joys of this life, when you sum them all up, Are found in the making of friends." Only thirty years ago, we had the first session of this organization At that time most of us were mere children or in our early teens We rode a &gt;out in horse-drawn carriages. We wore long dresses that swept the st ,eets with every step. We had never heard of a radio, to say nothinr of seeing one perform. Very few people, especially farmers, nad te ephones. Paved highways were a thing of which we had never dream d. Today, however, we ride about in automobiles which will carry us to abd from town with comfort. We tune in on our radios and hear the best of programs as we desire. Long dresses are only worn in the evening We walk to the telephone and thus are able to visit with our neighbors or relatives from far and near. Paved highways and graveled roads ire available to most of us! Crop limitation and the Corn-Hog programs are the topic of the hour. Progress moves on, through depression or prosperity. It forges </seg>
            <seg id="p347">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION ahead every day in one way or another. So as progress advances, bo must we — we, who are the backbone of the larm and home, the center about which a multitude of things revolve. We are not only mothers of children, companions to our hus - bands, but are the stabilizing forces which are essential in the making of progress. If we are to remain such, we must keep up with the many changes that are being made which affect us in our everyday life. Today we are in the midst of a political and social activity which demands our time and our attention. We must go into these activities and assume our tasks as leaders because that is what we are. All over the United States people's attention is being turned to - wards women leaders. Such outstanding women as Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt, Ruth Bryan Owen, Miss Frances Perkins and Mrs. Pinchot are examples of the leadership established by women. In every walk of life women have become leaders. Sometimes it seems as if we cannot accomplish the tasks set for us. Yet with careful planning we seem to finish our work. Our rapid advance to keep up with the times, our efficiency, and our being able to take over responsibility and promote our activities has given to each of us a mental satisfaction that has more than offset the deeds which we have had to accomplish. We realize now that as leaders we are keeping up with progress. In our club work this thought is brought out to us by various steps. We are trained to become leaders in our clubs, then presidents. We then may become County Chairman and then State President. This I consider one of the highest honors I shall ever receive. The permanence of the Extension work, however, is hardly open to question. It has demonstrated its usefulness in the past and altered conditions of the country have only served to emphasize the necessity to the farm woman of this far-spreading organized work. In the years to come it is but reasonable to believe that the same fore-sight and energy that have brought this study to Nebraska will continue to operate and to render it a powerful influence in the de - velopment of our farm homes. Through the untiring efforts of our Extension workers from the Agricultural College, our County Agents, and our Home Demonstra - tion Agents, leaders are made every day to carry on the wonderful work. They have laid the basic foundation for better homes, better children and better citizens. I wish to thank them at this time, for this group, so they might know that their efforts are appreciated. New clubs and increasing membership broaden the scope of their activities and prove the sincerity of their work. </seg>
            <seg id="p348">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ~, l\^ heen S pleasure t0 serve you and to work In this capacity I JI ylr ° De Bnd a " f ° r y ° Ur cob P- a »on and loyal supports In closing I wish to leave with you this little poem, "The New Year". "Once more to us has been given A page that is spotless and white. On which to keep a new record Ere cometh the shadows of night. The page we just turned was so blotted, The mistakes we made were not few. But with hope in the soul, we press onward To change the old years for the new. Let's not spend our time in regretting The year that is over and gone. But with faith in our hearts, go bravely To greet the New Year at the dawn." ACCESSORIES MAKE YOTJR COSTUME Pearl Pentiman and Doris Gray Off to college for the first time! My teammate and I are anticipat - ing oui school year with a great deal of pleasure. Even though our funds tre limited, we want to appear correctly dressed at all times Last yejar these dresses were our best dresses. This fall we cleaned and pressed them and we're going to have them as a basis for our school wardrobe. Through a change of accessories we will show you how we plan to wear them for many occasions. The effect of the whole costume is often marred because some one jewSr^ th68e are POOHy chosen - Por stance, cheap, gaudy Accessories should be appropriate for the occasion, becoming to the wearer, and suitable for the costume. Thoughtful attention to these m nor details is indispensable if one is to be well dressed. Quite often it is possible to offset the lack of a new dress by the careful choice or a chf nge in accessories, and we plan to do that very thing These dresses will be worn all winter with dark accessories and next spring we 11 change to white and continue wearing them. We believe that a study of accessories as to the kind we wear and where to wear them will prove both interesting and worthwhile to each and every one of you. They express personality, so great care should be taken in their selection. Pearl is fond of this striped collar be - cause ofi her dark hair and athletic type. Some collars add color and </seg>
            <seg id="p349">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION some a touch of freshness. This collar and cuff set was made from the remains of an old blouse and cost practically nothing. The real -danger in wearing accessories is that a girl often puts on a collection of unrelated articles and many more than she really needs. Accessories should never be worn just because they are in style or because we have them, but should be worn because they add to the becomingness and beauty of the costume. Each costume requires its own accessories. With careful planning one hat, one bag, and one pair of shoes may be used for many costumes. If care is taken of the accessories over a period of time, a variety of them may be on hand. Cost is no prohibiting factor in the choice of most accessories, because so many may be made at home, from ma - terial already on hand. It is not the one who spends the most money on her wardrobe who is the best dressed, but it is the one who plans and buys intelligently at all times. It matters not the size of the wardrobe — each garment has been selected so that there is harmony and beauty in each necessary* combination. t As to hats, when one is selected, its relation to the wardrobe must be considered. No matter how becoming the hat, nor how lovely it may be, if it does not seem a part of the costume with which it is worn, it is a poor- purchase. The problem may not be such a difficult one when one may have several hats each season, but when only one hat may be had for the season, or perhaps two seasons, much thought Is required in selecting it. It is necessary that the hat for general use be one that is durable, not only in material, but in style also. In this case the best material is the most economical. To be durable in style the hat must be con - servative — quiet in color with simple and becoming lines — so that it will harmonize with any costume and be suitable for all occasions. This hat, I believe, will meet these requirements. It is possible for one who can artistically design and successfully make her hats to have one for each costume if she so desires. Attrac - tive sport hats, berets and turbans as well as other styles may be made. This little sport hat was made from the scraps left from the swagger coat. Many feel that to be well dressed, the covering for the head, feet, and hands must be selected with even greater care than the dress. We all know that a picture hat is not appropriate for general wear, or for sport wear. A picture hat is not needed unless afternoon or evening functions are attended and unless the budget will allow such a hat. A brightly colored sport hat is out of keeping for church </seg>
            <seg id="p350">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE wear. The best guide to follow is to study the problem, applying an. appreciation of true beauty to the choice that is tempered with com - mon sense. If hats are to give the service that is expected of them, then thejr must be treated with care. A poorly kept hat speaks quite loudly Frequently brushing, especially when the hat is taken off and put on is necessary. When not in use, the hat should be kept either in a cov - ered bcx or on a hat stand. This stand was made of light cardboard ten inches wide, rolled so that it was wider at the base than at the top. Tlhe top was padded with crushed tissue paper. We girls plan to adapt our dresses for different occasions by th&amp; use of different collar and cuff sets. Such a plan is not a bad one tc - follow in remodeling your fall wardrobe, because collar and cuff sets are so easily made. White, plain colors, prints, plaids and stripes are being worn in silks, satins, organdies, crepes, taffetas, and even cottons High necks are the latest fashion in neckwear. The use of collars plastrons, vestees, capelets and other designs helps put back Into com - mission many of the V-neck dresses on hand from previous seasons Supposing Doris' dress had a low V-neckline, we would place this white collar on it, which covers up the V and with cuffs makes a very attractive and new-looking dress. Does your costume need a contrasting note to give it life and In - terest? If so, why not try a collar such as this? It is made of wash - able silk trimmed with small glass buttons and is just the thing for campus wear. . Or maybe you need a soft feminine touch at your throat. Why not try this white collar? It is made of organdy trimmed with a small organdy plait. It also fastens in the back with a small button. And here we have a brand new idea in the way of collar and cuff sets. It is made of two matching handkerchiefs. First slit one corner of the handkerchief, cutting out a circular piece to fit the neckline of the dress. Finish the raw edges with a small roll hem. With the sec - ond handkerchief, we fold it in four squares, then cut off two opposite corners. Finish the raw edges with a roll hem. Take the piece that was left from the first handkerchief and place it around it, which makes the knot and forms a bow. With, the small corners that we have left we make cuffs. Bind the edges with bias tape. Here we have one finished for Doris' dress made of matching brown and contrasting ye»ow. Snaps have been sewed on, for Doris and I find that snaps make putting on and taking off of collar and cuffs much easier than basting. So we use them entirely. This collar is made of two linen handkerchiefs, and all finished, it cost Doris twenty- </seg>
            <seg id="p351">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION two cents. Isn't that clever? Just the thing to finish that fall dress smartly! And here we have another handkerchief idea. It is called the cat - whisker bow. One handkerchief is tied around the other to form a knot and a smaller bow on top. This cat-whisker bow can be worn with almost any dress. , Handkerchiefs are frequently neglected in considering the ward - robe, but here I have three different styles. For afternoon wear, the white linen initial handkerchief is good. With my blue sport dress I would use this blue and white stripe, although for service and refine - ment, the white linen goes unsurpassed. Never should a dainty lace handkerchief peep from the pocket of a tailored dress or from the pur.se worn with such a costume. Purses, or bags as they are often called, also play an important part in our wardrobe. With sport dresses a leather bag is always good. Accessories have decided that these are days of cooperation — no longer everyone for himself. Gloves perhaps have made the great - est concession. They have grown in popularity since the introduction of the ensemble into fashion consciousness. The French say, "Well gloved and well shod is well dressed." In selecting gloves, one needs to consider the texture, style, and color in relation to the costume and other accessories to be worn with the costume. Gloves are designed for every occasion and a little care in selecting them greatly improves one's appearance. Leather used to be their time-honored material. Yet some gloves were open-minded enough to say, "Show us fabrics that are elastic enough to really fit and we'll glady use them." Fashion found a way. Either she used the knit materials that give, or plain fabrics cut on the bias. They may be had in colors to properly com - plete the ensemble — often selected to blend with shoes, hose, or bag. This pair was made by hand to match the purse. Gloves should be fitted so the hand may retain its flexibility and not only be comfortable, but appear so. A tight glove will make a hand look larger. Dark, dull gloves tend to make the hands look smaller. The most attractive gloves are those that follow the con - tour of the hand. Be sure and obtain your correct size of glove by having your hand measured. Gloves for school should fit more loosely than the dress glove. Turn to the palm of the hand prominent settings of rings before trying on gloves. In trying on gloves the fingers of the glove should be worked on simultaneously with a sliding motion and afterwards the </seg>
            <seg id="p352">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE thumb. Gloves should be tried on slowly the first time as much of their wear and fit depends upon their first fitting. This Is especially true. of leather gloves. Do not press down between fingers and do not pull gloves on or off by the cuff. ■ ... . ■'.'.'■' Smooth gloves before putting them into pocket, hand-bag, dresser drawer, or traveling bag. Wash or dry clean gloves before they are extremely soiled. It is better not to use gloves than to use soiled ones. Hose plays a large part in the general appearance of one's costume. Quality, texture, color, durability, and fit are important factors in the consideration of hosiery. Color is the first point to be considered. Though some color fad is popular, the color of the hose should be selected with the type of figure and type of ankles in mind. Hose lighter than the dress or shoes will make legs and ankles look larger. Hose to match the dress carry the eye down to the heels. The average woman spends too much each year for hosiery. We have found that more intelligent buying and better care will cut down on this expenditure. It is good economy to decide first on one or two shades that go well with your wardrobe and then buy all hose in those shades. A neutral shade is most popular. Secondly, wash hose every time they are worn. A carefully groomed girl always keeps the seams of her hose straight. Walk for health, walk for style, and walk in comfort. You have to watch your step if you want to keep up with the latest footwear fashions. Low comfortable heels are any school girl's delight. Black is the most appropriate color, for it goes with most of the clothes in your wardrobe, unless, of course, your wardrobe carries out the brown color. Shoe trees play an important part in any shoe's life, because they help to keep it in shape. If you feel that you cannot afford shoe trees, here is a good way to economize. Take a newspaper and roll it, place it in the shoe like this. It is as good if not better than shoe trees. Almost all people know these facts, but only the well dressed put them into practice. Now I am going to let you in on a little secret that we girls have dis - covered. Have you ever wondered why and how some people look smartly dressed whether in a beautiful silk or a plain house dress? Here is the reason. You know the old saying, "Stop, look, and listen." It not only applies to railroad crossings, but to everyone of us. First we'll stop, then we'll look. We see a neat, tidy person. If the occasion demands, she will have on comfortable and matching gloves, hat, shoes and hose. If not, she will look just as charming in her little print </seg>
            <seg id="p353">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION with necessary accessories matching or harmonizing with her costume. If we listen very carefully we can hear her humming a tune as a comfortable pair of shoes take her on her way. We have shown you that accessories should harmonize, contrast, or accentuate some color in your costume, and too, that they should be appropriate for the occasion, becoming to the wearer, and suitable for the occasion. THE CHILD IN THE COUNTRY Mrs. Ray Kellenbarger As middle-aged parents, many of us, perhaps most of us, have come to realize that our children are our primary concern. We decide for the most part every question with reference to their happiness and future. It is almost absurd at such a time to think back to the days when we first planned a home of our own. Whether or not the place we were going to live was advantageous for the growth of future gen - erations had little or nothing to do with our choice of a husband or a profession. We farmed, taught, practiced medicine, or what not, be - cause we were Interested in the subject, perhaps, and because we must do something, earn a living, and become independent adults. Kenyon L. Butterfleld says that while the surface query is, "What shall I do?", in reality we all want a chance to develop and grow, to use all the powers of body, mind and soul. And so we choose to the best of our ability and find in our career many unexpected problems demanding attention, many troubles, and also many advantages, undrcamed-of joys and compensations. For a few minutes then we are going to consider the child destined to grow up on the farm, count his many blessings, and see what a country environment contributes to his chance of developing into a happy, useful citizen. For the healthy toddler or the preschool child, few people question but what the farm can give him a fair chance and a good start. Sun baths, cod liver oil, and fresh vegetables are as available for his needs as in town. Though we read with horror of babies drowned in water tanks or hurt by the stock, we read, too, of countless auto accidents in town, which evens that score. Play-pens can be made in either place. In both town and country, it depends upon the parents' interest and initiative. Books and bulletins on youngsters' play equipment point out that these little folks are happiest with simple things — spoons, pie pans, lids, 12 </seg>

It Is when the children are school age that people develop divergent and often strange notions as to the desirability of farm life. Minus vacation schools" and supervised play, some feel the country child must waste three or four precious months in Idleness. Some picture little children as working until exhausted throughout the hot summer and toiling through snowdrifts all winter to glean their meager education. In a very recent pamphlet on play the only reference to country con - ditions was three or four lines which said the memory of glorious sun - rises was overshadowed by the thoughts of back-breaking work. Such hard conditions may have been more or less common in pioneering days, but they do not exist now in our community which is a very typical farm neighborhood. Neither do our girls spend their vacations in stupid idleness. When our oldest girl was just ten she began to drive the stacker team for her father. They had big hay crops that summer and before the last stacks were up she was thoroughly bored with her job, but she was proud that she had worked the season through, and not once did she hint that she 1 would like to give up her job to do something else And a year later when she was allowed to help take the cattle to the ranch, she was the envy of the whole school. She nad a feeling that she was doing a real job. She likes to work with her father, and her usefulness is attested to by the many times he hunts her up with, "Come along, I think you can help." She has cared for the chickens two years now. At first she took them over because she hated to wash dishes and wanted to do her share of the work in some other way. Last spring she was given twenty-five Red Orpingtons to care for with our Barred Rocks. When she sold some eight-pound cockerels the other day her pride over their growth and her pleasure in the check she received were worth while things to experience. The younger girls bring in the cobs and wipe the dishes. There is still some prodding needed to get the dishes done with anything like dispatch, but when they can decide on some other job for which they are willing to be responsible, I am perfectly willing to let them change. It is to be hoped that another year there will be enough outside work so they all can have some outside chores or jobs. From the mother's point of view it helps immensely to have the father know at first hand the children's physical and mental resources and emotional natures. I have found that my husband demands and receives a dependability of service that I do not always command. Two of the neighbors run a combine. A boy and his sister, chil - dren of one of the men, take turns leveling down the grain. They are on hand because they are doing a necessary piece of work. If they </seg>
            <seg id="p355">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION failed to show up, someone else would get the job and the money. Responsibility for an essential part of the day's work develops a child more than any number of synthetic jobs we might invent to keep him busy. Failure to care for livestock or to be ready if he is expected to take out a team wastes time for so many other folks that it doesn't often happen a second time. , t4t - But it isn't all work, and play is a lot more fun if some work is done first. In my husband's day he and his brother laid out whole farms, with string fences, wood blocks for buildings, fields and everything. They went back to these farms day after day, changing, improving and trading stock, and carrying on a play farm business. Last sum - mer there was dirt hauled into our front yard and for some two weeks we had a most amazing irrigation system around which we had to walk every time we went to the front gate. Dirt from a certain spot was found just right to make mud dishes which baked in the sun without cracking and, painted with kalsomine, were very lovely to the youthful eye. Of course it makes a very unorderly yard, but I comfort myself by remembering that this is the constructive, continued, imaginative kind of play books on child training advocate. Several years ago Ernest Elmo Calkins had an article in the Atlantic on "The Lost Art of Play". He told about a Christmas at his brother's home. The cousins had looked over a fine array of lovely gifts, taking them one by one from a large pasteboard box, and then they spent the rest of the afternoon playing with the box. One summer our children and two small neighbor boys played horse endlessly. They took an old buggy and ten cents worth of clothes line daddy had given them as an inducement to leave his ropas alone. They pulled and pushed that heavy buggy up and down and all over the place until we marvelled at their endurance, and wondered if any electric train ever went on so many adventures or had such eager excited engineers. For children do seem to enjoy most the games they invent for themselves and the farm offers much equipment for that kind of fun. In summer we picnic under the trees in the yard and take trips to the canyons for chokecherries and wild grapes. In winter we go coast - ing on the hills in the pasture. In the zest and eagerness with which the children enter into any such adventure, I can find no trace of the downtrodden country child, about which we sometimes read. As they work, as they play, the children see at work natural forces — sun and rain, seed time and harvest. The beloved gangly colts grow up and become old in the service, the destructive and adorable puppy grows fat and lazy. Unconsciously they absorb an understanding of a big industry. By the time they are half-grown they will have served </seg>
            <seg id="p356">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE a real apprenticeship. Even if they never choose farming as their occupation, the experience is worth while; they will be more intelligent men and women because of it. No lawyer or city business man could hope to give his children the specialized training which a country child receives as his heritage. And do we go to the one-room rural school? Yes, indeed. It is a mile and three-quarters from home. Years ago this was often a cold, wet, weary way. Now, with cars, better roads, ponies, and even at times the team and lumber wagon, the present generation does not have these difficulties, and as the old timers say, they have it "pretty soft". There isn't a parent in the valley today who would think of letting the children reach school half-frozen. And this is true, too — the pupils like school today better than their parents did. There are eight grades in our school and twenty-eight to thirty pupils. Dr. Charles Bessey was the first educator I heard asserting that the one-room school was a good place in which to lay the foundation of an education. He said that hearing things over and over again, year after year, in the classes preceding and following, planted the funda - mentals firmly in mind. As far as scholarship goes, and mind you, I am not saying that grades are the best test of an education, our dis - trict has made good. Last year two country girls took the normal training and scholarship awards, one being from our neighborhood. One local boy, now a senior in high school, is consistently an "A" pupil, is captain of the basketball team, sings bass in the quartet, and places high in dramatics, while a number of others are competing for honors in studies and school activities. Of course, a single teacher school cannot have as many outside activities as a city system, but a good teacher accomplishes success - fully one or two undertakings during the year. About eight years ago one girl organized our P. T. A. It took determination and cour - age, for the patrons who weren't hostile were dubious. But she persisted in her efforts, and with varying fortunes, the organization still exists. From her day, too, date the boxes of books sent out to us by the State Library Commission. She was a local girl, by the way, and Custer county's first "better rural school teacher". One year, helped by one of the school patrons, the school put on the Peter Rabbit operetta. None of the educational authorities had ever heard of a rural school doing such a thing, but it was pretty and tune - ful, and the youngsters did enjoy it. Last year the teacher brought a scroll saw to school and the children cut out and painted circus animals. Some of the patrons became interested, and in February, the com - munity staged a miniature circus that surprised even its sponsors by its colorful attractiveness. There were circus wagons with horses in a harness, ballet girls, clowns, a ferris wheel, a tent, and animals of </seg>
            <seg id="p357">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION every kind and description. Magazine pictures were turned into circus posters and used as a background. Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt, writing for one of the recent Sunday - papers, touched on a weakness we country patrons can remedy if we will. She said that of late years it had become increasingly popular to hire local teachers. Board members knew them and their financial conditions, and it was hard to refuse. If the teacher brought to the work sufficient training and a vision of the world beyond her own small community, well and good. If she were not qualified, we had merely given a neighbor a job and provided no teacher for our children. If it is necessary to hire a teacher from some other community, do it. To quote her closing words, "Have in mind that what you need is someone who can help your children to live broader and happier lives than even you have lived. Choose with care and then back up with sympathy, understanding and loyalty those whom you select." With a daughter excited over eighth grade examinations, high school education looms as one of our hardest immediate problems. Living only eight miles from town, I can't tell you now what sort of a solution we will work out. But this I do know. Even in these hard times every child in our district who wants to attend school is having the chance. Some drive back and forth, some board themselves, some drive in good weather and board in winter when roads are uncertain and high school activities are at the peak. I grew up in a college town, so the whole thing seems very strange and difficult, but as I watch the neighbor children year after year, I have to admit they seem to be solving the problem with credit. The large number of pupils in a school like Lincoln is in itself a problem, so I suppose we all have our troubles, and town or country, we have to find a solution for them. Let us suppose, then, that it is possible for a country child to grow up healthy and happy In rural pleasures, able to read, write, and cipher and capable of doing a fair amount of responsible work. Won't he be a "hayseed" or a social misfit after all, self-conscious and awkward away from his accustomed haunts? I think that is what troubles many people. They believe that virtue and industry may be found in the country,, but that social graces, adaptability and personality plus are very rare or non-existent. They do not feel that rural children stand much chance of developing as did the Little Girl Next Door, about whom Mildred Bowers wrote. If she had a broom straw t Stuck in her hat, We'd think it was a feather She's like that. Children vary so in their characteristics that it is hard to make f ' </seg>
            <seg id="p358">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE generalizations. Given the same home, school and community, no two - are alike. They have different interests and aptitudes and any home should foster and encourage these individual tendencies. Away from the lure of the movies and the demanding voice of the gang, this should be possible. Reading aloud is a favoriate activity, and the whole family enjoys such books as Hitty, Perrine, Adventures of Remi, Young' Fu, The Jungle Book, Stevenson and Milne. For a family magazine, nothing has ever taken the place of the Youth's Companion, found in both my husband's family and my own; the younger children like Child Life and Junior Home. For awhile games may claim the family attention and overyone ■will play Rook, Authors, or Parchesi. How the youngsters love to beat their dad! I have noticed that young folks who learn to play in the family circle rather than with a group of children are more likely to play according to the rules and are impatient with any kind of cheating. We have a four-year old jigsaw that has furnished no end of pleasure. Several families used it in getting ready for the circus dis - play. .One Christmas we made jigsaw puzzles. A neighboring family has accomplished much with their family orchestra; several have a real talent for drawing and we all enjoy their clever stunts and chalk talks. Many side interests are transient affairs. The cross word puzzle craze may flourish for awhile and be gone. But as children learn to take part and be interested in various activities, they develop an ability to appreciate and participate in other projects as their horizon widens. One of the most important values of 4-H club work lies not in the stitches we take or the calf we raise, but in the sustained common in - terest and the group work. No one person expects to know everything — we all have our limita - tions. But if our youngsters do not know that Clark Gable is the great screen lover, I expect them to learn when the time comes. The little city lad who becomes so excited over his discovery of how the men got milk from cows that he had to be taken from the barn also had things, to learn. More than a little, I have regretted the lack of chorus singing and rhythm bands in our school, but no one teacher can do everything. Maybe some day soon we will have a teacher whose talents lie in that direction. For no radio takes the place of music we make for ourselves or hear someone sing for us face to face. The music I care for most was that sung around the piano at home on a Sunday evening, or beside the picnic bonfire. I hope someone will mean to our girls what Mrs. Raymond and her music meant to me. </seg>
            <seg id="p359">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Even as I mourn the things we lack, I remember that last spring groups of Lincoln people were organizing groups to study birds, faring forth into the country, taking time and trouble to learn about our song birds. With a guilty start, I realize that there is a bird manual in the bookcase and many song birds in our yard every summer I can call by name. Children are so eager to look them up if someone will only start the ball rolling. At such times I think of our first summer in the country. The house, built forty years ago, is surrounded by trees and some lawn, but was without any foundation planting. Mother came to see us that spring and one day I saw her poking under the porch with a rake. When I went over, she was hauling out long, pale, sad-looking branches of some kind of vine. We tied them up and they came to the porch roof, a woodbine that had lain hidden and neglected for all of eight years, maybe more, but still alive. It was lovely even that first summer, and has furnished a shady place for play ever since. It was plainly a case of eyes that saw not. The comparative isolation of the farm home is a challenge to the parents. There is a quotation that I can't remember exactly, but which says in substance, "I cannot hear what you say, what you are thunders so loudly." It is that way in any home, of course, but more especially in a farm home. So if we want our children interested and informed on world affairs we must read and cultivate an active interest in them ourselves. If we want them to be fair-minded, we must try to down our own prejudice. If they are to feel that money is only a means to an end, the importance and lack of money cannot furnish the bulk of our conversational material. And above all, if we want them happy, secure in the understanding and interest only a home can give, we must be happy, interested in each other and in them. Every family depends upon its friends to bring new ideas and new life into the family circle. In the country folks visit, they do not make calls. Country children love to play hosts and show guests about. I cannot help noticing how difficult it is to cultivate this attitude in a village neighborhood where children play first in one yard, then in another, and feel at liberty to run in and out of the nearby homes and expect others to do the same at their house. In spite of all changes, a man's home is still his castle and it is good to find children who have a personal joy in making it a pleasant place for guests. No city couple will agree with me, I know, but I do think it matters more whom you marry if you are to live in the country rather than in town. When there is a very little money to spend, it matters trem - endously that the family agree on what are essentials, especially as they relate to the children and their training. I do not mean that democrats should marry only democrats, or Methodists only Meth - odists, but that both should want good government and a working </seg>
            <seg id="p360">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE church and feel the necessity of taking some time and effort to secure them. Where car expense is the item it is in the country, it is much easier if the family likes to go together and agrees on the direction. If a parent longs to send a son to college and the other feels he may only waste his education by farming after all, the difficulty of his going is immeasurably increased. One of the things that irritates me most is to have people suggest that education, at least all but vocational education, is wasted if one lives in the rural districts. But we are a long way from the Medieval ages when every son followed in his father's footsteps. If our chil - dren want to earn a living away from the farm or marry and have a home in town, we want them to have a home and school training that will fit them to be happy there. But if they elect to live in the country I hope they Will see some of the opportunities for a full life that abound, and be ready to help in some way. We need rural doctors, good ones, progressive business men, fine ministers. We need rural leaders and people who can write of rural life with real knowledge and convincing style. We need music in the country, courage and initiative. Our children, brought up in country homes, can grow into happy, useful young folks. Then if the future decrees that they are to live on a farm, they will have as much of a chance to live fully as they are capable of doing. They can say with Edna St. Vincent Millay: "My candle burns at both ends It will not last the night. But ah, my foes, and oh, my friends, It gives a lovely light." COLORED SLIDES OP WESTERN NEBRASKA Dwight Kirsch The program this morning is to consist mostly of pictures. I will talk about the pictures as I show the lantern slides. For the most part, however, the pictures will speak for themselves. On this program of Western Nebraska, I hope to bring out an ap - preciation of Nebraska and its resources. As one of the main resources of Nebraska I want to speak of the natural beauty of the state. I think that when we live among certain things, we often become depressed and things seem drab and we forget whether they are beautiful or not. We think so much of our condition that we do not consider whether our, surroundings are really beautiful or not, so I am hoping these pictures this morning will show you Nebraska perhaps through new eyes. The scenes I will picture for you are not unfamiliar to all of you, I am sure. Perhaps they will be new to some of you. About one-half </seg>

Before long you will discover that the term Western Nebraska, as I use it, will be used in the same sense that a New Yorker uses it — anything outside of the city limits. The farthest east scenes of which I shall show pictures, are in eastern Holt county. Then we will go west from there and I will show some pictures of Ouster county, and scenes west and north from there, some of the Nebraska State Parks, trees, streams, Bad Lands, and sandhills. These are natural colored photographs. 1. Custer county. Water tanks, water tanks, wagon, sod house; house over forty years old and still occupied. 2. State Park, Victoria Springs, near Anselmo, Nebraska — one of Nebraska's beauty spots. 3. Another view of Victoria Springs Park. Notice very large cot - tonwood trees. There is fishing, boating and swimming. There are also cabins in which you can camp and stay for quite awhile. 4. Bessey National Forest, Halsey. Hilltop covered with pines. Notice the yucca. 5. Scene near North Platte, Old Oregon Trail, Ash Hollow. Across and up the river we come to Lewellen. Rugged chalk cliffs and scraggly pines. 6. Sidney, Nebraska. Sidney was the starting place of the old Black Hills Trail. When the first prospectors were going to the Black Hills they were fitted out at Sidney. Here is Lodge Pole Creek. 7. Another scene of Sidney. This shows the old and the new. This is typical of the changes being made in Western Nebraska towns. Here we have the oldest house in the town. Over there is, the modern cream station and filling station and farther down is the beautiful new U. S. postoffice just completed before the picture was taken. 8. Fort Sidney. This shows the position of the house which was the munitions store house of old Fort Sidney. 9. North Platte valley. Here is the national monument which is known as Chimney Rock. 10. North Platte valley. This shows the irrigated land. This can truly be called a land flowing with milk and honey. 11.

This is a view of the irrigation ditch. I was interested in visiting this section of the country to find that the weeds were un - dipped. In fact along the bank of the irrigation ditch the weeds are allowed to grow to keep the soil from eroding. 15. Across the hills from Scottsbluff there is a road to Kimball, Nebraska. It goes through the Wild Cat hills, which is almost as wild and woolly looking as the name implies. Here we have bluffs of chalk and limestone. 16. This picture shows pine trees in this region. Notice the chalky cliffs. 17. Looking westward from the region, we come the nearest to what can be called mountains in Nebraska. The elevation where this picture was taken is about a mile above sea level. 18. Holt county. Road lined with cottonwood trees. 19. Cloud pictures. 20. Clear streams, Eagle creek. 21. Stream in winter time. Elkhorn river at Thanksgiving time. 22. Elkhorn river, showing icy water. Picture shows late after - noon sun reflected in the water and ice. 23. Scene at Atkinson, Nebraska. This shows the influence of the garden club of that city. They have sandy soil and in the sandhill country with plenty of moisture. 24. Pond of lilies at Atkinson, Nebraska. 25. Same garden later in the season, showing cannas and four o'clocks. This garden was made over from a spare lot which had fruit trees in it. 26.

', BOOKS ARE WINDOWS Mrs. Roy Green In trying to plan a book exhibit for this group I went over my scrapbook and bits of quotations about poetry and I was struck with the fact that two quotations I found contained the same keynote words. There was no connection between them, but they satisfied my purpose, so I invented a context for them. The first was from a sermon of Henry "Ward Beecher's: "Books are windows through which the soul looks out." A home without books is like a room without windows. We wouldn't think about building homes without windows. Years ago I used to spend some of my time in a room in' which the only window looked out upon a stone wall. That is the nearest that I ever came to living in a room without win - dows and it as as near as I would care to come. In my own home the windows one one side of the house look out upon a frame wall. You people who live in the country have windows that really show you things. But I wonder if you have the other kind of windows in your home. The other quotations has the idea of imagination. "I will hew great windows, wonderful windows, measureless windows for my soul." Maybe we can say that about the books we have for our souls. The book exhibit is to help you choose the kind of windows for your soul. There is a vast number of books and you must have help in picking and choosing or else you do not have the right window for your soul. It seems that we have to take books to men. From your windows you look on all sorts of vistas. A book window can show you a glimpse of people doing something or can put forth ideas to help you solve your problems. </seg>
            <seg id="p367">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION There are a number of pamphlets put out which discuss some cer - tain subject, such as this one called "Hobbies". Then the John Day Publishing Company are putting forth a group of pamphlets which help us to solve some specific problem. They discuss everything from, family relations to parties and there is one called "Growing Up" which, teaches the facts of life to children. A book I would particularly like to mention is Glenn Frank's "America's Hour of Decision". It was published about the same time that Herbert Hoover's and Henry Wallace's books on this subject came out, but takes a sort of middle viewpoint. He is one of the outstand - ing men in America today, and writes on political and social problems in a very scientific way. Book windows can look much further than glass windows and can look into ages gone by. We can learn the history of different peoples and their customs. One such book is "Daughter of the Samari". This window can look clear to far Japan and gives us some idea of the Japanese and what they do and you gain a finer appreciation of joy. Then we have the lighter novels. These are not the kind that stir us up, nor do they solve any particular problem. But they rest us and we need them every once in a while. And never has there been a time when there were such beautiful books for children, books which are informative without making it seem boresome. For instance, this one, "Grammar Can Be Fun" has been very cleverly written. But possibly the window we enjoy looking out of most is across pretty country to our neighbor's home, someone whom we like and who likes us and has the same problems we have and who understands them. I am" sure all of you would enjoy reading "The Barter Lady" by Evelyn Harris. She is a Maryland woman, who, at the time of her husband's death, was left with five children and three mortgaged farms. She has struggled along courageously since then. Her book is human and full of humor and appreciation. She tells how much she enjoys life and why she is glad she has her children on the farm. So it is just a glimpse from a window which might look from Mrs. Kellen - barger's to Mrs. Harris' farm. We sometimes are bothered about the cost of windows. We are very sure that we have glass in our windows which is clear and not wavy. Sometimes we are not so careful about the type of books we take up. There are many excellent reprints of books of mostly the old standard classics. About the only cheaper ones you can give older children are the classics. However, there are quite a group of authors </seg>
            <seg id="p368">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE who are beginning to write for children of this age. These include Kelly, Daniels, Field and Cornelia Meggs. A book that is really a fine edition is "Children's Literature." The book is worth having. Several masterpieces in the list of finer old books have recently come into the movies. Henry Ward Beecher said that a little library growing larger is an honorable part of one's possessions. Let us seek that finer and loftier vision and let us get away from narrow views. We must have windows through which our souls can look out, so let us "hew great windows, wonderful windows, measure - less windows for our souls." THK WOOL KXIIIBIT Mr. Marshall Ross I do not know how many of you have looked at the little exhibit we have at the back of the room, which gives the wool in practically all of its stages from the time it is taken from the sheep's back until the time it is made up into blankets, bats, or fabrics for women's wear. Some of these fabrics weigh only five to six ounces to the yard and are much lighter than you think is possible for woolens. There are seven lines of wool. You can notice the difference in the length of staple. These different kinds of wool are all used for a different purpose. The Merino sheep was bred in Greece during the seventh and eighth centuries and from there was taken over into Spain. In the seven - teenth century, the French went down into Spain, brought the Merino back with them, and crossed it with the carpet wool sheep. ; Two kinds of wool are used chiefly in making clothing, especially the lighter weight materials. These are the clothing woolens and the worsteds. When you get a short staple fiber of a length that ■would naturally grow on normal, healthy sheep, that is the staple used in worsteds. About two hundred to three hundred years ago there were some weavers living in the part of England which is now called Worcestershire. They were driven out of that part of England and went up into north England, and started weaving this kind of wool. The difference between woolens and worsteds is that in worsteds a tightly twisted thread is woven across and lengthwise, which is made out of combed wool. In woolens, the wool is not combed and the threads ■are woven so that the ends will stick out and leave a rough exterior. </seg>
            <seg id="p369">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION There Is some very fine cloth made from woolens, however, such as biTliardcloth and broadcloth. Worsteds are used chiefly in men's suits and in ladies' heavy suitings. However, most ladies' suits are made of woolens. In a majority of cases, the worsted is the better cloth. Because of the longer threads, it will give longer wear and does not tear so easily. Three-eighths and low quarter wools are used in knitted garments. From this kind of wool we get coarser fibers of a longer staple. The question is sometimes asked, "Why isn't black wool of as much value as white wool?" Because it will not take the dye. After a short while you would begin to see light splotches where the dye did not hold. Black wool cannot be used for that reason. However, black wool is used some in worsteds and woolens of natural color. Clothing wools are very much in demand. In 1933 we consumed 469,000,000 pounds of wool; in 1934, 224,000,000 pounds. A part of that, 90,000,000 pounds, has been out of mill inventories and has been carried over from 1933. Consumption has been very slack, but it is beginning to pick up at the present time. The last two fibers on the card are common and are bred from cross wool sheep. Sometimes the fiber is twice as long and twice as wide as a Merino fiber. Such fibers are used almost altogether in car - pets and rugs. We are allowed to import it at a very low tariff, be - cause there is nothing in our country to compete with this grade of wool. When used in woolen cloth, it is woven loosely, and used in over - coating, caps, mittens and things of that kind. The third and fourth grades of wool come from black-faced sheep. When wool is graded in the warehouse at Kansas City we get a fleece of quarter blood wool which would come from Hampshire or Shrop - shire sheep. Sometimes we get eleven different kinds of wool from one sheep. There Is a sorter which sorts the white away from the black. The short wool is left with the black, and also the stained wool. This is called "skirting the fleece". There is a lot of half blood wool in three-eights and low quarter wool. The finer wool wouldn't make a good garment if mixed with the coarser grades of wool, so it is sorted before it can be made into cloth. "Raw wool" is wool just as it came off the sheep. After wool has been graded, it goes through a long vat one hun - dred fifty to two hundred feet in length. The tank is filled with water and the wool is washed with soda. Hot water is not used, but it must be warm enough to melt the grease and to separate the grease from the fiber. We must be careful not to take too much grease out </seg>
            <seg id="p370">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE of the fiber, for that gives strength to the cloth. If too much soda is put in, the cloth will not wear as well. This is called the "scouring process". The wool Is carried through with paddles, and when it gets to the other end, it is carried up in racks and goes to the drier. "When it is dry, it is combed into tops. All wool is combed straight horizontally. It is combed into a long rope or roving, which can be run right into the weaving machine. In the case of woolens, they do not comb the wool, but subject it to another process. It is not combed out straight as in woolen tops. A great deal of the wool goes to the top mills and there combed into woolen tops. Other mills use their own machines to comb the tops and adjust them the way they want. You probably have noticed the different weight blankets and finer fabrics on the front part of the tables, which were made of finer wools. Delano cloth is made from Delano or Merino sheep, from which comes a long, fine fiber. There is a great deal of difference in texture. One pound of wool will spin a thread eleven to thirteen miles long. In technical terms, this expressed as 76's-68's, 66's-58's, 5O's-48's, 44's-42's 36's. There is that much difference in these wools. One reason why wool goods are warmer than cotton goods is that each hair is hollow. It is built up by scales and the inside of it is hollow, while cotton is solid. That gives the woolen goods air chambers, which make them much warmer. The principle is the same as that used in insulating houses. The sliver is woven the same way as wool is woven into bats. There are four or five pound bats and two pound bats. Two lighter weight blankets made from two pound bats are warmer than one blanket made from a four pound bat, because of the air chamber between. Dead wool is wool taken from sheep that have a fever or sheep that have been dead for a long time before they are sent to market. Dead wool does not have the strength of "live wool". It is usually used with black wool. Dead wool has to be sorted out from the live wool. Maybe there will be a spot on the back of sheep that is dead wool, in which all the life has gone out. It is the life which makes tensile strength. Women in the audience then asked Mr. Ross some questions. Should one use soap to wash wool? The lye in soap makes wool hard and stiff, so use soda to break the hardness of the water. </seg>
            <seg id="p371">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Does the United States produce as much wool as It consumes? We produced 350,000,000 pounds of wool last year. Normally we were producing 300,000,000 pounds and were importing about 300, - 000,000 pounds. Since 1929 we have imported very little wool. Aus - tralian wool is combined with other wools to make certain kinds of cloth. The advance in tariff, the textile strike which kept the mills out of business, and under-consumption for 1934 are reasons for the low price in wool. At present, the situation looks brighter. I expect to see the surplus all sold this year. Is it safe to send wool neckties and fabrics to the cleaners? Woolen neckties and fabrics can best be cleaned by dry cleaning. There is nothing used which will deteriorate the fabric whatever. OTHER EXHIBITS In the back part of the room and in the hall were a number of other exhibits. These were explained by the following people: Clothing, Miss Allegra Wilkens; Girl's Room, Mrs. Mary B. Nelson; 4-H Club Canning, Miss Jessie Greene; and the Ball Canning Contest for project women, Miss Muriel Smith. Miss Wilkens: There is also another activity represented here in the back of the room. The northeast corner is given over to 4-H Club exhibits. On the folding screens there are three exhibits — a cotton school dress, made by Marjorie Hudson of Lancaster county, a little boy's suit and a little girl's dress, made by Adelia Machacek of Saunders county, and an out - fit consisting of a wool dress, blouse, hat, underwear, hose and shoes, made by Ruby Kayser of Lancaster county. These garments have been scored and were Nebraska's best at the County and State Fairs, and were the ones which went to Chicago and competed with other states. There is always heavy competition at Chicago. The children's garments placed fifth with twenty-eight exhibits, and the outfit placed sixth with the same number of exhibits. The cotton school dress did not place, but after you have looked it over, I am sure you will agree with me thaj. it must have had very heavy competition. 4-H Clubs have many other activities and we are hoping you will ask questions after you have looked at these exhibits.. Mrs. Mary B. Nelson: There are two exhibits from the Girl's Room project — a pair of curtains made by Dorothy Kempcke of Douglas county and a writing unit, exhibited by Ruth Ann Sheldon of Cass county. These exhibits were selected from the State Fair. </seg>
            <seg id="p372">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE A common remark Is that it costs too much for a project of this kind. However, in going over leaders' summaries, I find that eleven girls made use of things they had at home and didn't spend a cent. The largest amount spent by any girl was $20.60, and the next largest amount was $11.00. Practically all the rest were under $5.00. Miss Greene: In the hall you will find the canning exhibit. It is a splendid exhibit and we are proud of it. Each girl exhibited from five to six jars of products. Dorothy Foster of Fillmore county exhibited food which could be used for an emergency dinner; Elsie Bernasek of Fill - more county, meat; Genevieve Johnson of Lancaster county, vegetables; and Birdean Jensen of Fillmore county, fruit. Also in the cases are the jars which were entered in the Ball Con - test for 4-H Club girls. The placings are as follows: Ruth Ann Sheldon 1st Cass Genevieve Johnson 2nd Lancaster Cletas Talbot " '. 3rd Butler Ruth Sutter 4th Fillmore Elsie White 5th Dawson Lesia Hasaka 6th Scotts Bluff Fern Hazard 7th Douglas Dorothy Savage 8th Wheeler Mildred Vogt 9 th Washington Corrine Schaecher 10th Platte Alice Schmitz 11th Otoe Cora Mae Briggs 12th Seward Evelyn Garvis 13 th Burt Irene Benson 14th Johnson . Rosetta Siemers 15th Cheyenne Miss Smith: In another case in the hall you will see the jars which were brought for the Ball Canning Contest for project women. Although there were only seven entries, we are very proud of them and feel that the exhibit Is a fine one. The placings are as follows: Mrs. H. H. Roberts 1st Fillmore Mrs. Hall Pollard 2nd Cass Mrs. William Schmitz 3rd Otoe Mrs. C. A. Roth 4th Dawson Mrs. Adolph Vavricek 5th Colfax Mrs. F. J. Reimers 6th Douglas Mrs. Lloyd Maxwell 7th Burt </seg>
            <seg id="p373">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION ■ ■ ■ I Two other exhibits were held aside from the ones explained in the above talks. The clothing exhibit was arranged in the Student Activi - ties building. It consisted of suggestions for made-over clothing. A boy's suit was made from an old coat. A child's dress from an adult's dress and various other articles were shown which had been made over from old garments. The exhibits showed in miniature how the smaller garment was cut from the larger; beside this was the actual garment, full size, made up with attractive trimmings and finishes. This exhibit came from the Bureau of Home Economics, U. S. Department of Agri - culture, Washington, D. C. The other exhibit was of antiques which were brought in by the ■women. These things were displayed in Room 213 of the Home Econ - omics Building. Many different articles were on display — coverlets, dishes, glass and china, pewter, and silver. There were also several pieces of furniture and a few pictures. See illustrations of this exhibit on page 74. USE OF LEISURE TIME Round Table, by Miss Mary-Ellen Brown Mary-Ellen Brown first introduced Miss Orinne Johnson who is one of the staff of workers on the Farmer's Wife magazine. To start the discussion on the wise use of leisure or hobbies, Miss Brown presented each with a sheet on which were six statements; some of these were true, others doubtful and others false. The list was as follows: - 1. Hobbies are a waste of time. 2. Rural women are too busy to have hobbies. 3. Hobbies should be related to one's work. 4. The cost of hobbies makes them prohibitive. 5. Hobbies are an individual interest rather than one the family can enjoy as a group. 6. A book exchange club may be made popular in any community- After the six statements had been read, checked and counted, then Miss Brown asked the group which statement they would like to discuss first and No. 6 was suggested. The vote on this had stood thirty-seven for true, ten doubtful, and five false. In the discussion which followed one woman said, "There are com - munities in the southwestern part of Nebraska where a book exchange </seg>
            <seg id="p374">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE club would be very difficult. Communities more thickly settled the character of the community and the make-up of the community must all be taken into consideration. It might not work in some com - munities." In this state the Master Farm Home Makers Association formed a book club. Each member bought a book at the first of the year and it will return to the owner by the end of the year. The plan has been very successful. Books rotate once a month. It is a rule that the books must be sent on by the fifteenth of the month, and each member sends the book to the same person each time. Some women said that pay books may also be secured at the libraries. Some schools that have no libraries, may secure books from the libraries by paying $5 a month. They can secure eighty books per month. Any group of women in the state may get books from the Nebraska Public Library by being responsible for them and paying the transporta - tion charges on the books. In one school in the state the teacher makes out a list of books she wishes for the school, comes into the Nebraska Public Library after the books and takes them back with her. She is allowed to keep them three months. A book which is recommended for people to read concerning hobbies is "Book of Hobbies" by Tausigg and Meyer. A good pamphlet is "The Care and Feeding of a Hobby Horse" by Ernest Calkins. Is reading a good hobby? A hobby is taken up because you want to do certain activities. If you like to read, then reading is a good hobby. The next topic to be discussed was No. 3, Hobbies should be related to one's work. The first woman to discuss it said, it was no rest to do the same thing you are doing all the time. We grow more by taking up something new. Some one else said it depends a great deal on what your work is. The question was asked if quilts were a good hobby? They are if it is restful work to you. If you have to drive yourself to do a thing, it is not a good hobby. Is it a good thing to change hobbies often? It depends upon your mental attitude. You will want some hobbies for just a little while and others you will want to continue through the years. Much depends upon the individual. Some hobbies grow more interesting as they are developed through the years. </seg>
            <seg id="p375">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION The women next asked to discuss No. 2, Rural women are too busy to have hobbies. No one is too busy to do what she wants to do. Anything restful proves a good hobby. One woman used her club work during the sum - mer as a hobby. . We find that usually busy women have a hobby. No one is too busy to have a hobby. All of us waste time. Take your wasted time and turn it to a hobby. A good hobby helps to keep one interesting. The next question to be discussed was No. 4, The cost of hobbies makes them prohibitive. The women decided that it did not, because if we use ingenuity we can make something out of almost nothing. In response to the question, What are your hobbies, there were many varied answers. For one women the greatest hobby was cooking. She enjoyed cooking for large groups and was sorry she did not have more of a family for whom to cook. Refinishing old furniture proved to be a hobby for another woman. Other hobbies suggested were old vases and quilts, as well as antiques. One woman writes letters to her three children. Each letter is a chapter of a book. Each woman attending this round table was given a copy of Vaca - tion Camp Circular 15, a copy of which follows. Favorite Pastimes, Avocations or Hobbies The members of the Mothers' Vacation Camp at Curtis agreed that every farm woman can have some leisure time — if she wants it. There - fore, it is recommended that every woman indulge in some kind of a hobby which brings physical, mental, social or spiritual satisfaction. An activity remains a hobby only as long as these satisfactions are a result of it. One's personal experiences determine the type and the duration of the hobby. National affairs and community conditions may affect the choices made. No one hobby appeals to every woman, for what is a hobby to one individual may be work to another. It is suggested that avocations developed in youth may become happy pastimes for later years. A hobby brings rest, relaxation, enjoyment, and contentment. It helps the homemaker to develop self-confidence and poise, and results in making her more appreciated by her family. The dictionary says an avocation is that which calls a person away from one's regular employment or vocation; a subordinate occupation. The campers suggested the following as possible hobbies or favorite pastimes for women. No doubt there are many others which may be </seg>
            <seg id="p376">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE added but there was only a short time for the women to devote to this topic. The following day the campers made memory or hobby books in their handcraft period. At the close of this circular you will find the directions for making memory books. There can be such a great variety in hobby books that it would be interesting if another summer each camper would bring her hobby book with her so it could be enjoyed by all.

            <seg id="p378">REPORT OF NEBRASKA. STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE GUIDING THE ADOLESCENT BOY AND GIRT., Round table, by Dr. Ruth Staples There are many people in each generation who spend much time and energy worrying over the young people of the times. Since this hap - pens again and again with each generation, we may wonder as to the cause. Doubtless it lies in the fact that thoughtful parents and others interested in the welfare of these young folks are anxious that they turn out to be just a little better and happier than they themselves have been. With experience, we learn that the world is made up of many kinds of people, some of whom are much more satisfactory citizens and mem - bers of families than others. Also there is more evidence piling up every day which indicates that early training or guidance is one of the determining factors in the character and personality of the adult. While adolescence is not the only important period for parents to con - sider, it is the one about which we have the greatest concern, probably because it is the end of childhood and we know that it is our "last chance". Adolescence is the period between childhood and adulthood, roughly speaking, the 'teen age". The boy or girl is no longer physically a child and yet lacks the experience and judgment of maturity. It is just this "in between-ness" of the period that causes much of the difficulty and many of the problems faced by the parents of the young girl or youth; One minute they reprove them for acting like babies and in the next they emphasize their inability to do this or that be - cause "you aren't old enough" or "mother knows best". The boy or girl has to learn new habits as he reaches maturity and also has to drop many of the habits they have built up while the children were small and treat their adolescent sons and daughters as they should be treated; that is, to regard them as young people rapidly approaching the time when they will be mature and independent in thought and action. The psychologists who have made an intensive study of adolescents have found that the problems of this period center around a few major cravings of the maturing boy or girl, namely, the desire to be free from the parent's supervision, to be independent financially, and interest in the other sex. The desire to be free from the rules or supervision of their elders and to be independent in thought and action is perfectly healthy and normal in adolescence. To be sure, the symptoms of this urge are often most annoying and at times quite undesirable or even impossible. These symptoms vary all the way from wanting to have a key, or a car, or to stay out late to being inconsiderate of others and Ill-mannered around the house. </seg>
            <seg id="p379">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION However, if the child is handled sensibly, we may not fear for his future. He may not be perfect, but he will be able to accomplish his aim which is a fundamental need for society, that is, to think and act independently, unhampered by fears, doubts, and indecisions and not easily influenced. On the other hand, if the youth is thwarted in his struggle to "grow up" he may fall into one or two pitfalls, either he will struggle more violently and his behavior or "symptoms" take on a serious aspect or he may give up altogether and remain unmature and dependent for direction by others all of his life. The problem of the parent is to recognize the symptoms as merely symptoms of a healthy urge, and to guide the boy or girl so that he will express his desire for independence and in ways that are socially desirable. It is guidance and re-direction that the youth needs, rather than "scenes" and thwarting. Allow as much freedom as is possible, saving restrictions for things that really count. Associate with your children in play as well as in everyday living. The boy who has the companionship and comrade - ship of his father picks up informally many splendid lessons. Through - out childhood we need to continue our sympathetic, consistent or firm treatment, not firm in the sense of harsh or stern, but firm as con - trasted to yielding to teasing, whining, anger, sulking, or other un - desirable behavior. Parents should remember that the children are getting grown up and that they no longer need the same care and supervision that was necessary in babyhood. The child should be taught self-reliance from early childhood by doing things for himself and by making his own decisions wherever it is possible. The adolescent should be weaned from his parents and should be able to be happy away from home and to be entirely trustworthy. This training should be begun in early childhood, even in babyhood. The parents should guide their children rather than merely discipline them. They should train them to do a thing because it is the right thing to do, rather than because they will be punished if they don't. This means careful explanations, firm and consistent treatment and rare and well thought out punishment. The sex Interest is another major problem of adolescence and is an expression of a major and perfectly normal urge. In primitive society mating was accomplished at this age as the simple economic situation permitted a youth to provide for a family with ease. At the present time marriage is delayed for a number of years past physical maturity and the boy or girl meets the problem of adjusting his normal im - pulses to behavior that is acceptable and socially desirable to society. As in the case of the urge for independence, the sex impulse has various symptoms. The boy or girl is anxious to appear desirable to the other sex. Consequently he is particular about dress, and wishes to do the </seg>
            <seg id="p380">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE sort of things which will favorably impress the other sex. One boy wanted to have a car to take a girl to a dance. Since the family had no car and since the girl lived a very short distance from the dance hall, the father thought it foolish to hire one for the occasion. The boy was much upset and distressed his parents by his unseemly con - duct. He did not wish to be unreasonable, but he did so want to ap - pear as a "fine fellow" in the eyes of his girl. Parents should not necessarily give in to each whim of the boy or girl nor should they tolerate impudence or rudeness. They should, however, keep in mind the reason back of the foolish or otherwise un - desirable behavior and help the youth in every way possible to adjust himself in a way that will be satisfactory to home and society. This can be done in several ways. First, see that the family is a good example of happy relationships. No girl or boy can build up a desirable ideal of marriage who is brought up in a home where bickering and quarrel - ing is rife or where love and affection are absent. Then provide opportunity for wholesome recreation and wide acquaintance with members of the opposite sex. The girl or boy who gets the idea that he or she is unattractive or who sticks entirely to members of the same sex should be helped to make acquaintances. Do not laugh at their first attempts at getting acquainted and avoid forbidding too many things, especially things which are not serious, but merely annoying or apparently foolish. Teach self-control and consideration of others from early child - hood and give such sex education as is suitable for each age. Enlighten - ment on sex matters does not safeguard the boy or girl from every danger, but it is one of the best guarantees yet discovered. Lastly, the adolescent should have plenty of work to do that is interesting and worth while to absorb his energy. We see that guiding the adolescent is not a problem of the adoles - cent years, entirely; personality and character grow and develop all through childhood, just as truly as the body. Each age leaves its mark on the age that follows and it is the problem of the parent to make the most of each age as it comes along, building for the years ahead. DEMONSTRATION OF ATTRACTIVE POODS WHICH COST MTTLE Round table, by Dr. Rebekah Gibbons I have been asked to demonstrate for you attractive foods which &lt;:ost little. I am going to prepare for you the first recipe on the mimeo - graphed sheet which was given you at the door. I chose to prepare this spinach souffle, because a great many women have said, "I can </seg>
            <seg id="p381">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION raise spinach easily. I can cut it and can it all during the summer, so that I am/able to can spinach when I can other foods, but my family do not like jit very well." Our problem with as valuable a food as spinach is some way of preparing it so that it tastes good. We must dilute the flavor. One such recipe is a spinach loaf, because it con - tains a thick white sauce which is used to dilute the spinach. I will now make my white sauce. I use bacon fat because it gives a palatable flavor. Smooth thickening can be obtained with very little difficulty by shaking a small amount of the milk and flour smooth in a small glass jar. The white sauce will be a little dark from the bacon fat, but it is a palatable product. Now I am going to get my spinach ready. This brand of spinach I am using is not an A grade product, but it is merely a medium grade, high quality spinach. The spinach is chopped fairly fine. For this I use a chopping knive and a strainer. Equal quantities of spinach and white sauce are used. In cooking vegetables or in preparing vegetable dishes, our first prerequisite is flavor. If your family doesn't like spinach very well, you may want to diminish the amount of spinach. The spinach is then put in with the white sauce to heat. Always keep a covered vessel of some sort by the sink and place in it the liquid from vegetables. This liquid may then be used when making soups or gravies. A large percentage of food value has cooked out into the cooking water. Use this liquft in other foods instead of keeping the kitchen sink the best fed member of the family. This liquid gives a good flavor to gravies. Two eggs will make a very pleasant, light-flavored souffle. How - ever, it is perfectly satisfactory to use only one egg. Pour egg yolks into the souffle after the whites have been beaten. Egg yolks may also be shaken in the same jar in which the thickening was made. When beating with a dover egg beater, always shake the beater on the hand and not on the bowl. The egg whites and spinach are now folded together. I use a rubber spatula to fold in egg whites. Cut down, fold over, cut down, fold over. A rubber spatula is especially economical to use when scraping out the dish. As in the case of all egg mixtures, the pyrex dish is placed in a pan of water and baked in a very slow oven. I shall now discuss the foods which are the basis of a low cost diet. The one we get the most for our money from is cereals. This group in - cludes all sorts of flour and meal, bread, rolls, crackers, various break- </seg>
            <seg id="p382">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE fast cereals, macaroni, spaghetti, noodles, rice, hominy, and canned corn. When we plan a day"s diet that costs the least it possibly can, we use several foods from this group. There are two kinds of cereals — those with the bran in them, and those from which the bran has. been removed. For us, it means wheat and oats. These grains are raised quite easily and can be bought quite easily. A great number of farm homemakers grind their own wheat. Cereals lack certain food materials. There are three very serious deficiencies. There are those who tell us that nothing would ever be wrong with us if we ate only whole wheat, but this is not true. The deficiencies of cereals are: (1) Calcium. Our very best source of calcium is from milk. Calcium is not found in the butter-fat, but in skim milk. Use skim milk for cooking. Calcium is an excellent bone-building material. (2) Vitamin C. (3) Vitamin A. The next food. Savory Wheat Casserole, is a cereal which has been combined with other foods which supply these deficiencies. The wheat is cooked with four times as much milk, and cooked until it is thick and stiff. Left-over breakfast food may be used very well for this. I can remember when I was very small that my mother cooked break - fast cereal on the back of the stove in an improvised double boiler. In this way, we made use of wasted hea« The cereal was then heated for breakfast the next morning. Cereal is almost as good when cooked in water, but calcium is lacking. The way I add Vitamin C is by using tomatoes. In addition, this recipe also has some carrots to give Vitamin A. I like this recipe cooked in thin layers, so it gets crusty. Many homemakers over the state have used this recipe for "Ne - braska's Home Prepared Breakfast Cereal". It is not difficult to make. The mixture is spread on flat pans and is baked in a very slow oven. It can be allowed to dry partly in the oven and partly in the open air. This makes an inexpensive cereal. Those cereals in which the bran has not been removed contain iron. Other good sources of iron are liver, molasses, navy beans and spinach. Iron is necessary for building normal blood. Many of us are foolish enough to pay almost four times as much for refined cereals as for those not having the bran taken off. If we use these foods, we must also supplement them with foods containing the necessary vitamins. Liver is a very good source of Vitamin A. Other good sources of </seg>
            <seg id="p383">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Vitamin A are listed on the sheet. Liver has to be used in other ways than fried liver. We must dilute it so that it will taste good. We can put something else in to spread the flavor over a little more space. We may make a liver loaf. Another pleasant way is to cook liver until done and then grind it and mix with other ingredients to make a "liver spread". Use 1 c. ground liver, 1 t. salt, 2 T. fat, 2 T. chili sauce or ketchup and 2 T. chopped celery. Sometimes carrots are put in. Use enough liquid to moisten — vegetable stock or milk or meat broth. Meat broth is my third choice because it has almost nothing to contribute from a dietary point of view. Let this mixture stand until of suitable consistency to spread. Some women use cooked-up cereal in a liver loaf. This is satis - factory. There are a number of ways of using liver, each of which has the purpose of diluting the flavor. Many people like to serve this liver loaf cold. It seems to me that many homemakers are spending too much money for Karo. There is no more food value in Karo than in ordinary sugar and it costs 6? a pound. I object to have people spend too much money when it is not necessary. Instead of using so much Karo, I would suggest using a dried apricot and carrot syrup. This is made by combining 1 c. dried apricot pulp cooked and sieved with 1 c. of carrot pulp. Also 2 c. of sugar and enough water to make it sirupy are added. Experiments have been conducted recently by Miss Helen Baeder as to the difference between lard cakes and butter cakes. Results have been shown that there is very little difference and in the near future we hope to make available to the women in the state recipes using lard. Home-made pastry flour can be made by taking 3 T. flour out of every cup and putting in 3 T. cornstarch. This is almost as good as pastry flour. Favorite recipes for using spinach and liver were then suggested by the women. Some were scalloped spinach, Spanish liver, Swedish liver, etc. Samples of spinach souffle, savory wheat casserole, liver loaf, Ne - braska's home prepared breakfast cereal and apricot and carrot syrup were given to the women. Sample lard and butter cakes were passed around for inspection. Following is a copy of the mimeographed sheet: Spinach Souffle 1 c. milk 4 T. flour 1 c. spinach 4 T. fat % t. salt 2 eggs </seg>

In order to meet and visit with more of the homemakers who come from various parts of the state to attend Organized Agriculture meetings, the Ceres Club meeting regularly held in January was planned as an informal tea at the Home Economics parlors, the club inviting as guests all women attending the Home Economics section. An exhibit on antiques was on display during the tea. These anti - ques had been loaned by women attending the meeting and members of the faculty. This exhibit proved very interesting and will probably be repeated again next year. Mrs. Norma Kidd Green brought books from the Lincoln Book Store for women to examine and consider in their selection of good reading. </seg>

            <seg id="p387">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION WEDNESDAY MORNING Miss Carolyn Ruby, Presiding The meeting opened with music by Howard Q. Miller, a student of Mrs. Mary Hall Thomas. He sang the following numbers: "Sylvia" by Oley Speaks "If Winter Comes" by Tement "Thora" by Adams "I Love Life" by Mana Zucca The next speaker on the program was Miss Clara Rausch Mi»s Rausch is an Instructor in Physical Education at the University of Nebraska. RELATION OP POSTURE TO HEALTH Miss Clara Rausch The other day as one of our professors was walking down the street he saw a motorists getting out of his car. Glancing at the car he said to the man, "I see your pneumatic contrivance has ceased to function." The motorist looked up with a rather startled expression and stam - mered, "Eh — what?" The Professor: "The Cylindrical apparatus which supports your vehicle is no longer inflated." The motorist: "But — " The Professor: "The elastic fabric surrounding the circular frame whose successive revolutions bear you onward in space has not re - tained its pristine roundness." By this time the motorist was speechless. Just then a little boy ran up and said, "Hey, mister, you got a flat tire!" I shall try, not in the words of the professor, but rather those of the small boy to give you a few ideas on posture and health. The people of America are said to be health-minded. We are said by some to know more about health than any other nation. One hears talk about health from all sides. It not only comes from educators, hygienists, doctors, advertisers, and radio announcers, but also from innumerable cults who say that all can be gained through diet, by practicing "physical culture", by wearing apparatus to hold the body in position or getting back to nature and so on through the long list. </seg>
            <seg id="p388">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Probably one of the biggest parts of any physical education program is the building of organic power. And so it goes. But -what after all is health? If I were to ask each one of you to define it, I would probably get as many different opinions as there are people in this room. From many authorities come some of the follow - ing answers. A learned professor of anatomy defines it as "a state of physiological balance". Another says that theoretically "healthy" might be applied to an imbecile or a moron. Still another says, "A person may be healthy now, but he may become more healthy," thus making a distinction between existent and optimum health. The dictionary gives such statements as these: "Health is a state of being sound in body, mind, or soul." "Health is a state of being free from physical disease or pain." "Health is a condition of soundness of any living organism." "Health is that state in which all the natural func - tions are performed freely without pain or disease." "Health is the physical condition, state, or degree of bodily soundness as compared with some other state taken as a standard." Such statements suggest that it is important to get a clearer idea of . this problem and so if we think back over our experiences, most of our ideas of health are found to depend on our environmental background, education, state of culture, age, and personal physiology. And as such, the farmer's conception is different from the miner's, the banker's or the doctor's. ■ If one is to reach any workable definition of health he must have some idea of the structure of the body. He must know its com - position, how it works, and by what conditions it is affected. Struc - ture is a process and is modified with the passage of time. It is for this reason that pathology or disease becomes a necessary building block in our idea of health. It is impossible to rely upon an individual's sense or feeling of well being. The drug addict while under the in - fluence of drugs will say that he never felt better. A friend may say that she has never had a sick day, yet a thorough medical examination would show that changes are going on within her body. Time is leav - ing its mark as it does on all of us. When, then, is one healthy? To say that health is a condition of the organism is to say nothing of any value. Dying is a condition of the organism; and to say that health is a sound state of the body or to be healthy is to be normal are phrases which really mean "untested, truth". These definitions imply a knowledge of a reality which can exist in the abstract but the results are only obtained when tested by environment. Health then can enable us to meet any possible environmental demand either instantly or after a period of training. This may be just a dream, but it is useful just the same. Dr. Nash says health is caught, not taught, </seg>
            <seg id="p389">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION and can only be developed through action. If such is the case maybe most of us need to start something at once. Having now somewhat of an idea of health, let us turn to posture for a moment. Again if I were to ask each of you to define the term, I would get practically the same result as I did on the question of health. Again going to the dictionary we find such statements as these: "To place in a particular attitude." "The visible disposition either natural or assumed of the several parts of a material thing and especially of a living thing with reference to each other." "Relative arrangements of different parts of anything, especially of parts of the body." "Posi - tion or bearing of body as a whole whether characteristic or assumed for a special purpose." "State or condition at a given time." "State or frame of mind or attitude." Various postures then may be defined as attitudes of body and of mind. The habitual postures each individual assumes are aspects of his general health and general state of mind and indicate to others the degree of care his body has been given and the general attitude with which he views life. If he is buoyant and happy his usual pos - ture while he is in activity will be erect and extended; if he is depressed and gloomy his body will tend to be slumped and the various segments will be out of balance because parts of his muscle structure are out of balance. Each of us has his own characteristic sitting, standing and walk - ing habits which are the result of some combination of educational, occupational, psychological or mechanical influences and no two of us can be expected to look identically alike in posture any more than in face. As Dr. Rogers says in his article on "Corrective Exercise", "We will all have to travel in the family carriage, or at any rate travel in the carriage nature has furnished us, even if it is not a very artistic vehicle and though it may be worse for many a hard knock in its earlier travels. We should remove dents from the hood, and straighten out bent fenders and make the machine as presentable as possible. After this is done we may still have a model which is not considered the fashion, but will get us there just the same." So I feel it is not only impossible but unscientific to hold up a common standard of posture for all individuals and to accept one sitting or standing posture as ideal and urge all individuals to aim for it. What is ideal for one individual would not be ideal for another. We cannot standardize the human body. Again quoting from Dr. Rogers, "There is enough joy taken out of life in other ways than by being told we have a third or fourth rate carriage when in reality we are only traveling in the family carriage which is a good one, even if it is not a handsome one :and may carry us for eighty or ninety years." But a body with all its segments in balance is the most desirable, not only because of the </seg>
            <seg id="p390">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE greater efficiency that such a position affords, but also because it expresses vitality and joyousness. Truly we are known more by the posture than the company we keep. When an engineer begins a piece of construction he considers not only the material to be used but also the arrangement of this ma - terial to meet the requirements of the structure with the least possible strain. In this arrangement he follows a principle he has known ever since he played with blocks — that of balancing one weight over an - other, and the more truly the centers are one above the other, the more secure is their balance. Nature in the same way has used these same principles in the construction of the human body. Consequently when poor habits of sitting, standing or walking throw the frame - work out of this alignment, it sags and bulges, slackens and totters just like any other building that defies these principles, thus de - stroying not only its external beauty, but undermining the position and security of its internal machinery and throwing the whole muscular system out of order. If we all understood these principles early in life we would not be confronted with the problems of posture that arise today. These prin - ciples can be learned only through direct application and are best taught in physical education classes. As a general thing, a child does not learn to use his body efficiently or to the best advantage unless di - rect application is made to such movements. Realizing the need of such training for the youth of our state, a couple of years ago one of our foremost citizens was approached to get his reaction to a state physical education law that would enable our boys and girls to have this training in our schools. His reply was that the boys and girls of our state did not need physical education. They had enough activity in their work on the farm that enabled them to get all the exercise they needed. They may have received plenty of exercise, but I doubt very strongly that they are getting true physical education in their activity. May I illustrate? I was born and brought up on a farm. I did all the usual things a child does on a farm. I played, I climbed trees and hung from the ladders in the barns. I walked the beams in the haymow. I learned to milk the cows, churn the butter, and run the separator, as well as wield the busy end of a broom or rolling pin. The barn - held wonderful attractions at dish-washing time and even the pump handle was often chosen as the lesser of the two evils. As I grew older, I could take any place in the harvest or hay field and often helped to feed the threshing machine as well as the threshers. If farm work was all that was needed to create a good posture and a healthy body, I should have been on top of the world. Theoretically it worked out something like the story of the young fellow and his girl who were out walking one night and the girl said, "Nobody loves me and my hands are cold." Her bashful escort spoke up and said, "God loves- </seg>
            <seg id="p391">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION you and you can sit on your hands." Theoretically the outcome should have been one thing; practically, it worked out entirely different. When I entered physical education training school, being the only student in the class from a rural community, I should have stood head and shoulders above all the others in the group. I'd always prided myself on never having been seriously ill and certainly thought I was in the best of condition. Can you imagine the shock I received to be called into the director's office and informed that I had not only an E posture (and E didn't stand for excellent either), but that they were seriously considering the advisability of my entering the physical education field because of the precarious condition of my health. Luckily for me I had a friend at court who promised to supervise my program and I was allowed to enter training. Many times since the director of that school has said to me that she has never examined anyone with so strong and heavy back muscles as I had, but she also added never had she found anyone either whose muscles were so un - trained. The point I'm trying to make is this — posture can't be left to chance if it is to be efficient, but opportunity must be provided for adequate training for poise and balance. Now what has all this to do with health that we've just been dis - cussing? We know that when the body is in its best alignment that the organs are in their most efficient position to function adequately and fully with the least possible strain. With better organic function •our whole sense of well being is improved, not only physically, but mentally, and we can take our place as citizens useful to society and make adjustments that will make life happy and joyous. The handi - caps of a poor physical appearance and a weak muscular structure as well as the many fears due to fatigue or ordinary lack of courage are removed by the improvement in posture. The removal of these fears results in increase in poise, self-confidence and courage to attack prob - lems otherwise shunned at every opportunity. But not only do we con - sider the physical, for the person with good posture usually has a mental attitude that goes hand in hand with her poised and balanced physical structure. From the foregoing pictures, several things are obvious: First, improvement in body balance brought an improvement in general appearance. Second, a better balanced structure eliminated many of the aches and pains that come from the strain of poor control of structure. Third, knowledge of her own condition and ways of protection or ■correction through health knowledge and practice eliminated many of the fears that had brought about a depressed mental attitude, which in some cases had gone so far as to make the student feel herself in - capable of hard work. </seg>
            <seg id="p392">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Fourth, with the improvement in both mental and physical health) come the ability to adjust to life with a reasonable amount of success,, satisfaction, efficiency and happiness so that she was better to adjust herself to the stress and strain of her environment and to take her place as a useful member of society. It has been said that posture is 98% per cent mental and 1% per cent hereditary. If that is the case then removing all the mental hazards that handicap the individual will certainly improve the health and posture and lead to joyous participation in all activities of life. In other words using the time tested recipe of mental and physical poise and balance, the results will startle you. How much easier you will find the shifting of gears, the application of brakes so effortless. With the combination of super-flexible springs in your arches and the levelator to eliminate sidesway, added to redistribution of weight, thus eliminating the double bump, you have undreamed-of comfort and steadiness never before approached. Keeping on an even keel at all. times, your machine skims smoothly over the rough spots and takes the curves safely at even a high rate of speed. Powered by the greatest engine ever built, it runs silky smooth, is dependable and built to last, and it provides true economy for both fuel and battery consumption. This superb new machine will be distinguished by a dashing new sky way silhouette in which slim silvery radiators, intriguing new colors, and sweeping wing fenders combine with air curved tops and rear decks to complete a distinctive, appealing stream line. Inside and out. it expresses the last word in comfort, the utmost in appearance, con - venience and durability. Truly it will be as "smart as tomorrow". USES OF COTTON Miss Catherine Cleveland ■ Following this, Miss Catherine Cleveland gave a talk on Uses of Cotton. Miss Cleveland represents the Cotton Textile Institute and her talk was an explanation of an exhibit and style show of garments which she brought with her. The University girls modeled the dresses, hats and other accessories which she had. The dresses were all made from cotton materials and were suitable for most any occasion — beach clothes, school dresses, afternoon dresses and informal evening dresses. She also had many hats to match the dresses and for the rain outfit she had an umbrella to harmonize with the coat. After the style show. Miss Cleveland explained the exhibit of fabrics which she had arranged in the front of the room. This included ma - terials for curtains, drapes, and dress fabrics. She also had some lun - cheon sets made up to suggest finishes, trimmings, etc. </seg>
            <seg id="p393">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION The talk and exhibit clearly showed the various uses of cotton. Many of the ideas were new and different. RECOGNITION OP COUNTY CHAIRMEN Miss Carolyn Ruby then turned the meeting over to Miss Mary-Ellen Brown. The county chairmen, home agents and state agents were asked to sit in groups. Miss Brown opened the meeting by having •everyone repeat the Collect: "Keep us, O God, from pettiness, let us be large in thought, in word, in deed. Let us be done with fault-finding and leave off self-seeking. May we put away all pretense and meet each other face to face, without self-pity and without prejudice. May we never be hasty in judgment and always generous. Teach us to put into action our better impulses, straight forward and un - afraid. Let us take time for all things; make us grow calm, serene and gentle. Grant that we may realize it is the little things that create differences; that in the big things of life we are as one. And may we strive to touch and to know the great common woman's heart of us all, and, O Lord God, let us not forget to be kind." A map of Nebraska was placed in the front of the room which showed the location of the home demonstration clubs. Miss Brown pointed out that there were 189 more clubs this year than last with an increase of 3,063 members. This she said was due to the splendid leadership of the women. She then introduced Director Brokaw who she said was our outstanding leader, one whose leadership we are proud to follow. The text of Director Brokaw's talk is as follows: I rather hesitate to talk to you year after year out of kindness to you. I doubt if I can talk to you on leadership as you know it better than I. If we have grown and our work has been effective, it is because of your coopera - tion and what you have done. The past years have been good years because we have developed leadership, which has been especially true of the past two years of this great crisis. The load on a few people has fallen back and leader - ship of many has come forward. Community leadership has shown its worth. We can almost judge a county by the leaders it has developed. Each day the program has built up new young people. I appeal to you to touch the lives of the young. During these years of unrest and change we need to build up 4-H Clubs, especially the older boys and girls. Education plays a great part in building youth and building a </seg>

I am happy to present to you this pin in appreciation of your leadership. It exemplifies some of your responsibilities and achievements.

            <seg id="p395">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION jrour fellow workers with a loyalty to service and a desire for achieve - ment of those things in homemaking and home life that are necessary for better agriculture and more complete living on Nebraska farms. Your selection was an honor and privilege, but it also implied duties to perform and obligations to fill. Your regular duties have not pre - vented your meeting these tasks and we recognize that only busy people are successful leaders. By a faithful performance of your duties, you have inspired a con - fidence in you and a friendship for you that can only be secured by having been a friend to others and by a faithful performance of obli - gations assumed. One is not worthily a leader who is not doing all in her power to enlighten her community in becoming, in so far as humanly possible, an example of right living and service to others. While the work you have done and the goals achieved are highly commendable, you have but entered into this field of leadership so essential to agriculture's welfare and to national progress. Others may assume in the coming years your tasks of the present, but leader - ship accomplishments imply growth of the individual and point the way to broader fields. Do not misunderstand; no field, appearing to many a higher field or greater accomplishment, is more essential than the one you are filling now. Your community, your county, your state, the nation, are observ - ing the character of your service. They will expect much Of you; in this, we are sure they will not be disappointed, for into the hearts of all humans there has been implanted, and it depends only upon proper cultivation of growth, that desire for leadership so essential to an occupation as ours and to the welfare of a Christian nation. After reading this charge. Director Brokaw presented the new chairmen a pin and a printed card of the charge. Following this, Miss Brown had all the past county chairmen stand. She then introduced Miss Dorothy Norris, president of the Home Demonstration Agents' Organization. Miss Norris said: In behalf of the Home Agent's Association, we wish to express our thanks to this group of County Chairmen who have so faithfully carried out this piece of extension work. Too much credit cannot be given to the voluntary leaders who do such a splendid piece of work. This little poem by Douglas Malloch no doubt expresses our feelings. The Hills Ahead The hills look hard and steep and high, And often we behold them with a sigh, But as we near them, level grows the road; We find on every slope, with every load, The climb is not so steep, the top so far — The hills look harder than they really are. </seg>
            <seg id="p396">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE And so with troubles, though seeming great, That men complain and fear and hesitate, Less difficult the journey than we dreamed, It never proves as hard as once it seemed, There never comes a hill, a task, a day, But as we near it, easier is the way. Miss Norris then presented each chairman with a bouquet. ' COUNTY CHAIRMEN LUNCHEON After the morning meeting adjourned, a get-together luncheon for the present and past county chairmen was held in the Home Economics Building. Fifty-four people attended this meeting. Plans were made for district meetings to be held in February. The purpose of these meetings was to discuss next year's project. WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON Miss Margaret Fedde, Presiding The past two years it has been the custom to have a general meet - ing at 1:00 each day. This year we were privileged to hear Miss Ruth O'Brien, Bureau of Home Economics, U. S. Department of Agriculture. The title of her talk is "Must We Buy By Guess?" MUST WE BUY BY GUESS? Miss Ruth O'Brien It happens that my job requires me to attend a great many meet - ings of merchants, advertising men, and manufacturers of various kinds of goods. At most of these conferences some aspect of consumer buying is up for discussion and I am always im- pressed with one fact. No matter how much Jjffir'fi^^ these merchandising friends of ours disagree on jgy^^Bi some subjects, they are always unanimous on one. yl^., They always agree that the consumer is very stupid y *£ -'"W ■■ — in fact, the word "dumb" might better describe "TSffo' their opinion than stupid. Somebody usually jumps . : iV ■ H^ V up and states that the intelligence of the average £&gt;jL x Jk$r consumer is about that of a ten-year-old child. I 1 : have never discovered who first invented this bit fr'ffij^^ oE psychological data. According to these commercial men, the consumer is gullible, likes to be fooled, is interested only in style and not in quality. In fact, consumers are so unintelligent they cannot distinguish good from poor merchandise and buy chiefly on impulse in response to emotional appeal. </seg>
            <seg id="p397">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION As a result of this deplorable mental and emotional state, con - sumers must be lured into buying by means of pretty pictures and pretty phrases. They must be scared into buying by fear of losing their sweethearts or their social standing. Above all, merchants and adver - tisers must be careful to speak to them in very simple terms, in words of one syllable which can be understood by feeble intellects. All so - called technical words must be avoided. You would think consumers had been known to collapse from the mere shock of hearing such words. This is quite a distressing picture, isn't it? It is to me,' especially when the consumer is usually spoken of as "she". But we have one consolation. Do you remember those puzzles which used to have a line under them asking what is wrong with this picture? Well, there is something wrong with the picture these people paint of consumers. That "something" is that their notions simply do not accord with the facts. And the sooner we convince manufacturers and merchants that these ideas are wrong, the sooner some of us wipe out of our own minds the feeling that maybe we are a little too stupid to buy intelli - gently, the sooner the consumer will have a fair chance in ,the retail market. For the difficulties we consumers are having in making good se - lections nowadays are not due to our own lack of intelligence. They are due to the merchandising conditions with which we are faced. It is true that practically all of our buying must now be done by guess. The nature of most goods on the market today is such that it cannot be judged by sight, smell, feel or taste. In many instances it is hidden in a tin can, a package, or behind a veil of cellophane. We may read innumerable pamphlets and study diligently to learn the qualities we should have in some household articles. This informa - tion is of limited help to us. For example, I may understand fully that an oven should have well insulated walls, but this helps me little when I go to the store and can get no definite facts concerning the insulation of the ovens on the particular stoves shown me. I may know that I should avoid buying a heavily weighted silk, but I cannot sit in a store and burn holes in dresses in order to test them for weighting. We are often urged to buy entirely by brand, that is, to find a brand Which suits us and stick to it. The difficulty is in finding the brand which gives us the best value in terms of price and the use to which we expect to put the goods. How can anyone test out each of 4500 brands of canned corn, the 1000 brands of canned salmon, the 3 00 brands of canned pineapple? Only too often we find out "by chance" that the brand we have been using is more expensive than some other of the same quality — and it must be "by chance". There is no other </seg>
            <seg id="p398">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE way. Many of our purchases are made only once In a lifetime and we cannot even profit by experience. I cannot afford to buy one stove after another until I learn which one is most satisfactory to me. "We are told that our difficulties would be solved if we would just buy at a "reputable" store. It is perhaps unnecessary to mention that so-called "reputable" stores carry various qualities of merchandise. The price asked is no accurate measure of the quality. The store does not assist us in choosing between the qualities offered. Neither can nor does a store refund the purchase price for all merchandise which fails. It could not do this and stay in business very long. We may well ask the question: Is there any such thing as a "reputable" store in the sense we are considering here, that is, in the sense that the customer will always get the quality most satisfactory to him at the most rea - sonable, socially just. price? In addition to these difficulties we have in selecting the merchandise best suited to our needs, we are also of course bombarded with all sorts of high-pressure selling methods which tend to confuse and bewilder us. There is the house-to-house salesman whose strong right toe is his greatest asset. He sticks it in our door and keeps it there while the wintry breezes sweep through the house. We finally buy his vegetable brush — not because we want it, but in order to get the door shut and save on the coal bill. All kinds of sales psychology are worked on us. We are urged to float into high society, not on a magic carpet but on the mattress which Mrs. Percy Billionaire "simply would not be without".- The lonely miss is assured she will at last find bliss — all by means of a cake of soap. ■ Is there any way of improving'the situation — of giving consumers the help in selecting the quality of goods which will give them the most satisfaction? Well, some of us believe it would help a lot if we could just have a few simple, old-fashioned, definite facts. We would like these facts on labels right on the goods so it would be as easy to find them as to find out the price. In many cases, this could be done most simply and most definitely by grading systems. Either letters, or numbers, or words could be used to show what the quality grade of the article is. For example, a New York department store has recently started to label each blanket offered for sale with letters showing its grade as to durability and as to warmth. A blanket may be A grade as far as durability is con - cerned but of C grade as to warmth. There are a number of quality grading systems now used in the wholesale markets and it is unfortunate that more of these are not carried through across the counter to the person who might be said to be the most important of all — the fellow who must use the goods. </seg>
            <seg id="p399">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION The system of grading canned foods on the wholesale market is a good example. If the goods is such that a grading system is not possible, a definite description of what it will do in use or of how it is made would help. We have mileage specifications on automobile tires now. We have the composition of fertilizers and some mixed seeds given on their bags. Undoubtedly we could have more of these kinds of facts given on labels on clothing, food, and household articles. Or perhaps merely some facts about some one or two important qualities might be given. For example, one organization is now trying to get manufacturers to label cotton fabrics with the per cent they will shrink so that we can know when he buy such a fabric how much shrink - age we must allow for. Why are our manufacturers and merchants unwilling to give definite information of this kind about their products? There seem to be many reasons but the one talked about the most is that the con - sumer doesn't really want such facts, is too unintelligent to under - stand them- and wouldn't use them in buying anyway. You and I know this is not true. But apparently we will never have informative labels on goods or any other kind of definite buying guides until con - sumers individually and through organization prove that it is not true. Right now is a splendid time to discuss such questions in county councils and in consumer groups, decide what is wanted and impress these desires upon the business interests in each community. One effective way is to buy those articles which are graded or carry other kinds of informative labels. There never was a time when the consumer was more important in the scheme of things, when he was talked and written about as much. It would be well for him to do some of the talking and writing himself — in other words, show he is not so "dumb" after all. Following the general meeting, each division met in its respective group. The Thomas Male Quartet opened the Home Economics Section meetings. They sang the following selections: "Medley" "Invictus" by Bruno Huhn "Old Man Winter" by Grey "Angels Watchin' Over me" — a spiritual Mrs. W. LeRoy Davis then presented the following talk on bills be - fore the 1935 legislature. </seg>
            <seg id="p400">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE COMING BELLS OP THE 1935 LEGISLATURE Mrs. W. LeRoy Davis In dealing with my subject this afternoon, I must of necessity dwell in the realm of the prophet and be a sort of fortune teller. Even though I am not gazing into a crystal globe and skilled with the sayings of the mystic art, I must prophecy, for the legislature has not been in session more than a week and three days of that week were spent in vacation. As you know, the legislature considers from 800 to 1,000 bills during a session, and so far in this one only 75 bills have been introduced, so they are barely started and just organized. To be able to predict what bills they will bring forth is more than anyone could do for you. In mentioning three bills, I am perfectly safe, because in the November election we gave them three mandates: (1) the planning for a unicameral legislature, (2) a liquor control bill, and (3) the ma - chinery whereby pari-mutuel betting may be carried on at horse races. In order of importance to the legislators, the liquor control bill comes first. This is uppermost in the minds of the one hundred thirty-three men in the legislature. However, there is one thing of which we can be certain and that is, that one hundred thirty-three different plans will be introduced for dispensing liquor plus the gover - nor's plan. What they will bring forth from all of these ideas no one can predict. Whatever bill they bring forth, it will not be satisfactory, for no bill will satisfy Omaha as well as University Place. Many com - munities in the state are as wet as Omaha and many as dry as Uni - versity Place. Another thing is very certain. The enforcement prob - lem of whatever comes of it will be most important. Liquor traffic is always lawless and any bill will call for expensive enforcement. Second most important is the bill establishing a unicameral legisla - ture. This is probably the last bi-cameral legislature in Nebraska unless we suffer a reversal of opinion. The biggest difficulty in setting up the machinery will come in re-districting the state. To a layman, the problem may seem simple. The suggestion has been made that the one hundred representative districts now in existence be combined to make fifty districts, thereby creating a legislature of fifty members. As you know, the plan provides for a legislature of from thirty to fifty members. Others suggest that the present senatorial districts be pre - served and thereby create a legislature of thirty-three members. This might well be done if the districts at the present time were perfectly satisfactory. However, when the present districts were created in 1921, it was admitted that they weren't perfectly satisfactory. They are now based on the basis of 13,000 people for every representative district and 42,000 people for every senatorial district. It is impossible </seg>
            <seg id="p401">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION to divide districts in such a way as to make it entirely equitable. 'There are dissatisfied people in the districts desiring to propose statutes calling for the making of an equitable distribution. A bill was introduced yesterday, setting forth machinery for the unicameral legislature. It provides for dividing the state into fifty districts, dividing on the basis of 17,000 people to a district. Lancaster county would have four representatives and Douglas county eight. In the western part of the state the counties are doubled up, the largest district making up nine counties in western Nebraska. There has been a sincere effort made to divide the districts as best as possible'accord - ing to the sympathies of groups in the districts, according to area, and according to population. Another plan has been submitted whereby forty-two districts are established. The establishment of a district may seem to be a simple thing, but if you realize that when one county is a strong dry county and the adjoining county is a very wet county, the very wet county does not want to be allied with the dry county any more than the very dry county wants to be allied with the very wet county. A county which is predomininately Irish Catholic is no more anxious to join up with the German Lutheran county than is the German Lutheran county anxious to join up with the Irish Catholic county. When they get into questions of that sort and the legislature gets involved, it really promises to be a delightful talk fest. I have seen them get into many snarls over re-districting. I expect they are going to spend lots of time on this question. The third mandate is the repeal of the state law forbidding pari - mutuel betting. A law was introduced yesterday by the same group that supported the referendum, providing for setting up such machines. They are to be run by non-profit making organizations, and minors are not to be allowed to use them. Ten per cent of the revenue is to be retained for the expense of operating the machine. At the time of the campaign, they promised that our taxes would be materially lowered by the use of pari-mutuel machines. We discovered now that the revenue derived is to go for buying stallions and jacks to improve the breed of animals in the state. Next most important is the question of taxation. The federal gov - ernment tells us we must assume responsibility for the unemployed. The federal government will try to take care of those who can work, but upon local government units depends the support of the unem - ployed. If the state undertakes that problem, we must have new taxa - tion. The present administration will not countenance additional taxa - tion. Already two bills have been introduced regarding real estate exemption and there will be an attempt to exempt property up to a ■certain amount. By the passage of a sales tax plus an income tax, the plea can be made that this is a replacement tax. We may get a sales </seg>
            <seg id="p402">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tax. Important in the matter of additioanl taxation is whether or not there is an exemption made. The sales tax is an increasingly popular form of taxation and is now found in twenty-eight states. The bill in - troduced given most consideration was copied after the Illinois bill. This call for a two per cent sales tax to be paid by the retailer, but in the end, the burden will fall on the consumer. This is a manifestly unfair form of taxation, for it hits the man with the small income more than the man who has a larger income. If an income tax is passed at the same time, it can be equalized in that way. Attempts have been made to remedy the old age pension law. I admit that it was a weak law when passed, for it was a compromise. The law as originally drawn up was a good one, but it took such a fight to get any law through, we had to be satisfied with compromises. The present law calls for the collection of $.50 from every adult to go into the old age fund. This is such an expensive process that it is not feasible. In most counties where they have set up the machinery for the pension, the plan is to add $.50 on the tax assessment. Not every adult is reached in this way, but to find every adult is too expensive. Even the collection of $.50 from every taxpayer is not an adequate old age pension. Two bills have been introduced in which the amount is raised to $2.50 and the age limit is lowered to sixty. Several other small amendments are also included. An attempt has been made to remedy the law we already have and make it a workable law. Also there will be a law introduced to put a tax on cigarettes, the income to go into an old age pension. Everyone comes down with the idea of economizing. But all they ever accomplished is to cut off one account and increase another, thus putting the tax on the shoulders of some - one else. The bill which to-date has received the largest amount of endorse - ment from state-wide organizations of any bill to be presented, is the child labor amendment. It is being presented by eighteen state-wide organizations, such as the American Legion, State Federation of Wo - men's Club, P.-T. A., Y. W. C. A., W. C. T. U., etc. It may seem absurd to most people that there is still child labor in the United States. I have been told that child labor has been eliminated in industries which signed a code, but in industries which did not sign the code, there is still child labor and the codes which were signed expire in July, 1935. There is nothing on the statute books at the present time eliminating child labor and so the president asked the remaining sixteen states to please ratify the amendment giving Congress power to legislate upon the matter. There is no doubt but what the industries themselves can eliminate it if they desire to, and if sufficient pressure is brought to bear, they will do it. After machinery came into use, there has been an increasing demand for cheap labor. As a consequence, hundreds and thousands of children began working in factories. At the same </seg>
            <seg id="p403">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION time a movement grew up against child labor. Congress passed two laws regarding child labor; but Congress only has the right to legislate under specific grants of power, while the state legislature has any power. Under that grant, they forbade to the channels of interstate commerce the products of child labor and they described those products. The law was passed and was in force, but was eventually brought to the attention of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court declared Con - gress had exceeded its grant of power and had used its power as an excuse to legislate in a purely welfare measure and declared the law unconstitutional. Congress also has the right to tax with no limits, so they passed another law and put a ten per cent tax on such products. This law was also declared unconstitutional by a five to four decision. At this time, they were given the advice that if they still wished to legislate on this matter, they should pass an amendment to the Con - stitution. As soon as the bill could go through, it was passed by more than two-thirds of the legislature and was then sent to the states for ratification. Six states rapidly ratified it. Then the people who make money from exploiting child labor got busy. They hired newspaper space and gained accession to the educational columns of farm papers and told the farmers that Congress was aiming at them. If the amend - ment was passed, they said that Willie wouldn't be allowed to carry in any more wood and Mary couldn't wash any more dishes. They said it cleverly enough and often enough so that people believed it. The bill was defeated in Nebraska three times, but it hasn't come up since 1929 until the present administration. Congress may be prepared to legislate on the subject in this session. I am hoping that our agri - cultural communities will think for themselves this time and will not be led astray by false propaganda. A great many other bills which affect us more or less indirectly will be brought up. For instance, there is one demanding that a flare be placed on a storage truck. There is a movement on foot to put the Capitol in the hands of the governor and to have a trained custodian put in charge of the building who understands the valuable materials contained in the Capitol. It has not been well taken care of up to the present time. The only way is to appoint a trained person and give him enough money so that he can take care of it. A bill has been introduced regarding tourist camps. A great deal has been written on the mushroom growth of the tourist camp. Hotel people are dissatisfied and unhappy over tourist camps and want them placed under the same regulations that regulate hotels. There is also a bill compelling the broadcast of football games. Another bill which affects a great many of us is the establishment </seg>
            <seg id="p404">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE of a state police. Such a measure should demand our attention. "With liquor I wonder if we won't come to the realization that something must be done to regulate traffic, that there have to be patrol stations. I think we are going to come to realize that we must patrol our high - ways. Money will be saved in the long run and many, many lives. There will be many other bills in which you will be individually in - terested, but I have not time to mention more. However, it seems likely that the legislature will arrange to stay here until May 1, so you will have opportunity to hear much more about them. 4-H BOYS' DAIRY TEAM DEMONSTRATION Max Brown and Dale Theobald The 4-H demonstration team which won the state and national championships in Dairy presented their demonstration on Making Ice Cream in the Home.

Department of Agriculture. The topic of her talk was Present Guides for Household Buying. The Bu - reau of Home Economics has been making a study of this and we felt that Miss O'Brien had some very vital information on this subject. PRESENT GUIDES IX HOUSEHOLD BUYING Miss Ruth O'Brien In the brief time that I have this afternoon, I am going to run down very rapidly those buying guides, which as far as I can see, we now have at our disposal. You may have the idea that I am very pessimistic, but I am sort of dubious about present buying practices. We must improve the situation, but until we can improve the present situation, we must use the guides which are now available. What are some of those guides? First of all we must know all the facts we possibly can find about every commodity we buy. That means that all these projects in exten - sion work where we study how to buy mattresses, bed springs, canned goods and all of those things which we have to buy, will help us not only in buying on the present market, but will show us the difficulties of the present market. We couldn't possibly bring about the changes which should be brought about until we know the limitations of the present market. Only by studying and reading all we possibly can about every particular commodity can we become educated enough to know where we should have improvements in merchandising practices. I brought along a few of the things which are most outstanding in textiles. One outstanding problem is the problem of silk weighting. We ought to know a lot about silk weighting. We can't burn holes in the dresses we buy. Unless we realize that silks are weighted, we cannot be on our guard and we cannot get the help we should have in distinguishing between the weighted and unweighted fabrics. The first chart is one of those typical things that you may have experienced yourself — a case of a discharging print on a heavily weighted silk. It is a solid background of color with a small design put on by use of a chemical which takes out the background color. If the silk is heavily </seg>
            <seg id="p407">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION weighted and if the chemical that is used is too strong, in a little while a hole will appear every place where the color has been removed. The next chart shows what happens across the back of a dress which is heavily weighted when it is subjected to great strain and wear across the shoulders. The next one, a slip brings up another point. When we are making our own garments, we are always so much more particular about tho quality of the fabric we buy. We are much more critical of the work - manship we put on it ourselves, but when we go to a store and buy a ready-to-wear, we look at the lines or the style and often forget to look at the seams or the quality of the material to see that we are getting as good a thing as when we make it ourselves. We must train our - selves not to be carried away by style. The person who bought that slip would not possibly think of making it that way. Here is another slip. I think you can all see the point. There is fancy lace at the top, with a thin seam. The shoulder straps are tacked onto the lace, which will not stand the strain of the pull. The next is a child's garment. I am getting very much interested in buying children's ready-to-wear. There seems to be a strange psychology about buying children's garments. More women wave some little garment at me and say, "How much do you suppose I paid for that?" I look at it and say to myself that even if they only paid ten cents for it, it would be too much. We must avoid "bargains". I think nowadays we are tempted to buy children's garments im - properly made more than we buy adult garments. If our buttons burst off when we bent over, we might be more critical. On the other charts you will see examples of things which we have to watch when we go to buy clothing. We must learn to get the thing that meets our own standards by our own power of observation. The next point to consider is this business of advertising. One of our duties in this movement of improving consumer buying is to judge advertising very critically. Read the advertisements critically. See how many facts you really find out about the products in the advertise - ments in the women's magazines and in newspapers. I recall an ex - periment in which a woman went through an advertisement and blotted out all the words which actually named the product. From the words which were left, you could not tell whether the advertise - ment was for macaroni or Skinner's satin. Many advertisements do not give us any real facts, save only to show us what different varieties of commodities are on the market. Unless we begin to read advertise - ments critically and voice opinions, we never will get the changes we want. </seg>
            <seg id="p408">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Third, we have approval services. Various organizations and national associations are putting on definite tags certifying definite things. However, before you take the advice of any certified or approval ser - vice, write to the organization backing it and ask for the standards which they have set up and upon which they base their approval of the thing you are interested in buying. For instance, if it is a re - frigerator or a rug, they should be willing to tell the public the stand - ards in the tests they make by which they decide which particular products they will approve or disapprove. If they reply with vague generalities, their approval does not mean much. We are intelligent people and we should be able to get the facts from these people. If they are doing a legitimate business, they should be willing to tell us their standards. We might mention to some of these organizations that instead of drawing one line — that of approval or disapproval — it would be more helpful to us if they would draw some more lines in the approval part and some in the disapproval part, so they could give us facts as to the relative value of the products which they have approved. There are many different classes of merchants that are not giving the help and service they might render. However, one organization which has done one of the nicest pieces of work in certification or ap - proval is the 'American Gas Association. There was a hazard in using gas appliances. Many were defective and as a result many people were asphyxiated. The industry was frightened. They set up two splendid testing laboratories. They approve devices for safety, and are grad - ually going into quality. They have not gone very far in the matter of durability and other factors, but they do approve or disapprove as to safety. They have an excellent system of sampling. If you write to them, they send you a volume of literature containing "straight - from-the-shoulder" facts. Fourth, wherever there is a grading system on the market, we should learn everything we possibly can about those different grades. It really is an intellectual struggle, but we will have to work at it. It is part of our job to learn all of the grading systems now in existence and what those grades mean. We must make use of the best tools we have. First is this matter of grading canned foods. We are trying to get it all over the country. Every consumer organization in the country is perfectly agreed upon that. We must know what the dif - ferent words are that are used to name the different grades and know exactly what they mean. Maybe the C product is just as good for a particular purpose as the A grade. When we want to buy an A grade, we do not expect to get a C grade at an A price. Papers are full of in - formation, and it is a live subject right now and we should be well informed on it. I am not advertising anything, but I have had this theory about this matter of grading. I am hoping that it will be brought </seg>
            <seg id="p409">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION about by law if necessary, but if possible, slowly and soundly and voluntarily from the industries themselves. If we could choose a few companies to try out grading, I feel that gradually, if the consumers showed they were interested, other companies would "jump right onto the band wagon". The other day a pamphlet was sent to me which was a very nice ad - vertisement for a can company, but I was interested in it because there was a paragraph on packing and grading where it discussed in a straight-forward way the grades of that particular canned food now on the market and what those grades mean. We should have intelligent advertising for an intelligent public. We are all trying to get this change. There are quite a few articles which are now graded. To help you know about these, the Bureau of Home Economics has put out a bulletin, No. 193, which we will be glad to send you free of charge. It lists every grade that we know of that is now in use, every kind of a help or guide now in use. It does not go into detail, but there are a number of references in the back which you may use to follow the thing through if you are interested. That is one place where you might look for commodities which are now graded. Learn the names of grades and watch out for pitfalls. Some systems have hidden grades above A. Some commercial firms insist that if they grade their products A, B. C, and D, nobody will buy the C and D grades, so they have a double A, A and B grades. This placing is not according to rules. There is a very interesting report from the Consumer Advisory Board established by the NRA discussing grades. This is a mimeo - graphed report and contains a list of all the grading systems used on the wholesale market. Many of those used on the wholesale mar - ket might be used on the retail market. The purpose of the report was to show that there are entirely too many different ways of naming grades. It would help if they would all get together and agree on one system. After grading systems we might work for specifications. There is at the present time quite a little misrepresentation in advertising and talk concerning the use of government specifications on consumer goods. Many people will say, "The government has specifications, why don't they make them public and use these specifications?" We want you to understand that a government specification does not mean that it describes the best quality. These specifications were written for the use of people in government offices for materials bought for use for government purposes. They have taken everything into considera - tion such as cost, etc. A quality way down the line might be perfectly </seg>
            <seg id="p410">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE satisfactory for their particular use, but it might not satisfy the home - maker for the use to which she would put it. Recently I had some interesting correspondence with a gentleman who seemed to be honest and sincere, but a little mistaken in his think - ing. He put out an advertisement in which he stated that his fabrics passed all government tests. This is what he wrote me: "What do you think of this lovely advertisement?" I replied that I thought it was very misleading and hoped that he would remove it from the magazines. He then replied that he had used the government bulletin that gave these tests, and that his goods passed everyone of those tests. I told him that the bulletin which he cited to me was the bulletin which tells qualities for the benefit of those who sell goods to the government and tells the methods by which all textile materials will be tested, but doesn't set up any standards. We have in some cases specified the tensile strength when we wanted a textile with a certain strength. The bulletin does not have a single paragraph in it that specifies standards. You can see how useless these bulletins would be to a person selling to the general public. The gentlemen had some way gotten the nation in mind that government specifications would do for all consumers and was going around saying his goods met government standards. So don't be led astray by such statements in the advertisements. Next is this matter of labels on goods that simply give us some isolated facts. We should know what we are up against in labels at the present time. I would suggest that you begin a hobby of collecting labels. When you buy something, watch whether it has labels on it and if it has, collect them and begin to read labels critically. Ab - solutely knit your brow over them and see exactly what those labels say. The matter of fiber content is the simplest kind of a thing. Cer - tainly we are entitled to know what percentage of wool and what percentage of cotton a fabric contains, also what percentage of silk and what percentage of cotton a fabric contains. We have classified these labels as to what facts they state about fiber content. Certainly these do not tell the story right out. Now this second group has a lot of romantic names which really do not tell us anything, unless we happen to know something about the manufacturer. Below we have Borne in which a start has been made to give us more information. If we read the labels critically, we find those which really tell us some - thing and those which do not. I see in a recent report that our advertising friends are coming out strong in a clean-up of false advertising. In the past they have done a very good job on that part of advertising because really we have a very small percentage of advertisements now that absolutely </seg>
            <seg id="p411">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION lie to us. There are some, but there is being set up machinery in the association of advertisers to cure that. There are sins of omission as well as commission, and what I am pointing out now are the things they omit to tell us. This matter of shrinkage is very interesting. Watch all the differ - ent phrases that appear concerning shrinkage in an advertisement. You will find out some very interesting things. Point this out in any movement along this line, if you would try to bring order out of chaos. There is no definition for pre-shrunk or super-shrunk. All we know is that the cloth has gone through some kind of a shrinking process. The organizations with which we are working are trying to get a definition of what is meant by these titles. The thing we feel we must have is a label on every washable material telling us what per - centage the fabric will shrink. Then in buying fabrics, we will know how much shrinkage to allow for. Another interesting subject is the matter of color fastness. The label may say "color fast", but fast to what? It could be fast to lots of things. Here is one man who is absolutely delighted to tell us some facts. His label says, "Wash fabrics — fast to soap and boiling, fast to sun and weather, fast to perspiration and uric acid." If you glance through these others, they are very vague. We are seeing this term "vat dye". Learn definitions for terms like that. What is meant by "pure dye"? Most of us know nothing about it. Pure dye refers to weighting. Vat dye is a technical term used to designate a very excellent class of dyes. We must prove that we have brains to learn the definitions of vat dye and pure dye. We have had no chance to learn technical terms, so haven't learned the definitions. Let's not be scared out. Consumers can learn any tech - nical term made, but we have had no chance so far to do it. There is interest in this problem of silk weighting and how things are to be labeled as far as silk weighting is concerned. There are all kinds of opinion on this matter. Can a silk be pure and weighted at the same time? On silk slips we sometimes find this label, "Pure dye, pure silk". There is a trade agreement as to a definition of pure dye silk, but some manufacturers have an alibi that no other fiber was present, so a chaotic situation exists. Pure silk means that no cotton or wool Is present, and pure dye that there is no weighting. The whole situation is in chaos and it is a vital thing to watch. Project work is able to teach us some of the things which are really good guides at the present time. The bulletin lists quite a few more. There is this thought I would like to leave with you. We are con- Bumers and intelligent adults. We can use the guides merchants will </seg>

THURSDAY FORENOON Mrs. Ernest Overton, Presiding Again we were privileged to open our meeting with some music by students of Mrs. Mary Hall Thomas, Professor of Voice at the Univer - sity of Nebraska. We first heard Margaret Jane Kimmel who sang: "Hark! Hark! the Lark!" by Schubert "The Wind's in the South" by Scott "The Sleigh" by Kountz Then Russel Cummings sang: "Orpheus with his Lute" by McDonald "Morning" by Speaks "When Irish Eyes are Smiling" by Ball They were both accompanied by Irene Remmers. One of the new things we tried out this year was to have an exhibit of antiques. The exhibit consisted of things the women brought. We had a good response and many stopped to see the articles on dis - play in the Home Economics Building. One of our best boosters and a person who is interested in these beautiful things was the next speaker, Miss Bess Steele. Miss Steele is the Head of the Design Divi - sion, Department of Home Economics, here at the University.

            <seg id="p413">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION APPRECIATING OUR ANTIQUES Miss Bess Steele Those who travel about the state of Nebraska often question whether the people value their antiques as they should. In this talk today I am going to call your attention to a number of different antique objects and I venture that many of you are going to say, "Why, I have one of those. It is stored away on the top shelf of the cupboard and I. hadn't realized its value." And then I hope you will not lose any time when you get home in putting it in good condition and see if you can give it a place of honor. You know things may take on an air we never dreamed of if they are used correctly. If we attach any value to a broad intelligent knowledge of American history we cannot disregard early American achievement in the dec - orative arts for it is intimately interwoven with the story of the nation's social and economic growth. If we would know the manner of men and women who laid the foundations of our country and builded thereon, if we would have a true and lively picture of their circum - stances, we must know something of the arts they practiced, arts which, simple and homely as some of them were, none the less played a significant part in the lives of our forefathers. Slide 1. Majolica — pottery with opaque glazing and showy dec - oration, a craft important artistically and commercially from the 16th to the 19th centuries. This slide shows majolica barrel-shaped flower jars — 1750 — showing Chinese influence. There were extensive trade relations between Mexico and the Orient. 2. Mexican Majolica Basin 20 VI" diameter, 1680. Blue tattoo decoration. At this time animal, bird and human forms with leaves and flowers were used in decoration. 3. Glass-making was the first manufacture engaged in by our English forefathers in North America at Jamestown, 1608. Captain John Smith was one of the early manufacturers — he made the first glass beads for trading with Indians, so the first American glass factory was also the first mint. In 1683 at Salem, Massachusetts, rude bottles, window glass and other articles needed by the colonists were made. In 1763 "Baron" Heinrich Wilhelm Stiegel started his glass works at Lancaster, Pennsylvania. These are pressed glass cup plates — coffee poured into saucers and cups placed on plates. 4.

There were Henry Clay bottles, Jennie Lind, Robert Fulton, LaFayette, Washing - ton, and Thomas Jefferson bottles. 6. Bottle mold and molded bottle. 7. Stiegel glass colored and white. A rich deep blue was the favorite color, but wine, amethyst, olive, light green and deep emerald green were also used. The list of articles made by Stiegel is exceedingly varied, glasses, tumblers, steins, mugs, pitchers, table equipment, ink wells, scent bottles, snuff bottles, and even small toys and ornaments. A distinguishing feature of the Stiegel glass is its "high structural tension and resultant bell-like resonance and brittleness, characteristic of nil curly flint glass. For decorative effects Stiegel used engraving, and painting with enamel colors. Early American glass was of two kinds — (1) glass with lead as a second base, known as flint glass, and (2) glass with lime as a second base, known as bottle glass, green glass, or after it has been made color - less by the use of manganese and careful processes of manufacture, as crown glass. Early American decorative metal work was done in iron, brass, cop - per, lead, tin, silver and pewter. Iron was both cast and wrought by the colonial craftsmen in decorative devices and patterns of greater or less elaboration. Cast iron is inflexible and brittle. It cannot be bent, but breaks. Wrought iron is pliable and will bend easily and shows surface irregularities caused by the marks of the smith's hammer. Most of us are accustomed to taking the iron work we see as a matter of course and few stop to contemplate the niceties of craftsmanship. 8. Early 19th century step rail of cast and wrought iron. The designs were characterized by refinement and ingenuity. 9. Eighteenth century hinges of wrought iron. Knobs, latches, latch grasps, and handles showed variations attributable to the fancy of the individual worker. All of them had grace of proportion and evidenced a feeling for refinement of line on the part of the craftsman. Key plates, keys, bolts, and locks furnished inspiration for interesting design. They were generally simple and often bore some little grace of adornment. The locks and keys were of such size that the expanse of metal demanded enrichment of design and fine workmanship. Knockers were wrought in simple, graceful shapes. Foot scrapers, simple and </seg>

Pennsylvania German cast iron stove plate. These plates have - often been mistaken for fire backs. They are primitive, quaint in design, native in conception and their dramatic elemental vigor of execution make them fascinating as an ingenuous expression of folk art.. 1740-1760. The designs were scriptural, legendary or symbolic. The casting of brass did not prevail till the end of the 18th century. American cast pieces having decorative value included knockers, can - dlesticks, door knobs, furniture mounts, warming pan lids, and buttons. 11. Warming pan with copper lid, chased decoration, 18th cen - tury. The coppersmith found his chief field for decorative expression in the lids of warming pans. Sometimes figures were cut out of copper in silhouette and used to embellish tin sconces and similar objects. Moulded lead was used for rain water heads. Eagles, foliage, and dates were cast in the outer surface of the box-like head. Lead was used for casting fine detail — swags and drops and urns — to be applied to the frieze of cornices on houses designed in the Adam style of late Georgian work. 12. Tin sconce with copper circle at top, central tulip design punched. Tin sconce with scalloped edges. Articles made of tin were sconces, candle boxes, lanthorns, sand shakers, candle moulds, foot warmers, tea caddies, bread trays, and small tin boxes. Lanthorns, both circular and square, with conical top and ring handle to carry them by, were decorated with a punched design; the more holes, the more light was emitted. Our foremothers were marvelously proficient in needlecraft. For any woman, rich or poor, to lack skill with her needle or neatness in her work was held to be cause for shame and rebuke. It was as much a matter of course for the early settlers to engage in decorative needlecraft, so far as the arduous duties of life in an untamed wilder - ness allowed them leisure, as it was for them to make clothing for themselves and their families. Besides that, the practice of decora - tive stitchery afforded a channel for the necessary and natural ex - pression of the creative instinct and added a wholesome and cherished object of interest in narrow lives. The heritage of stitchery lore brought overseas by the first women colonists were perpetuated by their daughters and granddaughters. Needle point, petit point, and gros point were everywhere in practice. </seg>
            <seg id="p417">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION There were embroidered samplers, pictures, sprays of flowers and leaves with perching birds on a white satin background, mirror tops, fire screens, chair seats, purses, bags, needle cases, and numerous articles of clothing as skirts and waist coats. The sampler was a study of both designs and stitches for reproduc - tion and, at the same time, a specimen of the worker's command of design and skill in lettering. 14.

Old silver plate is the most fascinating perhaps of all the products of early American craftsmanship. Our early plate represents the cun - ning handiwork of skillful artists — there is nothing primitive about the character of old American silver as there was about some of our other attempts. It represents the personalities of men who gave to the country the best they possessed in the form of service to Church and State. In 1620 Thomas Howard was silversmithing in Jamestown, N. Y. In 1634 John Mansfield was silversmithing in Charlestown, Massachu - setts and Ceasar Ghiselin had the same occuption in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. English and Dutch designs prevailed. Having one's silver in the form of plate was equal to having it in the bank. In times of stress and necessity it was melted and converted into specie. Hull and San - derson in Boston were concerned with the mint. Paul Revere, Boston's </seg>

            <seg id="p419">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Though much of the pewter used in the earlier part of the colonial period was brought from England a great deal was made by enterpris - ing craftsmen among the colonists. They were at work as early as 1639, in Boston, New York and Philadelphia. Much small moulded ware such as spoons which soon wore out were cast by amateurs. The possessor of a mould would lend it all through the countryside. Also things were made by traveling craftsmen at the farmstead. Tinkers who owned pewter molds made a yearly round of visits and cast, on the spot, what was needed by their customers. Pewter is a substance made mostly of tin and lead or copper. The finer the pewter the higher the percentage of tin. A larger percentage of lead gives a dark or bluish tone lacking luster. 32. Late 18th century pewter teapot. 33. Pewter plate and pewter basin. 18th century. 34. Tankard by William Wills, Philadelphia, early 19th century. 35. Coffee pot by Boardman and Company, New York, 1830.

Wriggling or joggling was a form of surface ornamentation in broken or wavy lines done by forcing a flat bladed tool forward with a rocking motion. The making of pewter began to decline in the latter part of the 18th century till 1835 or 1840 when the practice of the craft almost ceased. It was displaced by china, glass and silverplated ware. Early American slip decorated pottery, long forgotten, was recently brought to light. The art of making it was brought from Germany and was flourishing in eastern Pennsylvania before the middle of .the 18th century. The majority of the Pennsylvania Germans were from the humbler walks of life — simple, sturdy, industrious. The Pennsyl - vania slip decorated pottery was the first decorated pottery to be made by white settlers in the United States. There are two varieties: (1) the design is traced in slip, (2) the entire surface of the article to be decorated is covered with a coating of slip and the design is then done by scratching away the slip coat from the underlying surface. The base of the objects was commonly red or yellow clay. Platters, pie plates, jars or crocks and cooking pots were the principal articles made. The decorative motifs were varied from extremely simple conventional floral subjects to the human figure, often merely a repetition of wavy lines. 38. Slip ware pie plate, 1786. </seg>

Large slip decorated vegetable or Jiioat dish, cream colored slip on red ground, 1769. 41. Octagonal dish with moulded relief decoration. Pennsylvania German, 1794. Gray or gray brown stoneware with blue decorations. Pitchers, mugs, butter crocks and pickle jars were made principally at Haddon - field In West Jersey and are still being made with the same forms and methods of decoration. The shapes are good and the color scheme, gray or brown gray and deep blue, pleasing. Simple floral devices were painted on the surface or blue color run into incised patterns. Some - times the whole surface was covered with an incised pattern and not colored. Examples of early decorative painting are to be found in the usual pieces of household furniture, especially chests, cupboards, chairs, tables, mirror tops, clock faces, trays, small boxes, bellows, snuff boxes, band boxes. 42. Dutch New York painted "KAS". The early colonists wanted some sort of decoration for their simple, homemade furniture. With characteristic resourcefulness, they supplied the want themselves, de - pending for inspiration upon the traditions they had brought with them from other lands. The homemade furniture was severly simple and needed something to relieve it. 43. Hadley chest with painted gouged ground, made in the vic - inity of Hadley, Massachusetts. The design is strongly accentuated by the application of color to the background. 44. Pennsylvania German painted Bride's Box, which the groom customarily gave to the bride at or a little before the time of the wed - ding. They were filled with linen, laces, ribbons, and other small finery, for the personal use and adornment of the bride. 45. Painted metal tray with buff ground and dark border. 46. Eighteenth or early 19th century toleware or tin with dec - orative painting. 47. Metal clock dial with painted decoration. Banjo clock with glass panels painted in reverse. In the homes of our forefathers the clock was a point of central interest so they wanted to make it of decorative interest. In the eight-day clocks with astronomical attach - ment, showing the lunar phases, there was opportunity for painting jolly-faced, ruddy-cheeked, round-eyed moons. Then there were </seg>
            <seg id="p421">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION star-spangled spaces of dark blue sky, and occasionally ships on wavy seas. The painting was frequently bad but the decorative effect was good. 48. Early 19th century mirror top with head panel painted in reverse on glass. American makers copied the decorations of the im - ported mirrors. 49. Fireboard painted by Edward Hicks. "The Peaceable King - dom" is really a grotesque. The efforts of the first colonial artists impress us with their naivete and quaintness. It might be of interest at this point to recall the early painters: Benjamin West, Copley, Gil - bert Stuart, Charles Wilson Peale and Sully. Frankly hideous, clumsy and grotesque as are so many of the efforts of pictorial art done by the lesser painters of colonial and post-colonial times, there is, at least, a sincerity of purpose about them that commands our respect, and though we may not desire to possess or to study them, hoping to find any great intrinsic merit, an examination of their shortcomings, at any rate, is calculated to increase our appreciation of conditions existing in our own day. ■ -.:,;. 55R ._■' '.J Hfgjf&amp;fi ' %filBBiB Antique Exhibits 60.

They afford a sincere expression of folk spirit and indicate an inherent love of beauty that effected a happy union, "Wherever it could, between art and common household objects of daily utility. A knowledge of the old fireside loom crafts throws an interest - ing and valuable sidelight on the intimate domestic life of the people during the early formative period of colonial existence. Among the homespun crafts, none was of more universal practice than having the coverlets for the imposing bedsteads in which the eighteenth century housewife took such vast pride. "Sunrise", "Checkers," "Stripes and Squares," "Maid of Orleans," "Rose in the Valley," "Washington's Victory," "Missouri Trouble," "New Jersey Dream" are some of the most familiar patterns. 51.

As soon as the first strenuous phases of homemaking were past and there was opportunity to think of something more than the barest necessi - ties, the early American colonists gave attention to floor covering in both its utilitiarian and decorative aspects. For a long time the custom of sanding the floors remained in favor. 57. Handmade rug. Worsted on woven foundation. 18th cen - tury. With black and the three primary colors within their reach, it •was a simple matter for the colonial dyer to arrive at almost any hue she desired merely by the process of combination. 58. Birth record. An example of fractur painting or illuminating. "Fractur", or pen and brush illumination, is a form of painting once practiced among the Germans of Pennsylvania. It is of interest be - cause it embodied the survival in America of a medieval art tradition that had disappeared In Europe by the middle of the eighteenth century. In other words, the art of illumination was practiced by the monks of the middle ages — illuminated handwriting on paper or parchment, illuminated song books, book marks, baptismal certificates, marriage and death registers in family Bibles or on separate sheets of heavy paper, or pictorial adornment to be framed and hung on the walls. 59.

            <seg id="p423">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION In 1715 we know that calico printing with carved box, holly, or maple blocks was practiced. Often the blocks were cut and sold to the women to do their own printing. The same method was used for print - ing upon fabrics and wallpaper. Blocks were lent from one neighbor to another just as their pewter moulds were. Besides calicoes, linen, muslin, and any kind of cotton cloth could be used. The colors were made from vegetable dyes, red and blue being the favorites. Simple figures, geometric patterns, flower and leaf were used. :." 60. Boxes covered with printed paper. 61.

Report of the Resolutions Committees We, the Resolution Committee, respectfully submit the following - resolutions for your earnest consideration. I. Resolved that as a group of Nebraska homemakers we recognize the effort being made to encourage informative labeling and advertis - ing of consumer products. First, that we study critically the labels on products that we buy and encourage the buying of products bearing - truly informative labels; second, that we use every opportunity to in - form merchants and manufacturers of our desire for such labeling on merchandise; third, that we pledge our support to any merchant or manufacturer initiating such labeling. II. Whereas: The women of Nebraska wish to go on record as favoring the ratification by the state of the present Child Labor amend - ment to the United States Constitution. III. Whereas: The mothers and homemakers of Nebraska believe that the greatest stamina to everyday home living is a full appreciation of the wonderful things about us. We propose to quietly bring about a sound thinking citizenry who will place high values on study that will clothe our intellect in garments of contentment and enhance the beauty of our souls. We further wish to recommend that a copy of the second resolu - tion be sent to the Nebraska Legislature and be read before these bodies. Signed by the Committee, MRS. E. E. HARTZ, MRS. HENRY A.

            <seg id="p426">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE OUR BUREAU OF HOME ECONOMICS Miss Ruth O'Brien My main reason in talking with you is that I want you to know there are some sixty women in Washington who are at your service — sixty professional women. Wej have more than that number on our staff, stenographers and so forth, but some sixty professional women are there, working for you. I wanted you to know that we want to hear from you. We like to get; your letters asking us for the things we have to send you in the way of publications, and we feel it is our business to help you get the other things you want from Washington. So do not hesitate at any time you want bulletins or information to send us a letter in Washington. If you are not just sure, you write to the Bureau and we take it as our job to tell you where to get the material and information you want. We are just one. large family. We are a part of the Department of Agriculture — just one family there together. We want to talk with you. I wish very much any time you are in Washington you would come to see us. We love to have visitors. We are always glad to have you, either singly or in groups, but we are particularly happy when just one or two or three homemakers come in and talk with us, be - cause we feel then we are helping. Do not destitate to take up the telephone and find the Bureau of Home Economics, and we will tell you where to get to us. It is always a problem in Washington to know where to find a particular office or bureau. If you were to come to visit us, you would find we have offices upon the sixth floor. We have a library, we have a laboratory of different kinds and then we have kitchens, and of course there we have all these various types of laboratory offices right there on the sixth floor of what we call the South Building, Department of Agriculture. When the Bureau was organized, they decided to start with three different divisions. We realize there are many other things we would like to work on, but we have a certain amount of money, so we have just the three divisions. First, the Division of Foods and Nutrition. When - ever you are writing to the Bureau and the question has to do with foods, it goes to the Division of Foods and Nutrition. By the way, while I am mentioning that point, if you do know the exact Bureau to which you are writing, it is always so much better if you would address your letter direct to that Bureau. I think a lot of people have been disappointed because they have to wait so long for a reply. They address the United States Department of Agri - culture and do not get an answer for two or three weeks. The point is that the Department of Agrictulture is a great big organization. When I first went to Washington before the present building was started. </seg>
            <seg id="p427">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION there were fifty-seven different buildings scattered all the way around over the District and even way out into Maryland. We had a bee laboratory way out in Maryland, miles away. The Bureau of Chemistry was miles away out in the other direction. The new building has brought many of us together. If you are just writing to the United States Department of Agri - culture, it goes into one big general letter-receiving room where there are lots and lots of clerks. If you have asked some question that needs an answer they have to try to figure it out and think, "Is that some - thing that should go to the Bureau of Home Economics or to the Bu - reau of Chemistry?" If there is a little question about it, it may go around to three or four or five offices before it strikes the right Bu - reau. As an example, we had a letter from a man who said, "How do you make up a bleaching solution and train wild horses?" The com - bination was a little difficult to handle. The clerk who opened it did not know. We took care of the bleaching part of it but then of course we had to send it over to the Bureau of Animal Industry where I think they know somthing about training wild horses. Another letter may be addressed to another Bureau, then it goes direct to the Bureau. If it is something about textiles, I like to have it come to my attention, addressed to me. Then it comes right straight to my desk. We have this Division then, of Foods and Nutrition. We have the second division which we call our Division of Home Economics which has to do with such material as the spending of money, budgeting, etc. The third division is that of Textiles and Clothing, of which I have charge. Now the fundamental purpose of the Bureau is to carry on re - search, so we are primarily a research laboratory. That is why we have all these laboratories. We are primarily there to carry on re - search. What kind? Research that will help homemakers, consumer*, that will help the people back in the homes. We have our attentiou focused on that particular thing. Any project we carry must be some - thing we think will benefit you people and all the other homemakers all over the country. If you will help us by suggesting the thing you want to know, it will help us in making progress. We also never for - get we are in the Department of Agriculture. The research we carry on should be linked up with the agricultural progress of the country. We never forget the extension department, which is a part of the United States Department of Agriculture. We work with them and try to carry on the research they feel is most needed throughout the country. Suppose we decide to make a study. We write it up usually in what we call our technical bulletin. A series that is just strictly dry </seg>
            <seg id="p428">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE fact, written in a way that anyone may understand those facts Some - times those are very thick volumes, so we ars always told over again by the head of our publication division that it is best to rewrite every report we make in just as many ways as possible, that will meet just as many needs as possible. We take this technical material and we write it up in various forms, putting part of it in what we call our Farmers' Bulletins. That is just the name of a series put out by the Department of Agriculture. One is a Miscellaneous Series etc The Farmers' Bulletins are those of which we are allowed to give away more than any other series. It is put on cheap paper so they can be handed out maybe by the millions. That is no exaggeration. Take the stain removal bulletin. Would you believe that we now have dis - tributed over more than a million and a half copies of which more than half were in answer to individual requests? We have so many telephone calls from people right in Washington about how to remove stain that I have one member of our staff an - swer questions about stains which come over the telephone. Just the other day I was sitting in quite a learned conference with four or Hve men from the woolen industry with me, when I received a tele - phone call and the lady said, "Please, how do I get mildew off a dresser scarf?" I immediately had to tear my mind away from the subject of wool and think about the answer to give her, but that is what we are there for— to answer questions, whether they come over the tele - phone or by letter. Now as to the type of research we do in the different divisions. In the Food and Nutrition Division we have one laboratory where we can do the work on vitamins and minerals; we test out the various foods to find their vitamin and mineral content. We have a rat laboratory where they feed them to find out the affect of the different foods. Dr. Atwater first started experiments on nutrition. Among other things, he gathered up figures that different laboratories had obtained by analyzing foods. That is, here and there laboratories had decided to analyze foods, find out the caloric value and then the carbohydrates proteins and fats in these different foods. Dr. Atwater gathered to - gether all the material he could get and put it into a bulletin which has been used as the basis for diets in all kinds of institutions. In the meantime, another laboratory was producing other facts Now the field has gotten so big that the Foods Division is taking one little group of foods of a kind and writes about them in just one pamph - let after another. So we have one pamphlet dealing with meats, an - other on fruits and vegetables. So write the laboratory and find out what the latest facts are on food combinations. Then we have a division working on various things having to do </seg>
            <seg id="p429">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION -with the use of certain foods, the effect of this and that on the value of foods. For instance, a project on butter. We find out how butter is affected when you have it stored under certain temperature condi - tions, and we find that it does not make as good butter when stored under certain temperatures and so on. Then we have a project on eggs. We find out what you feed hens makes much difference in the quality of the egg. We have other projects, very largely meat projects, on which we have cooperated with a great many experiment stations all over the country. We find out what certain things you can do in the way of feeding, in the animal husbandry practices, that will produce certain qualities in the meat, etc. We ask questions such as, What are people spending for certain types of families, for we try to help people plan more advantageous budgets. In the clothing laboratory, most of our projects have to do with testing fibers like cotton and wool. Fibers we know the history ot where we know how the cotton was grown, where the sheep were raised' we make up into a variety of articles and put them into use and watch them for several years. We see how fast they wear out and also find out what grades are best for what purpose. We have made quite a little analysis of different textile materials in connection with the con - sumer movement. We are trying to find out what are the various quali - ties on certain staple materials. We have analyzed some, thirty-four different blankets, one particular quality and price range. We are trying to find out what really is on the market, how they vary how practical they are, and how strong. We grade blankets, so we could have the type of label we talked about yesterday. We are doing the same thing with textiles in grading them. What are they like on the market at the present time? It happens the last two weeks we have had different ones in our organization drop what they were doing and put their attention on the temporary emergency things that have come up. Just like all of us in the Bureau of Home Economics have been called upon to furnish material for all of these agencies that have come in to try to do the job quickly, we have been called upon many times by the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. We have loaned our people to the Consumers' Advisory Board and to these various organizations here that quickly needed someone trained for this particular job. We have put out quite a little emergency material and practically all the emer - gency material is mimeographed, so it is not very difficult for people out in the country to keep track week after week. Send for a list of our mimeographed and printed publications be - cause we have two lists— one mimeographed and one printed We will send you these lists. You can look them over and see whether there is anything you would like to have. After you have looked over </seg>
            <seg id="p430">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the lists, check the things you think will be particularly useful to you. That is the easiest way to get material. If you write in and say, "Send me a bulletin on foods," no one knows just exactly what you wish. We can't send everything. If you write for our lists, you can go through them. There are several mimeographed bulletins that are more or less recent. One is on "School Lunches" and another, "Discussion on the Use of Some Emergency Foods". We have a printed bulletin, "Getting the Most for Your Food Money", and the very latest leaflet is, "Meat Dishes at Low Cost," Miscellaneous Publication No. 216. Now there is one thing I want to say in closing. That is, I have tried to call attention to the fact that we are primarily a research bu - reau. It is our business to help the homemaker, the family, the ulti - mate consumer, in any way we can. Where we put our publications tnat go out widely, we are under more or less pressure from the various interests. They would like to get us to tell the homemaker to use this or that. How silly it is! Just about a week ago I had a man suddenly appear in my office who was representing the woolen industry. He sat down at my desk and made the statement, "Wool is the year around fabric. If it keeps out the cold, It will also keep out the heat. You should wear wool all the year around. Each weight and kind of fabric can be made of wool. We should like to have you people suggest in some of your bulletins that people should wear nothing but wool all the year around." He said that every garment he had on was made of wool. Of course, I could see they were made of wool. It was a very mild fall day, really quite warm. I had on quite a thin dress. He had on a woolen top coat, a very fine fabric, but as I pointed out to him, a very expensive fabric. He had on a wool tie, a wool suit and woolen socks, and as I said, a beautiful lightweight overcoat. I think it must have cost $300.00. He did not tell me the price. He honestly tried to urge on me that we should put in our bulletin the suggestions he made. He wanted me to print such nonsense as that in order to get more wool sold. Finally, after I had tried to laugh him out of it, I said, "Look here, there is one woman you ought to meet." You see, there was a woman in my office just before that, and she assui-ed me that every garment she had on was fastened up with slide fasteners. The apple growers would like us to go out and tell all the homemakers to eat an apple a day. The ice cream people want us to tell all the consumers they should use all the ice cream possible. The wheat people feel it is our business to urge the consumers to use as much wheat as possible. Secretary Wallace told a delegation who called on him, wanting us to urge something or other, "Gentlemen, the thing you should do is </seg>
            <seg id="p431">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION to put your money into the field of research, in the physiology depart - ment of a University, and see if you could do something to enlarge the human stomach, as that is the only way we can accomplish what all of you people wish us to do." It has been said that the Bureau of Home Economics is urging a campaign to decrease the use of wheat. We are not doing any such thing. Whenever you read anything that sounds as though any de - partment at Washington is going a little bit off, the n.ing to do is to write to that organization and find out what it is that they have started, and they will let you know. You know how easy it is to put something: in the newspapers. I think the American people are intelligent. Those - of us at Washington believe we are like the rest of the country and. have good sense. There are a lot of checks on anything we do. When: we put out a publication, you have no idea how many people have to&lt; approve it. There is very little chance to go off on some wild thing. There is a certain bulletin we put out as a result of the emergency need. We kept getting requests as to what would be the best division of the money that is available for food, and how to divide a certain amount of money. Our foods people worked on this and did every - thing they could to get the very latest information. They set up four different diets at different levels of cost. The lowest one was one no - one would want to live on for any length of time at all. It was simply an emergency diet. It would keep people alive if they just had hardly anything. It was made for the relief people. We said, "If you just have to limit the amount given out for relief, here is something that will keep one alive." It was a temporary diet. We set up four diets at different levels, with a different percentage of proteins, etc. We know we should have different proportions of these different things in the diet. There are different proportions of cereals, etc. We put in some other things. I never saw such a deluge of complaints. "There are not enough eggs in these different diets," "You do not have enough fruits and vegetables," "You have too much cereal, you should have less," said the producers of those articles. Well, it is just like the wool and slide fastener people. We have had that kind of a reaction from all these different groups. If this sort of thing is discussed in your community, I wish you would write to the Bureau. We will send you one of these bulletins I have just mentioned. You will agree with us that we have taken the middle course in the whole problem. We will also send you some information about the fundamental facts. You will find some of the things you have heard about these things is not the truth. That is true any place where you have organizations at the present time trying to do work in an impartial, unbiased fashion for the welfare of the people. </seg>
            <seg id="p432">REP&lt; &gt;KT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Where there Is so much pressure coining from business men want - ing us to push their particular product, it is hard to keep firm, keep sensible, and keep our attention focused on the welfare of the whole people. That is what we are working for, and that is what the state colleges are working for. Write to us whenever you hear of a con - troversy of this kind and we will try to tell you exactly what is under - neath it all. The thing I am primarily interested in is this. I would like to in - vite you to come to see us. I would like to have you write to us for any help we can possibly give you in connection with our own publica - tions or some work you want, anything in Washington, as we can direct you to the source of the thing you would like to have. Thank you. PANEL DISCUSSION Miss Mary-Ellen Brown, in Charge Members of the group: Miss Ruth O'Brien Mr. A. G. George '.** Professor C. E. McNeill Mrs. William Fleming Mrs. Mary B. Nelson Mrs. U. S. Ross Miss Brown: I have seen two panel conferences handled and have thought I couldn't handle one, and since promising to take this place, I have been very much concerned about it. However, we have good helpers on the panel, who have been handed a card which contains the two questions to be discussed, "What are the problems of the Ne - braska consumers?" and "What can be done to help?" We have not met together before. May I now introduce these people to you. This will give the mem - bers of the panel a minute to think about these problems and then after we have discussed these topics for a time, we are going to throw it open for general discussion. If you have some ideas, you can help us with them, or if you wish, ask some questions. With Miss O'Brien here, we have the best authority for answering questions. If we, as Nebraska women, do not ask her questions, we are wasting a good opportunity. The first member of the panel on my right is Miss Ruth O'Brien, from Washington and next Professor McNeill of the Economics Depart - ment of the University. Mrs. U. S. Ross from Rosalie, Nebraska, is a fine homemaker. We appreciate her willingness to help us on this panel. Mrs. Fleming is one of four people in Nebraska who have been elected chairman of a County Consumer Council. Perhaps some of you </seg>
            <seg id="p433">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION heard Mrs. Fleming give a radio talk recently. We have heard that it was an interesting talk. Mr. George, from the Rural Economics Department, knows as much about farm account books as any Nebraska man. He knows what the consumers' problems are. Mrs. Nelson is a homemaker who lives on a farm. She knows many of the problems of farm women and has been Home Demonstration Agent in Thayer county. "We asked her to help because she has been demonstrating the buying lesson in some of the counties. This consumer problem is a big problem, isn't it? You read about it in the papers. You hear about it over the radio. Right now the whole country is thinking about what the consumers' problems are. It is a good thing for us to talk about it and to study it. May we ask those who have sent to Washington for the Consumers' Guide to raise your hands? Not nearly as many as I had hoped have sent for it. Miss O'Brien, please tell us something about the Consumers' Guide. Miss O'Brien: The Consumers' Guide is a pamphlet about the size of this one I have here, with interesting pictures in it and also some up - to-date and interesting material about the consumers' problems. What are the things people are thinking about right now? It is issued by the Consumers' Council, of what we speak of affectionately in Washington as the Triple A, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration. It comes every two weeks. All you have to do is to write for it if you would like to receive it. It has right-up-to-the-minute material, anything that is a vital problem now in the administration, anything that is a con - sumers' problem. It also gives prices, which are a little bit late, be - cause they are collecting prices all over the country. I think it is a thing you would like to have. I should also say that there is another pub - lication just started that is called Consumers' Notes, which is going to alternate each week. It is put out by the Consumers' Division of the National Emergency Council, the agency under which the Con - sumers' National Council is now functioning. The Consumers' Notes, which you get by writing to the Consumers' Division of the National Emergency Council, will come every two weeks. It is a mimeographed sheet and alternates with the Consumers' Guide. May we pass this around? Consumers' Notes will alternate in the week the Consumers' Guide will not come out. They will be glad to send a copy to you if you will write for it. Miss Brown: We are hoping that many Nebraska women are getting it. Do you know how many Nebraska women have sent for it? Miss O'Brien: No, I do not. By the way, there have been only two numbers of the consumers' Notes put out to date. It would be well </seg>
            <seg id="p434">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to ask for the two back numbers and have your name put on the list for future numbers. Mrs. Fleming: It is devoted mainly to problems that arise in the Consumers' Councils. Miss Brown: Mrs. Fleming, how do you help the people in your county to know about the work of the Consumers' Council? Mrs. Fleming: Our work in education has been very slow. It is the first time the federal government has recognized there are con - sumers. While we have started, we have been learners. Professor Mc- Neill is a member of the Lancaster County Council. Our program of education is beginning because first we had to do some learning our - selves. Just now we have a young woman, a trained librarian, pre - paring a bibliography of all the material in the city library which is devoted to consumers' problems. We are taking material that is coming from Washington and asking the reference librarian in the city library if she could find a place for them. The Consumers' Guide is In the city library in the room where the magazines are kept. They would be very glad to send the Consumers' Guide to any city library that wanted to write for it. Incidentally, the Consumers' Division, of which Miss O'Brien just spoke, has a bibliography of books and pamph - lets for consumers' problems. I am sure that they would be very glad to send it to you. Mrs. Nelson: You suggested to the women that they send for copies. What was the response? Mrs. Fleming: It seems to me the leaders I came in contact with In northwest Nebraska were very eager to find out ways in which they could make themselves better consumers and know more about the problems they have. I found an especial interest in canned goods; the women were hoping they could have more instructive labels on the can. Miss O'Brien: I think we have a large number of copies of bul - letins that have been prepared on this subject. The A. A. U. W. now has a study group in the various local organizations In order to supply material for that study group. The Association is selling at cost a guide of information on consumer buying. The questions in the out - line suggest topics for discussion. They have a bibliography, fifty-eight pages long, so it is a large thing, and covers all the various angles of consumers' problems. They also have many mimeographed arid printed articles. You can get the guide for $1.25. It is a very valuable thing for a group entering on a study of that. kind. The Association will be glad to send it to you for $1.25. Also Dr. Hazel Kirk, at the Uni - versity of Chicago, has a series of radio talks mimeographed for $.10. </seg>
            <seg id="p435">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION She charges just enough to pay for it. A study outline is available from Evelyn Roberts, Pullman, Washington. It is a nice outline and could be used in a direct study group on this subject. She will be glad to send it to you for $.15. Miss Brown: I am wondering what problems in the homes these different folks are having. Mrs. Ross and these other people should have some suggestions as to what they are. What would you say the consumers' problems are in the homes? Mr. George: There is one problem arising — there will be less beet on the market, due to the high price of feeds. We will have to get substitutes for that. Packers say we will have to consume less beef. We will have even less beef to consume than in the past. Personally, I like beefsteak, but what are we going to do? Mrs. Nelson: If meat is selling at a high price, will not the other farm products be likely to be high? Mr. George: They might be, but that does not help the poor exten - sion worker. Miss Brown: We have to be thankful other people are getting it, if we are not. Mrs. Ross: It seems to me that some of the problems in the rural communities are just being able to get the things we want. We have to take what the rural grocer has to offer. I have talked to ladies, not only in mine, but in other rural districts. We call up and ask for a certain brand, but if they do not have that, they send a substitute and we are just unable to know whether that is as good or not. We have to take it even if it is a poorer grade. In the rural communities we have not been able to shop around and find out. Mr. McNeill: The Consumers' Council is now conducting a survey of prices here in Lincoln of retail commodities. We have taken 106 commodities, covering practically the entire range of foods and studied the movement of those prices over the last two months. We have only been going two months and cannot make any very definite statement about results, but we are working with fifteen representative stores here in Lincoln. Every two weeks we have an investigator who goes to those stores and gets the prices. Miss O'Brien is no doubt familiar with the vital statistics. The only thing we have discovered very definitely is the very wide variation in prices on some of these commo - dities. We found here in Lincoln variations in prices on tea from $.38 a pound up to $1.00 a pound for the same brand. You know that suggests to me that one of the problems is that consumers are faced with poor markets in this respect. If they are going to find out where to get the best prices, they have to go to the inconvenience of moving </seg>
            <seg id="p436">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE around from one store to another and keep well Informed on prices - for a great many commodities. The average woman finds it almost impossible to keep closely in touch with the price movement. That is one purpose of the survey we are making. We would like to get a knowledge of the average price for a large range of commodities so we may know what she ought to pay in order to get the various products she uses. The difficulty there is the great variation in quality and it is hard for you to check up on the quality of the different goods you buy. The government is helping out on that. In the matter of meats, you can get first class meat and the government has a stamp on it, telling that it is. When you find it, you know you are getting quality meat. One of the really great difficulties in the consumer problem is the fact that the consumers are not sufficiently interested in the way they spend their money. You can go down here and talk to the de - partment store men and they will tell you that they can take silk goods of a high quality, for instance, price it at $5.00 a yard and put it up on the third floor and sell more yards than if it were priced at $.75 a yard and sold in the basement. That ought not to be. It is difficult for you folks to know the quality of the silk. You ought not to base your judgment of the quality on the price. A great many things of that sort exist where women pay a lot more than they need to pay for a product if they had used a little more judgment. Miss O'Brien: Just because we do not know quality or what a good grade is. Mr. McNeill: I agree with that. It is a part of the reason but that is not the whole story. Miss Brown: What can we do so we will be well informed? Mr. McNeill: It is an educational problem, I think, in selling, and the work the government is doing is the most important agency we have for education. Miss O'Brien: It is not all a matter of educating the consumer. There is nothing on the silk in the basement that tells us it is the same quality as that upstairs. When we have no means of judging, we can do nothing. We are just up against it. Sometimes we do pay a higher price, hoping the manufacturer has been honest and that really the higher price does mean higher quality. Sometimes we find it has not been true. It should be definitely labeled on each piece of goods. General education is going to try to bring about better conditions, but it does not educate us to tell the difference between these silks. Mr. McNeill: I do not believe that makes a very good case for spending your money on the higher priced article. </seg>
            <seg id="p437">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Miss O'Brien: I once sat at a dinner where a gentleman tried to entertain me. He told me what a very successful manufacturer of gas mantles he was. It seems he manufactured gas mantles that were a good quality and which sold at a profit in the, ten-cent store. But he said, "You know, of course, that the consumer is so gullible that he will go to one of the other stores and buy one of my other mantles. There is only a very slight difference between the two products. But people will pay a higher price for them and buy them at a different store, when they could get practically the same thing at the ten-cent store." He thought that was clever merchandising. I thought he was simply not living up to the faith the public was placing in his articles. I thought he was downright dishonest. Mr. McNeill: I am interested in what your reaction is to the policy of buying on the general principle that the lower the price, the greater the value. Miss O'Brien: That does not always work. Mr. McNeill: I thought you indicated it would work better than the higher price. Miss O'Brien: I see no reason. We all know there are cheaper goods — cheaper products that can be sold cheaply. Sometimes it is exactly what we want, and serves our purpose better. That is one thing we must get straight. The merchandising practices should be such that we could tell the quality of all these different grades so we would know whether it is best to buy the cheaper grades or the better one. It is all a chaotic mess. Miss Brown: Over the country there is a sentiment toward being better informed and getting things labeled. Is it growing more and more? Miss O'Brien: Yes, I think so. We notice it in meetings like this, as we go to different groups of extension people and study groups of club women. I was rather amazed a few weeks ago. I was having a controversy with an advertising man in New York. He wrote me and asked me about it, questioning the idea that the consumer was really interested in these things. I was all "het up" over this gentleman's attitude. I put in a little extra time in answering his letter. I was amazed at the facts I was able to round up showing how many differ - ent organizations in the country were doing something on this subject. I must say that my arguments were published in his magazine as in - formation to his advertising clientele and that was what I wanted him to do. I wanted to get across to advertisers that the consumers are really interested in and will use this information. After all, they want to sell goods and are willing to change their methods if they feel it will bring them a more satisfied consuming public. </seg>
            <seg id="p438">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Miss Brown: Mrs. Nelson, you worked with the grocers out in the state. What was their reaction? Mrs. Nelson: I found any time I came in contact with the grocer that he is very anxious to have people ask questions, for it shows they will buy intelligently. But a point came to my mind just now as Miss O'Brien was speaking. How are we homemakers going to express our - selves in regard to the proposition of the third floor and the base - ment? We can go to a grocery store and make some remark and get it across. In going to department stores, what can we say that is going to get our expressions across? Miss O'Brien: I think it helps every time you discuss these things with the clerks, with the buyer, or even get as high as the merchandis - ing manager. All of these things help. Right now we have an excellent opportunity to make ourselves felt higher up. That is, we have a trade association in practically everyone of the different lines, the National Retail Dry Goods Association, and so on. I think that by expressing ourselves especially to each group all over the country, writing organ - izations that have the control over some commodity, you can make your opinion felt now. You understand there is a code for every indus - try. I think it is an excellent time to make your opinions known to these code authorities. I believe we are getting a feeling in the mer - chandising world now that has something to do about the consumers. The time to express ourselves is at hand. Mrs. Fleming: It happens that in the Omaha Consumers' Council they have had a textile group study weighted silks and all of that sort of thing. A consumer came to them with a piece of silk purchased for pure dye silk, which tested eighty per cent weighted. The consumer went back to the department store, one of the largest in Omaha, and raised a very vigorous protest. The chairman of the Consumers' Coun - cil in Omaha wrote a letter to the president, in which she stated that not long age she had written to all the department stores asking for their cooperation in selling the exact quality goods the consumer asked for and in giving the consumer the truth in advertising and reminding the president that there could be a good deal of publicity. This had its effect. In Lincoln I discovered that one of the largest department stores buys no silk goods of any kind without making a test. This particular store in advertising silk goods will tell you that it is weighted or pure dye silk. Some of the other department stores do not do that. Miss O'Brien: I think there is another opportunity in some com - munities in this connection. There was a movement among some mer - chants to try to get groups of women in different towns to cooperate in reducing the number of returns they made at stores. They used the </seg>
            <seg id="p439">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION argument that these returns increased costs and so forth. It should have been carried one step further. In our present situation, certainly there is no good way of finding out the quality at the counter and if you do not get the quality you want certainly you should return the goods. So it seems to me there is a chance for cooperation in a com - mon approach to merchants on returned goods. "We can Bay, "You do something about getting us definite information so we won't be obliged to return goods." We have a chaotic situation in regard to the size of garments. A woman has to take Johnny to the store and fit him there. Otherwise a six-year old is more than likely to mean a two-year old. There is no standard size and the whole situation is in a very bad con - dition. I think we should ask for some trade on this matter of cooper - ation. Mr. McNeill: The consumers' organizations can represent us in dealing with the organizations. Miss O'Brien: How would you suggest they start? Mr. McNeill: I am not prepared to answer, but I presume that people who are interested in the communities ought to be able to look for the leadership of such organizations as the extension department in enabling them to organize. Miss Brown: Don't you think this is a good way to start things, having these talks? Mr. McNeill: I think so. Mrs. Ross: Local stores in the small places have taken quite a definite attitude toward women who go in and know what they really want to buy. As women become more educated consumers, they in turn educate the merchant in the home town. On the farm where they do so much canning, they are not so interested in canned goods. Personally I am very much interested in educating the consumer in textile buying. Miss Brown: If you want it in the state, we will get it. Member of Audience: You say there is a list of these things in the library. I just wish the small towns could have better library facili - ties, and have bound volumes so we could get references with right up - to-the-minute information. Miss Brown: Time is going faster than I thought. Do you folks have some problem you would like to ask us about? What do you think about the labels? What about more buying lessons? What should go into that lesson? Question: With reference to silks and so on. How are we going </seg>
            <seg id="p440">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to test these materials? What is the most practical way to test silks and woolens particularly? Miss O'Brien: I feel we are just up against it until we can, as a consumer group, get informative labels. It is just a guess. We know that silks having excessive weighting are not good silks to buy. We just have to guess. We can make tests as far as that goes, but you can recognize that these various tests have their limitations. I am taking the attitude that it is in many cases impossible to judge the quality. Member of the audience: A dry cleaner in my home town told me that in buying a dress you will find a little piece on the seam that is easily clipped. Any merchant should not be embarrassed if you would burn that little piece and test it. The cleaner had had such an experi - ence. One of his best customers paid a big price for a dress and when they tested it, he told the lady he could not clean it. She was very indignant and she went back to the merchant, and the merchant came in to the cleaner and just had a "fit" because he had told the consumer to test the material. You have that problem, too. In talking about buying, I have always contended that the farm woman is the best buyer. She does not have the opportunity to order over the phone. I think when we go to town we do as a rule study our papers and see what is on sale and buy the brand to which we are accustomed. Member of the Audience: You speak of meat labels. Does the gov - ernment put its label on the different grades of meat? Mr. McNeill: It does. Question: If they have it in the case, what chance is there for distinguishing whether or not this label is on the meat? Mr. McNeill: I think if you will examine the outer skin of the steak you will find a blue mark. Question: Do they have different colors? Mr. McNeill: They cut the steak so they show the government label on every one, grade 1 or 2. It should show on the edge of the steak. Question: What protection do we have for the grade of meat we buy in the smaller places where the butcher does his own butchering? Mr. McNeill: You have no protection. Miss O'Brien: In the first place, you should be careful to distinguish between the inspection that is made for wholesomeness. That is one </seg>
            <seg id="p441">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION kind of stamp. Do not confuse that with the label. It is simply vol - untary with the packer if he uses the other stamp. They do not have to unless they want to, but the authorities try to get it pretty well scat - tered over the country. A great many are willing to stamp the meat. It is stamped clearly, so as it is cut, it will stay on the cut. You da not find it in the smaller communities. There is an interesting thing which just happened recently. The city of Seattle, Washington passed an ordinance requiring that certain types of meats shall be labeled with these quality grades. As far as we know that is the first time any municipality or state has gone that far on quality labeling, but d&lt;y not confuse that stamp with the one for the inspection for wholesome - ness. Mrs. Fleming: We found an interesting thing when we began the second survey. That week a number of meat dealers spoke to our representatives asking their ideas about having meat in Lincoln graded as 1, 2, and 3 quality. For instance, steak at 38&lt;J a pound is well recognized as quality meat. But we doubt if sirloin, at 17%&lt;J a pound, is first quality meat. It might be that with the help of the meat de - partment at the Agricultural College we can work out a basis. Question: When products are marked, "Below government stand - ard but good food," what do they mean? Miss O'Brien: Under the Pure Food Law three years ago they set up this sub-standard quality on canned fruits and vegetables and it simply means that while the food is perfectly wholesome, good from a nutritional standpoint, it is of such low quality that it should be called sub-standard quality. It is perfectly wholesome food, but a. sub-standard. Question: Am I perfectly safe in buying this? Miss O'Brien: As far as wholesomeness is concerned, but it is poor quality. Broken up material, variation in size, unattractive in appearance, all these various things that do not affect its wholesome - ness, but still it may be undesirable from the standpoint of quality. Member of Audience: I noticed in a serve-yourself store that butter was 35(f a pound wrapped, and unwrapped butter 33tf. As I was paying my bill, I asked the cashier what the difference between the 35# and 33&lt;J butter was. He said, "the difference is that one of them has more butterfat than the other." I do think there is a need for clerks in stores to be better informed. Just as Mrs. Fleming said, what do these department stores know about the quality of their silks? Miss Brown: Miss Fedde will give us a summary of some of the things which have been brought out in the discussion. </seg>
            <seg id="p442">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Miss Fedde: First, we were told about what is available in the way of literature and we found that the AAA in Washington has avail - able the Consumers' Guide and also the Consumers' Notes, by the Con - sumers' Division of the National Emergency Council, Washington, D. C, has available material. I would like to mention there was an excellent article in a recent issue where a man told about his reaction as he bought things. I think it is very stimulating because it sug - gests to you to watch yourself the next time you buy something. What are the things that go through your mind as you buy? The A. A. U. W. also has material. Dr. Hazel Kirk has a mimeo - graphed leaflet, and so has Evelyn Roberts, Pullman, Washington. We are hoping our own Extension Service will have something available soon. Some of the problems are: 1. What are we going to do when meat gets so high we can't buy it? This is a problem of the city more than on the farm. What are we going to do about it? 2. About the rural grocery store substituting something else when you want a certain thing they do not have or want you to get some - thing else. That is something for your group to work on. We want quality. We do not want fancy names which may mean nothing, but we want grade A, B, C, and so forth. Miss O'Brien mentioned adver - tising in her talk. When we want grade A, B, C, or whatever it is, we want quality. That is something that the rural groups can work on. 3. A survey is going on in the different Consumer Councils. There are four of these in Nebraska. You may be interested in knowing where they are: Lincoln, Omaha, North Platte, and Grand Island. That doesn't mean we can't have more. You can have one in your county. The Consumers' Councils can help you with the problems in your own county. Mr. McNeill brought out that we are faced with a poor market. Again he mentioned that we want information about quality, about our textiles, about our foods, and we will never get it until we keep on asking for it. We want our clerks to be informed. They do not know, so when we ask them a question they give remarks like the one Miss Vorhies just mentioned. They do not know. The merchants should try to get the information and demand the informa - tion. We want manufacturers to give it. We will never get it until we demand it. Let's get people over the idea that we are a "gullible" public they can sell us anything they want to. We are going to be thinking and demanding certain information. Miss O'Brien's sug - gestion is that you can work through the trade associations, and not only through the local merchant. A few stores are beginning to give this information about quality. </seg>
            <seg id="p443">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION When they huy products, they get it and they are willing to pass it on to the consumer. A point Drought out was how we need consumer organizations to deal with the merchant. We want to get the cooperation of the mer - chants. We do not want to antagonize them. We want to work with them, and not against. We will never get anywhere by antagonizing them. Another point is that there is a great deal of educational in - formation available right now. People in some of the groups do not even know that prunes are graded. There are lots of things available right now which we can teach ourselves. The point was brought out that we need better libraries in the small towns. The whole problem about meat buying is just an example. We could go down through a list of a great many things in the same way. Meat coming from the packing houses must be labeled for wholesomeness, that is, it does not come from diseased animals. Some merchants never buy A quality because the people of their com - munity can't afford to pay for A quality, and can only afford to have B or C quality. Another store buys just A. There is another problem if your local butcher does not buy meat from the wholesaler and does his own butchering. That is a problem that needs to be worked on. I think you can do it in your community. The butcher can very often tell you that this is a fine grade of meat, and that this is not quite as good. If it is not so good, you do not expect to pay so much for It. High prices are for high quality meat. These are the main points brought out this morning. Miss Brown: I want to say "Thank you" to these people who have helped us and we will now turn the meeting back to Mrs. Overton. Mrs. Overton said in closing: "This concludes another year of fine meetings. I hope you have all enjoyed them as much as I have. I wish to close with the poem I quoted to you in my opening talk: "Life is sweet just because of the friends we have made, And the things which in common we share. We want to live on, not because of ourselves But because of the people who care. It's the giving and doing for somebody else; On that, all life's splendor depends; And the joys of this life, when you sum them all up, Are found in the making of friends." </seg>

            <seg id="p446">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE PART n MOTHERS' VACATION CAMPS There were three Mothers' Vacation Camps held in Nebraska during the summer of 1934. The first one was at the Chadron State Park, June 21 to 24, the second was at Horky's Park near Crete, July 24 to 27, and the last was at the Agricultural School at Curtis, August 2 to 5. The Chadron State Park made a delightful place for a camp be - cause the grounds are attractive and the cabins are comfortable. The beds in these cabins have good mattresses. That means much to mothers on vacation. Mrs. A. E. Speer, in charge of the State Park, was a gracious hostess and did all she could to make the campers enjoy their vacation. Mary-Ellen Brown, Leona Davis and Mrs. N. W. Gaines arrived at camp in time to have things ready when the campers began to arrive on Thursday afternoon. Preparations had been made for about 30 to 35 campers, but the number kept increasing until there were over 50 enrolled. The first afternoon was spent getting settled in the cabins and in getting acquainted with each other. After supper Mrs. Gaines led the community singing-and then began reading the book, "As the Earth Turns", written by Gladys Hasty Carroll. Campers enjoy having Mrs. Gaines read a book to them for she omits parts and makes comments on sections as she goes along. Mrs. Gaines divided the reading of the book into three different sections. She read the second section during one of the Friday morning periods and then completed it after break - fast Sunday morning. This book was an appropriate one for camp because it dealt with everyday farm life. The campers at Chadron brought their own bedding and dishes. Mrs. J. T. Baker, who cooks for park campers, prepared the meals for the mothers. Arrangements were made so that each woman washed her own dishes, but this was made into a game each time, so no one minded the dishes. The campers enjoyed Mrs. Baker's meals. It was interesting not to have to plan the meals and also not to know what was to be served. That is one of the joys of going to a Mothers' Camp. The period following breakfast, while the campers are still at the table, is one of the happiest periods of the day. When women are home they have to go to work after the breakfast is served, but not so in camps, so they sit around the table for awhile. The first morning each camper told where she went to school as a girl. There was much merriment the second morning as each told of her most embarrassing moment. Sunday morning each gave a favorite quotation. </seg>
            <seg id="p447">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION The women of Scotts Bluff county had requested the making of hand tooled leather articles as the handicraft work, so Leona Davis taught the campers how to make purses and other articles. Following the camp the women in Scotts Bluff county have had their home agent, Mary Mae Holmes, continue the demonstrations on tooling leather, so many additional club members have since learned how to make tooled leather objects. Part of the forenoon on Friday and Saturday and some of the afternoon Friday was used for the leather work. After lunch each day a quiet hour was planned so the campers could take naps, read or visit as they pleased. Women who wished to brought their bathing suits and enjoyed going into the swimming pool later in the afternoons. On Thursday evening the Cloverleaf Club entertained the campers by giving "The Family Album". This was thoroughly enjoyed and made a happy evening for the campers. On Saturday forenoon the campers worked with Mary-Ellen Brown on a "True-Doubtful-False" round table discussion. The statements used for this are found later in this report. Mrs. R. O. Williams of Kearney, a representative of the State Farm Bureau Federation, gave a talk Saturday afternoon about the work the Federation is doing. Following this talk, the people of Chadron came with cars and together with the cars in camp, the women were all taken to the State Teachers College at Chadron for an afternoon tea. The visitors were shown through the girls dormitory after which a delightful program was given and tea was served. The dormitory is a building which is a credit to Nebraska and several of the women said they wished they could start to school again. If possible, they were going to send their daughters there to school. In the evening Saturday the group went up on the hill for a bonfire. The women were divided into groups and a contest was held in which the groups demonstrated laughing, crying, giving charades, baby crying, Indian war dance, folk dances, a "schul", and a memory song which consisted of Grandmother's Dream. The evening closed with taps. On Saturday preparations were made for the church service to be held on Sunday. The past and present county chairmen had charge of the service. The special speaker for the occasion was Professor E. L. Rouse. His talk was especially appropriate for a Sunday morning service in a Mother's Camp. The home people had been invited to come for this open meeting which began at 11 o'clock. Mrs. N. W. Gaines had arranged sheets containing three-part music for Steal Away, The Old Rugged Cross, and a choir response. At </seg>
            <seg id="p448">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE different times throughout the camp she had been training the campers on how to sing these songs In the church service. Such training made these songs mean more to the campers than before.

Burt county had the largest delegation with twenty members. They came in a truck and the women had much fun, although it was a hot and dusty ride. Campers are out for a change and a good time and they surely have it. This camp began on Tuesday afternoon and closed on Friday after - noon. The program here was similar to the one at the Chadron State Park except these campers made hobby books instead of doing the hand tooled leather purses, for they had tooled leather in a previous camp. Mrs. E. E. Hartz of Roca, who had attended the National Farm Homemakers* Guild meeting in Chicago, gave a talk on that meeting. Mrs. Howard F. Capwell gave the talk on the work of the Farm Bu - reau Federation. On Wednesday afternoon the campers were taken by Mr. Horfcy for a launch ride on the Blue river. Then on Thursday afternoon the Crete business men took the campers for a ride with time given to visit the girls new dormitory at Doane College. Mrs. Bashie 'fully Brown of "Lincoln entertained the women the last evening by reading short stories. Mrs. G. Perry of Exeter gave an original poem on the camp. The closing talk for the camp was given by Mr. N. W. Gaines. The camp at Curtis began Thursday afternoon August 2. Mr. and Mrs. Douthit and Mrs. Agnes Campbell did their part well as host and hostesses in welcoming the campers to the girls* dormitory at the School of Agriculture. The women had comfortable beds and the spacious living rooms made a good place for the meetings. On Friday afternoon the business men of Curtis provided cars to take the campers for a ride to the canyon gulch and then to Aggie Land for a picnic supper. Mr. Douthit arranged for the campers to make a tour of the campus on Saturday morning. Miss Leona Davis entertained the campers that evening by reading short stories. The county chairmen had charge of the Sunday service and Mr. N. W. Gaines preached the sermon. The statements used for the round table discussions were as follows: Timely Topics for Discussion Some of these statements are true, some are doubtful, and others are false.

The training of judging teams has been one of the important activities of the 4-H Club work. The Home Economics Section of Organized Agriculture has considered it a worthy use of $75.00 of their allowance to foster this work. Each year an amount has been allowed on the expenses for the trip to the National Club Congress for the eight high scoring individuals who won championship in Home Economics Judg - ing at the State Fair. The eight girls who represented the four judging teams this year are as follows: Baked Foods Helen Pascoe, Dodge County Margaret Pascoe, Dodge County Canned Foods Dorothy Lemke, Saunders County Helen Wolfe, Saunders County Clothing Mary Tree, Lancaster County Genelle Jenkins, Lancaster County Girls' Room Frances Meier, Cass County Virginia Trivaly, Cass County At the National Club Congress in Chicago these girls entered judg - ing contests which aim to train girls to recognize standards in quality, to weigh values of importance, and to give their reasons for their placings. We are very proud of the record these girls made. In fact, we are proud of the record made by the entire delegation representing Ne - braska in the 4-H contests. With forty-three states represented in eight judging contests, Nebraska placed three firsts, one third, two sevenths, one eighth, and one tenth, and received twenty-five ribbons with twenty-eight entries in Home Economics exhibits.

My sincere thanks again. : . Sincerely, (Signed) HELEN PASCOE. A STORY OP MY TRIP Even though I had experienced some of the thrills of the National Club Congress of 1933 and knew what to expect,- 1 was one of the most excited and happiest persons to board the "Corn King", the train which left Omaha at 7:15 P. M. Saturday night, December 1, bound for Chicago. Following instructions given to us by Mr. L. I. Frisbie, our state leader, we spent the remainder of the evening in recreation in the lounging car. Upon arriving in Chicago, the Harrison Hotel being our home for the week, we breakfasted promptly. We attended Central Church at Orchestra Hall on Michigan Avenue on Sunday morning where Rev. Frederick F. Shannon, one of Chicago's outstanding ministers, presided. In the afternoon we went on a fifty-mile bus tour. The places of interest to us were the "loop", the "black belt", Chinatown, Lake Michi - gan, Washington and Lincoln Parks, Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs, the Chicago river, the only river in the world that runs backward, and Lake Shore and Sheridan Drives. We were conducted through the Chicago University Chapel which contains beautiful wood carvings from all over the world. This building was presented to the University by John D. Rockefeller at a cost of two million dollars. Services Sunday evening were held at the Goodman Theatre where numerous renowned speakers were present. </seg>
            <seg id="p455">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION Monday was "International Livestock Show Day". The various judging contests were held at the International Livestock Exposition We were delighted to see fine exhibits of home economics and live - stock. We were guests for lunch at the Stock Yard Inn. through the courtesy of Sears, Roebuck and Company. We continued our review of the exhibits and at 3:40. the two battalions were taken to the Wilson Auditorium where we were entertained by motion pictures and vaude - ville acts. Mr. Wilson was our host at dinner at his plant and alter the banquet, we returned to the Auditorium where he presented the Wilson awards, college scholarships, to three boys. At this time Helen Hicks, Charlie Grimm, Red Grange, Shirley Ann Johnson, Chick Evans and Hal Totten, all well known sport celebrities, appeared. Upon returning to the International Livestock Exposition, Mr. R. A. Turner of the University Department of Agriculture presented the various winners of the national contests. Tuesday was "Swine and Industry Day". On Tuesday morning, the girls were taken to the Field Museum, which is one of the finest natural history educational institutions in the world. Things ot especial interest were the pre-historic exhibits, and the Hall of Stone Age Men. Here were eight groups of the stone age man dating from 250,000 years ago, life-like in size with perfected details; this is the first group of exhibits to be shown in any museum. Our next stop was the Planetarium, where a demonstration of the stars and their movements was given by Miss Maude Bennat, Assistant Director. The Chicago Mail Order Company was our host for lunch. Follow - ing this, there was a fashion promenade showing suitable apparel for the school girl. At 6 P. M. we joined nearly 1500 other club members at the thirteenth annual banquet given in the grand ballroom of the Stevens Hotel. This ballroom is the largest in the world. "The Spirit of American Music", a musical drama, was presented for our enter - tainment. Since Wednesday was "Manufacturers' Day" we toured the Mc- Cormick Works and International Harvester Company plants. The making of twine through all of its stages was interesting. We ate lunch as guests of the International Harvester Company. Following lunch, we were guests of the International Livestock Exposition at the horse show where we witnessed a polo game. For the first time, the National 4-H Style Revue, under the direction of Miss Allegra Wilkens, a Nebraska leader, was presented where girls from all states </seg>
            <seg id="p456">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE modeled their costumes. A trip to the Museum of Science and Industry proved most interest - ing with the feature exhibit "Five Thousand Years of Farm Tools". To descend into the model of a true coal mine which demonstrated the formation, mining and preparation for market of coal and its products was a novel experience. On Thursday, which was "Educational Day", we were conducted on an educational tour through the various departments of Montgom - ery Ward and Company and later taken to the Edgewater Beach Hotel for lunch. A novel program was provided for our entertainment. The latter part of the afternoon we spent at Marshall, Field &amp; Company. The ideal of this store is to be satisfied with nothing short of perfection and we felt this to be true. The day ended with a Dutch treat dinner and a final party in the ballroom of the Auditorium Hotel. Awards and cups were presented to the winners at this time. The Nebraska delegation, disappointed that it was over, but glad to have so many happy memories, boarded the "Portland Rose" and we arrived home, tired but happy. </seg>

The dates and places for the meetings selected were: Harrisburg Nov. 1 9 Sidney Nov. 20 Osh k osh Nov. 2 1 Bridgeport ...Nov. 2 2 Chadron Nov. 23 Harrison , Nov. 2 4 The programs used in the six places were much the same. The general meeting began at 10 o'clock. After C. W. Watkins talked on The Shelterbelt Program, the group divided for a men's session and a women's session. Following the noon period the groups came to - gether again for a joint session, followed by separate sessions again from 2:50 to 4:00. At Chadron and some of the other places the women added a new feature which was popular. It was the serving of a tea. This gave the women attending an opportunity to visit with each other and to become better acquainted. The Dawes county project clubs prepared an exhibit of the work they had been doing in their clubs.

            <seg id="p461">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION SALESMANSHIP IX EVERYDAY LIFE Salesmanship in Everyday Life was the topic used by Mrs. Burl Hornbeck in her afternoon talk given in the women's section. She -did not have her talk written so the following has been prepared from notes taken by Miss Mary-Ellen Brown during Mrs. Hornbeck's talk. Mrs. Hornbeck opened her talk by saying she had listened to a series of talks given by Dr. C. S. Tolles on salesmanship. She wanted to pass on to us some of the ideas gained from him. She said she had been interested in watching each woman's personal salesman - ship of her self as she came into the room. The way we walk impresses others with what we think of ourselves, so how we walk is important. She then asked all of those who believed in luck to raise their hands. No hands were raised. She said she did not believe there was such a thing as luck. Accidents do not happen, they occur. Many of them are the result of foolish thinking or bad judgment. Mrs. Hornbeck then told of an accident she had experienced. She was driving quite a long ways from home to give some talks. A sign board told her she could shorten the distance about thirty miles by taking a short cut. The road was oiled and slippery for it had been raining. As she came near the top of a hill she suddenly applied the brakes; she and the car went into the ditch. The car was badly dam - aged, she was bruised and had sprained ankles. The result was that she could not keep her engagements, there were doctor's bills, and she suffered much while in the hospital. She said that the accident did not just happen, it was the result of bad thinking. Such things happen as the outcome of poor thinking. What is salesmanship? It is the ability to make other people think as we want them to think. Mrs. Hornbeck said she could be a good salesman if she wanted to work at it hard enough. She said she was lazy, although to us she did not seem at all that way. She said she would start out, bravely resolved to be what she wanted to be, she would work and strive toward the goal for quite a while, then would get tired and quit. She said we could look the way we want to if we have the will to do it. Unless we are lazy we will keep our weight where it ought to be or we will build ourselves up to weight if we are below. If we love to eat and can always find alibis for eating we can - not hope to be as attractive as we might be. We need to be judicious about eating, sleeping and exercise. There are two types of people as judged, by the way they wake up in the morning. There is one group that wakes up with a groan and feeling sorry for themselves. The other group say to them - selves, "I am feeling fine this morning. It is time to get up. There </seg>
            <seg id="p462">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE is an interesting day before me." Then they meet the family with a. smile and cheer up those who come near. One good, exercise Mrs. Hornbeck suggested for the women to try - when they first wake up was to sit up in bed and exercise as though rowing a heavy boat. How do you shake hands? Is your handshake cold and clammy and lacking in personality, or is it warm and friendly? A sincere - friendly shake is one way of helping others to have a good opinion of us. How do you look at people? Do you look at them squarely as though you were proud of yourself? Our own opinion of ourselves is important, for it is written all over us. One day Mrs. Hornbeck and her son were sitting in a car on the street and were watching people as they passed. Finally her son asked her what made the difference in people. "It is not the clothes," he said, "for there goes a young woman dressed in a simple inexpensive gown and still she looks like a million dollars." After he had sat thinking about it for a time' he said, "I know what it is, Mother. It is just what people think of themselves." It is true, we are just what, we think we are. "As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he." When you call up a number on the telephone, how do you speak? Is your voice one that is a good salesman for you? Is your tone mon - otonous or is it cheerful and happy? It was interesting to hear Mrs. Hornbeck tell how she dismissed agents at the door. She would not discuss with them but simply told them she was not interested. If they tried to continue with their sales talk, she would repeat that she was not interested. Doctors, ministers and lawyers need to be salesmen. Even in married life there should be salesmanship on the part of both the hus - band and wife. Salesmanship is a game and we can get much happiness from it if we play it successfully. If John does not do his part to - ward selling himself to his family, Mary may be thinking, "I wish I had looked around a little further before getting married." If Mary forgets to have a permanent or does not use cosmetics wisely, and lets her hair and clothes become untidy in appearance, she will not have a good opinion of herself and neither will her family. Keeping one's mental poise happy and serene is important. Salesmanship is important in the home. Even the children need to be trained to be popular and to get along with other children. Mrs. Hornbeck then told of an experience she had in selling some white roosters she had on the farm. She was more than successful, for the hotel man ordered four or five times as many as she had for- </seg>
            <seg id="p463">NEBRASKA HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION sale and after she returned home she wired him that she could not fill the order. She had used the four points she explained to the group which were helpful in salesmanship. First was the necessity of getting a favorable reaction. She em - phasized the importance of not letting the person to whom you are trying to make a sale get on the defensive. It never pays to get angry, when trying to sell, for if one does, she is whipped at once. Create a favorable response. The second step is to create a desire for what is. being sold. The Third step was to have the person come to a decision. Many salesmen talk too much. She gave some good examples of where this had been done. Fourth was the final purchase. Mrs. Hornbeck's talk was enjoyed by the women, for she gave - fitting illustrations throughout her talk which were not possible to re - write from notes. Perhaps what has been given here will help those; who heard Mrs. Hornbeck's talk to recall it. </seg>

Banning, Union Secretary E. H. Hoppert, Lincoln The sixty-fifth annual convention of the Nebraska Horticultural Society met in the Auditorium, Agricultural Hall, of the Agricultural College, Lincoln, Nebraska. It was called to order at 9:30 A. M. by the Secretary, Mr. E. H. Hoppert of Lincoln, who acted as chairman in the absence of Mr. W. B. Banning, Union. MR. HOPPERT: The first number on the program this morning is Mr. Ernst Herminghaus, Landscape Architect, Lincoln who will give us an illustrated talk on Planning and Planting the State Capitol Grounds. I am sure you will be interested in what he has to say. Mr. Herminghaus is the one who has had charge of the planning and planting and subsequent care of the capitol grounds. In spite of the fact that the year 1934 was one of the worst in the history of the state, the losses due to the heat and drought were only about two per cent, a very- remarkable achievement. Mr. Herminghaus. </seg>
            <seg id="p468">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE PLANNING AND PLANTING THE STATE CAPITOL GROUNDS By E. H. Herminghaus When the landscape archietect was retained by the capitol com - liission, he found that many things had been done in the arrangment of the grounds that usually come within the scope of his profession,, in fact, all he was called upon to do was to prepare a planting plan. From the point of view of the landscape architect, the arrangment of side walks and drives and other items were in error. In the first place, it was unfortunate that the capitol commission deemed it wise to eliminate the retainiing wall which surrounded the entire grounds. This was one of Mr. Goodhue's masterly ideas; it gave boundary to the grounds, it provided another horizontal line to the design and above all it provided a barrier which protected the lawn from trespassing. It was impossible to convince the commission that a hedge was nec - essary. Now the grounds are already showing the effects of people tramping over them and the results will be more serious in the future. Let it be said here, that the foundation of the -planting scheme of the entire grounds is the lawn. Without a fine well kept turf, the con - ception fails. It was a mistake to make the driveway at the north entrance wide enough for two cars. It fits in with the colossal scale of the building, but unfortunately it also provides a parking space that no amount of policing seems sufficient to eliminate. We have the unusual effect of fine concolor firs which cost the state ninety dollars each being hidden or masked by automobiles. The driveway should have been one car wide to eliminate any possible parking. There should have been no grass parking between curb and side walk. With the very large amount of car parking about the capitol, there is too much tramping over the grass strip to ever hope to main - tain. Again the pitch in grade from sidewalk to curb makes it dif - ficult to water thoroughly. The sidewalk should have been placed at the curb, then the amount of lawn could have been added to the main mass. There seems to be no way of avoiding eventually the sub - stitution of lime stone chip for this grass strip. The grounds were originally graded in accordance with the pro - posed walls. When they were eliminated no change was made to correlate with entirely different conditions. Thus we have steep sloped banks that are hard to maintaiin and decidedly unattractive. And finally the Lincoln Monument at the west entrance should have been moved off the grounds. As it stands, it completely masks the west entrance facade. : </seg>
            <seg id="p469">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY The landscape architect could not correct these errors, he could not get the commissions sanction to plant a hedge where the wall should have been. He had to conceive a great lawn leading up to the building with planting against the building and the distribution of rather small trees upon the lawn so as to produce vistas as one looks at the building. The planting against the building consisted of evergreens. This proved the most suitable material not only for contrast with the stone of the building but also for its year around effect. But they had to be chosen with care on account of the smoke nuisance that exists in Lincoln. Cedars, junipers, Colorado spruce and Concolor firs are more adapted to conditions of smoke than any other evergreens. In fact, other types can not be used. Such fine trees as sugar maple, oak, linden, birch and elm were used on the lawn. The plans were all studied in elevation. Sizes were taken from the plan and then material was selected to meet that requirement. When the material was found it was tagged, and the various nurseries bid on that particular material. There were 167 large trees and ever - greens varying in size from 8 ft. to 30 ft. in height. They were all moved with a large ball of earth with modern tree moving equipment. The Concolor firs were found on the Lydick farm near Bertha and Craig, Nebraska. Harrison Nurseries at York, furnished Colo, spruce, and sugar maple, and some red oaks. Plumfield Nurseries of Fremont furnished some red cedars. Marshall Nurseries of Arlington had red oaks and tulip trees. At Sonderegger's at Beatrice we found many large cedars, some sugar maple, all the birches and lindens. Woods Brothers Nurseries had the large elms and Geneva Nurseries of Geneva, Nebr., supplied the large pin oaks. Some cedars were located at Williams Nurseries at Lincoln and the rest of the large cedars were found on private places in Lincoln and Omaha. i The large tree contracts went to Marshall Nurseries of Arlington and Byrd Nurseries of Omaha. The smaller shrubs and evergreens were furnished and planted by Nebraska and Williams Nurseries of Lincoln. Excellent care was given the planting during the summer. Tho we experienced the worst summer in the memory of man, only one large tree was lost. Of the smaller stock, the Mugho pine alone suf - fered but they suffered all over the state and adjoining states. Much care must yet be exercised to maintain the trees because the second and third years are the difficult ones for a large tree moved with a ball of earth. Generally there is enough sap, vitality and strength </seg>

However, sufficient new root growth must take place the first year to carry on. Whether that occurred in this last disasterous year remains to be seen. Discussion Question: Would you please tell the late comers where the gentleman lives who grows these gorgeous Concolor firs? Answer: He lives near Bertha, Nebraska. First go to Craig, and find out there where Bertha is located. Mr. Lyrick's place is just six miles east of Bertha. Question: I would like to know what happened to Mr. Lydick's asthma. Answer: He is still living and in fine health. I urge you all to see his place as it is just unbelievable. He has Concolor firs that are blue. The best time to see these is in June. MR. BANNING: Very sorry that I was a little late this morning but I think I heard most of the talk. We are very glad to have such a large attendance as we have this morning. It shows an interest. I think everyone should be interested. There are still many farms that have no trees or shrubs about the buildings to break the winds and provide shade. Now, the next gentleman on the program is going to talk on the subject that we have heard about more or less and read about in the paper, The Nebraska Shelterbelt. We are very glad to listen to Mr. Clayton W. Watkins at this time. THE SHELTERBELT IN NEBRASKA Clayton W. Watkins The program now being organized by the U. S. Forest Service for establishing strip shelterbelts through the agricultural sections of six plains states should be of interest to residents of Nebraska. This tree planting program, although larger than any previous undertaking, is only a planned expansion of what has been going on in this state since the beginning of its development. Nebraska has been trans - formed, almost in one generation, from open prairie to one of the most productive agricultural states. Trees have played an important part in this development; not in bringing a great deal in direct returns but in furnishing shade, shelter and fuel for those who were far - sighted enough to see the agricultural possibilities in the state. There are people living yet who remember eastern Nebraska when it had very few trees except along streams, but today even the uplands of this section are well broken up with groves and shelterbelts. The early settlers here came from states to the east where trees were quite </seg>
            <seg id="p471">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY common and naturally the lack of shade and shelter caused these people to attempt planting around their homes. In fact many of the covered wagons that were dragged through the Missouri River con - tained bundles of cuttings or small seedlings to be used in starting windbreaks or groves around new homes. If records were available they would show that many of the fine groves of trees through Ne - braska now are the result of stock brought here by ox teams when Ne - braska was being settled. Nebraska is internationally known for its interest and success in tree planting. It is true that some of the trees that were planted did not grow because wind and drouth had their effect on plant life then just as they have now. Further, there was very little information in those days on hardiness of varieties or cultural methods necessary. Yet in spite of these handicaps there is ample evidence of the results from much of this early planting. We should appreciate this development and give credit to our pioneer settlers for their faith in the future of Nebraska. In times like these we need a little more of the old-time faith and spirit which together developed the moral fibre that char - acterized those who pioneered this state. The plan for establishing this gigantic shelterbelt is not yet com - plete. However, fundamentally it is not a fantastic dream but a sound practical program not only to start trees but to give them the best possible chance to grow. This will involve a soil cultural pro - gram based on the best information available and applied to the locality ■where the work is being done. In addition every known method of moisture conservation will be employed in order to store in the soil all precipitation (summer and winter) because for any plant to grow there must be moisture for its roots. This soil culture and water conservation program will call for fallowing the strips to be planted with a lister or similar implement and these will follow the contours of the land even though such a method makes very short rows. Ter - racing of slopes that might otherwise wash or allow a heavy run-off will be important function in some sections. Snowfences will be set up on difficult o,r exposed sites as a temporary measure to hold winter moisture. To some these may appear as extreme measures, but if we continue to farm all of Nebraska's agricultural area these same meas - ures will, before many years, be a part of the agricultural program for the production of ordinary grain crops. In other words, we cannot continue the exploitation of soil or continue to permit this loss of mois - ture through soil erosion, drainage ditches and careless farming prac - tices, and still expect the same production that has in the past been possible when subsoil moisture stored up over long periods was avail - able. Annual precipitation is limited in this section; in fact, there is probably not more than one year out of fifteen when rainfall exceeds the crop needs. After the experience of 1934 it is unnecessary to men- </seg>
            <seg id="p472">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tion much about the other extremes. Therefore, to grow any crop in an area where we know from experience that the limiting factor is moisture, it is good business to begin with a program that will con - serve all that nature sees fit to send. The growing of trees is not unlike, nor any more difficult than the growing of other crops. The same principles that apply to one will apply to the other — good husbandry practices. . • During this present drouth period trees that were planted on well-pre - pared soil and given regular cultivation lived through with very little damage. As a matter of fact, an acre of trees requires less moisture to live and grow than many of our common grain crops. Therefore, this shelterbelt program where soil preparation may be carried on for one or even two years for the purpose of storing up moisture and then planted with a definite program of cultivation can be made successful. The purpose of this planting even though it is on a large scale is the same as that of smaller windbreaks that have been planted or are being planted around farms in the state to divert wind and check its velocity. What effect a hundred narrow shelterbelts, one planted each mile in a strip one hundred miles wide,! will have on wind velocity is not definitely known, because no such planting has ever been made. It is known that such a planting will have a very beneficial effect on the area within and adjacent to the belt. The question as to how soon a planting of this kind will be effective is difficult to answer except to compare it with smaller plantations of the past. A windbreak including rapid growing trees properly planted and cared for will offer some protection within five years. Railroad snowfences consisting of two rows of trees planted in various parts of Nebraska in 1929 and 1930 are now serving in place of wooden fences. Therefore, It is safe to assume that within a period of from eight to ten years these shelters will be effective. The plan which will be followed in developing one of these in - dividual strips will be first to prepare the ground ag previously dis - cussed, together with the fencing of the area against livestock. Next a careful selection of planting stock of hardy varieties including native trees and shrubs wherever possible. The outside row on either side will be a low spreading shrub which will grow up quickly and serve as a snowtrap for the belt itself. Next a row of hardy evergreens such as red cedar or possibly ponderosa pine. Then a row of rapid growing broadleaf trees, and the interior of the plantation will be hardy, tall - growing varieties. This belt when complete will have the low surface winds checked from the outside by the evergreens and the shrubs, and the central part of the windbreak will give height to slow up and divert winds for a greater distance. The strip fenced for this planting will </seg>
            <seg id="p473">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY include sufficient area to leave some ten to twelve feet on either side between the last row of trees and the fence, and the trees within the belt will be spaced sufficiently wide to permit cultivation and to elim - inate the danger of serious root competition. A belt of this kind with low growing trees on the outside together with the strip of cleanly - cultivated land between the trees and the adjacent fields will not effect crops by root interference, but this crop will have the beneficial influence of protection against the drying out of soil and the mech - anical damage of wind These shelterbelts even though they will be given regular cultiva - tion as long as their growth will permit will serve as bird and game cover. This use, of course, will be of minor importance by comparison, but certainly will serve to replace brush lands, etc., which until they were removed by the progress of civilization served for these same purposes. To the individual farmer game may not be of great im - portance, but to the state as a whole it is very important and we have no moral right even though it may be legal to so handle our lands that the propagation of game is very difficult and in some cases impossible. Every community in Nebraska from east to west or from north to south now has plantings which demonstrate that trees can be grown. These are often small isolated groves or windbreaks which have been subjected to the rigors of a climate which we must accept as normal and have still made a very creditable showing. A mass planting such as that proposed in this shelterbelt will have a decided advantage over individual plantations because each strip will be a self-protecting unit and will more nearly approach natural forest conditions. It can - not be denied, however, that many of the early plantations in this section were failures, partly because of improper or no cultivation, or damage from livestock and in many cases a poor choice of species. This is not a criticism of those who attempted early tree planting because there was very little plains tree planting information avail - able at that time. In fact these failures have furnished a great deal of the information now serving as a basis on which this present pro - gram is being built. i The strips to be planted will be about eight rods wide following the half section rather than the section lines, thereby eliminating the posslblle interference with highways. This method of location will also give each quarter section a part of the shelter. The strips will run east and west or north and south depending on the prevailing winds in the particular locality. No farmer will be required to permit this strip to cross his land; his land will be included only after he is convinced that it will be an asset to the farm and after some form of contract or lease is drawn. The strip will be fenced to keep out all livestock. Local labor will be hired to construct the fence and prepare </seg>
            <seg id="p474">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the ground. With present moisture conditions it will probably be necessary to fallow these strips for at least one season before planting is started. This fallowing will be done with a lister rather than a plow as a moisture conservation measure and as a check against wind erosion. The trees to be used will be selected with the greatest care and these will vary with localities and sites. They must not only be hardy but also be of a type that will serve best as windbreaks. This group for Nebraska will include the following: red cedar, ponderosa pine, Austrian pine, mulberry, Russian olive, Caragana, buffalo berry, Chinese elm, American elm, ash, cottonwood, honey locust, wild plum, choke cherry, hackberry, burr oak, and black walnut. The fact that this proposed belt is to run from Canada to northern Texas does not necessarily mean that the strips will run north and south. In many places it will be necessary and advisable to run them east and west. These tree belts will be made to nt the community through which they run rather than attempting to make the community fit the tree belt. The purpose of this undertaking is to locate and de - velop shelterbelts that will serve best in resisting prevailing winds. In other words, there is no "cut and dried" plan or checkerboard lay - out which will have to be followed. To say now what this series of tree belts would or would not do toward checking the forces of natural elements, which the people of the Middle West realize are actually threatening the foundation of agriculture in this section, could be no more than a guess based on the results of smaller windbreaks. That something must be done to - ward checking wind and water erosion and in conserving the moisture that falls and runs out of the state is not a guess if we expect the soil of Nebraska, which is its only source of income, to continue production. Discussion Question: How many miles of your 10 rod strip will your six million trees make? Answer: About 160. Question: How many are allotted to Nebraska? Answer: 30 are allotted to Nebraska. MR. BANNING: I am sure we have all enjoyed Mr. Watkin's talk and from his talk we have been able to get a different idea of this shelter belt.

            <seg id="p475">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY time we are going to have that subject discussed under the heading. Trials and Tribulations in My Rose Garden by Charles Andrews. TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS IN' MY ROSE GARDEN Chas. W. Andrews, Arlington, Nebr. In preparing this paper, I am taking into consideration my experi - ence with several rose gardens besides my own garden. I will list and comment upon a few climbing roses. Then I will classify the bushes as Superhardy, Hardy, and Semi-hardy. The Super - hardy do not require any winter protection, the Hardy should have some, and the Semi-hardy must have winter protection. And, as there is more interest in the planting of the Semi-hardy class, I shall say more about this group. Climbing Roses Four of the hardiest. Excels a (Red Dorothy Perkins) Extensively - planted on banks, slopes, on trellis, porch and arbor; very good. Pink Dorothy Perkins, good. White Dorothy Perkins, best white. Crimson Rambler, an old favorite red; foliage mildews some. Semi-hardy. Very good flowers. For best results train them up - right on post or wall as a pillar rose. The pillar method should be used more with climbing roses in Nebraska. Paul's Scarlet, very popular. Cl. American Beauty,' rose, good. Mary Wallace, light pink, pillar only. Dr. W. Van Vleet, cameo-pink fading to flesh white, good. Four Old Timers. Not sold much, alright for variety. Seven Sisters, pink; hardy. Baltimore Belle, cream; hardy. Prairie Queen, pink, hardy. Tausendchon (Thousand Beauties) vari-colored, fairly hardy. Strong growers. Wichurian (Memorial) Glossy leaves and clusters of starry white flowers. Excellent ground cover. Hardy. American Pillar, red with white eye, yellow stamens, red hips; trellis, fences or ground cover. Fairly hardy. Silver Moon, semi - double pure white with yellow stamens. Moderately hardy. New climbers some are trying. Blaze, (patented) red. Mrs. Arthur Curtis James (Golden Climber) (patented). From what I know of the above two, I do not recommend for this state. New Dawn (patented) sport of Dr. Van Feet, pink; trial only. Mme. Gregoire Staechelin (Spanish Beauty) large pink, trial only. Superhardy Roses. Shrub roses, used mostly in shrub borders. Prairie Rose (Rose setigera) wide spreading shrub, fine for slopes and </seg>
            <seg id="p476">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE thickets. Meadow Rose (Rosa blanda) a wild rose. Redleaf Rose (Rosa rubrlfolia) deep red leaves in sijmmer, red stems and fruit in winter. Hugonis Rose, yellow blooms in spring, attractive shrub, very good. Persian Yellow, the old fashioned little yellow rose. Moss Roses, attract little attention nowadays. Single Rugosa Rose (Rosa rugosa) dark green foliage, single pink or white flowers, orange red fruit. Rngosa hybrids, (everblooming) F. J. Grootendorst, red rambler cluster bloom, popular. Hansa, red, fairly popular. Sir Thomas Lipton, white, Anthony "Waterer, semi-double pink. Conrad F. Meyer, silvery pink. Gravero, pink. Hardy Roses Hybrid Perpetual Roses. Hybrid Remontant Roses would be a better name. They grow higher than Hybrid Tea Roses and should be placed in beds by themselves or in front of shrubs. Not so many planted as in the past because of their size and the increased fiopularity of the Hybrid Tea Roses. Excellent crop of bloom In June, with intermit - tent bloom thru the summer, and then increasing a little in the fall. Heaviest bloom in June. We have had some other good varieties, but I consider the following outstanding. Frau Karl Druschki (Snow Queen) large free blooming white, popular. Paul Neyron, large pink, sometimes called cabbage rose, good. General Jacqueminot (Jack Rose) red, an old favorite. Mrs. John Laing, a good pink. Prince Camile De Rohan, dark velvety red, sometimes called Black Prince erroneously. J. B. Clark, a good large red. Polyantha or Baby Rambler Roses. Dwarf bushes, small flowers in clusters, continuous bloomers. Look best in beds all of one variety together. They are seldom of any importance for cutting. Red Baby Rambler (Mme. Norbert Levavasseur) good clear light red, my favorite. Pink Baby Rambler (Ellen Poulsen). White Baby Rambler (Katharina Xeimet). Ideal, dark red, holds color well and some like it. I have found kicks on it as a tiresome color and feel that way about it myself. Cecil Brunner (The Sweetheart Rose) tender frail bush, tiny pink buds, nice to have a- few. Baby Tausendchon, vari-colored pink to white, good in spring and fall. Miss Edith Cavell, brilliant red. I like it. Gruss an Aachen, salmon. Ernst Herming - haus says these were fine in beds at the Capitol last summer. I had a couple and didn't like them, and must say that we should see Poly - anthas in beds before we condemn them entirely. Golden Salmon, reddish-orange. Similar experience. Gloria Mundi, brilliant orange - scarlet, new and promising. </seg>
            <seg id="p477">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY Grass an Teplitz. Hybrid China or Bengal Rose. Generally listed as a Hybrid Tea. Hardier than most H. T. roses. It grows vigorous like a Hybrid Perpetual. Large semi-double good red roses in clusters and blooms continuously. Not as good for cutting as H. T. roses. Would not plant with H. T. roses in the same bed, but in beds or hedges of themselves for show. A wonderful decorative rose that every one can plant several of for outstanding effect. Hastings, David City and Blair parks have large beds of Teplitz. Semi-Hardy Roses. Hybrid Tea Roses (H.T.'s) The everblooming cutting roses. When many people say 'ever blooming roses' they are referring to H.T.'s. They bloom from June to into November. The heaviest crops are in June and October. While this class requires covering for winter protection and better care in summer gives better results, the work does not seem so tiresome because of the compensation of bloom we receive. Compared with shrubs, we get several 'years of bloom' in just one year. This class doesn't grow high, because we keep cutting them. Selection of location. When planting H. T. roses it is best to set aside an area for a rose garden. You may not plant so many any one year, but you are very likely to add more. Many people wish they had reserved a larger area for a rose garden. Do not plant any other class of roses with your H.T.'s in the same beds. Beds should be in the open, free of tree roots. The soil should be good enough to raise good vegetables. They do not take much room. Most people plant them 18 inches apart in the row. I have my rows 2 ft. apart, three rows in a bed; some plant rows 18 inches apart. Keep line of sod at edge of bed 8 to 12 inches away from roses. Selection of varieties. Some of the best rose gardens in this state contain only 12 to 18 varieties. In a rose garden of any size a better effect can be secured by grouping several of one variety together for the best color effect. Also many people like to raise several of one variety to have plenty of the same variety for picking. Mrs. Ward, Etoille de Hollande, Talisman and Columbia are some of the favorites for this purpose. And, the Radiance family, because of their hardiness and continuous blooming, especially good summer blooming, are fa - vorites with many. Kaiserin, our best white, should be added in beds to bring out a better color effect of the whole bed scheme. Many people lose money buying cheap plants. Some of the claims made for plants in some of our national magazine articles and/or advertisements does not always agree with the results obtained in this section. I would recommend to stay to tested varieties for this sec- </seg>
            <seg id="p478">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tion, unless you intend to experiment. I recommend to our garden clubs to work out some definite scheme to stress the importance of tried varieties. We must have experimenters, but beginners make poor experimenters. Some people who have poor success in garden - ing quit. It is the fellow who is successful who keeps going. What we want ourselves can differ from what we might recommend. Patents on plants is a new thing. Because it is patented, does not mean to me that it is good. And, while its appearance is supposed to be" different than existing varieties, I believe in some cases the differ - ence is slight. Watch to see if a patent might help to put across a poor variety. Proper planting. Plant bushes slight deeper than they were plant - ed before. Be sure to mound the earth up about the canes to prevent drying out on the start, and gradually take this mound down. I rec - ommend spring planting only for roses for this section. Proper cultivation. Keep the top soil hoed roughly to conserve moisture. Some folks mulch with peat moss instead of cultivating. Around 2 inches. I have been cultivating. Watering. I irrigate by digging a ditch between my rows and then fill the ditch with enough water to soak down among the roots thoroughly. Spraying. The wise rose grower makes it a regular duty to dust or spray his roses. Spray every Monday evening, or name your own day, with some combination fungicide and insecticide. Start when the leaves are half size and continue until frost approaches. When the foliage is dry. When the air is still. A very thin mist coating on both sides of all the leaves. The way to avoid rose troubles is to prevent them. I use Rose-Aid (or some combination of about 85% dusting sulphur and 15% dry lead arsenate) sprayed with a dust gun. Use some nicotine solution when, and only when, you see aphis (plant lice, little insects under the leaves or on the stems) as directed on package. The fumes kills them. Picking flowers. Cutting flowers compromises the bush and more shoots are produced. And the new shoots have the blooms. Pick with good stems, on most varieties cut back to two full sets of leaves. In the morning. Winter protection. The best preparation for winter is to have good plants which have made an early growth, that were kept clean, were ripened properly, and were growing in well drained soil that was in a moist condition when it was frozen at the approach of winter. With the first freeze cover the roses with a 6 to 8 inch mound of earth about each plant. (I cut off the tops at the top of the mound.) Then </seg>
            <seg id="p479">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY after a more severe freeze cover with about 12 to 18 inches of loose hay or straw. A cover to keep out the moisture from packing this litter is an additional help, being sure to allow for a vent system for the circulation of air from the outside into this litter. Uncovering winter protection. When it gets warm in the spring uncover gradually, and if it gets cold, you may have to put some dirt back. No set rule can be given. Alternate thawing and freezing, and drying out of canes from winds is the thing we wish to prevent. Fertilize. ..I use one application of Vigoro, or fresh cow manure in May. I understand that in alkaline soils they use Ford fertilizer. With the heat of summer do not expect so much from roses. Do not try to push them with further fertilization. Let them rest a little for the big fall show. They are naturally inclined to rest during late July and August. Instead of thinking of fertilizer, think about water - ing them correctly.

Discussion Question: What about the Francis Scott Key rose? I Answer: A very vivid rose and liked by very many people, then again, I find those people that feel they would rather have Etan de Holland or the E. G. Hill rose. Statement: I have never had a rose do so well as the Francis Scott Key. Statement: I find that the Lady Hillingdon is one of my finest roses. Answer: We do find where some people have wonderful luck with either of these. My recommendation cover the experiences of a period of years. Lady Hillingdon has not done as well for me as some others with similar characteristcs. Question: Are they supposed to be as hardy as the Hoover? Answer: Most rose growers find they are not so hardy. Question: On my Pink and White Dahlias there was a spider that </seg>
            <seg id="p483">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY just spun webs all around the plants. One plant had about a hun - dred buds but was entirely enclosed with spider webs. I sprayed with Black Leaf 40 and soap water but all the buds fell off. I wonder if it was the soap that caused the trouble. Answer: I really don't know much about Dahlias. Might have been too strong a solution of either the nicotine or of the soap, more likely the former. Question: Why didn't you mention the variety. New Dawn? Answer: I probably should have but I don't know much about it myself. Statement: I have one that blooms from June to November. Question: I wonder if you would recommend Spanish Beauty Climber? Answer: I would recommend it for trial. When trying different plants, you better have some of the more substantial varieties first. Question: Is the Mrs. E. P. Thorn a single or double rose? Answer: That is a double rose. MR. BANNING: If there are no other questions that you want to ask Mr. Andrews, we will adjourn for lunch. We will begin our after - noon session in this same room at 1:30. TUESDAY AFTERNOON SESSION CHAIRMAN: Now, if you will come to order, we will start. We like to get started on time because some of you will like to attend other meetings. We are very glad to have such a large attendance this afternoon. Glad, especially, to see so many ladies present. First on the program will be a talk on "Practical Home Landscaping" by Maurice Marshall of Omaha. PRACTICAL HOME LANDSCAPING by Maurice N. Marshall At any time in a problem of home landscaping, the design of the home, of course, is the first consideration. For the effect of simplicity and in order to make a definite problem in home landscaping, we will consider that we are dealing with an English brick home with an attached garage similar to those being built in the newer additions of most of our cities. The first rule of design in proceeding to landscape home grounds is to remember that the home is the central feature and that the grounds </seg>
            <seg id="p484">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE are there primarily to enhance the beauty of the home by careful land - scaping. Following up from this we will find that, like a picture, we must give it a setting and a frame. The simpler way to accomplish this is by first taking a careful measurement of the entire home grounds showing the walks, drives, and general topography of the' entire area, having a careful understanding of the views .which are desirable, the views which are undersirable and should be screened out, and the views which are most valued from within the home as we look out the windows. After we have taken these primary factors into consideration, the simplest and perhaps the easiest way to clearly locate the areas, is by what is known as the ovals and circles method. This consists of sketching ovals or circles in the unobstructed open areas such as the front yard area, serving area, side yard area, and back yard. These ovals and circles being drawn large enough and in such a way as to come relatively close to the borders of the property, and at the same time to overlap where the ovals or circles areas come adjacent to those of another. Excluding the possibilities of what should be placed for foundation planting and considering only the border areas founded by the circles and ovals method, we at once get a rough idea of where border shrub - bery, framing trees, and bays and promotories should be placed Usually houses with an attached garage give us an opportunity for additional and more conveniently located service areas. Now that we have roughly located the areas and portions of the yard which are suited for framing and border materials, we can for - get the ovals and circles and progress with these border areas. With the removal of ovals and circles, we immediately gather an entirely different picture of the whole yard setting. The next thing that must be taken into consideration and care - fully thought out is the location of trees so that we will benefit by their shade and at the same time not obstruct the border area where we desire color and bloom. The placing of trees is a vital factor in every home planting because they cannot be changed easily. The size when matured should, of course, be considered in every case. One should remember, also, that the flower areas are satisfactory only when the flowers do well within these areas. By that, I mean, that they must be so placed that they have every cultural advantage and will therefore appear healthy and vigorous. This means that they must be given a considerable amount of open area in the sunshine. We have already said that the trees should help to give enclosure and act as framing material for the home setting. Therefore, it naturally follows that they should be placed, more or less, to the </seg>
            <seg id="p485">NEBRASKA STATE IIOUTICLI.TLUE SOCIETY borders and to the back yard property, leaving spaces of open lawn ■which will serve as attractive views and vistas from various points. Now that we have located the trees on the plan, the next step is to locate roughtly the areas which we expect to devote to flowers such as annuals, perennials, and roses. Also we may find It desirable to locate a garden arbor or a pergola in the back yard area. Also in this day of rockery and pools, it ordinariy seems that an outdoor living room development is not complete without at least a pool as a part of Its many points of attraction. The fact that a back yard or outdoor living room is to be made livable and to be used as one Avould use the living room of their home stands to reason that garden furniture should not be overlooked in completing the job. So much for the general location of trees, shrubbery, flowers, and various garden appointments. The next step and the most vital one is to work out the plant materials to fill in these areas. No iron clad rule can be laid down which will apply in all cases. How - ever, the fundamentals of landscape design must apply. By that I mean the materials chosen must be such as to give variety, both as to bloom and character of plant, and must be chosen so as to give a pleasing irregularity of skyline, and, of course, must be varieties which will always be healthy in climate used. Avoid using shrubbery in ones! It is always better to group them in threes or more, and avoid the use of twos except where a feeling of formality is desired. For the ordinary yard quantities of three, five, or even seven of a variety usually give us the best effect. Supposing our home to be in eastern Nebraska. We would find our taller growing materials to consist of Sweet Mockoranges, Virginal Mockoranges, Tatarian Honeysuckle, White Bell Honeysuckle, Cran - berrybush, Chinese Lilac, Golden Elder, Pussy Willows, Dogwood, and Forsthia. A satisfactory list of the medium growing shrubbery should include Regal Privet, Van Hoot Splrea, Garland Spirea. Pink Weigela, and for still lower growing material Rugosa Rose, Froebel Spirea, Thunberg Spirea, Japanese Barberry, Anthony Waterer Spirea, Groot - endorst Rose and Coralberry can be used. Of course there are many others which are used with success in this locality, but the above rep - resent the most popular in use. As to evergreens other than those for the foundation planting, one is more or less limited to various varieties of Spruce, Fir, and Pine. As for shade and ornamental trees of a desideous nature Moline Elm, American Elm, Norway Maple, Soft Maple, Russian Olive, Niobe Weeping Willow, Hopa Flowering Crab, and Cutleaf Weeping Birch about complete the list. </seg>
            <seg id="p486">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I will not go into any detail about the varieties of roses, annuals or perennials which would be suitable. Any nurseryman in your locality will be glad to recommend in accordance with your desires. This about completes the problem with the exception of the foundation planting. Now, as we have said, we are considering this as an English brick home and therefore, one ideally suited for an evergreen foun - dation planting. There is a wide range of varieties that could be used for this purpose. However, those for the accent point probably should consist on one of the following: either Virginia Juniper, Cannarts Juniper, Dundee Juniper, or Colorado Juniper. For the area between the accent point such as beneath windows or as facer material in front of the accent evergreens such varieties as Pfltzer Juniper, Savin Juniper, Andorra Juniper, and Mugo Pine are in most popular use. This in a general way represents the major problems which will confront the average home owner when he sets out to beautify his grounds. Even in the face of these suggestions and, of course, of landscape design, one should feel free to consult his local nurseryman and his local landscape man before going ahead on any elaborate and expensive landscape program. Discussion Question:. Is the Chinese Lilac a budded lilac? Answer: No, it is the French lilacs that are budded. They have heavy folage like our old-fashioned lilac and are not free blooming like the old-fashioned or common lilac in this respect. The Chinese lilac blooms in the nursery row within three years. Has already bloomed once when it leaves the nursery. Question: Do they sucker up very badly. Answer: No, they do not. The Chinese lilac does not sucker. It forms its new shoots at the base, at the ground line. Question: What is the difference between the Persian Lilac and the Chinese Lilac? Answer: Very little difference, both are oriental in origin. In fact they have been sold interchangeably by the nurseries with no intent to deceive at all. Question: Isn't one form of the Chinese Lilac like a tree? Answer: Yes, there is but it is not as common as is the Japanese tree lilac. It is a tree that will get as large as a mountain ash. Question: Is the Chinese Lilac the same as the Rothomogensis? Answer: They are all alike, like three peas in a pod. I think </seg>
            <seg id="p487">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY the Rothomogensis Is more of a dwarf. They all have small leaves and blooms. The Chinese lilac is considered the best of the three. Question: What about the Chinese Elm? Answer: If you live out in the Platte bottom, use it by all means. Here in Lincoln, it is all right. Then, there are lots of other varieties. ... Question: Does the Moline Elm make as good a tree? Answer: I think in twenty years, you will prefer the Moline Elm to the Chinese Elm. Question: Does the Moline Elm split badly? Answer: No -r believe not. It is a very upright growing type of tree and crotches do not carry much of a strain except in high winds. You have to watch crotches in all trees, however. Question: How big will the Moline Elm be in twenty years? Answer: I think a lot depends upon the treatment given them the first few years after they are set out. Trees on thin exposed hill tops will seldom grow as well as those on rich low soils where they are protected. Trees that are in sod will not grow as well as those that are cultivated. Nitrogen fertilizers and plenty of water will usually produce a vigorous growth under Nebraska conditions. Statement: I am not so interested in the Moline Elm as in the Chinese Elm. Answer: Don't give it too much competition with weeds. When you water it, drown it and when the ground is dry enough to cultivate, cultivate immediately. That, will keep the moisture in it, otherwise it comes right back out again. Statement: We bought these to act as a screen. We have about come to the conclusion it will take about forty years. We have good soil. It is in Butler County. Answer: Always remember that good cultivation is the best rule to follow and the rule most violated. They get plenty of cultivation in the nursery but not a lot of water. Question: If you wanted a good screen, how close would you plant the Chinese Elms to your Chinese Lilacs? ■ Answer: About 5 to 6 feet away. They will adjust themselves to any reasonable space. The White Belle Honeysuckles should be 6 or 7 feet depending upon whether single or double rows are desired. Question: What is a good vine where the sun is hot in the after- </seg>
            <seg id="p488">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE noon? Is the Ucapia a good vine? I want shade from the afternoon: sun. Answer: You can always plant some of the Ivy vines such as the Engleman's ivy or you could use the Virginia creeper. Statement: We had Virginia creeper but the insects got on it and killed it. Question: Wouldn't the Silver lace Vine be a good vine for that location? Answer: Fairly good. It has a good blossom. Question: In selecting shrubs and trees, what would be good trees and shrubs for the birds? Answer: If you are a lover of birds, you might use some Red Haw or a plum tree which acts as a place for the birds to retreat to and to serve as food for the birds. The matter of berries should be considered where birds are concerned. Statement: Seems to me this morning during the Shelterbelt talk, they suggested shrubs and trees that birds liked which I think was a good thing. Answer: Any collection of trees is an attraction for birds. For winter feeding and for the best retreats, you have to use into Plum and Russian Olive which aren't so desirable for cats and that should be considered. Statement: Thorn trees are very good. Answer: Hawthorne is very good. CHAIRMAN: I think we have certainly enjoyed Mr. Marshall's discussion and we will expect to see some results in Nebraska this coming summer. Now, along with landscaping we have another subject which fits in very nicely, The Eternal Garden Triangle by Mrs. Fae Huttenlocher of "Better Homes and Gardens Magazine, Des Moines, Iowa. THE ETERNAL GARDEN TRIANGLE Mrs. Fae Huttenlocher, Des Moines, la. I started my garden in much the same manner that everyone does. I wanted flowers. I had my backyard spaded into beds of various and sundry shapes and sizes planting them to whatever annual, perennial and biennial met my fancy in the seed catalog. Rough coated zinnias </seg>
            <seg id="p489">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY nudged a row of dainty sweet peas. Blue reds and yellow reds, magenta and orange screeched and screamed at each other in the same bed. There's no. doubt about it, my garden looked the part of the craziest of crazy quilts spread out for an airing over my back yard. I loved flowers, and I had them, yet I felt like tearing my hair and running away when I looked at that motley mess of unrelated forms and colors. When winter came, my lawn looked like a cemetery ol newly dug graves. I knew something was wrong. Fortunately, a garden club friend happened along and diagnosed my trouble. You need a plan, she said. Don't go to your garden and say, "Oh, just dig a bed here for the zinnias and one over there for the marigolds." Instead of planting them in unrelated beds and masses, put them into a border at the outer edge of your lot and leave the greensward center clear. You don't pile your furniture into the middle of the room do you? "Well, don't do it in your garden either. That was my first lesson in design. Though my garden the next year was nothing more than a border planting of annuals, surrounding the lawn, it was so pleasing that I promptly started reading, studying and experimenting in garden design. I joined the garden club and my favorite activity, was making mini - ature model garden designs for the flower show and arranging flowers for color, line and design. That was 15 years ago. And I am still learning and loving anything that pertains to fresh creative ideas in garden design and color harmony. No matter how trying the day, if I can go to my garden and plan a new harmony of flowers, my troubles dissolve and fade in the warmth of my interest. So, it is my object to present as clearly as possible the fundamentals that have remained most constructive and helpful to me each year in the development of my small city garden 75 feet by 150 feet, and that of my mother's more extensive garden of an entirely different type. Unity of Motive On the blackboard I have drawn for you my own philosophy of gardening in much the same form as the philosophy of life which my old psychology professor used to teach me. According to their theory, the kind of life we live is determined by those three basic factors, heredity, training and environment. And, according to my theory, the kind of garden we have is dependent upon unity of motive, style and color. Most psychologists agree that the basis of the triangle of life is heredity. So, I feel that Unity of Motive is the basis of your garden. \ I believe this because it is the fundamental garden principle that would </seg>
            <seg id="p490">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE have saved me many years trial and disappointment had I but under - stood it. Every garden must have unity of motive. If you were creating a musical rapsody you would not use the time and technique of a wailing negro spiritual. So it is in successful composition of gardens. You must first de - cide upon the underlying motive or theme you wish to follow. In terms of gardening, that motive will be formal, informal or naturalistic. As to which of these motives you select— that will depend upon the topography of your ground, its size, the style of your house and your own taste, which will undoubtedly change as you progress and learn. This last element is one of the secrets of the garden's continued and undying interests. Again permit me to use my own experience as ah example. My ground is flat and small in size. The house in style is one of those usual square types that dot the entire American landscape. There was no predominant character to dictate that my garden should be formal, informal, naturalistic, Spanish or English. Having read that informal borders, straight here and curved there, encircling a green sward, gave a small grounds the appearance of greater space, I chose the informal border planting as my motive. Since my lot was small and my borders but 5 to 10 feet wide, it was essential to use a background planting of trees and shrubs that were informal of character, but not so rampant and rustic that they took the whole border. In other words, I selected plant material that was in unity with my motive of an informal type of garden. I chose lilacs, mock orange, euonymous, cotoneasters, deutzias and some of the more refined viburnums such as carlessii, opulus and lantana. For peren - nials that were of an informal type, I used accents of single peonies, plenty of Iris, thalictrums, columbines, artemesias, veronicas, hotas, gasplants and other perennials of an informal but not rustic type. The annuals that carried my unity of motive informality, were marigolds, nicotiana, zinnias, larkspur, petunias and ageratum. Naturalistic Had my plot of ground been sloping and of a woodland character, in order to retain its unity of motive, I would have planned my garden in as naturalistic form as possible, taking some one tree or low place for a stream or pool as my climax with meandering paths leading to it. Shrubs would be planted in natural groups instead of straight or curved borders. In character they would be of the same unified char - acter, dogwoods, shad, witchhazel and coralberry. Here and there </seg>
            <seg id="p491">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY imbedded rocks would outcrop from the slopes. Perennials would be harmoniously rustic of character, such as wild asters, goldenrod, digitalis, narcissus, cimicifuga racemosa, chrysanthemums, lily of the valley and the coneflowers. Annuals such as calliopsis, gallardias, fringed gentians, cardinal flower, campanula Americana, browallia, neraesias, helianthus and ambrosia, would be chosen. That is what I mean by unity of motive — selecting a theme for your garden, then planting and keeping everything even to the garden furniture and fence in harmony with it. Unity of Style. The second fundamental is unity of style, by which I mean, if your house is of Spanish influence, plan your garden in that same style, using a raised pool or well, potted plants sitting about, gay tropical colors, shrubs, flowers and plants of tropical character, such as olive, ginko, yucca, geranium, lantana, zinnias and tritomas. Or, if it be Dutch colonial type, select shrubs, trees, perennials and annuals that are neatly formal, substantial and colorful, such as privet, poplars, tulips, pansies, daisies, delphinium and lilies. Unity of Color This is the third fundamental and some landscape architects will contend that it is as basic in importance as unity of motive. Many authorities say that the first study in flower gardening should be color. For color does more to bring unified effect than either of the other fundamentals. The study of color is equally important to large and small gardens for the same effects can be secured in gardens of varied area. One need not be deeply versed in art or talk a lot of nonsense about it to distinguish the difference between discord and harmony in color. Some people are born with a subtle color sense. Some who are born without it may acquire taste thru study and experience, but until it is attained, the most satisfying garden effects may not be had. Flower gardening for color holds unlimited opportunity for creative garden enjoyment. Masses of flowers thoughtlessly planted — a hodge - podge of warring colors, give no more pleasure than a crazy patch - work quilt. Color Effects Let us consider the element of flower color and its effect. Blue lengthens distance and adds depth to shadow. Therefore, if your garden be small and you wish to create a feeling of space rather than </seg>
            <seg id="p492">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE being crowded, have blue flowers predominate, being sure to plant plenty of blue in the farthest border. This does not mean a monoton - ous one color garden. It means using blue flowers in all their gamut of tints and hues, bringing it to life here and there with a contrasting touch of white, yellow or red. Nearness Yellow shortens the garden, so if you wish a large space made more intimate, use yellow flowers in predominance, especially at the far end of the garden. Accent Points Bright red in the garden is like an exclamation point to a sen - tence. It is so insistent in its effect that most every other color is eclipsed by it. It is therefore best used in an isolated position, or placed at the entrance to a garden or front border where one walks away from it. Red flowers such as oriental poppies, planted in the fore - ground of a copse, or in front of a mass of dwarf evergreens, is a glorious picture. The vivid beauty of the cardinal flower is pitifully out of place among most garden flowers, but is a joyous picture when seen rising in colonies beside a stream that mirrors its beauty. Harmonizer White is a peacemaker among warring flowers. And those who work by day should plant white flowers in their gardens for evening effect and night enjoyment. Flowers such as nicotianas, white asters, white cosmos, white larkspur, datura, tuberoses, mock oranges, white roses and alyssum are indespensibes in most gardens. Xeutralizers Green is nature's own neutralizer. Even screamingly opposed colors are rendered inoffensive by broad green stretches between them. Kind of Color Harmonies Working for color harmony in the garden is much the same as in flower arrangement. And for the beginner, it will be easier to start with flowers of analgous colors. That is, tints and hues of the same color. For instance, a background of lavender basketflower, deeper lavender larkspur as a center planting and purple verbenas as an edg - ing would be an analogous harmony. Or, yellow zinnias as a back - ground, flame snapdragons in the center and deep tagetes marigolds as a border. </seg>
            <seg id="p493">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY Complementary Colors As we grow a little bolder, we may add a complementary color to snap up our analogous harmony, as for instance, adding a group of shell pink and deep rose zinnias in the heart of our lavender and purple border. i .'. '"'■■•■•" Contrasting Harmony For those that like to combine colors that make you catch your breath, the contrasting border of opposites in the color spectrum is desirable. Scarlet zinnias and white daisies; blue cornflowers and red poppies; orange tulips and purple pansies. Rythmic Harmony As you advance in garden enthusiasm, you will revel in the joy of creating a whole border of every spectrum color so harmoniously blended that its effect is like that of the rising and falling of beautiful music. To do this, one starts With tints of one color, following the spectrum clear around to the deepest shades at the opposite side. Flower Characters Flowers are as varied and interesting in character as people. Analyze every flower, shrub and tree that you plant, for by so doing you will be surer of selecting plant life that will be in harmony with your garden motive. The reason most of us hate cannas, is because we have seen them wrongly used. Usually they are coralled like cattle in a suffocating pen of a bed. If they were used in groups of five as a strong accent in a wide roomy perennial border or placed in clusters at the foundation or doorway of a Spanish style house, their beauty would be enhanced. By analyzing the character of our flowers, we will have the key as to how they may be used most effectively. Two dominant qualities that mark the character of a flower, are its form and its texture. By form, I mean whether it is a steeple flower, tall and slender, accenting the garden, or button shaped like zinnias or roses which are of the most dominant form and should be used as points of emphasis. The third form of flowers are those called fillers. These are feathery types like baby's breath and statice. A garden or flower arrangement may completely lose its character by an overuse of the soft feathery flowers. Roses or carnations arranged with a mass of baby's breath is absolutely characterless. On the other hand, a border of all button forms is oppressively heavy and not at all interest - ing. The best planned rose gardens are accented with tree roses, or </seg>
            <seg id="p494">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE taller varieties planted with the hybrid teas. The ideal border uses a preponderance of button forms, accented with clusters of steeple flowers such as gladiolus, veronicas, tritomas, larkspur, delphinium, with here and there a softening mist of thalictrum, or statice. By texture we mean the character of a plant's foliage as determined by the manner of growth, also the substance of its flowers and leaf, whether light and thin, rought and dull or thick and glaucous. Holly - hocks are strong and dominant of character, their flowers being large and button shaped, their stem being steeple and spired, their foliage being coarse and rough. The hollyhock is one of the most dominantly decorative plants in the garden. It must be used in bold clumps standing sentinal at gateways to sturdy old fashioned gardens, or in soliderly clusters at the door of an early American styled house that is sturdy and squat of line. The Iris is refined of substance and growth, yet with enough char - acter in its pointed glaucous foliage to give it a place either in refined formal areas or the informal border. The peony is dominant in form and superb in size. It demands a large border with tall strong spikes of delphinium nearby, or planted in strong ribbons of color across an informal lawn area. Coneflowers, rudbekias, helianthus, perennial asters, digitalis and goldenrod are rustic of charcater, loving to run riot and should there - fore be used in naturalistic woodland types of gardens. Pansies, forgetmenots, larkspurs, cosmos, sunshine asters, snap - dragons, baby's breath and roses are for the refined formal or semi - formal gardens, fitted to small areas and borders, combining well with white lattice fence and refined shrubs such as the spireas, and deutzias. Petunias, nicotianas, nasturtiums and phlox are free growing, luxurious of growth with a profusion of bloom and by their informal character are fitted to the old fashioned type of garden with pebble or brick paths, or to the informal flower border that has width. The frouzy, rough-leaved, ageratum belongs to this informal group of plants. Four-o-clocks too are coarse in habit, belonging to the care - free form of old fashioned gardens. Suggested Color Combinations I am listing some combinations of cutting flowers that I have found pleasing. Prom them you may be able to select those that best fit your garden motive and your personal preference. You will notice that I have used combinations of annuals and perennials, for they </seg>
            <seg id="p495">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY admirably supplement each other when used together. Both are love - lier with a background of shrubs that serve as a foil for their high color. Not every lover of flowers owns the land where he lives, and where it is rented, only quick returns are required. It is possible to secure a beautiful effect with annuals alone if too great a multitude of them in unrelated colors or forms are not used. Tho one can have but a cutting garden, or a combined annual and vegetable garden, let it have a plan and hold flowers that have been selected for form and color harmony. Here are a few examples: Lavender, purple and white verbenas seed sown over the daffodil planting. Heliotropes planted in front of the lavender buddleias, with a fore - ground of white violas and pachysandra. Always have one color predominate in every harmony that you create. This lavender and white combination may be snapped up with a French touch of shell pink poppies or deep rose polyanthus roses. In this harmony, you also have an interesting contrast of steeple and button forms as well as color. A border of polyanthus roses will be lovelier with lavender and purple verbenas planted among them and an edging of intermingled pinks and forgetmenots. Lobelias and white annual pinks make an interesting border. Ageratum and nepeta mussini with veronica incana form an unusual edging in gray tones. Another splendid annual poppy is Rose Queen paeoniae florum,. growing nearly 3 feet high with vigorous stiff stem and glaucous foliage and superb blooms followed by handsome seed vessels. The whole plant is suggestive of decorative design and is delightfully com - panionable with white foxgloves. A fragrant mass of pink nicotiana makes an excellent background for deep rose zinnias or massive umbels of phlox,, mauve, crimson and white. For it furnishes contrast of form as well as color. Lobelia cardinalis is a daring vermillion border for clusters of rosy phlox, the spiky form of the lobelia being a desirable contrast to roundheaded phlox. In autumn the splendid browns and russetts of coreopsis and rudbekias, coreopsis verticillata for contrast, used with a few orange African marigolds and a border of dwarf nasturtium Vulcan makes a. beautiful bouquet until frost. </seg>
            <seg id="p496">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The silky transculent texture of petunias catch the light and reflect it. White petunias in a solid border around the pool in a half shady garden, is a charming epitome of delicacy. Mignonette harminizes with everything and should be sown broad - cast as soon as the bulbs are cut off, over tulips and among roses. Sweet peas in blocks of color may be used over a trellis as a back - ground on the north side of a rose border. Annual poppies are indispensible. Nothing can exceed the fairy - like grace of shirley. Sow in large masses with blue cornflowers where tulips and daffodils have finished blooming. Try alternate clumps of pink Shirley popies and deep crimson linum grandiflorium rubrum. Keep blue and yellow flowers' away from this combination. A moderate touch of yellow to the blue and white larkspurs is like salt to the soup. The fire of Iceland poppies among purple and gold Siberian iris as the sun. shines thru them in the afternoon is like the finest church glass window. Orange marigolds combine delightfuly with wine red phlox. Mauve scabiosa with deep purple petunias. Masses of candytuft with bright pink annual lupines. White always strengthens pale pink. Try snow white astors and baby's breath and delicate spikes of white larkspur with white sweet alyssum and white verbena for a white border of interesting form. Spicy white pinks, deliciously scented white ten weeks stocks will have a cooling effect on the hottest days. For interesting contrast of foliage forms; plant hostas or plantain lilies with lupines or iris with tuberous begonias. Alternate plants of sweet alyssum and lobelia in a single row. Creamy yellow snapdragons with purple veronicas, orange mari - golds with helenium Riverton Gem. Steel blue salvias against red dahlias. Carmine zinnias with New England asters. French marigolds with chrysanthemums of the same bronzy tone. Annual asters with perennial asters is pleasing. </seg>
            <seg id="p497">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY Pink snapdragons, pink anemones and pink gladiolus emphasize the charm of each other in form and tone. Calendulas, marigolds and sunflower Stella heleniums and boltonias in heavy bands and drifts form a sturdy autumn border. White zinnias, white scabiosas, white annual phlox and white glads make an interesting one-tone combination. If you are red minded, you'll love red salvias, red phloxes and red dahlias together. For a yellow accent try the Celosia plumosa the new hybrid known as the Thompsonii magniflca and use with it an - edging of the beautiful ultramarine blue browallia speciosa major. If you wish the mellow tones of an old church window, plant to - gether where the sun can stream thru it sideways pink lathrys and purple heliotrope with deep orchid stocks and blue browallia border. And remember, if there is any plant to which you have an aversian, it is probably because you have never seen it planted to its best ad - vantage in perfect harmony with its surroundings, or in unity with its garden motive. I have loathed begonias, coleus and cannas, because I have seen: them corralled like so many cattle in hideous square and round park beds, instead of used as colorful accents in the flower border. Select, choose and place your every plant with thought and care given to motive, style and color. CHAIRMAN: I am sure that Mrs. Huttenlocher has the sincere thanks of this audience for the splendid talk she has given us. The next on our program is Promising New Plants for the 1935 Garden by Arthur Rapp. And, by the way, remember we have another num - ber than is printed on your program. PROMISING NEW PLANTS FOR THE 1935 GARDEN By Arthur Rapp From time immemorial there has been a constant interest in new plant material. First it was in the hope that such new plants might have food value, then came the hope that such plants might have medicinal value. Before the time of Christ there was a constant seeking after the Golden Bough, the mythical tree that bore fruit of gold and whose leaves were precious jewels, the knowledge and possession of which brought the gift of magic and the ability to per - form miracles. In the time of the Caesars and for centuries after, those herbs that were sweet scented or that might have value for the seasoning of foods or the dispersing of fuel odors were much. </seg>
            <seg id="p498">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 1^***1*?' { V U th ° Se dayS th6y dfd nOt have Frteidaires nor Gen - eral Electric refrigerators, and food was often in such a condition that rather strong and spicy seasoning was necessary. So it is not surprising that we are all possessed of an inherent interest in new plants for our garden. We do not have here in western Iowa and eastern Nebraska a wide range of native flowering plants suitable for garden use We ive in a prairie land, and for centuries these dry prairies were burned in the spring of each year. So we do not have the shrubs that are found in damper, rougher lands of other states. We have a wide range of temperature; cold in the winter without the protection of snow and hot in the summer with insufficient moisture for proper plant growth and the maturing of seed, with frequent dry springs that pro - vide poor germination for hard seeds. So it is quite natural that we should turn to our catalogues each year in the hope that there we might find something that we can put over on our neighboring gardeners. " i Unfortunately, however, the advantage of having available such a wide range of plant material as is listed in some of the better cata - logues is almost a disadvantage if it leads us to think that being able to get certain things is the important matter. The important thing is to be able to grow new plants— to make them do what they very often can do if you give their requirements reasonable consideration. The cycle of the development of the average gardener is quite uni - form. We first get interested in annuals, then we graduate to peren - nials, and from there to shrubs, and finally, if we live long enough and have enough room, we acquire an abiding interest in trees. Along the route we may get sidetracked in special interests; perhaps it will be a rock garden, or perhaps we landscape for a day our homes, or we may become specialists collecting first all the iris we can, then peonies and perhaps, finally, lilacs. Now there isn't a great deal of credit even n a big collection of iris or peonies or lilacs. All that such a collection indicates is a certain amount of means, of persistence and of garden room, because there isn't any special skill required in keeping such a collection. But when you meet a person who has a collection of Mertensias or of the Alysiums. and who knows how to grow them properly you may rest assured that the gardener has skill in cultiva - tion, a possession of far great importance than most of the catalogues in existence. This importance of knowing how to take care of plants is probably the most valuable part of this talk to you. There are many very de - sirable plants that are quite suited to the conditions which prevail here in Nebraska or to the conditions which you can provide if you use </seg>
            <seg id="p499">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY intelligence and good judgment, or if you have good luck, for luck is not to be ignored. Just a few days ago I saw a very thrifty red elder, the kind that has coral berries which are at their best just about the time our elderberry blooms. The owner of that bush had been told that it would not do well in southwestern Iowa. I am quite certain that if he had planted it three feet to the right or left or the east or west, it would have died exactly like any other plant, native to our north - eastern states where the air is cool and moist, does when it is subject to the occasional hot dry winds of our state. But in the spot where the owner had planted it, these conditions that it required prevailed at least to a certain extent. In telling you about certain plants, I make no pretence that they are new. It is very seldom that we have new plants, although quite often we have new varieties of old plants. Not many of these new varieties are satisfactory under a wide range of conditions, and the plants that I will speak of are those that I grow or have grown under conditions which prevail here in parts of your state and of my state. There are a number of plants that are very satisfactory under our conditions, yet which are rarely listed in catalogues. Sometimes this is because they are difficult to propogate, or because there is no de - mand for them, and for these reasons dealers can not afford to list them at a low price. Such a plant is Euphorbia polychroma, a perfect mound of fine foliage about a foot high, entirely covered with deep golden covered bracts during tulip time in spring. It is one of the milkweeds, is hardy, long-lived, and is attractive during the entire summer and has but one thing against it, and that is that it is hard to get. Because of the limited amount of time I am going to stick almost entirely to perennials, and, jumping to the other end of the season, I wonder how many of you are growing Desmodium, a shrubby peren - nial that is covered with reddish purple pea shaped flowers during September, a native of Texas, stands both heat and drouth, grows slowly and never dies out; three feet tall, with neither disease nor insect pests to bother it. I like the thalictrums for their foliage, the tiny minus for the grace that it adds to a bouquet, and glaucium for its golden yellow plume. All of these are iron clad, and they can stand both hot and cold — wet and dry seasons. Lysimachia is another of those plants with runner roots that do not propogate easily, yet which wander all over the garden. No, it isn't a pest. It just likes to be by itself, prefers to be cool, and likes mois - ture. The white variety Lysimachia clethroides is the best, but the yellow variety is also good. </seg>
            <seg id="p500">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE , Two plants that are in the habit of getting their feet thoroughly wet each day along the tidal rivers of the Atlantic coast, will do quite well out in Nebraska even in a dry year. I refer to Lythrum and Statice. Lythrum is an old fashioned favorite — it's long graceful branches being covered with red or reddish pink flowers all summer. Statice seemed to bloom this year just as well as any other year a weed in New Jersey, and it .has all the persistence of a weed in Nebraska and its beauty makes it a desirable tenant of any garden. Most of the penstemous and most of the salvias will do well with us. They are prairie flowers, prefer to be left alone, and they are as a rule in no hurry to grow up. Perhaps that is why the grower does not always have them in stock and perhaps our lack of appreciation is due to their not having flowers as large as peonies. Most of us know the verbascums by the name of mullein or Indian tobacco, the wooly leaved plant that grows in waste places. Try some of the new hybrids, Miss Wilmot, Olympicum, or Phoeniceum. Most of them are biennials and I raise them from seed, but I don't know where you could get seed. A very distinct novelty is centaurea macrocephala or Hard head. It is a good cut flower and good garden material. Just a word about a few annuals that have been featured as novelties. Sweet Wlelsdsfleld is fine in England where bright colors are lacking, but we don't need it in Nebraska. Guinea Gold is a marigold that lacks the odor of marigolds, and is a fine cut flower. The double nasturtium is a good cut flower and is fragrant, but all three of these annuals must be well grown or else they are disappointing. There are a number of shrubs which can and should be found at least in the southeastern part of your state. Exochordia or pearl - bush is one of these. . It is hardy but not as easy to transplant as a spirea, but it has a long life and distinction. Most of the Honeysuckles or Loniceras can be grown by you. You stick to the Tartarian because it is one of the best and the most thrifty. There are a half dozen others almost as good and some of those that ripen their fruit in the fall are most excellent. I can not say as much for the Beauty bush or Kolkwitzia. While it is beautiful when it does bloom, the season is short and only occasional, and the balance of the time it lacks dis - tinction. There are a few veburnum besides the Snowball and the High bush cranberry that do well. Lantana Lentago and Prumfolia or Black Haw are probably the best. When it comes to wild crabs I feel that the native Iowa crab is preferable to any other including the many Asiatic varieties that have been introduced. Sargent's crab, with it's brilliant cherry-like fruit may be an exception. In closing may I express the hope that you will not try to grow </seg>
            <seg id="p501">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY plants like azaleas and rhododendrons In Nebraska. I know that you can grow them but don't do It. Foreign plants in your garden are your guests and they are entitled to kindness and courtesy, and it is not kind to place a plant in a position where it is uncomfortable, and I can't imagine a shallow rooted, acid loving plant that can stand neither wind nor dry air being comfortable in Nebraska. Discussion Question: I wonder what is the best location for the Lysimachia? Mine is on the southwest corner and does not bloom. Answer: It should get lots of sun. How old is it? Statement: It is three years old. Answer: Then It should bloom very soon. Question: Where can we get Lysimachia? Answer: At Snider Bros. Nursery and the Wayside Nursery. Question: Is this a shrub? Answer: Yes, it is. It dies down to the ground each year and has to be trimmed back. Question: Will Witch Hazel grow in this part of Nebraska? Answer: Yes, it will grow. All you have to do is plant it. The peculiar thing about it is, you have to plant more than one. It does not like to grow alone. A great many shrubs are that way. Question: Is it a shrub? Answer: Yes looks a great deal like our Witch Hazel brush. Fruit comes on in the late fall. Statement: I don't think it is fair not to tell what the blooms are like. Answer: Well it looks like yellow confetti and blooms on Thanks - giving day. Question: Does it have berries on it? Answer: No, it has nuts that burst and seeds pop out. CHAIRMAN: One of the important flowers that we grow in our gardens is the Dahlia and not many of us have success with it. We have on our program at this time Mr. Smiley of Beaver Crossing who has been very successful with Dahlias. MR. HOPPERT: Mr. Smiley was kind enough to give us his paper, </seg>
            <seg id="p502">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE although he was not able to be here himself. I know you have all heard of him. He has about 42 different ponds with different kinds of lilies and some of them contain wonderful looking fish. He, also, makes a speciality of certain flowers like iris, peonies and dahlias. If there are no objections I will read his paper. THE GROWING OP DAHLIAS by Erie Smiley, Seward, Nebraska It has frequently been said that Nebraska has not a suitable climate for growing good Dahlias. However, in my experience during the past six years, I feel that the effort put forth during that time in caring for the plants has been well repaid by the mass of bloom that has come during the months of September and October. I have tried many different methods during these years, and I have finally come to the conclusion that the plan that works best is the most simple. We plow our Dahlia ground in the fall, and sow rye, broadcast. This keeps down the weeds in the spring, and produces humus for the soil. We plow about two weeks before planting time in the spring, or about May 5th. We do not harrow the ground at the time of plow - ing, but allow it to stay loose until just before planting time, which would be about the 20th of May. At that time it is harrowed thoroughly. The reason that we plant our Dahlia roots so late is that the blossoms burn badly during the intense heat and the stalks become hard, diminishing the size and quality of the blossoms. When they are planted as late as we recommend, they do not bloom until the intense heat of the summer months is much lessened. After harrowing, the ground is laid out in rows four feet apart, and the stakes set three feet apart in the rows. We use a seven foot stake, two inches by two inches. After all the stakes are set a hole two feet in diameter and one foot deep is dug. In it we put one shovel - ful of wood ashes and one shovelful of sand. The sand is used be - cause our soil is rather heavy. In sandy soil, this is not necessary, but above all, use wood ashes. The soil is then replaced until the hole is only about four inches in depth. The dahlia root is divided, leaving at least one good eye on each section. The root is planted horizontally, one to two inches from the stake. We cover over to a depth of about two inches. One tablespoon of virgoro is scattered over the top of the soil. After the plant comes through, fill in the other two inches. Meanwhile, it is unnecessary to irrigate, as at that time of the year plenty of moisture is furnished by rainfall. </seg>
            <seg id="p503">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY As the plant grows, we begin to hill up, so that a ditch is formed the length of the entire row. This is used later as an irrigation ditch. During the growing period, the entire bed is hoed at least once a week. By using a rake, a dust mulch is placed on the surface. This operation is used after every rain, so that the weeds are kept down and the soil is kept in good condition. If there is no rainfall during the week, the entire bed is flooded at least once each week. A spray of equal parts of Arsenate of Lead and Black Leaf 40 is used once a week to keep down the insects. Seasons vary so much that it is almost impossible to say whether or not to pinch out the tops of the plants after they have grown the three sets of leaves. In the past season of 1934, we did not do this. The plants did not make rapid growth. The flowers come sooner and are of much better size if the pinching is not done. Never allow more than two stalks to come from the root, and start tying them to the stakes after they reach the height of two feet. The stalk itself is very brittle, so it is a good plan to keep it tied firmly to the stake throughout the growing season. Some varieties need more pruning than others. Do not let them get bunchy at any time. Keep them pruned out so that plenty of air and sunshine will reach all sections of the plant. You may plant as late as July first, but I advocate that all plants be in the ground by the first of June. In this section of the country, the first blossoms come about the first of September. If the frost holds off until late in October, you will have an abundance of bloom throughout the months of September and October. If you want large blossoms, only one bud should be left on each stem. If an abundance of bloom is desired rather than a lesser number of large blossoms, do not dis-bud or prune back too heavily. After the blossom starts to wilt on the first three or four rows at the back, it should be removed. For cut flowers, the best time is when the blossom is completely out and the first row of petals on the back starts to curl. This is done when the flower is completely out, and sometimes it looks much better after picking. There are several methods of keeping the blossoms. I think the best way is to cut them early in the morning, while the dew is still on the plant. Dip the stems in one inch of boiling water. Leave them in 'for about thirty seconds, and then place in cold water. Another method is to pick early in the morning, split the stem about two inches and place in cold water. There are many varieties of Dahlias of enormous size being grown </seg>
            <seg id="p504">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE in many sections of the country. I have grown perhaps 500 varieties in the past 6 years. The following are a few of the varieties best suited to this section of the country. In referring to the different types, namely Formal and Informal decorative, the distinction is in the formation of the petals. The Formal Decorative has straight petals, without any curl whatever. The Informal type has a massive blossom, and the petals are slightly curled. In the Autumn shades, or Yellow Copper, in my estimation Jane Cowl, Virginia Ray, and Barbara Renfield are best suited to our climate. These three are informal decorative in type. The Jersey Beacon is always a favorite, and the most flery in the garden. Chinese Scarlet in color, formal decorative. Another very attractive Formal Decorative is the Judge Marean, which is a yellow with carmine tints. Monmouth Champion is another Formal, very free in bloom, flame colored, with blossoms unusual in size. Of the Reds, Form Monmouth is one of the largest, and can be grown to a diameter of 13". The color is known as Claret, informal decorative. The petals are narrow enough to almost be classified as semi-cactus. Rosa Nelle, a formal decorative, is a red that is unusually good. Elizabeth Stewart is another red, with not quite as large blossoms, but more brilliance in color than Rosa Nelle. One of the most attractive of the reds is the President Wilson. A very brilliant red, which makes an extremely striking blossom with some of the petals tipped with white. The plant is free in bloom, and not a very tall grower. Of the Yellows, King Midas, informal, is the most striking in the garden, but is not as good as a cut flower. Avalon is a very clear canary yellow, formal in type, very free in bloom, with a medium sized flower. Mrs. Ida Ver Werner, is one of the oldest v and still one of the good ones. It is lilac in color, a formal decorative, free in bloom, and a robust grower. Kathleen Norris is a large delicate pink. We have grown it to a size of 12" across, and in my opinion it is the most beautiful of all the dahlias. It is free in bloom, and produces blossoms a little later than the others. Star of Bethlehem is a beautiful white of the semi-cactus type. The only objection is that the stem is too short, but it is a wonderful garden variety. Snowdrift is more clear in color, formal decorative </seg>
            <seg id="p505">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY in type, and excellent in size. It comes into bloom later than the other varieties. After the first black frost comes, the plants are cut off six inches above the ground and left to stand about a week. At that time the roots are carefully dug out, and the stalk is trimmed off to only two or three inches from the roots. We have had the best success in keeping the roots through the winter by not drying them out, but by placing them in boxes or baskets, placing the stalks upside down to drain them of excess moisture, and covering them with soil. Put the baskets in a cellar or cave where the temperature can be kept as low as possible without freezing. Cellars with furnaces or any other heat will dry the roots out too much and cause them to shrivel. If they do shrivel, they will grow, provided the eye is fresh and clear. After they have shrivelled, we recommend placing them in water for at least 24 hours before planting. They should be looked at every week or so to see that they are not drying too much. If they are, moisture can be applied by sprinkling the tops of the containers. I am very sorry that I cannot be present to deliver this informa - tion in person. I am sure that there would be many questions in the minds of the prospective dahlia growers. I will be glad to answer all correspondence with reference to methods of growing, as well as varieties. Discussion Question: What is Mr. Smiley's address? Answer: He lives at Seward, Nebraska in the winter time and at Beaver Crossing in the summer. Question: Does he have Dahlias for sale? Answer: I don't know if he does at the present time or not. He does not seem to have any great number of any one variety. </seg>
            <seg id="p506">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE WEDNESDAY MORNING JAN. 9 Plant Industry, 1st floor MR. BANNING: Let's start on time and get through on time. "We have been waiting on Porter. We can start now. We are glad to see as many orchardmen out this morning because I think the problem this morning is something we are all interested in. Most of us have realized the conditions in the past, especially, financially in the orchard game. We have had some disappointments and there are some serious questions ahead of us at the present time. Last season was rather disasterous. Crop frosted in the beginning and hot dry weather later cooked things. However, the apple growers came out better in the end than did some of the other farmers. There are some things I want to call your attention to and among them, in my opinion, is the marketing of our fruits. We are not united. We have differences of opinions in grading fruit. One grower may judge an apple as grade "A" while I or someone else may judge it grade "B". I believe we should get on a uniform basis. We should have a law relative to grading of fruit. The surplus fruit from the west is flooding our markets. As you probably know the west has been exporting several thousands of cars of apples each year. Gradually this export market has been closed and as a result the middle west is being flooded with cheap western fruit. The packed fruit from the west is not a serious threat to the marketing of our fruit but the bulk shipments that are packed here or sold in loose bushels is marketing that stuff in competition to our own home grown fruit curtainly com - plicates our problem. I think we should make a study of the problem and get suitable legislation to remedy the situation. We tried to get it through once but it died on the next day. There are other serious problems confronting us but these will be discussed by Mr. Wiggans and Mr. Yocum. We are facing situations that should be met at once. On the program this morning, our first speaker is Prof. Yocum on "How Apple Tree Roots Develop". That is one of the very important subjects. BOOT DEVELOPMENT OF APPLE TREES by W. W. Yocum The importance of the roots of our fruit trees has been generally underestimated in relation to all orchard practices. Although in the handling of trees under most situations the first results are ob - tained upon the roots. Such orchard operations as transplanting, cultivation, fertilizing and cover cropping influence the roots directly </seg>
            <seg id="p507">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY and the tops indirectly. The factors in the soil environment, as soil moisture, soil structure and texture, acidity, organic matter and the water table, influence the roots more directly than they do the tops. In spite of all this the top part of the tree has been and will con - tinue to be most used to measure results or indicate the condition of the tree: First because they are easier to measure; and second, be - cause roots are of little economic value of themselves alone. How - ever, we should appreciate the importance of the root system and its relation to the well being of the tree. The main part of this study of apple root development has been a study of young Delicious trees for 3 years after transplanting. Be - fore I go into the main part of my subject, however, I wish to give a little review of background information. In the first place apple seed - lings have a decided tap root development. When these seedlings are dug for grafting purposes 12 to 18 inches of this tap root is recovered. This tap root is generally cut up into 2 or 3 pieces and used to propa - gate as many apple trees. This digging and cutting up of the tap root tends to destroy the tap root type of development in the apple tree. The young apple grafts are grown for two or three years, usually, in the nursery before they are dug and sold for orchard planting. In this time they have developed quite an extensive root system, as you can see from the pictures. When these trees are dug in the nursery the roots are cut off about 15 to 18" deep and about one foot away from the trunk to the side, (indicated by line on the picture). You can readily realize what a shock it is to a tree to have such a large portion of its root system cut away suddenly. Certainly no statistics or figures are necessary to emphasize this point. This extremely severe pruning of the root systems is the main reason for pruning the tops of young trees heavily at transplanting time. Young trees, when transplanted to the orchard site are usually set about 3 inches deeper than they grew in the nursery row. The hole in which they are set should be dug large enough to allow the roots to be spread put in approximately their normal position, without being cramped or crowded, or sharply bent. As new roots develop most of them seem, to come first from the cut ends of the main roots. Later they seem to arise from any position on the main roots or even on the trunk above the graft. The most ideal root system for most plants, I think we can safely assume, is one which occupies the largest volume of soil, from which it can draw an abundance of moisture and food. In a humid climate or a wet location we would expect and usually do find that fruit trees are shallow rooted. In less humid regions such as ours, fruit trees are more deeply rooted. </seg>
            <seg id="p508">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Oskamp has found from rather extensive investigations in New York state that the depth of rooting of mature Baldwin apple trees ranges from 1 % to 8 % ft. in the areas investigated. Shallow rooting, he found, was associated with a condition in which the ground water is close to the surface during the spring of the year or in which the subsoil is a compact gravelly clay or a combination of both conditions. The most unfavorable orchard location he found, was accompanied by a high ground-water level. In eastern Nebraska it seems reasonable to assume that the ideal root system of an apple tree is one which has both great depth and lateral spread. In an ideal orchard soil like the loess of the Missouri River hills and under suitable growing conditions I believe we will find that such is the case. However, various conditions may inter - fere with the ideal or normal development of the tree root system. Since moisture is the chief limiting factor, to plant growth here, any treatment which changes moisture conditions will probably modify the tree root system. You may be asking, "Isn't heredity a factor in determining the type of root system which a plant develops"? Yes, that is true, as our nurserymen can testify. There are rather marked variations in type of rooting in the different varieties of one fruit like the apple. But on the other hand one particular type of root development can be greatly modified by environment, as you will see from our studies. It was for the purpose of gaining more information on this parti - cular point, that an investigation was started in the spring of 1932. The effect of various cultural treatments upon root development of apple trees has been studied in particular. It is a common practice in developing orchards in the Missouri Valley to intercrop with corn for 4 to 6 years. So the effect of corn grown between the trees has been studied. Straw and paper mulches are used considerably in some sections in growing vegetables and small fruits and to a less degree for tree fruits. So the effects of straw and paper mulches have been studied. Trees that are neglected have to compete with grass and weeds, so a few trees have been studied that were grown under sod mulch. Fertilizers carrying nitrogen and phosphorus are often user for mature trees so have been tested on young trees. Clean cultivated trees have been studied and their root growth compared with that of trees grown with corn and with the different mulching and fertilizer treatments. I should explain that the apple trees used in all these studies were all Delicious trees of one nursery grade, 11/16 inch. They were selected carefully from the nursery stocks in order to have them as uniform as </seg>
            <seg id="p509">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY possible. Trees were chosen which had their roots evenly distributed on all sides. These trees were planted about the middle of April, 1932, and pruned back uniformly to a leader and one lateral branch. About one-half of them were planted at Lincoln, and the others at the Uni - versity Fruit Farm at Union in loess soil. This enables us to get a comparison between the effects of the soil and climate of the two loca - tions. Clean cultivated trees were grown in each location. At Lin - coln the trees under the various mulches have been grown. Those planted at Union have been intercropped with corn or have received fertilizer applications. The original plan of the experiment called for the digging of about one-third of the trees under the various treatments at the end of one growing season. Another third was to be dug after the second season and the remainder at the end of the third season of growth. We have noylr reached the end of the third growth period. About 30 trees were dug at the end of the first, and another 30 at the end of the second season. I can report quite fully on the results from the first and second diggings. But the digging that is now under way has not gone far enough to give much additional information after the third growing season. We have about 20 trenches opened up at Union and Lincoln but drawings have been completed on only 2 trees. More will be saidi about them at another time. I think that it will now be necessary to explain how we went about it to check the effects of the various growth conditions, or treatments upon the tree roots. After one year of growth the trees which were chosen for study were dug out as completely as possible. A trench was dug about four feet from the tree, to a depth of 5 or 6 feet. By picking into the side of the trench slowly and carefully the roots were dis - covered and excavated. When the tip of a root was located the root was tagged giving in inches the depth of the root tip and the lateral spread of the root and its direction from the trunk. After all the roots of the tree were thus uncovered and tagged the tree was then taken indoors and the roots were spread out in as near their natural position as possible and drawings were made of them. One drawing was made looking down onto the root system from directly above. The other drawing was made after dividing the roots along the north and south line. All the roots which grew east of this line were drawn on the right side of the /picture and those west of it to the left. The roots were first pinned up on a wall board in their proper depth position. The drawings are on cross-ruled paper, with each square inch representing one square foot. Now for the comparisons of these drawings. At the end of the </seg>
            <seg id="p510">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE first season of growth the roots did not show very much difference in development under the different cultural treatments. In the Lincoln mulching series the trees receiving straw mulch had the most exten - sive root development, but only slightly better than clean cultivated and a little more shallow. The root development under paper and sod mulch was similar in distribution to the clean cultivated but it was dwarfed somewhat. The average extreme spread of roots was 45 inches under straw, 44.5 under clean culture, 42 under paper and 36 inches under sod. The average extreme depth of rooting under cultivation was 34 inches, straw — 34 inches; sod — 38 inches, and under paper 39 inches. In the corn series at Union at the end of the first year's growth slight differences could be noted in the growth of the apple roots. Corn was planted at three distances from the tree row, 3 % , 5 and 7 feet. In the first season the corn was planted soon after the trees were set. Competition between the trees and corn was therefore more or less equal the first season. Corn roots grow out to the center of the tree row to some extent in all 3 spacings. The tree root system with corn nearest the tree was smallest in depth and lateral spread, through the general distribution of tree roots was much the same for the three spacings of corn. Clean cultivation produced root development very much like the 7 foot spacing of corn. So this widest spacing of corn did not seem to disturb the tree at all. We will turn now to the root system as they appeared after the sec - ond season of growth. The root systems had extended so far after two season's growth that it was not practical to excavate them com - pletely, as was done after the first year of growth. Instead a trench was dug about two feet from the trunk and enough roots were picked out of the face of the trench to give a cross-section view of the root system. Cross section drawings of the root systems were then made. With this method from % to near % of the root system was pictured. Rather marked changes in tree root development resulted from the different treatments in the second growing season. When corn grew 3.5 ft. from the trees, the lateral spread of the tree roots was much restricted. Most of the tree roots turned downward in a zone about 4 ft. in diameter. Apparently the corn had so dried out the soil on either side of the tree that most all tree roots were forced to turn downward to find a satisfactory moisture supply. The average extreme depth of rooting was greatest here and a larger number of roots reached this greater depth. The few roots which developed laterally probably made their greatest extension after the death of the corn, for they were very young roots. But with corn spaced only 3.5 ft. from the tree few lateral roots crossed the first corn row. </seg>

As corn was grown farther and farther from the trees there was a gradual change to a more spreading type of root development. With corn 7 ft. away the root system approached the form produced under clean cultivation, although there was not as much spread of roots in the upper 3rd or 4th foot of soil. This 7 foot spacing of corn seemed to slightly disturb the normal development of the tree root system. The extreme depth of rooting, 11 to 14% feet, did not vary much with the different spacings of corn, though more roots penetrated deeply with the close spacing. Trees grown near by under clean culture were not as deeply rooted, averaging about 11% feet. Their lateral spread was greater, 8 to 10% feet from the trunk, as compared to 5 to 6 feet with the 7 foot spacing of corn. We will turn again to the mulching series of trees at Lincoln after their second season of growth. These trees showed marked differ- </seg>

            <seg id="p513">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY ences In both vigor and distribution of roots. The root systems under sod and paper mulch were still very similar in type to those under clean cultivation, except that they were considerably dwarfed in both lateral and vertical growth. The trees under straw mulch had very spreading root systems. Most of the roots grew horizontally in the upper two feet of soil, 9 to 10% feet from the trunk or a total root spread of 18 to 21 feet diameter. Some roots grew downward under straw to about the same depth as under cultivation, but these vertical roots were much more numerous under cultivation. Under clean cultivation the roots extended out from the trunk laterally an average of about 7 % feet at Lincoln, while at Union in loess soil this spread was about 9 feet or a total spread each way from the trunk of 15 and 18 feet respectively. These figures certainly do not conform to old ideas which all of us have heard expressed, as, "the spread of the roots of a tree equals the spread of the branches", or "the height of the tree equals the spread of the roots." These common statements may be true in some parts of the country but they are certainly not true under Nebraska conditions. Now as to the effect of the nitrate and phosphate fertilizers upon the root development of young apple trees little needs to be said. No beneficial effect has been observed, for the root development was practical the same as that of other clean cultivated trees. Doubtless this soil contains a sufficient amount of these nutrients so that they do not limit the growth of the trees at this age. The most striking information revealed by this study thus far is; first, the way in which the moisture supply affects the root develop - ment; and second the amazing rate of root growth of these two year old apple trees. The extreme depth of rooting averaged about 8% ft. at Lincoln and 12 ft. at Union under clean cultivation. With the intercropping of corn the roots reached an extreme depth of 11 to 14% ft. in two years. The average extreme distance reached by lateral roots under clean culture was 7% ft. at Lincoln and 9 ft. at Union. Under straw at Lincoln the extreme distance reached by lateral roots was about 10 feet. This means that the volume of soil occupied by one 2 year old tree had a diameter of about 20 feet. No doubt you are wondering about the extent of rooting in the case of older fruit trees. We have also been curious on this point and have made some investigations. A 6 year old Jonathan tree growing at Lincoln was excavated as completely as possible in 1932. Most of the main roots extended twice as far as the branches and some roots three times as far, or a distance of 17 to 23 feet from the trunk. This tree was rooted only about 7 feet deep. </seg>
            <seg id="p514">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE in June 1934 two excavations were started in the commercial orchard at Union, beside Jonathan and Duchess trees that were 17 years old. The Jonathan tree is in a planting without fillers, and the Duchess is a filler tree between Jonathan permanents. In each case a trench was first dug midway between the tree rows on the north and west sides of these two trees. These trenches on the two sides of a tree were extended until they met at the center of the square formed by four trees. These L shaped trenches were 3 feet wide and were deepened until the extreme depth of tree roots was reached. The extreme depth reached was 33 feet under the permanent Jonathan tree and 3 0 feet under the Duchess filler. The Jonathan roots had gone through the loess soil and in some places about 3 feet into a very hard red clay. As the trenches were dug downward a record was taken from each wall, of the number, size and location of all cut roots. This made it possible to determine the distribution of roots. After the extreme depth of the trench was reached the soil remaining on the inside of the "L" was removed in vertical sections 3 feet wide, until the pit was changed into a rectangle cornering directly under the tree. Records were taken from each wall as the soil was re - moved. A similar record was taken from the bottom of the trenches at each 6 foot depth or each time the trench was lowered 6 feet. The data collected in this has been only partially digested so a full report is not yet possible on this phase of the root study. A few general statements may be made, however. The soil throughout the area explored and to the depth indicated was occupied by roots. The soil nearer the surface and more directly under the tree had the greater concentration of roots, as would naturally be expected. As the soil nearer the tree was dried out the roots grew deeper and more wide spreading, seeking new reserves of moisture. As to just how much reserve moisture is available to such trees Professor Wiggans will indicate in his report. Discussion Question: What do you think of mulching? Answer: It seems to me it would be a dangerous practice if con - tinued long. When mulching is started the first year and continued the roots develop just under the mulch and fail to develop as well down deep as under cultivation. Question: Why does the paper mulch show up better than straw? Answer: It doesn't. Under paper the roots are dwarfed in every way, perhaps because of less moisture and higher soil temperature. If straw mulch is continued too long, it might get one into trouble also. At the rate these roots grow sideways, you would soon need to have your entire surface covered with straw. That would be dangerous as </seg>
            <seg id="p515">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY a fire hazard. Also after some years the shallow rooted trees would be more easily damaged by severe drouth and strong winds. Question: If you started out, would you plant corn at all? Answer: Yes, but not so close as we are accustomed to. Perhaps somewhere from five to seven feet would be a safe distance the first year. The second year at least seven feet away from the trees. Question: Do you think it best to crop in between? That is financially? Answer: I don't know as to that. I know it is more difficult to care for the trees if corn is inter planted. If no corn is planted, very little hand work needs to be done. The trouble generally is if corn is planted, the tree rows are allowed to grow up in weeds and grass and you then have to put more hand work on your trees. If no corn is planted you could cultivate crossways as well and very little hand work would be required. Whether it pays to grow corn would depend on the price of corn. When corn doesn't bring cost of production there is nothing gained and much lost. Statement: Corn would be somewhat of a protection to the trees. Answer: Possibly. But sometimes it is a detriment to the develop - ment of the trees. Question: Your charts show that trees root deeply directly under the tree when corn is interplanted. Wouldn't this situation be changed when corn is no longer grown. Answer: If you remove the corn, no doubt, these roots are going to reach out to the side. These deep roots that are now deep will spread sideways. They will adjust themselves to the changed condi - tions and lack of competition. Question: How far will the roots of a 17 year old tree extend. Answer: We did follow one clear out to the end. They must have gone out at least 35 or 40 feet clear across the next row. The Missouri people worked this out and as I have it Dr. Murneek has found trees with roots over in the second middle probably 40 feet away. Statement: I am under the impression trees need more room under the ground than above. Answer: Yes, you are right. Question: This last year was there danger of cutting off the roots and injuring the tree where the ground was disced deeply. Answer: I don't think so. In such a dry condition, there would </seg>
            <seg id="p516">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE be no live roots close to the surface. If live roots are cut off they are replaced rapidly when conditions are favorable for their de - velopment. Question: Some people had the opinion with a dry year like this, some of the roots were low and some were very high. Think there is anything to that? Answer: I think these roots can come to the surface very rapidly. The apple roots do grow all winter long and probably throughout the year and as soon as you get moisture in the soil, new roots would form. It would take them but a few days to grow two or three inches. Statement: I think it is fair to say the roots under the tree are up closer to the surface than way out in the middles. Answer: Yes, I don't think we need to worry about roots coming too close to the surface. Question: If you plow deep in the orchard every year, will you cut off roots every time? I know they do plow very deep in some orchards. Answer: Do you actually use a plow? Statement: Yes. Answer: Most people use other implements. Statement: I made a trip through Oregon some months ago and saw an apple and prune orchard that was plowed 14 times during the summer because they didn't get any rainfall all summer. »■ In my orchard we plow every year and plow off quite large roots every year. How deep do our roots go when we hit water at 15 feet. They don't go any deeper, do they? Answer: No they don't. Question: I should think root pruning would be much less serious with you than in many other sections. Statement: During last summer the trees showed the drouth. The fruit suffered earlier and the unirrigated orchards in our locality really didn't have any fruit on them that was valuable. I irrigated mine at this time. In a few days the fruit recovered and developed normally. Those tree roots really weren't getting enough water from the subsoil even though our water table is only 8-10 feet down. Statement: The reason for this must have been that your water level dropped below the depth of the roots. Statement: A tree that normally has an abundant water supply </seg>
            <seg id="p517">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY may not develop such a large root system as these others. In extreme heat and drought such trees suffer more than do trees that have more roots in proportion to top. I heard Mr. Franklin say the trees in the low ground suffered more than those on the hills. Question: Wasn't the trouble this year not so much the lack of water supply to the roots but rather the excessive evaporation from the leaves? Answer: I believe that was the case. A number of stations reported that damage from heat and drought resulted even when the soil was wet. Leaves and fruit wilted per - ceptibly even tho 4 or 5 inches of water were applied per week. No doubt the rate of transpiration from the leaves, due to unusually low humidity and intense heat, was so great that the moisture evaporated could not be entirely replaced by translocation from the soil thru the roots and conducting the tissues. When the leaves can not secure sufficient moisture from the roots, the moisture is drawn from the fruit, causing it to wilt. Question: Do you think discing this summer was better than no discing at all? Answer: If the weeds were dead there was no object in discing. In fact discing might be detrimental in that moist soil would be turned up that would dry out. Should it rain there would be that additional dry dirt to wet up before the soil beneath could get any moisture. Statement: I disced thoroughly both ways but my fruit wasn't as large as a neighbors who didn't disc at all. Answer: There might be other factors besides the discing that are responsible for the difference in size. Statement: Some orchards grow up in weeds and some grow up in sweet clover. In these cases, hardly any water ran off but was held there and stored in the subsoil. Orchards that have never been culti - vated have grown apples as big as any I have ever seen. Answer: Clean cultivation is not sound practice in orchards on rolling ground. Too much danger of erosion and run off. A coven crop of some low growing legume like lespideza is good. Allowing the an - nual weeds like crab grass and fox tail to develop and then mowing two or three times during the summer is the next best thing. MR. BANNING: I think we will have to continue with our pro - gram. Next will come, The Effects of Orchards on Subsoil Moisture by Prof. Wiggans.

            <seg id="p518">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE THE EFFECTS OF ORCHARDS ON SUBSOIL MOISTURE By C. C. Wiggans v v The drouth endured by the central west the past summer has served to make the average man much more water conscious than he has been accustomed to be. Again the old saying "we never miss the water until the well runs dry" has been proven. When for week after week no rainfall of consequence came it seemed unbelievable that plants could survive and yet after all this period of dry weather a very large share of our orchard trees came through apparently in good shape. Although the full effects of the drouth will not be known for a number of years, it is evident that it takes more than one dry year to get the best of a good orchard tree. However, it is evident to anyone who gives the matter thought that moisture from some source was available for the use of the tree during the dry period or the tree would have perished immediately. It is the purpose of this paper to discuss briefly this hidden moisture source. This is not the first time that the question of moisture for trees has been discussed before this society. In the annual report for 1899 is found an article by Dr. C. E. Bessey in which this statement occurs. "I have no doubt but that a common apple tree 20 feet high in Nebraska in an average season will lose close to 1500 barrels of water through the leaves". No data concerning apple tree requirements are present - ed — this figure being arrived at by reasoning from some results secured in Germany by a physiologist working with an oak tree. Regardless of the accuracy of the reasoning it is evident that the thou - sands of leaves on the tree do transpire large amounts of water in per - forming their functions, — and all of this water must come from the soil. Whenever plants reach the point where insufficient moisture is available one of two things happens, either the plant adjusts itself to the reduced supply as in the case of cactus and other desert plants, or the leaves wilt, finally turn brown and drop off. In extreme cases the plant, of course, will die, but this point may be delayed for a con - siderable time during which the plant barely subsists and is entirely unable to properly function as a fruit producing organism. General observations and historical accounts leads one to the conclusion that Nebraska orchards seldom last more than 40 years. The present crop of bearing orchards in this state will average less than 25 years in age. Few plantings reach the 50. year mark whereas in other more humid sections the same varieties last much longer. Is it not possible that the true explanation of the relatively short life of the old Ben Davis plantings lies not wholly in the disease realm but also to a very considerable degree in the field of moisture relations? </seg>
            <seg id="p519">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY The work of men in the Department of Agronomy perhaps offers some interesting material on this question. Anderson, Kiesselbach, Russell and Tysdal, after making many determinations in alfalfa fields concluded that alfalfa does remove great quantities of water from the Bubsoil during the first few years of its growth. During this period production is not entirely dependent on annual precipition — in fact a considerable crop can be grown without rainfall, — the subsoil mois - ture being the sole source of water. Eventually, however, available subsoil moisture is used up. Then production immediately drops and becomes absolutely dependent upon the annual rainfall. This point is usualy reached about the fifth or sixth year. Fields which have become depleted of available subsoil moisture regain or restore this supply very slowly. Further interest in the subsoil moisture problem was stimulated by some root studies made during the past summer at the University Fruit Farm. In this work it was found that a 17 year old Jonathan tree had roots to an extreme depth of 30-35 feet and that the root spread covered all the available space between the trees, when they were spaced 30x33 feet. The above situation differs materially from that reported by Oskamp in some studies made in New York where roots seldom pene - trated deeper than eight feet and in some cases only three or four. There, however, the water table level and soil conditions determined very largely the depth to which roots needed to go or in fact could go. Kxperimental Methods. The material upon which this paper and the accompanying charts is based was secured from sampling done during the past summer and fall. The sampling method is simple. A sampling tube, properly pointed is driven into the ground. When lifted out by means of a pipe jack it contains a core of soil from 1 to 5 feet long and about % inch in diameter. This is divided into one foot sections which are placed in suitable containers. These are weighed, dried and then weighed again. The moisture percentage is based on the dry weight of soil. Tube sections of convenient length are joined by a threaded plug and permit sampling at considerable depth. The deepest samples taken in this work came from the 38 foot level. Large roots may interef ere with sampling near the tree and a rock or gravel may foul the point also. In dealing with soil moisture one must always keep in mind the fact that not all the water held by the soil is available for plant use. This unavailable supply is called hygroscopic water and the amount varies with the soil type. Sand for instance, has a very low hygrosco - pic coifficient and clay a high one. The figures given in the charts </seg>
            <seg id="p520">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE for hygroscopic water were supplied by the Department of Agronomy as representative for that particular district. Available water, is the difference between the total content and the hygroscopic water. Ac - cording to soil experts eastern Nebraska soils are capable of carrying something over two inches of available water per foot of depth. Total water holding capacity is sometimes spoken of as Held carrying capacity. Water beyond this amount cannot be held against gravitation but percolates to great depths or is carried away through layers of sand or gravel. Interest in these determinations, which must be considered as only preliminary, centered mainly about these questions. 1. What is the effect of density of planting on subsoil moisture? 2. What is the effect of the age of the tree upon this reserve at varying distances from the tree? 3. What is the residual effect of an earlier orchard crop upon the amount now avilable? 4. Do all varieties affect soil moisture in a comparable fashion? 5. Do all species of tree fruits affect it to the same degree? 6. What is the effect of tree species other than fruit upon avail - able moisture? As indicated above the conclusions given below should be con - sidered only as tentative ones. Not enough samples were taken and not enough orchards sampled to permit positive statements. The results are suggestive, however, and they are presented now for your consideration. Effect of tree density. At the University Fruit Farm at Union a portion of the orchard contains fillers and another does not. The spacing of the permanents is 30x33 feet and the fillers are planted midway between the four permanents rather than midway in one of the rows. This gives a better distribution of the trees. This spacing gives approximately 43 and 86 trees per acre in the two plantings. The trees are now 17 years of age. Samples were taken to 30 foot depths (1) near a Blacktwig tree in the filler block; (2) midway between the trees in the filler block; (3) near a Blacktwig tree in the permanent block; (4) midway be - tween trees in the row in the permanent block; (5) midway of diagonal between trees in the permanent block; (6) in an adjacent area which has never produced orchard trees. Results are given in graphic form in Chart 1. </seg>

            <seg id="p523">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY Conclusions to be drawn may be stated briefly: (1) In the filler block samples at both stations gave moisture percentages down nearly to the hygroscopic point. Thus these trees have utilized in 17 years possibly 70-75 inches more water than they have been able to secure from annual rainfall. (2) In the permanent block conditions near the tree were quite comparable to those in the filler block but at distances of 15 and 22.3 feet from the tree there remains still considerable Available water for future growth. Apparently, however, these trees have already drawn somewhat upon this reserve when the water con - tent of the field sample is considered. Unfortunately sampling was discontinued at 30 feet and hence, there is no information of condi - tions beyond that point. Effect of tree age. Samples were taken at Shubert in the 17 year old Slocum planting, in an adjoining 7 year old planting and in an im - planted pasture area. Holes were made near the trees and also in the center of the tree space. Results are shown in Chart 2. In the older planting, spaced 22x33, the soil has been dried out severely to a depth of 18-20 feet while in the center of the space there is still some available moisture below the ten foot level. On the other hand, the center region in the young planting has not yet been affected even though directly underneath the tree severe drying out to a depth of ten feet is evident. It will be noted in this chart that all lines converge at about 20 feet showing that the trees have had no influence on conditions below this point. This is probably due to soil conditions which make it impossible for roots to penetrate more deeply. Residual effect of earlier orchard growth. In the L. L. Franklin orchard near Falls City was found a situation where a young planting was growing where an older orchard had been pulled out. The first planting was made in 1890 and then cleared away in 1922. It was of the Ben Davis variety and had become badly cankered. The land was farmed to ordinary crops for six years. The second orchard was set in 1928 and at the same time an adjoining area which had never produced apple trees was also planted. Chart 3 shows the situation which apparently prevails in comparable locations in these plantings and also in an adjoining 35 year old planting. Spacings are 22x33 feet. It will be noted that again a 7 year old tree has had a serious ■effect on subsoil moisture to a depth of 8-10 feet but that is no ap - preciable influence yet on the moisture content in the middle of the tree space. In the replanted section, however, only one-half as much reserve is available for future use, even in the center of the space, as in the case of the virgin planting. In the older planting there has </seg>

Apparently, therefore, the growth of one crop of trees will seriously handicap the production of a second orchard, if this second orchard is planted too soon. This may furnish, also a plausible explanation of why replants, particularly in old orchards, make such a poor showing. The difference between the time for the old orchard and that for the replanted area may represent restoration which occurred between 1922 and 1928. Varietal effect. While not at all conclusive, some figures taken from sampling in the Jonathan and Blacktwig blocks at Union sug - gest that here may be one explanation as to why varieties suffered in varying degrees from last summer drouth. (It is also recognized that the extreme temperatures played their part in causing damage.) While no chart is shown, yet the determinations indicate (1) that the soil underneath Blacktwig trees is dried out to a greater depth than under Jonathan trees but (2) that soil in the middle of the Blacktwig area has more available moisture than at comparable shallow depths in the Jonathan block. These may indicate that Janothan roots do not pentrate quite so deeply even though they are more widespread than in the case of the Blacktwig. Effect of orchard species'. In a twelve year old planting near Lin - coln plums and cherries were used as fillers for apples — the latter being spaced 30x35 feet. Samples were taken from the center the area as well as from near the trees of the respective species. Apparently the apple and cherry make a heavier draft on soil mois - ture than does the plum tree. In the two former species the soil beneath the tree was near the hygroscopic point down to a level of 15 feet while with the plum there was almost as much water still unused as was found in the center of the space. The curve found for the vineyard soil was comparable to that of the plum. Kffect of forest tree species. At Lincoln on the Experiment Station grounds there is a planting of catalpa and ash spaced 4 to 6 feet and Approximately 30 years old. Samples were taken in these groves as well as in the pine windbreak around the orchard and under various other groups of pines and catalpa. Two samples were also taken in the pine grove in Arbor Lodge State Park at Nebraska City. In all cases there has been a decided depletion of subsoil moisture in fact in most instances the amount of available water is very small. There seems to be no reason to believe that the effect of such plant - ings should be essentially different from those found in orchards. There undoubtedly will be species variations however. Pine groves showed a decided depletion to approximately 25 feet but ash and catalpa apparently make use of water from greater depths. </seg>
            <seg id="p526">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Conclusions From the foregoing evidence, sketchy and incomplete though it may be, one can hardly escape the conviction that trees as grown la eastern Nebraska have used more water than they have secured from annual rainfall. To be sure the last two or three seasons have been unusually dry but even so it hardly seems reasonable to attribute to these conditions the great drying which has occurred at such extreme depths in orchards or groves. Rather, should one reason that as soon as a tree is planted it begins to draw ."upon subsoil moisture for its needs above and beyond those filled by annual rainfall. The rate at which this proceeds and the extent to which it will go depends there - fore, not only upon the yearly precipitation but also upon the number of trees per acre. The original soil moisture content likewise has its influence since if there is a small amount of available water to begin with, it cannot last so long. Undoubtedly the length of life of Nebraska orchards and other tree growth is definitely limited by these factors. Regardless of this hazard, however, Nebraska orchardists are pro - ducing splendid apples from trees now bearing and they will and should continue to put out new fruit acreages. They should and undoubtedly will give more consideration to the moisture problem. In old orchards, therefore, removal of a part of the trees will give more available rainfall for the remainder while more attention paid to run - off prevention will greatly increase the amount of water available for tree growth. There seems no reason to suppose that there isn't suf - ficient rainfall to grow tree crops if such rainfall can be conserved for their use. If supplemental water is available it, of course, would solve the problem. There is a possibility that if the depleted sub - soil could be again filled to capacity it would carry even mature plantings for a number of years. , With respect to young plantings the facts presented point very definitely toward, 1 — the use only of land which has never been planted to orchards or has not been depleted by alfalfa. 2 — The use of wider spacings with the possible elimination of fillers. Filler varieties are often more profitable than permanent sorts — in fact are sometimes permanent varieties planted double thickness and almost invariably filler trees remain too long. 3 — The use of every practical means of conserving annual rainfall, even during the early life of the orchard, by terracing the proposed orchard area and by contour planting. These preliminary facts show rather conclusively why commercial plantings have been and probably always will be confined to the south - eastern part of the state except in those rare cases where irrigation, either surface or underground, may be available. This is due not only </seg>
            <seg id="p527">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY to temperature relations but also to the fact that subsoil moisture conditions are much more favorable naturally in this region than in other parts of the state. Also, soil texture is such that rainfall can be absorbed much more readily when it does come. However, because of topographic conditions considerable more thought must be given to proper measures for the prevention of rainfall loss through run-off. Orchardists, therefore, should seek the most favorable sites for future plantings, so as to lessen as far as possible this loss. Question: According to your theory, then you wouldn't think of putting out a young orchard where an old one had died? Answer: No sir, I will tell you why later. Question: Can we by holding the normal rainfall expect the sub - soil moisture to be replaced? Answer: Mr. Russel will answer that later this afternoon. Question: What kind of soil is this particular orchard located on (the Slocum orchard west of Shubert) ? Answer: I don't know just what you would call it. The subsoil is sort of a stiff clay. This is not as good a soil as that at Union, Ne - braska. At Union the loess soil is much deeper than at Shubert. East of Shubert the loess is also deeper. I would say that generally the closer to the Missouri river the deeper the loess and the further from the river the more shallow is the loess. Question: What is the maximum per cent of moisture that the loess soil can hold. Answer: It varies between 25 and 30%, the finer the silt the higher is the water holding capacity up to about 30% as a maximum. Question: I know of a piece of timberland near the river which has been cleared off which grows the best apples and has for years. This land was covered with forest trees for years. Is the moisture situa - tion here likely to be similar to that under the older orchards or is it likely to be more nearly like the blue grass pasture subsoil. Answer: I don't know. I just can't answer that question. Before I say yes or no, I would like to see some deep subsoil samples taken in this orchard and to compare these with some taken in an orchard of similar age which had been planted on ground that had never been in trees nor in alfalfa. MR. RUSSEL: Pardon me Mr. Wiggans, I would like to say some - thing right here that will connect up with my talk this afternoon. </seg>
            <seg id="p528">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Our figures, and we took numbers of samples, showed the heavy rains that fell in 1929 were able to penetrate down to a depth of 12 to 15 feet and even further. That was the year that the Auburn weather station showed 59 inches of rainfall; Pall City reported 49 inches. In years such as 19 29 with the type of subsoil you have along the Missouri river, the moisture will go to great depths. In these soils the percola- ■ ,tion of water is rapid. Mr. Wiggans estimated that trees of bearing age would remove 12-15 inches of water from the soil. Then there was left between 30 and 40 inches of water allowing for some runoff. It takes about 2 to 2% inches to wet one foot of soil, so the upper 15 to 20 feet were probably soaked up in that one year. MR. WIGGANS continued — Question: What was the effect of that replanting? How are the trees doing? Answer: The trees are growing all right. I doubt if you can tell any difference. In the upper ten feet, there is no difference in subsoil moisture. Question: Don't you think there is a chance in planting young trees of pretty nearly always having one or two rainy years before the trees reach bearing age. Answer: Yes, if you can guess right on the rainy years. Question: We have two orchards that were planted the same year but of different varieties. The one planted on new ground is at least a third larger. They are ten years old. Answer: Well, there you are, that hears out what I have said. MR.

Dear Mr. Wallace: The Nebraska Horticultural Society in its annual meeting at Lin - coln January 10th passed the following resolution and instructed me </seg>
            <seg id="p529">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY as Secretary to transmit to you for your consideration the following resolution. Whereas: The ruling of the Food and Drug Administration of the II. S. Department of Agriculture limiting the tolerance of lead to .019 grams per pound of fruit for the year 1935 is considered arbitrary and detrimental to the interests of the apple growers of this and other states, — we the fruit growers of Nebraska and Members of the Horticultural Society in meeting assembled at Lincoln, January 10, respectfully suggest that the lead tolerance be raised from .019 to .025 grains per pound of fruit. Our reasons for this request are: 1. The codling moth is becoming a more serious pest each year. The Experiment Stations of the states and that of the Department of Agriculture have not found a substitute for lead arenate that is as safe and effective in controlling this pest. 2. Lead removal methods so far developed can not be depended upon to reduce the lead residue to .019 per pound of fruit without endangering the keeping quality of the fruit. 3. Nearly everyone who cooks or eats apples discards the ends of the core which usually contain' as much or more residue as does the rest of the apple; naturally the consumer would not be affected by the residue contained in the basin or cavity. It is therefore manifestly unfair to include these core ends In the tests by which the amount ot spray residue is determined. 4. In view of these facts, a tolerance of .025 for lead would not endanger human health and we believe a lower tolerance is not war - ranted at present. MR.

Wood, Extension Engineer, University of Nebraska Much has been said and written the last few years about the con - servation of moisture in the central and western parts of Nebraska. The need for conserving moisture in the orchard lands of eastern coun - ties is a comparatively recent development brought to the attention of fruit growers by observation and research, the results of which are given elsewhere in this publication. The orchard areas in the south eastern counties are of rolling to - hilly topography, many of the slopes ranging from 6 to. 12 per cent </seg>
            <seg id="p530">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE or more. During the hundreds of years when the land was covered with native prairie grass, erosion made little headway and the sub - soil accumulated a reserve supply of moisture due to the fact that there was little run-off from vegetated hillsides. The settler's plow brought about a rapid change in conditions, however. Erosion soon removed a greated part of the absorbent top soil exposing a less absor - bent layer beneath. During rains of considerable intensity, the sur - face becomes puddled and as a result there is considerable loss of water which runs away down a gully to the Missouri river. The orchards which have been planted are rectangular in shape conforming with the system of land surveys and the tree rows are laid out parellel to the fence lines. In many cases this practice has re - sulted in rows running over steep slopes which have eroded badly when cultivated. Gullies have formed forcing owners to no little ex - pense in the construction of ditch checks as a temporary means of con - trol. Aside from the loss of soil, there is a considerable loss of much needed moisture. It is the purpose of this paper to point out methods by which erosion can be retarded and at least some of the run-off water retained where it falls. Research has shown that the older orchards have suffered consider - ably from a lack of moisture in the sub-soil. It has been suggested and observations seem to substantiate the fact that an orchard tree in this region thrives while the roots are penerating soil having a reserve supply but when this available reserve is used up, the tree lives "from hand to mouth" on what little enters the top soil or it dies prematurely from thirst. Certainly this condition can be helped if some of the water which now runs away can be put into the earth again. It has been pointed out that straight rows have resulted in erosion and erosion always means that water is escaping to the lower ground! Then why not place rows on the contour or around the slope of the hill instead of up and down the slope. It is a well known fact that terracing and contour farming in the case of field crops accomplishes the very purpose for which the orchard owner is striving. The terrac - ing of orchard land is not new, by the way. It has been used for the control of erosion in the southeastern states. At the Hayes, Kansas Experiment Station an orchard was planted on terraced land some years ago for the purpose of conserving moisture. The tree rows follow the terrace lines and the layout is so designed that practically all of the water falling on the hillside is held for use of the trees. Let us look at a typical orchard layout on a small field with tree rows laid out parallel to the fence lines as shown in Figure 1. [n Figure 2, is shown the same field terraced with the tree rows arranged on the contour and planted on terraced ridges. </seg>

            <seg id="p532">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE It is true that in the rectangular arrangement cultivation can be done with greater ease and the initial cost of land preparation is con - siderably less, but in the long run, it may prove to be the most ex - pensive. After the trees are once planted and have grown to con - siderable size, little can be done to prevent erosion and so far as we know at present, moisture conservation measures are out of the ques - tion except by the use of vegetative covers which have greater ability to absorb moisture than cultivated land but which, on the other hand, will compete with the trees for what moisture is available. In the countour layout, the land is first surveyed to ascertain the amount of slope. The terraces are staked out as near as possible to correspond with tree rows. In other words, if the tree rows are 40' apart, then the terraces are spaced 40' apart or as near that as is prac - tical. It may be that in parts of a field the terraces will be wider apart, as shown in Figure 2. In this case, a short row can be placed be - tween the longer ones. It is true that considerable experience and careful design will be necessary in making a layout of this type. After the terraces are carefully staked, terrace ridges may be con - structed with any one of a number of different machines. The most efficient and probably the most economical work may be done when considerable power is used. A 12 or 14-foot blade grader and a large caterpiller tractor will build excellent terraces at a cost of approximately $35.00 per lineal mile. The elevating grader, such as is used in high - way construction, may also be employed and there are on the market a number of small and efficient machines which resemble the blade grader but which are made especially for terracing. The final cost of terracing orchard land, including terrace outlet ditches and structures, would probably amount to as much as $5.00 or $6.00 uer acre and, in extreme cases, as much as $10.00 but there are owners in south eastern Nebraska who have spent this amount in attempting to check the gullies which have formed when the rectangular meUiod of plant - ing was used Referring to Figure 2, it will be seen that the terraces follow around the slope of the hill and discharge into an outlet ditch near the fence line. The outlet ditch, is used only as a safety measure to care for a rain of great intensity which the terraces could not hold. The ditch above the terrace, as shown in Figure 3, is a reservoir in which water is retained. The terrace ridge is curved around the hill on a grade which is practically flat. In most instances, it would be absolutely flat. Where the terrace enters the outlet ditch, a plank or concrete check is used which prevents the water in the terrace from dis - charging until the terrace channel or reservoir had filled to a depth of a foot or more. In the case of a rain of great intensity which con - tinued for a considerable period, the terrace channel will become </seg>

Plantings in the terrace channel and at other locations have been suggested. filled to a point where no more water can be contained without over - topping the ridge and overflow into the terrace outlet ditch would then take place. The water retained above the terrace ridge would, in a certain period of time, soak into the ground and be retained in the sub-soil. It has been shown that by the use of field terraces, the anount of soil removed from slopes by erosion can be greatly reduced. It is estimated that the loss from 8 % slopes in this region is probably as much as 30 to 35 tons per year. Careful terracing should reduce this to below 3 tons per year. It has been repeatedly shown that terraces will prevent gullying since there is no long sustained flow down the slopes. The soil that is removed will fill in the terrace channels nec - essitating a certain amount of maintenance. In other words, it would be necessary from time to time to clean the terrace channels with some such implement as a Martin Ditcher, a small terracing machine or even a road grader. The cultivation of the trees will have some tendency to help maintain the terraces inasmuch as the dirt would be moved toward the terrace ridge rather than away from it. The con - struction of terraces on a field would not hinder in any way the planting of the area to field crops up to the time the trees became large enough to shade the ground. The crop rows would be placed on the contour between terrace lines which is common practice in parts of Nebraska and in many of the southern states. It would seem that the owner contemplating the planting of a new orchard would certainly consider terracing of the area and contour placing of rows. The problem is considerably more serious in the case of old orchards which are already planted on the rectangular system. It may be that the careful use of vegetative covers such as grasses and legumes will be a partial solution of the problem and some experimental work is being done with the use of pits and trenches above the trees for the accumulation of run-off water. Experiments have shown that there is considerable run-off even where the, slope of the ground is not great. At the Spur, Texas Experi - ment Station, the results obtained were as follows: </seg>

            <seg id="p535">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY considered that moisture is the limiting factor in crop production in all parts of Nebraska, it becomes apparent that more attention should be given to conserving as much of the available moisture as possible. The major portion of the season's rainfall is disposed of in one of the following ways: 1. Run-off. 2. Evaporation from the ground surface. 3. Transpiration from the leaves of plants. 4. Joining the permanent body of soil moisture. It is interesting to note the small portion of the whole which goes to actual use by plants. The disposition of the 17-inch average annual rainfall at the Goodwell, Oklahoma Experiment Station is found to be about as follows: 5.3 inches comes in showers too small to be of value and evaporates soon after falling. 11.7 inches comes in moderate to heavy rains which penetrate the soil or runs off. The disposition of the 11.7 inches has been found over a period of years to be as follows: 2.3 inches runs off and is lost to plant use. 6.5 inches evaporates either at the time of cultivation or at other times. 3.0 inches remains in the soil, available for plant use. A part of this remaining in the soil is wasted by weeds. A study of rainfall at the Spur, Texas Experiment Station reveals that during a seven year period the 20.9 inch precipitation was dis - posed of in about the following way: 5.2 inches came in small showers too small to be of value, soon evaporating. 3.1 inches ran off and is lost to plant use. 12.6 inches entered the soil of which further evaporation and weeds account for some loss. While time does not permit of an exhaustive study of moisture losses, the above statements should be food for thought. The per - centage of losses from the various sources will, of course, vary with climatic, cultural and soil conditions but it may be seen that run-off is not by any means the largest loss. It is however one of the losses ■which can be more easily curbed. </seg>
            <seg id="p536">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Question: Don't we have more run-off than 20% on an average in this state? Answer: I doubt it. About 20% is right, one-fifth. In eastern Nebraska we can't ordinarily figure over 25% run-off. Question: How about Stub Terrace for between rows of trees? Answer: That would be very good. MR. BANNING: I am sure we are very thankful for the fine talk given by Mr. Wood. I think myself and from my own experience this is one of the most important questions of how to control this erosion and holding the land. We will now have a talk on Pump Irrigation for Orchards by E. E. Brackett. PUMP IRRIGATION FOR ORCHARDS By E. E. Brackett Nebraska climate usually considered semi-arid probably needs a new classification for 1934. Instead of "semi" we will probably think of 1934 as "totally" arid as long as our memories of it remain. Irrigation in semi-arid and humid climates differs in some respects from that in the drier area where all agriculture is dependent on arti - ficial water supply. Here in eastern Nebraska it is natural that the first question is "Will it pay," and if based on one year's results the answer may be "yes", or equally truly "no" climatic conditions being the deciding factor. With the shallow-rooted crops, application of water has an almost immediate effect— and it is visible. Furthermore, the benefits may in some cases be realized in the form of cash income within a few weeks, and there is no doubt in the mind of the irrigator about there being a benefit. Your morning program has given a picture of the root systems of our apple trees and the deep soil, which permits this development also forms a great storage place for water. But standing water (or the ground water table) is well down below a point to cause trouble. Professor Wiggans has told you something of the conditions that now exist in the root zones of our apple trees. It is truly a serious situation that probably will bring many a comparatively young tree to the woodpile years ahead of its time because it choked to death. The end of the tree's life came in 1934 but can all the blame be charged to the past year? For how many years had its need for water exceeded the rainfall? Over how many years has a water deficiency been ac - cumulating until the conditions pictured by Professor Wiggans have </seg>
            <seg id="p537">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY been reached? How long can these trees survive in this condition? Is it practical to supply this hazardous deficiency? Will irrigation increase production and leave a profit? Will it increase the produc - tive life of our Nebraska orchards? Probably many of you are looking to the Experiment Station for information on these questions. The first requisite of any system of irrigation is plenty of water, and it appears that the underground supply below most of our orchards is limited in quantity and is at considerable depths. It must be re - membered that a good irrigation well is quite different from many good farm wells where the windmill may be allowed to run day and night. It is an exceptional farm well that is called upon to furnish water for 500 head of cattle in addition to other farm needs — possibly a total of 10,000 gallons a day. But in terms of irrigation, that is less than half an inch of depth on one acre. Some experimental re - sults reported from the northwest indicate the need of from 2% to 10 inches of water to supplement an average annual rainfall of 29 inches. Possibility of an adequate supply from a well should be based on the geologic data of our Conservation and Survey Division and on samples taken from test holes. Some of our small streams can easily furnish the supplemental water needed. It should be remembered that water can not legally be used from our streams for irrigation until alloted to the tract by our State Department of Highways and Irrigation. In addition to the cost of well or of stream development, some addi - tional investment in pipe lines will probably be needed since most of our orchards are on rather hilly land. A very important item of cost is that for power to operate the pump. This may roughly be estimated at from 7 to 10 cents per acre foot per foot of lift. For example, if the water were raised 75 feet and the cost &amp;i, the power cost would be $6.00 for sufficient water to cover one acre to the depth of one foot. Good pumping equipment is available to meet widely varying con - ditions and each orchard will probably require slightly different equip - ment for best results. It seems to me that you who are owners or managers of orchards might well aproach this problem as you would consider investing in insurance. Adequate supplemental water properly applied at the right time surely has some value as an assurance of a crop and as a means of prolonging the productive life of the trees. I hope we may be of some assistance to our Experiment Station and </seg>

            <seg id="p540">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I have been reading of the experience of Mr. C. E. Dutton, manager of the Ohio Orchard Company at Milford Center, Ohio, with porous canvas hose. He had tried furrow irrigation but found it very hard to manage. In 1931 he started irrigating with the porous hose and found it fairly good. There is a creek which has a dependable flow the year round, adjoining the orchard. At a point nearest the orchard he set up a 3 inch horizontal centrifugal pump, a 10 - 20 tractor being used as the source of power for operating the pump. A 4 inch iron pipe was attached to the intake of the pump and a 4 VL inch pipe carried the water to the highest part of the orchard, a ridge about 55 feet above the creek. It took 1600 feet of this pipe. Seven outlet valves were placed at various intervals along the pipe to which the porous hose could be attached. It is necessary to irrigate either on the level or down hill with porous hose. When the down hill slope is steep the natural tendency is for most of the water to escape at the lower levels. To prevent such uneven disribution the hose is constricted by tying twine around it at the point where the drop occurs. When there is a slight down - ward slope the water may be carried 600 to 700 feet in a single line. Where the ground is level and it is desired to carry it that far a heavier type than generally used must be attached to the supply pipe or the excessive pressure will cause excessive irrigation at that point. One such lead of 3 inch hose will take care of 75 to 100 gallons of water per minute. In the Milford, Ohio orchard 3 to 4 leads were run at the same time. It takes all of one man's time and about half of another man's time to look after the tractor and the changing of the hose. Now as to the costs. The total investment was $839.88 which consisted of $584.53 for pipe, $103.82 for fittings and valves, $24.38 for tools and belt, $67.40 for pump and $59.75 for canvas hose. The tractor was on the place, being needed for other operations. Total operating costs plus interest and depreciation for irrigating 31 acres was $496.02 or about $16.00 per acre. Similar blocks of the orchard that were not irrigated were used in comparing total yields and grades. The difference in yield was 70 bu. in favor of irrigation and the grades were enough better to make a net difference in favor of the irrigated block of $66.80. Figuring $16 per acre for the irrigating leaves the net returns from this block about $50 per acre greater than the un - irrigated block. PRESIDENT BANNING: Are there any questions that any of you care to ask regarding this matter? If it is possible to irrigate a small portion of the University orchard at Union, the method just discussed can probably be tried out. </seg>
            <seg id="p541">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY Before we go into business session of the Society I think we had better hear Secretary Hopperfs report on the meetings of the Horti - culture Scientists at Pittsburgh. REPORT OF THE PITTSBURGH MEETINGS December 27-29 The Secretary attended the meetings of the American Society for Horticultural Science and one session of the American Association of Economic Entomologists held in Pittsburgh Dec. 27, 28, and 29. A great variety of subjects were discussed in more or less detail. Time will not permit a report on every paper given. Many of the subjects would be of little interest to you. I have therefore classified the in - formation given along the lines of sprays and spraying, fertilizers, and moisture relationships to fruit growing. Sprays Control of the Codling moth seems to be a universal problem in all apple growing regions less important in the New England States than elsewhere but yet of some interest there; much more important in the remainder of the states growing apples commercially. Since the residue problem has focused attention on the short-comings of lead arsenate new materials are being tried in a grand scale. New Jersey reported that 87 different materials have been used experimentally. The only one that shows promise seems to be cadmium, either in the hydroxide or in the oxide form. Cadmium oxide is insoluble in water and is very effective in killing leaf eating insects like the silkworm at strengths of % lb. to 100 gals. However, there is danger of injuring plants because when as much as % pound to 100 gallons is used serious foliage injury results. Cuprous Cyanide was tried in Illinois with fine results so far as codling moth kill was concerned but the apple leaves were severely injured. When asked about residues the author of the New Jersey work replied that Cadmium is much less toxic to humans than is zinc and this in turn is much safer than lead compounds. The cuprous cyanide on the other hand is a much more deadly poison than even lead arsenate. In southwest Michigan fine results have been secured with zinc arsenite but here again the arsenic tolerance may be a stumbling block. Zinc arsenite, however, does not adhere to leaves and fruit as does lead arsenate. It weathers off more like calcium arsenate. Naturally this means that this material could not be depended upon to be effective for as long a period as is lead arsenate. Everyone seems to agree that lead arsenate is still standard and that where this </seg>
            <seg id="p542">REPORT OF NEERASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE material will not control satisfactorily the summer oils should be used in addition, particularly for the first brood and perhaps for the first spray for the second brood. Oil applied late in the season is likely to prove injurious to the tree by cutting down the assimilation of carbon dioxide by the leaves. The New York Station found this true with each of three commercial summer oils tried the middle of August. They found that those oils that were best for insect control cut down assimilation the' most and vica versa. Cutting down carbon dioxide assimilation results in retarding the building of carbohy - drates. This in turn retards the growth of the fruit and prevents proper coloring. In addition it interferes with fruit bud development. In the discussion which followed it was pointed out that some states have been using oils regularly for 10 years and still their trees produce fruit buds in abundance. As for retarding size it was felt that it was better to have a medium sized sound apple than a large wormy one. There seems to be no question that oils with lead arsenate give sufficient additional control in badly infested orchards to war - rant their use at least until the infestation has been sufficiently re - duced so that lead arsenate can again be depended upon for commercial control. Oils seem to be safer early in the season so far as subse - quent fruit bud development is concerned. Illinois reported that 8% oil applied for scale in the dormant period resulted in retarding the blooming period G to 10 days but that apparently there was no per - manent injury to the trees. In working with the removal of residues, the Maryland Station found that where 5 covers of lead arsenate were used and oils in the first two only the % % strength of hydrochloric acid was effective in removing excess lead and arsenic down to the tolerance. Where min - eral oils were used in all 5 sprays it was necessary to use 1 % % strength. Where seven cover sprays were given and mineral oil used in the first five, the residue could not be brought down to the tolerance unless vatsol was used. Another phase of spraying that was discussed brought out some interesting points regarding the setting of the flowers. Dr. Auchter of the Department of Agriculture reported that a number of growers wanted to know how to prevent fruit set on certain varieties or parts of orchards without of course injuring the leaves or spurs to the ex - tent that they would fail to develop fruit buds for next years crop. Experiments were carried on in Missouri, Arkansas, Georgia, Virginia and a few other places with about 8 materials, among them dormant strength lime-sulfur and copper sulfate 4 pounds to 50 without lime. The trees were sprayed in the full bloom stage with these two materials but they only killed 50 to 75% of the bloom. The leaves were killed but little spur injury resulted. New leaves were formed rapidly and </seg>
            <seg id="p543">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY fruit buds produced abundantly except on a few trees which happened to set a good crop on the blossoms that were not killed. The only material that seemed to do what was expected was a 3% solution of tar oil distillate applied in the cluster bud stage. Here 100% of the blooms were killed and with them the young leaves that were out at the time. But new leaves were put out and good fruit buds developed. No spurs were seriously injured. Fertilizers The three standard fertilizers seem to be Nitrate of Soda, Am-' monium sulphate and cyanamid. Of these three the most readily available is nitrate of soda; next comes ammonium sulphate and finally cyanamid. If one wants to wait to see how the prospects are for fruit as for example on peaches and cherries, it is best to use sodium nitrate because the plants c.an take the material up quickly. It isn't safe to wait this long and then apply cyanamid. Injury has been found on cherries in Michigan from such late applications and on peaches on the lighter .soils in the east. On heavy soils there is little likelihood of injury but there is danger of its getting to the spurs in time to do any good so far as crop set and fruit bud differentiation are concerned. For best eifects it should be applied in late February or early March or in the previous fall any time from the latter part of August until the middle of November. Ammonium sulphate can be applied as late as April 1st but even here with this material it is better to play safe by applying it either in March, February, or in the previous fall. Dr. Heinecke of New York brought out a new idea in applying fertilizers on old trees, particularly of those varieties that tend to biennial bearing. He feels that it is essential to keep old trees produc - ing carbohydrates until frost kills the leaves, particularly the year that they have their heavy crop. When the leaves turn a light green they are not functioning so well. Light applications of either sodium nitrate or ammonium sulphate in August and again in late September if needed will tend to produce an excess of carbohydrates for the use of the fruit buds the following year. Of course this theory is not yet substantiated by experimental evidence but it sounds reasonable. The Maryland Station reported on an experiment where fertilizers were placed around 15 year old trees in different zones under the trees. The least effect was secured in the applications close to the trunk. The best responses came when applied at the edge of the branches. There is danger in applying 4 to 5 pounds of fertilizer to the area in a 6 foot circle about trees such as this on account of the high concentration. </seg>
            <seg id="p544">REPORT OV NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Soil Moisture We have heard quite a lot about the importance of soil moisture in our sessions this year. Dr. J. R. Magness in his address to the Society at Pittsburgh emphasized the importance of this relationship also and several other speakers did likewise. The Illinois Station for example, found that in the drought which they experienced the past summer the fruits of peaches and cherries actually lost size (by actual measurements). Evidently the tree when it finds difficulty in getting sufficient water pumped up from the soil, will take moisture out of the fruit to keep the leaves from wilting. Business Meeting During the time that Mr. Hoppert made his report and answered questions President Banning was called out of the meeting and there was little likelihood of his being back, it was said. The Secretary: What is your pleasure, gentlemen? Shall we postpone the business meeting until tomorrow morning or shall we call the Vice President to the chair? Member: I move that the business meeting be held at this time and that the Vice President take the chair. Another member: Second the motion. The 1 Secretary: You have heard the motion. Any discussion? If not, all those in favor of continuing with the business meeting say "aye". Opposed the same sign. The motion is carried. Mr. Kimmel, as first Vice President you are in charge of the meeting. MR. KIMMEL: Who will you have for your Chairman for 1935. DEARLE BAKER: I move that our First Vice President, Mr. Dick Kimmel be nominated for President. GEO. CHRISTY: Second the motion. VERNON MARSHALL: Mr. Chairman, I move the rules be sus - pended, that the nominations be closed and the Secretary be instructed to cast the unanimous ballot for Mr. Kimmel for President. Seconded.

Hoppert Winter Meetings The Nebraska Horticultural Society began its activities for the year 1934 with its annual meetings held at Lincoln on January 23 and 24 in conjunction with other similar organizations. The first day sessions dealt with Ornamental phases of Horticulture. Dr. J. C. Russel of the Agronomy Department talked on "Fertilizers for Gardens, Lawns and Flowers." Dr. David C. Hilton of Lincoln gave an illus - trated talk on "Some Ornamental Uses of Common Trees." Dr. J. E. Weaver of the Botany Department of the university, explained "How Cutting the Tops affects the Roots of Grasses." Prof. P. H. Elwood, Chairman of the Landscape Department at Iowa State College at Ames, told of the "Development of More Beautiful Highways." The next two days were devoted to various topics of interest to the fruit growers. Dr. A. E. Murneek, of the University of Missouri discussed "The Causes of Dropping of Young Apples" and "Pruning and Thinning". Henry Lobenstein, Extension Morticulturist from Kansas told of their experiences in Kansas with the banding of apple trees in the control of the codling moth and likewise discussed "Orchard Sanitation". Dr. R. W. Goss summarized 5 years of experimental work in the control of Cherry Leaf Spot. Dr. C. C. Wiggans of the Horticultural Department at Lincoln gave a demonstration of how to clarify cider. Both the ornamental and the fruit meetings were well attended. The papers given together with the discussions are published in the printed report of the Society under the year 1934. Usually the Society sponsors a summer tour through the orchard section. This year the extreme drought made it inadvisable to hold such a tour. </seg>

HOPPERT: There is a matter of business I would like to take up regarding a project for us to work on. Most organizations are now working on some one thing. Would you be in favor of entering into a project of some kind? MR. BAKER: Last year, if you will recall, we tried to get through a CWA project through the state. It would be a fine thing if we could get behind a project of this kind by having FERA workers work with our department on whatever we had for them to do like cutting down dead fruit trees, removing diseased and dead limbs, clearing away ' brush, scraping trees etc. I just wondered if we cared to go ahead with it. I have a form on how it is done in Kansas which Mr. Hoppert will read. I think we should get interested in something like this. In our country, we are starting Monday and building brush dams and if we carried this sanitation project along with it, we would get all cleaned up. Mr. Chairman, I think the best way to do that would be to draw up a resolution, have this Society pass on it to show that this society is in favor of this work. After that, maybe our President, Mr. Kimmel, and our Secretary, Mr. Hoppert, could present it to Mr. Haynes and see what can be done. MR. KIMMEL: After a resolution is drawn up, we will hear more about this tomorrow. MR. F. SIM: Mr. Chairman, I was wondering if there couldn't be a law passed which effects farmers who have old orchards that are not given the proper care. Some are within a short distance of good orchards — with a young orchard, naturally you don't want the codling moth getting in right away. That seems to be all some old orchards are good for is collecting bugs, disease etc. Other states have laws which require that old trees be cut down and I think we should try and get such a bill through the Nebraska legislature. MR. KIMMEL: I think this can probably be taken care of in the FERA project which we are going to work on. MR. KIMMEL: It is 5:30 o'clock and time for the fun feed to begin. If there is nothing further, motion to adjourn will be in order. Motion was made to adjourn, which was seconded and carried. </seg>
            <seg id="p549">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY THURSDAY MORNING SESSION Jan. 10, — 9:30 A. M. Plant Industry, 1st Floor MR. KIMMEL: Meeting please come to order. The first thing on the program is "The Codling Moth, A National Problem" which was to be given by Mr. Newcomer, U. S. D. A. Entomologist, Yakima, Wash - ington but he wasn't able to be here. Mr. Hoppert has his paper and will read it for us. CODLING MOTH — A NATIONAL PROBLEM By E. J. Newcomer, Division of Fruit Insects, Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine, United States Department of Agriculture. Some years ago I attended a conference of Federal workers to dis - cuss the pests of deciduous fruits. Fully half of our time was devoted to the codling moth, indicating that it is the most important pest of deciduous fruits in the United States. A few figures will show why this is true. According to the Yearbook of Agriculture for 1934, apples are produced in 46 of the states of the union. The only exception are Florida and North Dakota, and it is probable that some trees exist even in those states. The average annual production in 36 states is over 100 cars each,: and in 21 states it is over 1,000 cars each. During the last 20 years, articles about the codling moth have been published by experiment stations in 40 states, indicating that this pest occurs prac - tically wherever apples are grown in the United States. It is also found throughout the apple-growing sections of Canada. In spite of work done by many Federal, State, and private in - vestigators, control of the codling moth has become a more serious problem every year. In some districts this has been partially the result of the increasing size of the trees, of the abandonment of some orchards, or of a series of seasons peculiarly favorable to the pest. In many districts the continuous areas planted to apples and pears have been a factor. If our orchards could be separated from each other by different types of crops, the problem would be simpler, as the moths could not fly so easily from one orchard to the next. Although the most important method of controlling the codling moth has been by the use of chemical insecticides, we have made the mistake in the past of replying almost entirely upon this method. As a result, we now have on our hands the problem of putting our fruit </seg>
            <seg id="p550">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE on the market In a condition satisfactory to the consumer, as well as a constantly growing problem of control. In other words, we are find - ing it apparently necessary each yefar to increase the quantity of in - secticide applied to the fruit and at the same time to increase the per - centage removed. Obviously, this state of affairs would soon lead to an impossible situation. In fact, we are told by those working with the problem that we have already practically reached the limit in the removal of residue as far as lead arsenate is concerned — and lead arsenate is our most important insecticide. The codling moth population has become so large in many disfricts that suitable control with chemical insecticides alone is well-nigh impossible. It is necessary, then, to employ other means in order to reduce the population to the point where adequate control may be ob - tained with reasonable quantities of these materials. Since the codling moth problem is a national one, the United States Department of Agriculture has made it a major object of investigation for many years, and the Department has recognized the need for means of control other than with chemical insecticides. Work is being done on orchard sanitation, which includes the scraping and banding of trees, adequate pruning, proper thinning, sterilization of boxes, props, and packing sheds, and cleaning up of trash. Baits and lights are being tested as supplementary means of control, and the possibility of reducing the population of codling moths somewhat by the use of parasites is being looked into. Much work along these lines is also being done by many of the experiment stations. At the same time, every effort is being made to find more effective insecticides, and means of using them in such a way that the fruit will be safe for human consumption. "While many of these things are still only in the experimental stage, definite statements can be made about some of them. Scraping and banding of trees is of great benefit in reducing heavy populations of worms. Bands, treated with beta naphthol, and placed on trees that have been thoroughly scraped, may destroy 75 per cent of the worms leaving the fruit. This can be accomplished at an average annual cost of less than 10 cents per tree. Figures have been published showing the value of banding. In one test at Yakima, Wash., covering three seasons, a block of banded trees was less than two-thirds as wormy at the end of the test as a similar block, not banded. Many growers are already convinced of the value of this method. In 1933, about 33 per cent of the orchards in the vicinity of Yakima and Wenatchee, Wash., were banded, and in 1934 about 37 per cent were banded. Of 700 orchards examined in 1934, only 6 showed evidence of having been banded in 1933 and not in 1934. In other words, growers are not giving up this method. </seg>
            <seg id="p551">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY The Apple Growers' Association at Hood River, Ore., has done a very commendable thing in treating boxes with steam to destroy the worms that are in them. This has without doubt contributed very materially to the control of the codling moth in the Hood River area. It is a means that should find wider use, as the expense involved, less than % cent per box, is, in my opinion, amply justified. It has also been demonstrated that many moths can be destroyed at small expense by simply putting infested boxes into packing sheds or other buildings and keeping the buildings closed until the moths have emerged and died. It may be necessary in some cases to screen the building. One grower in the Middle West did this by means of cloth at an expense of about $50. He estimated that many thousands of moths were trapped in his warehouse. The cloth is still in good con - dition, and he can use it for several seasons. A more lasting method would be to use ordinary wire screen. The cost would of course de - pend on the amount of screening that was necessary. There are other means that are undoubtedly of value, although definite figures are not available. Tree props often harbor many worms, and some means of treating these should be worked out. Adequate thinning and pruning are of help in applying sprays thoroughly, and many worms may be destroyed by the prompt disposal of all wormy fruit at thinning time, and also at harvest, since more than half of the wormy apples still have worms in them when they are picked. Experimentation with baits and with lights for control has not reached the point where recommendations can be made. The work of parasites has been somewhat disappointing, particularly as the application of sprays interferes with their activities. It is possible that a modifica - tion of the spray program might result in their becoming of more importance. I think you can see from this that many problems in connection with the control of the codling moth are not yet solved. Many of these problems are of national importance and therefore at least the funda - mentals in connection with them should be worked out on a national basis. Along with this, much work of a local nature is necessary in order to adapt these fundamentals to local conditions. Discussion Question: Does Mr. Newcomer mean the scraping and banding of •one tree would cost but 10&lt;S? Answer: No, he does not say scraping but only banding. That is very high, however. Question: How can you supply that steam to orchard crates? </seg>
            <seg id="p552">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Answer: I suppose you would have to put them in an airtight chamber and run steam into it or run live steam around all the cracks - and crevices of the crates. Question: Why wouldn't quick silver put along the cracks destroy them? Answer: Quick Silver? My, that's expensive. Statement: The reason I suggested it is because in killing bed bugs I know of a person who used quick silver on the legs of the bed. It sure got the bugs where nothing else would. Question: Would it help to hang up one of these bait traps in a packing shed. Answer: Yes, that would help. The codling moths would be attracted by the fermenting bait in the trap and would be caught before it got out into the orchard. Question: Is there any kind of chemical that a person could use as a disinfectant for apple boxes, something that the boxes could be dipped in? Answer: I think cresyllc acid is used very effectively for that purpose. This material was used fairly successfully in controlling overwintering larvae of the codling moth on the trunk. The reason it was not generally recommended was that in some cases trees were injured. But with crates there would be no danger. Question: Would it bej very expensive? Answer: No, I don't think it is very expensive. It is a coal tar product worth perhaps 10 to 15 cents a gallon. ■.-■•••■■ i . ■ Question: Why not use Paradichlorobenzene? Answer: That would be expensive if applied as an oily solution. If applied as a gas you would have to have an airtight chamber. If you had such a chamber Cyamide would be more effective. Steam would be much cheaper and as effective as either. I think the cheapest method is to put them in a building and close it up. MR. KIMMEL: Mr. Shubert, I wonder if you could tell us some - thing about your banding experience? MR. SHUBERT: I think Mr. Baker could probably tell you more about this than I could. If I told you how many worms we caught you would think I was bragging. I noticed, however, where we took the bands off, it leaves a little strip around the tree the same size as </seg>
            <seg id="p553">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY the band. "We have taken our knives to see if it did any harm to the tree but it apparently does not. Just the same, I am afraid of banding these trees one year after another, I wonder if it won't injure the trees. Personally, I am sold on the banding proposition. MR. BAKER: I will give you our experiences with one particular tree that we had banded. This tree was located in the Slocum orchard. Mr. Hoppert neglected to tell you that it is in the Slocum orchard where the state has experimented and they have given us the moth infestation. "We took a Grimes Golden tree and put a 3 inch band on the tree early in May and, I believe, under normal seasons the band would have lasted throughout the summer but on account of high temper - atures I find it won't remain effective that long. "We had 30 to 40 days with the temperature over 100. These hot winds seem to kill the chemical in the band. After the second brood of worms hid under these bands, we made a count and found 283 worms under it and 223 of them were live worms, so we knew they had been there long enough. If the band had still been effective it would have killed them all. So, I suggested to have the bands replaced. We removed the old bands from the trees the next day. The old bands were torn off rolled into a sack and burned. Three or four days later, new bands were put on, a 2" band this time. When we removed those bands this fall a count was made and 176 dead worms were found in that band. So, you can see that we got 'a lot of good out of the bands. We did not scrape the trees quite so much, just used a curry comb to remove all loose bark in a hurry. The cost of banding and scraping the trees was approximately 5£ per tree. Question: I wonder what you would think about this. If we take a strip of burlap or building paper and placed under these bands, would they creep under that? Answer: Yes, they would crawl under anything that affords shelter from birds. Then too, they need something that will give them something to brace against in the spinning of the cocoon. The point that J. F. Shubert made concerning possibile injury to the trunk needs further discussion. There is danger of such injury on young trees and on older trees if bands are placed in the same place year after year. Question: In using paraffin on the trunk where the band is to go would there be any danger of destroying the chemical action of the band? Answer: No, the paraffin on the trunk would not affect the action of the band. </seg>
            <seg id="p554">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Statement. We made one of those paraffin lanterns. We took a. discarded cream can which, I should judge, holds 3 gallons, cut a door in the bottom, put some holes in it and ran wires through them. First, through the top put a lantern so it sets on the bottom of the cream can. Put in a small pan for the paraffin. The only cost to this was 10(J for the parafin pan as the cream can was a discarded one and the lantern as good as new. In this way we could keep the paraffin melted sufficiently to use as a paint. MR. KIMMEL: Any more discussion along this line? Mr. Yocum will now give us the discussion on Codling Moth Control Investigations. CODLING MOTH CONTROL INVESTIGATION By W. W. Yocum During the season of 1934 codling moth control tests were run again at Shubert in one of the orchards of the Shubert Orchards Co. The materials tested were nicotine sulphate "Black Leaf 155", "Kalo" and Calcium arsenate, in comparison with ordinary lead arsenate. These materials were tested because they are either generally recom - mended or are widely advertised as substituts for lead arenate. The test also included the use of chemically treated bands for codling moth control. The trees in half of each spray plat were scraped and banded. I hesitate to give you the results on this spray test, because of the conditions which developed during the test. The drouth and ex - treme heat affected the spray test in many ways. When the plats were laid out they included trees of Jonathan, Delicious, and Winesap, in each plat. These varieties set a fairly good crop of fruit but by the end of the season such a large portion of the fruit had dropped that it was not possible to check the results of the sprays in all plats on Jonathan and Delicious. Winesap was the only variety which had sufficient fruit that a check of results could be obtained in all plats. This dropping which was due very largely to the drouth was apparently heaviest where the trees were most crowded. The drouth also checked the growth of the fruit and a 'heavy skin developed. Rains in August and September renewed growth of the fruit and the skin cracked badly. Many worms then entered the fruit through the cracks in the skin. Since these entries could not be due to any fault of the spray material, an attempt was made to check on this point and the entries known to be due to cracks are not included in the percentages which will be given. Of course one could not always be certain whether the worm or the crack appeared first. Moreover, if no cracks had developed, no doubt some of the worms which did enter thru cracks would have entered thru the skin. Prom 1 to 12 </seg>
            <seg id="p555">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY per cent of wormy fruit resulted from entries through cracks in the various spray plats. Cracking was not uniform throughout the ■spray plats but seem more severe where more of the filler trees were missing. Cracking was highest on Jonathan, where about 9 per cent wormy fruit was due to cracks. This cracking of the fruit and the entry of worms thru cracks introduced a large error in checking the spray results. The results from banding were very irregular. The first bands applied were found not to be fully effective, perhaps due to the effect of the extreme heat upon the chemicals. So these bands were removed and burned and were replaced by new bands. Another error in banding was due to scraping the trees too late for best results. Trees should be scraped during the winter or in early spring before the overwinter - ing worm escape from under the bank. These trees were not scraped until after the overwintering worms had escaped. In spite of all this the control of worms was 10 per cent better in the banded area as a whole than in the unhanded area. The effect of banding in the various spray plats and on the three varieties varied greatly. In three plats the percentage of worms was lowest in the banded half. Winesap trees had the highest percentage of worms in the banded area. How - ever, as I mentioned once before, more filler trees are missing in the banded area and the fruit grew more and cracked more when fall rains came. In the banded area 8.3 per cent of the Winesaps were wormy due to cracks while this figure was only 3.7 per cent where trees were not banded. Of the spray materials tested nicotine sulphate used with oil gave the best control of worms being nearly equal with lead arsenate. The percentages were 29.9 and 27.4 respectively. "Kalo" was next best with 35.3 per cent worms entering through the skin. Calcium arsenate had 41.7 per cent and "Black Leaf 155" 45.9 per cent wormy fruit. While control was far from satisfactory in any case the results do indicate some things. Nicotine used with oil is about equal to lead arsenate in control of worms. Calcium arsenate and Kalo certainly do not have a place in our regular spray program. Black Leaf 155 which is a very new preparation does not look very promising either. Banding seems to offer more improvement in our control of codling moth than any recent development in spray material. If 10 per cent improvement in control could be obtained by banding under the con - ditions of this test, certainly in a normal season and over a larger area more could be expected. </seg>
            <seg id="p556">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Discussion Question: Now you say nicotine and oil mixture was practically equal to lead arsenate. Is that true? Answer: Yes, that is true. Question: What is the difference in cost? Have you the differ - ence? Answer: I don't know what the difference is. Mr. Cherry of the Tobacco By Products company is here. Perhaps he could answer that question for us. MR. CHERRY: I am going to answer that in this way. The cost of Arsenate depends on the amount you use, usually about 4 pounds to the hundred gallons. Regularly 3 pounds to 4 pounds are used de - pending on the degree infestation. To use lead arsenate alone is not as effective as if you use some material with it as a sticker. The cost of material I will leave up to you. Nicotine and Oil will cost about one cent a gallon. Spray coverage is much finer and can spray one additional tree in every ten with the use of oil preparation in place of solid preparations. That is the best answer I can give you. The cost in the one case would be about 75£ to $1.00 in the case of oil. nicotine. Question: Will the effect hold as long as Arsenate of Lead? MR. YOCUM: I doubt it. Both the oil and the nicotine are much less stable than is the lead arsenate. Some experiment stations claim the oil nicotine spray is good for only 8-10 days at best. We know that lead absenate lasts at least 3 or 4 weeks. Statement: Mr. Yocum, I believe the reason they are recom - mending the Nicotine and Oil is to avoid lead and arsenic residue. I believe you have to figure some of the cost of removing the residue against the lead arsenate spray. Question: What strength oil and nicotine would you use on that? MR. YOCUM: 1 per cent oil and % pint nicotine to a hundred gallon. MR. CHERRY: I know a number of men who are using the oil successfully throughout the entire season from the beginning all through spraying. In that case they do not wash the fruit at all. That is over in Indiana. They use 1 per cent oil. MR. HOPPERT: In the west where oil sprays have been used longest and most the experiment stations warn against the use of over 3 oils a season. Oil accumulates in the conducting tissues of the tree and when too much is used the trees are injured. One man might </seg>

MR. KIMMEL: Next discussion on the program is How the 1934 Drouth Affected the Codling Moth Life Cycle by M. H. Swenk. HOW THE 1934 DROUTH AFFECTED THE CODLING MOTH LIFE CYCLE / ■ ' ■ Myron H. Swenk, Entomologist Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station* The season of 1934 was the seventh during which the Department of Entomology of the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station has been making an intensive study of the broods of the codling moth in southeastern Nebraska, with special reference to the responses of the insect to varying meteorological conditions. The close of 1933 and the entire season of 1934 was marked by unusual drought and heat, which had very marked effects both upon the population of the codling moth and the seasonal history of the insect. It is well known that a "wet" fall and winter is favorable, for the survival, . early pupation and normal development of wintering codling moth larvae, while a "dry" fall and winter has exactly the reverse effect. The fall of 1933 was warm and very dry. The mean tempera - tures for the months of October, November and December, 1933, were 53.8, 43.0 and 37.8, as compared to normal temperatures of 54.2, 39.1 and 27.6, respectively, at Lincoln. It is the dryness, however, that was most conspicuous and important in relation to the codling moth. The per cent of relative humidity at noon at Lincoln for the three months just mentioned was 41, 46 and 57, respectively, as compared to normal humidities of 50, 59 and 66, respectively. These three months were far and away the driest last three months of any year during the seven years of the experiment. The same conditions continued over the first three months of 1934. The mean temperatures for the months of January, February and March, 1934, were 21.7, 30.2 and 26.0, as compared to normal temperatures of 14.2, 26.1 and 27.7, respectively, at Lincoln, and the per cent of relative humidity at noon at this place for these three months was 64, 51 and 49, respectively, as compared to normal humidities of 68, 64 and 52. These six months of warm and unusually dry winter weather produced a very heavy mortality among the wintering codling moth larvae, and greatly shorten - ed the pupation period of the spring brood. •The writer wishes to acknowledge indebtedness to Messrs. B. Thomas Snipes and Roscoe E. Hill, who carried out the actual laboratory manipulations for this study in 1934.

            <seg id="p559">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY In the fall of 1933, 582 wintering codling moth larvae were placed in cocooning racks. During the winter of 1933-34, 164, or 28.18%, of these wintering larvae died. This was a very heavy mortality. Pupation of the surviving wintering larvae began on April 26. The last one pupated on May 28. This was a fairly early but very short pupal period, since pupation of the spring brood normally continues well into the second half of June. Of the 129 larvae that pupated, rep - resenting 30.49% of the total number of larvae collected, 57, or 44.11%, died before producing moths. The remaining 72 pupae produced spring brood moths, these representing 55.81% of the total number of pupae. These 72 moths of the spring brood represent but 17.02% of the total number of larvae collected in the fall of 1933,. making the total mortality of spring brood larvae and pupae reach 82.98%, an exceedingly heavy reduction in the spring brood popula - tion, which accounts for the small number of moths found at the bait traps. The pupal period of 30 female pupae varied from 10 to IS days, averaging 14.1 days, and of 42 male pupae varied from 8 to 22 days, averaging 13.9 days. For the whole 72 pupae, the average pupal period was 14 days, which is only about one-fourth as long as the normal pupal period. The peak of pupation was on May 1. The short pupal period of the spring brood, the early emergence of the moths and their short lease of life were all in response to the continued extreme drought. 'In April the average precipitation for the state, 0.54 inch, was only 22% of the normal for that month. Only two previous Aprils (1926 and 1928) had been recorded as drier than April of 1934. The April precipitation deficiency varied from 14% of normal in the southeastern section of Nebraska to 29 % of normal in the northwestern section, the precipitation falling during the first five days of the month in eastern Nebraska, but also on the 14th to 16th in the western section of the state. There was but 0.35 inch of precipitation in April. Average temperatures during April (52.1°) ran well (2.9°) above the normal over the state, being especially high during the first ten and the last two or three days of the month; so that, although during the rest of the month the temperatures were normal or below, the average departures varied from 3.7 degrees above normal in the southwestern section to 2.3 degrees above normal in the northwestern section, and made the month as a whole warmer than all but seven of the Aprils during the preceding fifty-eight years. At Lin - coln the mean temperatures for the months of April and May, 1934, were 55.2 and 71.9, as compared to normal temperatures of 51.5 and 61.7, while the per cent of relative humidity at noon for these two months was 34 and 31, respectively, as compared to a normal humidity of 50 for both months. The first moths of the spring brood emerged on May 9, and the last one on June 8, in the insectary. At both the bait traps and the light </seg>
            <seg id="p560">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE trap, the first spring brood moth was captured on May 8. This 31-day pe - riod of flight of the spring brood moths was an early and very short one, compared with the records of the preceding six seasons. The peak of spring brood moth emergence occurred in the insectary on May 12, 'with slightly lower secondary peaks on May 21 and 29. At the bait traps the peaks of abundance of flying moths occurred on May 26 and June 1. The length of life of 30 female spring brood moths varied from 1 to 16 days, averaging 9.1 days, and of 42 male moths varied from 3 to 22 days, averaging 9.2 days, and for the whole 72 moths the aver - age was 9.15 days, an unusually short life period, which normally extends a week or ten days into July. The drought continued without abatement through May and June, greatly affecting the normal development of the first brood of the cod - ling moth. In May the average precipitation for the state was 1.06 inches, only 30% of the May normal. Only one previous May (1894) has been recorded as drier than May of 1934. For May, 1934, the precipitation deficiency was greatest in the central and eastern parts of Nebraska, varying from 17% of the normal in the central section to 54% of the normal in the western section. The general moisture deficiency for Nebraska as a whole at the end of May was 4.89 inches for the five months of 1934 and 6.43 inches for the preceding eight months, making the total average rainfall only about 40% of the normal for these periods. At Lincoln the 1934 moisture deficiency was 6.80 inches, there having been but 0.49 inch in May. May of 1934 was the warmest of record in Nebraska, exceeding by 10.4 degrees the average temperature for that month and by 4.7 degrees the warmest previous May (1881). May was actually warmer than a normal June. Northern Nebraska showed the greatest departure from normal. The periods of highest May temperatures were from^the 15th to the 21st and from the 2Sth to the 31st. Maximum temperatures over 100° were reported from all over eastern and central Nebraska. The lowest May temperatures were on the 13th to 15th. The unpleasant and damaging effects of the high temperatures were intensified, both in April and May, by frequent dust storms, a deficiency of cloudiness and low humidities. June continued hot and dry, being with two exceptions the warmest June of record. As was previously mentioned, 164, or 28.18%, of the 582 winter - ing codling moth larvae placed in cocooning racks in the fall of 1933, died during the following winter. In addition, between May 1 and June 20, 289, or 49.65%, of the original 582 larvae died, making a total larval mortality of 453, or 77.83%, of the spring brood larvae collected. This of course made for a very light first brood population. Eggs of the first brood were first deposited on May 1 2, and the last ones were deposited on June 15. Thirty female spring brood moths laid 696 eggs, of which 204 eggs were laid on leaves, and of these 204 eggs, </seg>
            <seg id="p561">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY 96, or 47.05%, were fertile. The first eggs of the first brood hatched on May 19, and the last one on June 15. This egg-laying period was again very short and also very early. In 1928 and 1929, for example, the first eggs of the first brood were not deposited until June 15 and June 13, respectively. A total of 1,048 first brood larvae were collected under bands in the orchard between June 3 and July 13, chiefly between June 11 and 19. Of these, 267 larvae, or 25.47%, died as larvae. The other 781,. or 74.53%, pupated. Pupation of first brood pupae began on June £ and extended to July 13. This again was a very early and short pupal: period. Normally the pupal period of first brood pupae begins late In. June or early in July and extends well into August or even into Sep - tember. Of the 781 pupae formed, 306, or 39.30%, died during the: pupal period. The remaining 475 of the original 1,048 first brood, larvae produced first brood moths, this representing 45.32% of the - total number of larvae. The average pupal period for the females was. 9.20 days and for the males 9.84 days. The first moths of the first brood emerged on June 12, and the last one on July 26, in the insectary. This again was very early, for normally first brood moths are not flying until early in July, and the period of flight extends through or nearly through August and sometimes nearly to the end of September. The peak of first brood moth emergence occurred in the insectary on June 29, while at the bait traps the peaks of abundance of flying, moths, occurred on June 21 and 28. July continued and intensified the heat and drought. July of 1934' was, in fact, the warmest month ever recorded in the state, as well as the driest July of record, these factors conspiring to produce the worst drought in the history of the state. The mean temperature for the state as a whole was 82.5°, and for the southeastern counties it was 86.6°, which was nearly ten degrees above the normal. At Lincoln, from July 11 to 25, inclusive, the maximum daily temperatures ran from 101° to 112°. At Geneva, Pillmore county, a temperature of 118° was reached on July 15, the previous highest temperature ever recorded in the state having been 115°, which latter temperature was equalled or exceeded in 1934 also at Ashland, Beatrice, Falls City and Pawnee City during the period July 13 to 20. The July average rain - fall for the state was 1.11 inches, setting a new low in precipitation, this being only 35% of the normal amount. In the southeastern coun - ties, with a rainfall of only 0.39 inch, the precipitation was only 10% of normal. At Lincoln the mean temperatures for the months of June and July, 1934, were 79.8 and 86.6, respectively, as compared to normal temperatures of 71.4 and 76.5, respectively, while the per cent of rela - tive humidity at noon for these two months was 38 and 27, respectively, as compared to normal humidities of 52 and 48. </seg>
            <seg id="p562">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The high July temperatures proved directly fatal to many of the moths. On July 15, the maximum temperature reached 112° F., and the mean temperature was 94° P., while the relative humidity dropped to 14% at 7:00 P. M., followed on July 16 with maximum and mean temperatures of 108° F. and 92° F. and a relative humidity of 18% at 7:00 P. M. This extreme heat and dryness killed outright at leadt 95% of the adult moths in cages in the insectary on these dates. The length of life of 232 female first brood moths varied from 1 to 17 days, averaging 7.03 days, and of 243 male moths varied from 1 to 18 days, averaging 6.1 days. Eggs of the second brood were first deposited on June 16, and the last ones were deposited on July 15. From 232 female first brood moths, 8,554 eggs were secured, of which 2,717, or 31.61%, were laid on leaves. The period of heaviest egg-laying was June 26 to July 6. Of the 2,717 eggs laid on leaves, 1,697, or 62.45%, were fertile. These hatched from June 27 to July 20. Hatching of second brood eggs was complete in 1934 at a date when in a normal year hatching was just getting started or even had not begun. August continued warm and dry, especially in the southeastern section of the state. The mean temperature for the state in August was 76.4°, three and one-half degrees above the normal, and for the southeastern counties it was 79.8°, nearly five degrees above tho normal. A maximum temperature of 115°, equaling the previous high August temperature of record, was recorded at Ashland on August 5, and every station in southeastern Nebraska reported maximum tem - peratures of 109° to 114° during the period August 4 to 9, which was the hottest period of the month. The average rainfall for the state in August was 1.67 inches, which was 59% of normal, this falling mostly as scattered showers. However, at the end of August the aver - age total precicipation for the state during 1934 was only 9.31 inches, which was 53% of the normal and 1.01 inches Jess than the previous low record for the first eight months of the year, made in 1894. At Lincoln the mean temperature for August was 79.0 as compared to a normal of 74.4, while the per cent of relative humidity at noon was 38 as compared to a normal humidity of 50. September brought with it much cooler weather and slightly more precipitation, in very marked contrast to the four preceding months. It was, in fact, the coolest September in sixteen years, with an aver - age mean temperature for the state of 59.7° F., which is over four degrees below the normal. Freezing temperatures were generally reached in western and central Nebraska, and at a few places in the eastern part of the state, during the last week of the month. The ■average precipitation for the state was 2.51 inches, which is 0.37 inch above the normal. At Lincoln the mean temperature for September </seg>

Of these 379, larvae, or 60.96%, died as larvae, while the other 230, or 39.04%, pupated. Pupation of second brood pupae began on July 12 and extended to September 7. Ordinarily second brood pupae do not appear until toward the middle of August, and pupation does not end until well into September, thus indicating that second brood pupation in 1934 was extraordinarily early and rapid. Of the 230 pupae formed, 90, or 34.13%, developed into moths, the other 140 pupae, representing 65.87% of the total number of pupae, dying during the pupal period. The average pupal period for the females was 11.1 days and for the males 10.7 days. The first moths of the second brood emerged on July 21, and the last one on September 14, in the insectary. The last moth was caught also in the bait traps on September 14. Ordinarily the flight of this brood of moths does not begin until the middle or end of August, and extends well into September or even nearly or quite to the middle of October. The peaks of second brood moth emergence occurred in the insectary on August 22 and 23. At the bait traps, the peaks were on July 31 and August 8, the former being the higher peak. The length of life of 36 female second brood moths averaged 17.7 days and of 54 male second brood moths averaged 20.8 days. Eggs of the third or wintering brood were first deposited on August 11 and the last ones were deposited on September 14. Thirty-six female third brood moths laid 1,578 eggs, of which 599 were laid on leaves. Of these, 161, or 26.83%, were fertile and hatched. Eggs of this brood were all hatched only a little after normally egg-laying should begin, the hatching period running from August 11 to September 15, with the peak on September 13. Discussion Question: Are those six traps located in the same location? Answer: Yes, in the same orchard not very far apart. Question: They have been there right straight through? Answer: Yes, maintained there consistently. Question: I didn't get the late date of the spring brood of moths this last year. Answer: The last one was on the 8th of June. </seg>
            <seg id="p564">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Question: Dr. Swenk what effect do you think this great dyings out of the Codling Moth during 1934 will have in 1935? Answer: The Codling Moth is a tremendously resilient worm which has so much potential ability. Right now this moth is at a very low ebb in population. The season so far has been unfavorable for it. If in April and May we have a normal rainfall along with warm weather, the Codling moth could still develop and have a first brood that would be normal in population. That's how quick a comeback they can make. Question: Would it be possible for your department to send someone into these different counties and with the assistance of the Extension Horticulturist make surveys in some of the normal orchards, using this survey as a basis for making recommendations as to the time of the first spray? Answer: Well, now we have been trying to do that. I think probably Mr. Hoppert can answer that. MR. HOPPERT: I doubt the feasibility of studying the codling moth in each orchard. I think it would be improper for either, the experiment station or the extension service to do that. There is danger too, of inviting trouble. As I see it this worker would be studying in - dividual orchards and probably be asked to make specific recommenda - tions for specific orchards. If they failed to give control he would be held responsible when perhaps inefficient spraying would be to blame. Question: Now, the worms that we sold this fall in apples, little fellows just going in were they first, second or third brood? Answer: They were probably the third or wintering brood. Those little fellows normally would go through the winter. What time were these apples picked? Statement: About the 10th or 15th of September. PROF. SWENK: We have two things to go by, our traps and when we first commence to see the worms go in. I remember in 1931, the first worms we found were on the 12th of June. We caught moths, however, before that. MR. HOPPERT: I think it is a little difficult for the average grower to interpret the results from his bait traps especially at the beginning. Just because 2 or 3 moths have been caught on a certain day does riot mean he should get out his sprayer and go to work. These early moths may be the only ones caught for several days. The sprays should be so timed as to' kill the most worms. During the past year conditions were so favorable for the codling moth that traps were of little </seg>
            <seg id="p565">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURE SOCIETY value. Where the infestation was heavy it was sound practice to spray every 10 days to keep the apples covered. In some years much of this spray would have been wasted. Question: Then you would recommend that orchards be sprayed some time after the peak of the hatch is out so that everything will be covered. Answer: Technically speaking, yes. Egg laying begins about 3 days after emergence takes place. It takes 6 to 10 days for the eggs to hatch. In all then, we have at least 9 days to get this spray on most orchardists have the equipment to cover their orchards in less time than this. Question: How many days from the time the moth first begins to fly does egglaying begin? Answer: This last year (1934) the first moth produced the first eggs May 12th, the first larva hatched May 19th. Question: You mentioned something about making observations on 1500 eggs. How many moths had laid 1500 eggs? . Answer: There were 36. That would be an average of 40 per moth. Question: Do you recall the largest number of eggs laid by one moth? Answer: Only vaguely. I don't recall the exact figure. RESOLUTION The following resolution was submitted and approved by the Horticultural Society on Thursday, January 4th: To the State Work Project Director, State F. E. R. A.: Honorable Sir: "We, the members of the Horticultural Society respectfully ask that you give consideration to orchard sanitation as a work project for F. E. R. A. workers in some of the counties where commercial orchard - ing is an industry. This work has been adopted as a project in Missouri and Kansas and several other eastern states. The work is done in the winter months when the ground is frozen and not suitable for the building of brush dams, earth dams and ponds. This project will give useful employment to 50 to 100 men in each of the counties along the river as far north as Washington county. It is of public benefit in that the harbors for insects and diseases will be removed not only in commercial orchards but also in farm orchards in the community.

I' ■ - ■ ■ EWE FEED M. A. ALEXANDER This summer we had more inquiries about silage than any other one topic. The corn was burning up and our main answer was to save it via the silo. Many farmers are not familiar with silage and then many know a great deal about silage. Silage is not a new feed in spite of the fact that it is new to many people. Many are using it for the first time this fall. Silage has been used as a sheep feed very successfully for a long time. There are, however, a few things we should keep in mind in feed - ing silage to ewes. Corn and Atlas silage have about the same feed - ing value for sheep. They can replace one another without difficulty One thing about feeding silage to bred ewes— they can get too much for too long a time. It is a safe practice to let them have all they want up to six weeks prior to lambing. To let them have all they want any longer is dangerous because it is likely to cause too much Internal pressure. This causes premature lambing from an inverted uterus To prevent this condition, the silage, or part of it, should be replaced with good bright hay. Three pounds of silage can be replaced by three - fourths pound of good legume hay. If you are planning to sell the ewes, after the lambs are weaned, a little ground ear corn can be used at this stage. This year we added ground ear corn and hay to our ration about three weeks before lambing time. Hampshire ewes can eat up to eight and a half pounds of silage One-fourth of a pound of protein supplement— cottonseed meal or linseed oil meal— and one pound of bone meal or mineral to every thirty-five or forty ewes can be added to the silage to an advantage Pregnant ewes need protein and mineral in order to give the fetus proper nourishment. Exercise also is an important thing in pregnant ewes. If they are fed and kept in a small lot, they will be likely to give birth to weak or dead lambs! Sometimes it is necessary to drive the ewes for them to get their exercise. It is too late to do anything about the feed after the ewes get down, and that is what they will do </seg>
            <seg id="p571">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION and you will lose the lamb and possibly the ewe. After the ewe has lambed, she can be fed all the silage she will take without any danger. Silage can also be fed to lambs. We are running an experiment now with lambs on silage. It is very interesting to watch. Come out to the sheds sometime during the week and the men will be very glad to show you the lambs. There are six lots in the experiment, four of which are getting silage as the only roughage. Two lots are getting tankage as the protein supplement rather than cottonseed meal or linseed oil meal, and one lot is getting meat scraps. The idea of the tankage is because tankage is higher in protein than cottonseed meal and low in price as compared to the other protein supplements. It contains more minerals than the other commonly used protein supplements. It was peculiar to watch the lambs when thex, were first fed tank - age. It was scattered over the top of the other feed and when the gate was opened the lambs bounced up to the feed racks, took one sniff, and bounded right back again. They didn't like it at all, but they finally took to it and now they are getting as much as the lot getting cotton - seed meal. One lot is getting straw as their only roughage and the other lot is a check lot of corn and alfalfa hay. Tomorrow the lambs will have been on feed fifty-six days. The results of this experiment will be interesting to watch. If you have any questions or personal problems concerning sheep, come up after the program. Slli AGE FOR CATTLE R. R. THALMAN I think I have received letters with inquiries about silage con - cerning every conceivable angle. I don't know of any question asked that hasn't been received here at the station. A cow can't get too much silage. They can eat silage to their hearts' content and it will not hurt them. If your silage is a little or even quite a bit moldy, do not throw it away, but feed it to the cows. They will eat it unless it is too moldy and it won't hurt them. Silage is one of the best all around conditioners that we have for cows. Silage is usually thought of as a winter feed, but it can be fed in the summertime equally as well. It replaces pasture to a limited extent. It can be approached as a substitute for pasture by a root crop or wet beet pulp, but neither is any better than silage. It is our main roughage here. We usually feed hay if it is cheap, but now you can </seg>
            <seg id="p572">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE buy a ton of cottonseed meal for what you would have to pay for three tons of hay, and cottonseed meal with silage makes a good ration. Alfalfa hay is a good all around feed, but there are relatively few alfalfa districts so that alfalfa hay is limited in its distribution and candot be bought anywhere. We have been recommending silage for horses. Last summer we ran out of hay down at the horse barn and we fed some of them silage and they came through fat and in good shape. One thing that should be watched is that moldy silage should not be fed to horses. Silage should be supplemented for horses. Cottonseed cake makes a good horse protein supplement, about one pound per day being the usual amount fed. In the South it is a common practice to feed cottonseed cake to horses and mules, especially the latter. They are more liberal with their allowance down there, too. A horse needs a concentrate to carry them through the winter and with the other concentrates as high as they are, cottonseed meal might well be fed to horses. The question of how much silage to feed a cow might well be con - sidered. A 900-pound cow can be maintained on 20 pounds of silage and 30 pounds of oats straw, but if she gets 35 or 40 pounds of silage, a pound of supplement, and 3 pounds of hay, she can maintain her weight and go along and produce a calf. There is no object of carry - ing a cow through anyway. She must produce a calf this spring in order to pay for her keep this winter. It is a good idea to put a mineral mixture in the cow's ration, especially if you want a good calf. The best mineral mixture for cattle consists of 40 per cent bone meal, 40 per cent ground limestone, and 20 per cent salt. We have had numerous requests on full-feeding steers on silage. A 400-pound steer will eat from 30 to 35 pounds of silage and during cold weather it takes more. A cow will eat from 50 to 75 per cent more feed during real cold weather, especially if a blizzard is in progress. Let us look into what can be done with a calf. A 600-pound calf at $4 is $24, and feed him 150 days and he should weight 600 pounds, and at the same price per cwt., it is worth $36. This leaves $12 for feed. During that time it would have eaten about 150 pounds of cottonseed meal and two tons of silage. The cottonseed meal is worth about $2.25, which leaves $9.75 for the silage. Deducting $1.00 per ton for labor, we have $7.75, or about $3.85 per ton for silage. At a 7-ton yield, this is $22.00 per acre, which equals a 40-bushel yield at 50c per bushel net, if you sell the corn. This is figuring conservatively and it would be much higher with Atlas sorgo. If you have corn fodder and 'an empty silo, it will pay to cut it up yet. Ensiling saves fodder, there is no shrinkage, neither is there dirt or grit, as there is In corn fodder. Dry fodder can be put into the silo by adding as much water by weight as there is corn fodder. </seg>
            <seg id="p573">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION It will go through the fermenting stage and in most cases will prove to be equal to silage made from green corn fodder. Out at the farm we put some dry corn fodder in the silo, mixing it well with water, and it turned out very good. It was fed to calves and they made very good gains. They averaged about two pounds per day for the first part of the feeding period. Later the silage was taken off the ration. We have heard a lot about thistles this fall. The feeding value of thistles has been compared to alfalfa hay and such feeds. While thistles contain 16 per cent protein to 13 per cent in alfalfa hay, only 5 per cent is digestible in the former while 10.7 per cent is digestible in alfalfa hay, so there is really not much comparison. Russian thistles may cause impaction and it may be fed with molasses which is a physic and will take away some of the constipating effect of the thistles. Good thistles are all right and may be fed with only a protein supple - ment, but if you are feeding poor thistles, it is well to add some molasses as well as the protein supplement. Thistle silage is usually not as good as thistle hay, especially if they are cut at the proper stage. Silage is not only an emergency feed, but is a good feed anytime. It will keep indefinitely in a good silo. I have seen silage that was 13 years old and it was almost as good as it was the day it was put in. Silage has many uses and many advantages and I see no reason why it should not continue the increased use that it has had this year. . . •■...•• SILAGE CROPS ■ ■ P. H. STEWART Three months ago a talk about silage crops would have dealt largely with Russian thistles, waist-high, immature corn with few or any ears, and with emergency crops of other kinds. Today, looking ahead into the future with the optimism and faith that every farmer must have or else be lost in a cloud of pessimism, we will spend most of our time talking about normal crops that we expect to produce rather than I about the emergency crops. Like the farmer who keeps his buildings" insured against the fire that he hopes will never come, we will plan on some crops that are the best insurance we have against complete crop failure, namely the group of plants of the sorgo family. Although none of us in 1935 expect to sow a field for silage to Russian thistles or pig-weeds or Kochia, also called fireweed, we are thankful today for these pests in many localities where stacks or trench silos of thistles are doing surprisingly well in keeping some </seg>
            <seg id="p574">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE livestock through the winter and thereby saving farmers their main working tools and sources of income — cattle and horses. I have here in these two jars some silage made largely from Russian thistles. Mr. Keim brought these from his home farm in Nuckolls County. This one is from the sides of the silo where there was too little water and it does not have quite the smell and flavor desired. Cattle will eat it, however, and apparently do fairly well on it. This other jar came from the center of the silo and has quite a decent smell and flavor. As an emergency feed it Is way ahead of the leeward side of a.barbwire fence. I am wondering what the farmers who built trench silos this year are going to do with them next season. Let me ask two questions just to get your thought on the matter. First, how many of those who are here built a silo of some kind for this year? Second, how many of you, even if next season is a fairly normal one, expect to fill the silo again this fall for 1936? When we think of silage crops for Nebraska, we normally think first of corn and second of sorgo crops. I am inclined to believe that we should reverse this and think first of planting an acreage of Atlas, Orange, Sumac or Amber cane, that under average conditions would fill the silage needs. Although there is probably but little that 'I can say about corn for silage that will be new to you, I would like to mention two or three points. In the first place, if we are using corn as a silage crop, what is the best variety to use? Shall we pick a large late variety which may not freely mature, or shall we use an ordinary variety common to the Community? Tests on this point have been run in several states. We might summarize these reports by saying that when measured in terms of dry matter produced per acre, the ordinary dent varieties grown for grain are at least equal to the late types. Green weight per acre does tiot tell the whole story. Not only is more water present in the large late types but tests also show a lower digestibility per unit of dry matter in silage made from relatively later-maturing varieties. That is on the basis of a unit of dry matter, silage made from well dented varieties containing about 30% dry matter has a greater digestibility and nutritive value than that made from less mature varieties. Acording to these tests, and they are fairly consistent as to data, there is no advantage in growing an especially large late variety of corn for silage. The use of a standard variety which yields well when measured in terms of grain production is recommended. The normal rate of planting for grain production is also most likely to give the highest average returns per acre. </seg>
            <seg id="p575">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION Sorgos For Silage Unless we should soon enter a cycle of wet years which weather officials say may occur, an increase in the use of sorghum crops for silage may be expected. Atlas and Orange varieties in eastern and southern Nebraska and earlier varieties, such as Sumac, Black Amber and Orange farther west and north are likely to be grown on most livestock farms. Those of you who have attended meetings here at the College before are familiar with the results which we have been getting with Atlas sorgo, a variety developed from a cross between blackhull kafir and sourless cane. The crop has the head and grain characteristics of kafir and the sweet, juicy, leafy stalk of the sweet sorghums. The stalks are resistant to lodging. In drought resistance, Atlas is similar to Orange and other sorgo varieties, but is distinctly superior to corn. Atlas generally produces an exceptionally heavy tonnage, although in southeastern Nebraska the Late Orange variety may equal it. It is leafy and sturdy in growth. Its yield as a silage crop has averaged about twice that of corn. Atlas also makes good cured fodder and, if drilled in thick, can be used as a hay crop. There are some reports indicating that it makes a satisfactory crop for the manufacture of syrup in the southern part of Nebraska where the growing season is sufficiently long. Atlas sorgo shows more resistance to chinch bugs than corn. Rntc and Manner of Planting The rate of planting Atlas depends on the use that is to be made of the crop. In the more favorable parts of the state 14 to 15 pounds of seed may be used per acre. The Animal Husbandry Department has found IS pounds per acre a satisfactory rate for Atlas when listed in for the production of silage. In the drier parts of the state, the rate of planting should be reduced accordingly. In areas having more than 25 inches of rainfall, the seeding rate, when drilled, should be from 50 to 100 pounds of seed per acre. In the drier parts of the state, the rate might be one-half or less of this amount. It is difficult to make definite recommendations as how to set machines to plant the desired amount of seed per acre. Regular corn plates are usually not satisfactory. Blank plates drilled with a number of holes % of an inch in diameter are satisfactory for Atlas in Eastern Nebraska. The holes should be reamed on from the lower side to prevent clogging. Some adjustment may be necessary to secure the correct rate of planting. Atlas sorgo, in listed or surface planted rows, is handled as one </seg>
            <seg id="p576">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE would take care of corn. The crop is usually planted at about the - regular corn planting time for the community. For thinner seeding,, holes three-sixteenths of an inch in diameter are satisfactory. Length of Growing Season anil Time of Harvest Atlas sorgo requires about 125 days to mature, which is three to four weeks longer than Black Amber sorgo. Even in southeastern Nebraska, Atlas is usually none too well matured by normal frost time. In northern and western Nebraska, in some seasons, Atlas is very likely to be too late for satisfactory results as a silage crop. In 1933, it made satisfactory silage at the Valentine Station and matured good quality seed in Logan county near Gandy. The crop should be allowed to mature as well as possible before - harvesting it. If put into the silo when extremely immature, it is likely to produce a very sour, acid silage of low palatability. Disadvantages Atlas sorgo, like other sorghum varieties, may be poisonous if used for pasture. Second-growth and drought-injured plants are particul - arly likely to be poisonous if pastured off. When cured, there seems to be little or no danger from poison. Although no definite figures are available, Atlas sorgo is thought to have the same effect on the land as other varieties. The heavy yield requires much moisture and fertility, which is usually reflected in lower yields of crops which follow on the land. Atlas sorgo fodder is more difficult to grind satisfactorily than corn, as most mills will not crack the seed. Tests show that much of the grain from fairly well-matured sorgo crops when used for silage, pass through animals undigested. From one-third to one-half or more of the seeds are normally undigested. It may be worthwhile to consider topping the bundles and ensiling only the stover particularly when the grain is scarce and high in price. There is going to be a great scarcity of sorgo seed of all kinds for 1935 planting. The crop is reported to be the lowest on record. I know of only a few fields of Amber sorgo and one or two of Atlas. A few fields of sorgo of the early-maturing variety sold as Atlas last spring, did mature seed and no doubt will be used for planting purposes. Prices on sorgo seed are hardly established as yet. Atlas is being quoted now at about $5.00 to $6.00 per cwt. Due to the scarcity of sorgo seed of the common adapted sorts, much seed of a little-known variety is now being offered in this state. Much of it will no doubt be sold. This is known as the "Hegari". The following statement describes it. </seg>
            <seg id="p577">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION "Hegari is now the leading grain sorghum in southern Arizona under irrigation. It is widely grown in south and west Texas and in eastern New Mexico and is of considerable importance in eastern Texas and south central Oklahoma. It appears to be best adapted to condi - tions of high temperature and abundant moisture. In west Texas and eastern New Mexico, it is grown principally as a bundle feed. Under favorable conditions, it produces good yields of grain but in dry sea - sons, produces very little grain but a fair quantity of forage. It is popular with farmers as a forage crop because it is leafy, jucy and has palatable stalks. It also does not grow too tall to be cut easily with a corn binder. It has largely replaced kaflr in New Mexico, west Texas and some other sections because of its forage qualities. "When Hegari is grown under favorable environmental conditions, it often is rather erratic in maturity, height of stalk and in the uni - formity of appearance. As a forage crop, it should be equal or sup - erior to Blackhull kaflr and Grohoma. Because of its shorter height, Hegari will not yield nearly so large a tonnage as Atlas sorgo and other tall sorgo varieties. The seed of Hegari is rather soft and starchy and may give some trouble, in securing stands although it should be less troublesome than feterita in this respect. In any case, the seed should be treated with copper carbonate before planting. Considerable quantities of seed are available and are being handled by the seed trade. This is being secured from southern Arizona, south Texas, south central Oklahoma and occasional lots of old seed are available in west Texas". The Agronomy Department of the Nebraska College of Agriculture suggests that so far as possible Black Amber and Sumac be given preference for forage where early-maturing varieties are desired and Atlas and Orange where these later sorts can be grown. Hegari has produced slightly heavier yields of cured forage than Black Amber sorgo during a 6-year period in Nebraska Experiment Station tests and was unsurpassed in grain production. It should therefore prove very satisfactory as an emergency forage crop in this state. SILO TYPES IVAN D. WOOD The first type of silo that I can remember was the old wooden stave silo. This type has disappeared long ago. The next type to find popular use was the hexagonal type made by laying 2x4's or 2x6's flat. This type was not air-tight and the inside corners caused a lot of spoilage, which is true with any above ground silo that has square corners. The silage won't pack tightly enough in the corners and a lot of spoil- </seg>
            <seg id="p578">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE age is the result. The same thing is true of the old square steel silo. It was made with steel sheets with asphalt on the inside. They gave fairly good service, but the silage freezes badly in them and the square corners cause a lot of spoilage. Along about 1914 or 1915, the pit silo came into use and many of them were dug in the next four or five years. Most of them are still in use. They consist of a round hole from 12 to 16 feet across, dug in the ground. They vary from 20 to 40 feet in depth. They have smooth plastered sides. The bad air, or damps as they are called, that collect in the bottom of the pit silo are one of the objections of this type of silo. We have all heard stories of how a man was overcome by the gas and the boy went down to get him and he too was over - come by the bad air. I know a man in Dawes county who puts a jack rabbit in his pit and when he sees that the rabbit is still alive, he knows that it is safe for him to go down. He says that he has never lost a rabbit. The hoist is the main disadvantage of this type. Many types of hoists are now in use from a hand windlass to horse drawn devices. One method to get away from the use of a hoist is to dig the silo next to a steep side hill and tunnel in from the side and it can be taken out just the same as it is from an upright. I have heard of a man who had this arrangement and when filling time came he led a mule into the silo through the tunnel and let the mule tramp the silage and when the silo was full, lead him out the top. I don't know how practical this is, but it is worth mentioning. There are many kinds of upright masonery silos. If they are con - structed right, they will give good service. I have seen several that were not properly reenforced and they have broken out. This is usually rather serious and they are very difficult and sometimes im - possible to repair. Construct them properly and they will give good service for a long time. What is the future of the trench silo? My opinion is that the trench silo is here to stay. Most of them are about 12 feet wide at the top, 8 feet wide at the bottom, and 8 feet deep. If the walls are not lined, the walls are going to get rough and the trench must be widened in order to cut out the rough spots. Some may say that they are only a temporary proposition and that they do not want to put money into a lining for a trench silo, but if I had a thousand dollars to put into a silo, it would still be a trench. The big advantage of the trench silo lies in the fact that they are easy to fill. With the use of the field cutter, the crew required to fill a silo is reduced a considerable amount. There are many empty silos over the state and the farmers say that they cannot get help to fill them. If your neighbor does not have a silo that he wants you to help him fill, he may help you fill one year. </seg>
            <seg id="p579">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AXD FEEDERS ASSOCIATION but the chances are that he will have something else to do the next year when silo filling time conies. It is a labor proposition. With the field cutters, someone to drive the team is the only necessity. Dump - ing the load can easily be done by putting a woven wire in the bottom of the wagon and after the wagon is full, back it up to the pile. Hitch a team to the front end of the woven wire and the silage comes out with the wire. Even women can drive a silage wagon when it is done in this manner. A very satisfactory roof for a trench silo can be made. They are made of light material and galvanized metal. They can be made in sections so that they are easily removed. I think that a lot of trench silos are going to be lined in the future. There are several ways of lining a trench silo. Common plastering is not satisfactory and is not recommended. A gunite outfit can do a good job of lining a trench silo. They use them to line irrigation canals and they will work equally well on a trench silo. The only drawback is that they are an expensive outfit and a person buying a gunite outfit would have to line a large number of silos in order to make it pay. Other methods are using solid concrete, clay tile and brick. A two - inch brick lining costs about $8.50 per 100 square feet, four-inch, $13.00, and eight-inch, $26.00 per 100 square feet. This includes the brick and the mortor, but not the cost of the labor. The work can be done by amateurs and can be done rather cheaply. Clay tile costs approximately the same amount. The material it would take to make a four-inch solid cement lining costs about $12 to $12 per 100 square feet and for a six-inch lining, about $17 to $18 per 100 square feet. There is a bulletin available that gives the method of construction, the cost, and some of the details of these different linings. More infor - mation is contained in it than I have time to tell you. It also takes up packing the ensilage in a trench silo, and it must be well packed in a trench silo in order to keep well. If it is packed well, silage will keep in a trench silo just as well as it will in any other silo. We have a supply of these bulletins over at the Agricultural Engineering Building and you may get it over there or you may write to the Extension Ser - vice for it. CUMIXG COUNTY'S EXPERIENCE WITH TRENCH CONSTRUCTION CLAY M, WESTCOTT Cuming county is usually an area of surplus rough feeds. The farmers usually have more than they can use and have been selling a considerable amount in former years. This past year was no exception. The corn made a good growth during a very favorable spring and early summer, but in late July and early August the hot winds, which in </seg>
            <seg id="p580">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE a normal year do not reach that far north and east, began to damage the corn. It wasn't long until considerable damage had been done and the corn began to fire and burn up. The farmers, who for the most part are of German descent and are conservative, began to wonder what was going to happen. About the first of August the farmers began to come in and ask me what to do to conserve the feed they had. It seemed to me that the trench silo was the solution to the problem. Time was pressing and there was a big problem of what was the best way to dig the trenches in a short time and yet not cost too much. There was a contractor in the county who had a ditch machine, a drag line outfit. We thought that this might be used to dig trench silos, so we went to him. He thought he could do it but didn't know what he would have to charge or how he would move the machine. He said, however, that he would go out and try it and let us know how much he would charge. We got together on the moving and went out to one farm. This farmer had considerable roughage. The contractor dug two silos for this farmer. One was 200 feet long, 10 feet deep, and 16 feet across at the top and 8 feet across the bottom, and the other was just the same except that it was 160 feet long instead of 200. These two silos were dug in eight and one-half hours and the contractor charged $63.00 for the job. These ditches hold about 600 tons of feed, which makes the construction cost 10 cents per ton of feed. Three hundred ninety-four silos were dug in Cuming county this year. They ■ hold about 45,000 tons of ensilage. We held six or eight feed conservation meetings during August. At these meetings we stressed the value of ensilage and the necessity of conserving all the feed possible. We urged the farmer to dig two silos where he had the corn to fill them. We suggested that one might be used by the farmer himself and the other be used 'to store feed to sell. Many of them followed this suggestion. Some silage has been sold out of Cuming county. Transportation has been the big problem. Much more will be sold providing the weather permits it. We are selling the ensilage through the non-stock cooperative association. Many of the 394 trench silos were dug with slip scrapers and fresnos. The cost is higher per ton of feed stored when they are dug in this manner than when they are dug with a drag line outfit. There are three classes of trench silos. The first and the most practical type is the open end type. They are dug on the sidehill with the lower end open. I figure that this is the ideal set-up because the rain will run out of them and you do not have an incline to drive up when the ensilage is being taken out. The second type is the one that is sloping at each end. The third type is the partial above ground trench silo. By this I mean that the dirt taken from the ditch is piled on each side and forms the upper wall of the silo. This reduces the </seg>
            <seg id="p581">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION amount of dirt moved and thereby reduces the cost, and the ensilage keeps just as well in these as it does in any of the other types. We have one of this type in the county that holds 1100 tons of ensilage. Some of the farmers covered the ensilage with about 6 inches of clay dirt and I believe that this is the best. Some covered with straw and sweet clover hay, but this does not exclude the air and you will have some spoilage. The same thing happens when you cover with a layer of straw or hay and then dirt. I believe the trench silo is here to stay. It works not only as au emergency proposition, but for a long-time project. I know most of our farmers who dug silos expect to use them year after year and I believe there will be some new silos dug in Cuming county next year. PACKER FEEDING AND OTHER PROBLEMS C. J. ABBOTT Some time ago the American National Live Stock Association asked me to discuss cattle feeding by packers and its presumably ill effects on feeders and the producers of live stock. I agreed to do this if I might be permitted to add, "And Other Problems", to the title of my address. Consequently the title of my. address today is, "Packer Feeding and Other Problems." This is the first time I have ever attended these meetings of Ne - braska Organized Agriculture. I am very happy to be here. I ap - preciate the honor of being asked to address you. The problems of our industry have always interested me. We are all producers or feeders of live stock. As producers and feeders of live stock we are members of a family which we may term the meat industry. I think of this family as composed of six members, pro - ducers, feeders, marketing agencies, processors, wholesalers and re - tailers. I have always been a firm believer of settling family differences within the family. A united family is usually a happy family. I hope that thru discussion of these problems our industry will become ! a united family instead of dividing itself into distrustful factions. As the producers of the raw material of the meat industry, what are our problems? Let us name three of the most often discussed, packer feeding, direct marketing and the widening price spread be - tween producer and consumer. Let us add a fourth, our political prob - lem, as a problem that concerns all of us, and because many of our people are eager to make one or all of the three problems a political problem. </seg>
            <seg id="p582">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Is packer feeding a problem or merely a grievance? Does it enable a local packer to place himself in a better buying position? By feed - ing cattle can a national packer influence the market to his advant - age? Does packer feeding of cattle unnecessarly cause corporate work to displace individual work? Most all of us have an answer to these questions. There are some two thousand packing plants in the United States. Some of these plants are very large, some are quite small comparatively, but all are packing plants as distinguished from retail butcher's slaughter houses. ! Of these two thousand packers I can say that I am well acquainted with two, reasonably well acquainted with two others and know some of the officers of the large packers. My smallest packer friend has about 200 head of cattle on feed all of the time. In fact he plans on having this many cattle ahead. Pie kills about thirty-live head of cattle per week. He also keeps hogs in his lots, but not as many as cattle in proportion to his kill. My friend who operates a larger packing establishment, yet is one of the small packers, feeds as many as 7000 head of cattle in the lots adjacent to his establishment. His kill is said to be approximately 600 head of cattle per week at this plant. He has another interior plant and maintains eastern sales rooms. His pork business is much larger than his beef business. I asked an officer of one of our largest national packers for an estimate of the total number of cattle which they had fed during the fiscal year ending in 1934. His company had fed 11,171 head of cattle in the United States and Canada. Three years before, they had fed just over thirty thousand cattle. During 1934 they had slaughtered approximately three and one-half million cattle. Practically all of the cattle his company had fed were slaughtered at western plants and were sold direct to the local trade. They were fed for this par - ticular purpose. I found that the local packer and the interior packer fed a greater percentage of cattle in comparison to their i kill than the large packer and that they regarded their feed lots as necessary in order to keep on hand an adequate supply of cattle for their needs. Their supply fluctuates to a greater extent than the national packers, because they can buy from only a portion of the national market. I did not find that the local packer could, because of his location, buy his supplies any cheaper than he could have on the central market. His big asset was his proximity to both supplies and local trade. However, as a matter of policy large corporations should not do things which in - dividuals can and will do. </seg>
            <seg id="p583">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION Direct buying of live stock is one of our most discussed and most troublesome problems. Its criticism can be traced to the growth of the interior packers. In order that any national packer or any small packer may maintain his competitive position, he must at all times, have access to raw material at prices comparable to those paid by other packers. He must buy the cheapest meat, quality considered, that is offered, because his sales are based upon competitive price. Both marketing agencies and producers are deeply interested in this problem. Are packers able to control prices by buying their sup - plies from interior markets and concentration points at figures based on the central market price? Do interior packers make use of unfair classifications and weights in their dealings? Is direct buying a threat to the central market? Are central marketing agencies penalized by this practice? Our answer to the first of these questions must be based upon two more questions. Do packers compete in buying supplies and do they compete in selling the finished product? Most all of us think of four concerns when we say packers. There are only four extremely large packers which we call national packers. There are, however, ten more packers who are extremely large, small - packers and who maintain eastern sales forces. Next in importance are a large group of large, small-packers, who operate their plants in the east and buy part of their supply in the west. Following this group "we find a host of others, of all sizes. Both the base of supplies and the market place for a few is the United States. For a large number, the market place is the extreme east and the extreme west, where two-thirds of all of our meat is marketed. Their supplies come from the great two-thirds of the United States which is known as the middle west. They buy where their pur - chasing cost will be lowest. The remainder are local middle western packers, who can most advantageously serve their local market, but who can and who do ship both beef and pork to the east to be sold through brokers. It is these two groups, the packer who has his plant on the coast and buys his supplies every where, and the packer who has his plant where the supplies are and ships everywhere which compete with the large packer, both on purchases and on sales. It is ridiculous to con - tend that they can cheapen their purchases by unfair practices. They are the producer's safeguard that we shall have free competitive markets. Competition on sales in the east can best be visualized by figures. The classified business directory of Boston, shows 94 firms listed as wholesalers of meat. In the Burough of Manhattan, a part of New York City there are 115 and in Philadelphia 119 firms. The east will </seg>
            <seg id="p584">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE i . ' take all the beef shipped there at some price. Consequently it has become the market place for all of the excess supplies of the middle west. Western beef often sells there for less than it sells locally. While we are talking of eastern markets it is interesting to know that there are 1512 retail meat markets, exclusive of chain stores in Philadelphia. Conservatively estimated, the fixtures in these markets alone would be valued at as much today as 300 Nebraska sandhill ranches stocked with 500 head of cattle each. It is my opinion that the uneasiness displayed by our central marketing agencies regarding direct marketing is unwarranted. These central market agencies have established themselves over many years of free competition. There has never been a time when citizens of the United States could not deal directly with each other. In a free country this right of a citizen to deal where he pleases can never be changed. The packer first established himself where supplies were to be had and should be expected to continue this policy. Charges for services by market - ing agencies can become too high on the central markets. Sources of supplies and charges for services change. Central markets must expect customers to turn away from them when costs of transporta - tion and charges become too high. Producers are the individuals who are most vitally interested in free competition and free markets. They should diligently guard both. They have resorted to political action and regulation of both packers and marketing agencies in the past. If regulation had have been the answer to the problems of our in - dustry, with the enactment of these regulatory measures our problems would have ceased to be. I have always felt that when we were regulating the packers we were merely regulating ourselves. The costs of any such regulation must ultimately be born by the producers as a fixed expense. Is fixed expense the cause of the widening price spread between producer and consumer? We have taken this price spread as our third problem. Let us examine those items of expense which are com - mon to all packers and which are fairly constant and equal. They con - sist of labor, transportation, supervision and taxes. I During the year 1931 labor received approximately 9c out of each dollar of packer sales. This averages approximately one half of all the money received by the packer and not returned to the producer at the point where his live stock was marketed. Labor costs per dollar of packer sales declined slightly during 1932 and 1933. This was due largely to increased tonnage. During 1934 the packers have increased their hourly wage rates twice, not-withstanding the fact that before the increase the hourly rate was approximately 50% higher than </seg>
            <seg id="p585">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION' 1914, and notwithstanding the fact that the agricultural employer "has been forced to reduce wages. An interesting fact that producers should know is that the hourly - rate inmost packing establishments is from 50£ to $1.10 per hour. The packer must guarantee 32 hours per week. In one large packing establishment last year's bonus amounted to $3.52 per week per man. This establishment also provides old age pensions at approximately one half of the yearly salary after an employee becames 65 years old. This concern also provides a two weeks vacation each year for all workers and at full pay. Workers who have served twenty years and over are entitled to 3 weeks at full pay. Supervision and transportation are the second and third largest expenses in the budget of the packers. Each is about equal in size and together they constitute about 5% of packer sales. Taxes are another fundamental cost to all packers and are an - other fixed factor in the spread between producer and consumer. Tax varies among different packers. Swift and Co's. balance sheet, as pub - lished for 1934 makes provision for the payment of $7,432,762 in taxes. These fundamental charges constitute approximately 15^^ of the 19&lt;f which is shown by published statements of the large packers as being all the percentage of their sales not returned to the producer in purchase of his live stock. I have purposely omitted mentioning invested capital as a funda - mental cost. Competitive business cannot adjust its profits higher, because of the amount of wealth represented by its invested capital. By investing capital we can provide a business machine. The product of the business machine must be sold for more than its cost. It must be sold in competition to the product of other business machines. Most •of the present propaganda against business gains the ears of the public because we fail to recognize the fact that competitive business cannot fix its profits. Let us next recognize the fact in this discussion of price spread that the total money, or perhaps I should say exchangable product of meat consumers, has since 1928 grown steadily less. The year 1928 marked the beginning of the time that industrialists could not profitably dis - pose of their output. Unemployment followed because employers could not convert labor, taxes, cost of materials and use of money into exchangeable products. This condition became more tense until the spring of 1932. A political campaign and the advent of the National Recovery Act, among other things stopped the functioning of the natural laws which were then becoming effective and intensified our •already unbalanced trade. When we, as producers, attempt to con - vert our livestock thru the medium of a packer whose fixed expense is </seg>
            <seg id="p586">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 83% of bis total expense and profits into the goods of our consumers,, who had no way to producing due to this unbalanced condition, it be - comes at once apparent why our price spread has widened. When we come to consider the problem of converting our product into the product of our consumers, we are brought face to face with politics. All of our other problems except part of the problem of price spread are family problems. The steady decline in the value of cattle beginning in 1928 and lasting until 1934 was not caused by the over production of cattle. Overproduction of cattle was caused by two things. The consuming public would not consume at the exchange value they had been paying and the fact that consumers could turn to pork and other foods. Within the family of the meat industry, two products are almost interchangeable. One is beef and the other is pork. Pork lost its ex - port value when other nations raised a tariff wall against our agri - cultural products, pork included. The cause of this tariff wall is debatable, but if America is to export any of her products she must accept goods in return. If America is to lend capital abroad, she must accept pay for its use in goods. Therefore we can only exchange the amount of goods or safely employ as much capital abroad as the value of the goods we are willing to import. It is a mistake to think that we can raise the American standard of living by closing our ports to the importation of goods. Our stand - ard of living has been attained by our ability to produce and trade. The greater a nation's production per capita the more we have on a basis of fair exchange to consume per capita. The reason we have poverty in a land of plenty is because some of us price our product at an exorbitant figure. It is the function of government to protect trade and promote the general welfare. Would it not be advantageous today to equalize the wages and profits of industry with the wages and profits of the country? We have embarked upon a programme of curtailment both in industry and in agriculture. High production costs in industry will be met with retalitory costs on the part of agriculture. We agriculturists must remember that any family, given a few acres of good ground can supply nearly all of its own food. We must produce at a price that consumers will pay. The eastern consumer did not send us into this great region, nor did he promise to buy our produce. We came of our own accord, because the east was crowded. We prospered as we traded with the people who comprise the east. Our pioneers made the great middle west a comfortable place to live. They stocked its farms and ranches with fine live stock. Other pioneers developed a distribution system, that is not equalled in any other part of the world. </seg>
            <seg id="p587">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION Our pioneers and their system of distribution probably had many faults. We producers and packers of today have many faults In order to eliminate some of these faults and in order to promote those things which would tend to steady and broaden our market some of us had hoped to unite our industry as other industries have united under a marketing agreement. The packer's committee had confidence in our producer's committee. We had agreed upon everything and finally, although the packers feared being made into a political foot - ball they agreed to surrender to the Department of Agriculture the privacy of their books. Our committee had brought this about. Politics and ignorance finally blocked the right of you as a producer to unite your own family, the meat industry. Politics in the form of a sincere congressman who was ignorant of the fact and is today ignorant of the fact that meat in the sense we use the term cannot be stored. Live stock bought in Chicago Monday will be in New York coolers the next Monday and will all be sold to retailers by the next Friday. All koshered cattle and when I say koshered cattle I mean the meat for a Jewish population, which in New York alone is greater than the population of Nebraska must be eaten within 72 hours of the animal's slaughter else it requires an additional inspection by a Rabbi. The extreme limit that the Jewish religion permits meat to be used is nine days. Meat excepting that used for canning or sausage and that portion of a hog which is cured positively must be sold fresh. ' Imagine my amazement when I heard Congressman Cummins of Colorado during a hearing before the Agricultural Committee of the house address himself to Mr. Brock of Wyoming as follows- "And what assurance have you (Mr. Brock) that if you adopt such a plan as you have outlined here, that the packers will not be in a posi - tion to do exactly the same thing as they did before, cut the price to the retailers, and after they have the price down so low that the cattle men cannot make anything out of their cattle then they will step in and buy them up. I have had them skin me alive." When I heard this I thought of my uncle who had been one of the west's great buffalo hun - ters. He had been asked to drive a famous politician from the rail - road station to the school house where he was going to make a speech. He met the politician with his sleigh. When the great poli - tician came out to the sleigh he insisted that there be some changes made in the harness so as to balance the load and make my uncle a more efficient driver. My uncle patiently made the changes. They then entered the sleigh and the politician insisted that the buffalo robe be turned over, because, he said, it would be much warmer if the hair were turned next the passengers. After doing this they started on their way. They had gone but a short distance when my uncle began to chuckle. The politician asked him why he was chuckl - ing. He said, "I was just thinking what fools these buffalos have </seg>
            <seg id="p588">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE been all of these centuries that they have been wearing their hair on. the wrong side of their hide." My father started our business in 1889. We have been selling some cattle to packers each year since its establishment. It was built on honesty and charity for our fellow man. It was built upon the con - fidence of our employees and of the public. Who of we producers cannot recall the loss of confidence in 1932 and 1933? How many of us remember that, Carter Glass, declined to assume the office of secretary of the treasury? How many of us knew that the accepted reason of his refusal was that the president - elect had refused to give the senator assurance that we would not innate and debase our money? How many of us know that in the last fourteen days of the Hoover administration hoardings and ship - ments of gold abroad had totaled $1,212,000,000. Gentlemen these and many others are the politicial causes which brought our industry and our people to their knees in 1932 and 1933. Drouth and crop reduction will produce a kind of prosperity for a few. But always remember that a nation's wealth, and an individual's wealth is measured in the terms of their productivity and capacity to export. Real recovery will be slow and will not be hastened except by confidence. Let us live so that we may have confidence in each other. Let us become a united family. ■-'.;,. ' ■ ■ •..'■..'• HANDY FEED MEASUREMENTS IVAN D. WOOD We here at the station have had lots of requests on how to measure feed. One recommendation that I always make is where it is possible weigh the feed, then there is no chance of mistake as there is in phys - ical measuring. One suggestion — when you write in, be sure and give all the necessary measurements. For example, a man wrote in the other day and said that he had a trench silo 12 feet wide at the top, 10 feet deep, and 100 feet long. Of course, with only those figures it was practically impossible to calculate the capacity of the silo. We did not know how sloping the sides were or how wide the silo was at the bottom nor did he tell us how full it was. Give us all the meas - urements you can, because it makes it easier for us and also you will get your answer sooner. It is better to give us too many, some that we won't use, than to send us too few measurements. We get a number of requests for information on how to figure capa - city of cribs. With the crib which has a sloping roof, the thing to do is </seg>
            <seg id="p589">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION to get the average height by adding the two odd figures and dividing by two. This figure times the width will give the end area. The end area multiplied by the length will give the cubic feet in the crib. In the case of ear corn, the cubic feet divided by 2.5 will give the bushels, and in the case of small grain the figure is 1.25. So in the case of small grain divide by 1.25 instead of 2.5. In round cribs the thing to do is to get the area of the base. This may be done by multiplying the diameter by itself and that by .7854. This will give the area of the bottom. The area multiplied by the height will give the volume. From there you proceed exactly as in figuring any other crib. Divide by 2.5 or 1.25 as the case may be. This same can be used in calculating the capacity of a round bin or granary. We are requested many times to find the number of tons of hay in a stack. All stacks of hay may be placed in one of four groups; round stacks, low round-topped oblong stacks, high round-topped oblong stacks, and square flat-topped oblong stacks. There is no use of me going into the figures because there are so many good circulars out on this very subject. I have a supply here of what I consider the best circular out on measuring stacks. I will leave a supply here on the table which you may get after the meeting. You will notice it divides the three oblong stacks into three kinds and gives a formula for the measuring of each. It also gives the formula for the calculation of the volume of round stacks. On page 4 is the table which gives the number of cubic feet in a ton of the common hays. And the last two pages are devoted to a table giving the cubic feet in a stack with a cer - tain circumference and a certain over. In case this supply does not last, the title of this leaflet is "Measuring Hay in Stacks", Leaflet No. 72, U. S. D". A. and may be obtained either here or by writing to Washington. One other point I might mention in regard to silos is to give the shape and also how full it is. The number of cubic feet per ton of silage varies considerably. A cubic foot of silage may weigh up to 45 pounds per cubic foot — not this year, however, because the ensilage Is un - usually light this year. The most accurate way to measure the capacity of a trench silo is to weigh the amount of ensilage in a cross section of the silo a foot thick. This times the length will give the volume in feet. Marks may be made on the wall to tell when you have a foot dug off. This method should be used this year in particular, because there is so much variety in the weight per volume of ensilage. During normal years a cubic foot of ensilage weighs 40 to 45 pounds per cubic foot. In above ground or pit silos much depends on what part of the silo you are in and also how high or deep the silo is and on how full it was. It is easy to see that there would be more ensilage </seg>

In closing, may I add that there are several circulars put out on measuring, both from this station and from the department in Wash - ington, and we are here to help you in any way we can in this and other problems. THE EFFECT OF GRINDING AND CHOPPING ON FEEDING VALUE C. W. McCAMPBELL This discussion will include roughages only. It will also be limited to three classes of livestock — horses, sheep, and beef cattle. Dairy cattle are not included because I have had no experience — experiment - ally or otherwise — in handling this class of livestock. Feeding value may be measured in several ways. One by nutrients available. Another by the cost of a unit of available nutrients. Still another by what might be termed the "over all" effect, which means the value after all factors have been considered. This latter value is usually designated by the terms profit or loss in the case of fattening livestock, and gains in weight in the case of stock horses, sheep, or cattle. If nutrients available was the only and whole measure of feeding values, the answer to the question of the effect of grinding and chop - ping could be given in one short sentence. It would be that grinding and chopping does not affect feeding value because no change takes place in the nutrients of the feed so refined, and the portions consumed are not more readily or completely digested. Certain advantages may and do, however, lie in reducing waste and increasing the convenience in handling. Whether it will pay to grind or cut roughage depends upon many factors including: 1. The price of feeds. 2. Nature of refinement. 3. Degree of refinement. 4. The cost of refining. 5. Kinds of roughages refined. 6. Quality of the feed to be refined. 7.

Definite information is available relative to the effect of many of these factors on the value of ground or cut roughages, but in the case of others little definite information is available. It seemed to me that about the most satisfactory way to discuss this question would be to present a brief resume' of the results of the more comprehensive experiments conducted to date, in which ground or cut roughages were compared with whole or ensiled roughages or both. Results secured at the University of Nebraska will not be in - cluded because they will be discussed in detail later on this program. Horses Comparatively little experimental data has been reported on the subject of grinding, or otherwise reducing, roughages for horses. Cornell bulletin 437 gives data covering a comparison of whole timothy hay and chopped timothy hay as roughages in horse rations. The results are summarized as follows: "Since both groups not only gained in weight but improved in condition also, the experiment would seem to indicate that the advantage of chopping or cutting was not sufficient to compensate for the labor of chopping the hay. Wisconsin Research bulletin 102 reports an experiment in which the value of chopping hay for horses was studied and states that, "Chopping hay for work horses did not save as much as 10 per cent of the grain in the ration. Considering the proportionately greater loss in live weight in the horses on the chopped hay ration, chopping showed little benefit; certainly not enough to make this method of preparation pay". This was the result, even though the concentrates were mixed with the chopped hay in order to secure any possible ad - vantage from compelling the horses to eat the grain more slowly and to chew it more thoroughly. These are the principal and most comprehensive tests yet conducted comparing chopped roughage with whole roughage for horses. Con - clusions in both instances indicate that it usually does not pay to chop hay for horses. Since experience has shown that horses will clean up without waste all the good hay needed for best results, it would seem that the conclusions drawn from these experiments may be accepted as final in so far as horses and chopped hay are concerned. Sheep Comparatively few experiments have also been conducted in - volving the use of sheep in comparing refined and unrefined roughages. </seg>
            <seg id="p592">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ; Idaho circular 19 reports two comparisons made in 1921 of whole alfalfa hay and cut alfalfa hay in lamb fattening rations. In each comparison the whole alfalfa hay proved to be decidedly more profit - able than cut alfalfa hay. Tests conducted the next year also showed a decided advantage in favor of whole alfalfa hay. Idaho bulletin 176 reports two tests made in 1928 and 1929 in which whole alfalfa hay was compared with cut alfalfa hay in lamb fattening rations. In one, whole alfalfa hay and in the other, cut alfalfa hay, proved to be more profitable. A few excerpts from the discussion of .these results read as follows: "(1) Chopping or grinding hay does not increase the amount of hay actually consumed by the lamb. (2) Average daily gains made by lambs are not increased by chopping or grinding. (3) The amount of hay required for 100 pounds gain is lowered but, due to the cost of chopping and grinding, the total cost of produicng 100 pounds gain is not materially affected, ex - cept in the case of high priced hay. Michigan mimeographed circular 49 reports a comparison of ground alfalfa hay with whole alfalfa hay, both hand fed and self fed. The gains were greater and cheaper in the lots receiving whole alfalfa hay. South Dakota bulletin 252 shows a comparison of a ration of whole barley and whole alfalfa hay with ground barley and ground alfalfa hay. More rapid and cheaper gains were secured from the lambs fed whole feeds. Colorado press bulletin 68 gives a comparison of cut corn fodder with corn silage. Gains and selling price per hundred were the same in each group but the cost of gains were somewhat cheaper when silage was fed. Texas reported a lamb feeding test completed in 1932 in which chopped sorgo hay fed with shelled corn and cottonseed cake proved to be slightly more economical than baled sorgo hay fed with the same concentrates. In all these experiments results were calculated on feed require - ments only. Acre returns were ignored. Even upon the basis of the reckoning used the average results of all these tests do not seem to justify cutting or grinding roughages of good quality as a general practice for lambs. Beef Cattle Oregon bulletin 193 reported a series of three comparisons of </seg>
            <seg id="p593">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION long alfalfa hay had chopped alfalfa hay fed (1) alone, (2) with a limited amount of grain and (3) with silage. The final conclusion de - rived from these comparisons was "it will be seen that it is only under rare conditions that chopping will pay its costs". Oregon bulletin 276 later reported a series of three comparisons of long alfalfa hay with chopped alfalfa hay in rations for fattening calves and yearlings. The average of these three tests showed an advantage of 28 per cent in favor of chopped hay when fed to calves and 42 per cent in favor of chopped hay when fed to yearlings. These percentage advantages were calculated on the basis of feed saved to produce 100 pounds of gain. Idaho circular 18 reported a test in which whole alfalfa hay alone was compared with cut alfalfa hay. The whole alfalfa hay proved to be decidedly more economical than cut alfalfa hay. Idaho circular 28 reported another test in which whole alfalfa hay fed. with a limited amount of barley was compared with cut alfalfa hay fed with a limited amount of barley. The cut alfalfa proved to be slightly more economical than the whole alfalfa hay. On the other hand, cut hay fed with silage proved to be somewhat less economical than whole hay. Texas Cattle Feeding Series No. 3 reports three comparisons of sorghum fodder chopped and unchopped — milo, kaflr, and feterita in cattle fattening rations. The chopped milo and chopped kafir were somewhat more satisfactory than the same feeds unchopped, but the chopped feterita was less valuable than unchopped feterita. South Dakota bulletin 252 reports a comparison of ground barley and ground alfalfa with whole barley and whole alfalfa for both two year old steers and calves. The 2 year olds made more rapid and cheaper gains on the whole feeds. The calves made more rapid, but more expensive, gains on the ground feeds. This test is not altogether satisfactory because of the double variable involved. Minnesota bulletin 274 reports a comparison of rations consisting of ground shelled corn and whole alfalfa hay with ground shelled corn and ground alfalfa hay fed to yearling steers. The final conclusion deducted from this test reads: "The results show that it is not profit - able to grind alfalfa hay and mix it with corn". It also reports a com - parison in which one lot of cattle was fed whole shelled corn plus whole fodder the first 56 days and whole alfalfa the next 119 days; and a second lot, ground shelled corn plus ground fodder the first 56 days and ground alfalfa the next 119 days. The whole feed combin - ation proved to be more profitable than the ground combination. Wisconsin Research bulletin 102 reported an average of 3 tests in </seg>
            <seg id="p594">KEPOKT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. which chopped alfalfa was compared with whole alfalfa for stock cows suckling calves. The ration fed consisted of alfalfa, silage, and a limited amount of grain. In this particular series, a saving of $1.83 ■m all feed had to pay for chopping one ton of alfalfa. Hay was run through a roughage mill equipped with recutting screen 9/16 inch perforations. Missouri has reported recent tests in which refined stover was compared with whole stover in rations used in wintering stock calves. In two out of three of these tests, ground stover produced slightly more gain per acre than whole stover. Cut stover produced less gain per acre than either ground or whole stover in two out of three tests. Michigan reports two successive tests recently completed, in which both ground shock corn and corn silage were compared with shock corn, in fattening yearling steers for market. These tests are parti - cularly valuable because they calculate returns upon an acre basis, which is the only really practical basis for computing returns on all livestock production operations when the producer uses the feeds he grows. In each of these tests the gains, selling price, and net returns were least in the ground shock fodder groups, greatest in the silage groups, and between these two extremes for the whole fodder groups. Average returns for the two tests after deducting all labor and machinery costs for harvesting and processing were: Ground shock corn, $8.30 per acre; Shock corn, $14.73 per acre; Silage, $24.51 per acre. The labor and machinery costs for these two years averaged $13.82 per acre for ground shocked fodder, $4.22 for shock corn, and $7.41 per acre for corn silage. The Kansas Station conducted a series of tests over a period of three years — 1928 to 1931 — in which roughage in the form of whole, cut, ground, or silage kafir plus one pound of cottonseed cake per head daily was fed to stock yearlings. The results based upon an average of the three tests may be sum - marized as follows: (1) Grinding increased gains per head 15 per cent; chopping de - creased gains 10 per cent; ensiling increased gains 26 per cent. (2) Grinding increased gains per acre 28 per cent; chopping, 1 per cent; and ensiling, 120 per cent. In view of the fact that manufacturers claimed improvements had </seg>
            <seg id="p595">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION been made that would insure the grinding of a larger percentage of grain without increasing the percentage of extremely fine particles of roughage, the Kansas Station ran another test during the winter of 1933-34 in which whole kafir, ground kafir and kafir silage were com - pared as the basal ration for wintering yearlings. The more important results secured may be summarized as follows: (1) Grinding and ensiling increased gains per head almost identically the same — 35 per cent. (2) Grinding increased gains per acre, 46 per cent; ensiling, 87 per cent. The roughages used in all the experiments discussed varied from fair to good in quality. In most instances whole roughages proved to be more profitable than either ground or cut roughages and in all in - stances silage proved to be more profitable than either whole, ground, or cut roughages. While the results of the experiments reported would seem to in - dicate that under ordinary circumstances refining roughages of good quality might not be profitable, except in the case of silage, conditions might arise under which it may be advisable to grind roughages. For instance, in times of scarcity and high prices of roughage, when it is desirable to get livestock to eat roughages with the least possible waste. In such circumstances it might pay to grind. Another instance when grinding might be advisable would be in case concentrates were scarce and high in price and it was desirable to get livestock to eat the maximum amount of roughage. This could be accomplished by mix - ing the ground roughage with a limited amount of some palatable con - centrate such as molasses, grain or protein supplement. In conclusion let me say that the whole question of the advis - ability of grinding is not yet settled. There is great need for more experimental work in this field, comprehensive enough in scope to in - clude all the many factors that determine in the end the value of re - fining roughages under any and all conditions. OUR FEEDING EXPERIENCE WITH ROUGHAGE R. R. THALMAN I have talked grinding and chopping so many times the last few years at Feeders Day and other times that I should think you would be tired of It. I was glad to hear Dr. McCampbell because he justified some of the recommendations that I have been making this fall. For example, I have been contending that 18 or 20 pounds of cut corn fodder </seg>
            <seg id="p596">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE is worth as much as 25 pounds of corn fodder. This cutting seems to be a physical proposition; it increases the utilization of the fodder. The old cows just can't eat these big stalks when they are not cut. I have watched the old drouth cows over at the barn take a big stalk, chew on it a while, and then up it comes. They are just too tough to be chewed whole, but when they are cut up, most of it can be utilized. Of course, it is better to cut the fodder green or add water if dry and put into a silo. Using good corn silage as 100 per cent, corn fodder is worth about 85 per cent, or in other words, 85 pounds of ensilage is worth as much as 100 pounds of corn fodder. The same thing is true of the other crops from which ensilage is made. If good Atlas sorgo silage is given the value of 100, then Atlas sorgo fodder is worth about 40; or 60 per cent is added to Atlas fodder when it is cut and put into the silo. I have heard some men contend that the grain on Atlas wasn't doing any good when fed in the fodder stage. The other day I visited a large feed yard near Gretna, operated by George Cockerill. He makes it a practice to grind all his alfalfa hay that he feeds to his steers. Mr. Cockerill says that it takes less equip - ment. It does away with the hay racks and only the bunks are used. He has a large grinder through which one man can put a large load in about fifteen minutes. They were grinding while I was there and it does a good job quickly and only one man was operating it, so it takes less help when feed is handled this way. Mr. Cockerill also states that he can control the consumption of every steer when he grinds the roughage. He starts the steers on about 10 to 15 per cent grain, which is mixed with the ground alfalfa. As the feeding period progresses, he gradually increases the per cent of grain until they are on full feed. There is less waste from tramping in the mud and weather when the hay is ground. A great many feeders grind their roughage, of which Mr. Cockerill is a good example. I think that it would pay to look into this in case you are feeding or contemplating feeding cattle. Last Bummer we ran a little experiment in which we compared ground alfalfa hay with long alfalfa hay. We found that just as good a gain was made when two pounds of alfalfa hay were fed as when four pounds of long hay were fed. Whether one should grind or not depends a lot on the cost of grind - ing. Conditions change and for that reason we do not make a financial statement. A statement made today might be way out of line in a few weeks. We believe if we give you daily consumption and the daily grain or the feed requirements per hundred pounds of gain, that you should make your own financial statement. Our labor may be higher </seg>
            <seg id="p597">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION' than you are required to pay, or some other cost may not be in line with your general practice. We believe that whether to grind or not to grind should be your own decision, but, of course, we are always willing to make recommendations. OUR FEEDING EXPERIENCE WITH GROUND GRAINS WM. J. LOEFFEL Whether we should grind our grain or not depends on many things. It depends on the gains made, on the system of management, and many other things. One thing that should always be taken into consideration is the cost. Can we afford to grind? This depends on the cost of the feed, of course, the costlier the feed, the more saving we want to be with it, and for that reason the grinding cost should be figured in per cent of the price of the feed. Perhaps it would not pay to grind a feed today and the reverse be true a year from today. If it adds 10 per cent to the value of corn and we can grind for five cents per bushel and corn is a dollar per bushel, then, of course, we should grind. But if corn were 20 cents per bushel and grinding still costs five cents, it would not pay to grind the corn. The fact that the price of grain fluctuates more than the price of grinding is another reason why the cost of grinding should be figured as a per cent of the cost of the feed and not a flat rate per bushel or per unit. The feasibility of grinding also depends on how the feed is to be fed. Did you ever notice how pigs eat? When they are hand-fed, the idea seems to be to get all you can^the competitive spirit that they show is keen. Whereas when hogs are self-fed, they eat more leisurely, masticating the grain more thoroughly, and thereby getting more nutrients from it than the hand-fed pig who just gobbles his food. The size of the pigs also is something to take into consideration in determining whether one should grind his grain or feed it to them whole without grinding. When pigs are small there is little advantage in grinding grain for them. I should not say small either, because figures show that it is not a paying proposition to grind feed for hogs that weigh less than 225 pounds. This is not a hard and fast rule, but can be generally accepted. The fineness to which the feed is to be ground is an important factor. We ran an experiment here at the station in which we had three lots. 'To one we fed whole wheat, to another coarsely ground wheat, and to .the third, finely ground wheat. The amount of the grain taken by the </seg>
            <seg id="p598">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE pigs varied considerably. The pigs fed whole wheat took 7.92 pounds, those getting coarsely ground took 7.08, and the pigs getting finely ground took 6.83 pounds. The pigs in the third lot took a little over a pound less grain than those fed on whole wheat. This leads us to be - lieve that the finely ground wheat is less palatable than the whole grain. You have noticed the same thing if you have ever tried to eat flour or sugar. The wheat is more bulky when ground. If you take a pail of grain and run it through a grinder, you know that you can - not get it into the pail again. It is more bulky, takes up more space and hogs evidently do not relish it as well as they do the whole grain. "We did, however, get more gain in the lot fed finely ground wheat. The average daily gain in the three lots was 1.73, 1.79, and 1.81 pounds respectively. Lot 3 gained a little more, even though they consumed less grain than the other two lots. The cost of this grinding in the case of coarsely grinding was 3.5 cents per bushel and in the case of finely grinding was 5.9 cents per bushel. This is figuring gasoline at 20 cents per gallon, or electricity at 5 cents per kilowatt hour. In grinding costs, labor is the largest single item of any of the costs. Next to labor, power is the largest item and, of course, the cost goes hand in hand with the fineness of grinding. The finer the grain is ground, the more it costs to do the job. ■ Grinding increases the value of the grains from 4 to 18 per cent with 10 per cent being the average. Barley, for example, increases 7.5 per cent in value with grinding. Therefore, if it costs more than 7.5 per cent of the price of barley to grind the grain, it should not be ground. Ten per cent is about the average increase we get in the value of grain with grinding. The proposition of grinding is essentially a problem of costs. We have tried and intend continuing trying to give you the facts and let you draw your own conclusions. FEED PROCESSING METHODS AND RESULTS F. C. FENTON Kansas State College In discussing this topic, let me say on the outset that there are many kinds and sizes of grinders. Most all grinders may be placed in one of four types. The types are the knife cutter, the roller mill, the burr mill, and the hammer mill. There may be others, but the most of them can be placed in one of these four types. There are grinders that have a combination of the essential features of two of these types of grinders. Several machine companies are putting out a mill that combines the knife and the burr features into one mill. </seg>
            <seg id="p599">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION The newest of these types of mills is the hammer mill. I'm sure all of you have seen them work and require no explanation of how they work. The hammer mills are sturdy and are less likely to damage if something goes through them that shouldn't. I have seen things go through them without damaging the mill that would undoubtedly cause some breakage had it gone through any other type of mill. The hammer mill may be obtained in a large number of sizes, from very small to very large mills. The efficiency of these mills is not affected by the size — all sizes having practically the same efficiency. One thing about a hammer mill — it is not practical for reducing roughage. Some of the old models especially were no good for roughage. In the first place, they do not take roughage very well. You would hold a bundle up and try to shove it in. It wouldn't go until all of a sudden the whole thing would go in and the mill would clog, throw the belt, or something. This is especially true if the roughage happens to be a little damp. The burr mill is usually a simpler and cheaper machine. However, they are more susceptible to damage and the burrs — the grinding part — wear out more rapidly than corresponding parts on other mills. You all are familiar with this type of mill and we need not go into details on it. The knife cutter mill is one that embodies a stationary bar and a knife that comes down next to the bar and literally cuts the feed. The silage cutters embody this feature. Many combination mills combine this mill with the burr feature, which works very satisfactorily. The burr reduces the grain and the knife, the roughage, then they are mixed together again. The roller mill does not find its way into feed grinders to any degree. All of the flour mills use this type of grinder. One thing about this type of mill, it breaks rather easily if any foreign material goes into it. However, I think it has possibilities for use in a farm mill and that it should be used more. The problem of a choice of a mill is a difficult question to discuss because of the multitude of factors to take into consideration. I will, however, discuss some of the paramount issues in choosing a mill. The feed to be reduced is the first thing to consider. If you intend reducing only roughage, of course, you would not want a burr mill. The power available should be considered in choosing the grinder, especially the size. Another factor in obtaining the right size is the number and kind of live stock on the farm. There are two kinds of costs in a mill; the fixed and the operating costs. The smaller the mill, the lower the fixed costs, but the higher the operating costs per unit of feed reduced. Labor is a big factor in the </seg>
            <seg id="p600">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE increased operating cost of a small mill. Electricity is used more advantageously with small mills in rural districts. The transformer that would need to go with a large motor would run the cost into money. So if you are on a high tension power line, it would probably be cheaper to have a small grinder rather than a large one. More people have a grinder that is too large for their needs than there are that have a grinder that is too small for their use. Roughage cannot, be successfully ground with a small grinder. It is important to have a dependable source of power for grinding feed. The electric motor, if it is available at the right price, is the most dependable source of power that we have. It is very steady and has a great over-load capacity. A twenty-five horse power motor is able to carry peak loads up to forty - five horse power. By peak loads I mean loads for a short length of time. Used automobile and combine motors also serve as a good source of power for grinding. The supply of these old motors is un - limited. In Kansas there are several combine motors that may be had for a small sum. The cooling capacity for these must be increased because they are built to travel out in the open and they will heat very badly if they are used as a stationary engine and the cooling system is not increased in some way. Many have used a cream can or a barrel in increasing the cooling system. Most automobile engines will produce about 20 horse power. Of course, they are rated by the manufacturer much higher than that, but about twenty is all they will actually produce. A governor can also be added to one of these engines to a good advantage. Otherwise, they will run too fast. Most hammer mills, especially the older models, required a high r. p. m. and speed was quite a problem. Some employed the counter shaft with good results. The counter shaft has worked especially well since the V belt came into use and has been used on them. This belt works very nicely on the counter shaft. The kind of power or the amount of power is also affected by the fineness of grinding. Some grains crack very easily but grind hard. The grain sorghums are very hard to grind, even though the kernel cracks very easily. Oats also takes three times the power to grind it as it does to just crack it. The amount of moisture in the grain has a marked effect on the required power. As a rule, the greater the moisture content, the greater will be the power required to grind it. Moisture content, however, has no effect on the power requirements for chopping. For those mills, however, that embody the use of the fan, and most roughage mills do use the fan principle, more power is required to pull the fan when the feed has a large amount of moisture in it. Summarizing, roughage should generally be chopped. One should </seg>
            <seg id="p601">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION not attempt to grind roughage to a finely divided state, it will not pay. The burr mill is probably the best for coarse grinding. The hammer mill is being successfully used more and more each year. The roller mill should find more use on the farm. •TILL. GRASS R. R. THALMAN I think that I have talked drouth rations this fall and winter more than I ever have anything else. I have numerous telephone calls from men who have money and want to get feed. It isn't so easy to get feed even if you have the money. It is fortunate that the Drouth Relief Service was able to obtain this soybean-molasses mixture which Mr. Derrick told you about. It is wonderful to have something to take the place of the corn which we do not have this year. It furnishes a rather concentrated mixture. It analyzes better than alfalfa-molasses meal. This molasses is black - strap and is made from the sugar cane. In small amounts it is about equal, pound for pound, to corn. When fed in quantities exceeding two pounds, corn is better because the molasses is not as efficient as corn in amounts over two pounds. Eighteen pounds of this mixture will maintain a cow giving ten pounds of three and five-tenths per cent milk. Straw and cottonseed may be added to this ration with cheapen - ing and beneficial results. i. You have heard about our experimental drouth cows. They were killed day before yesterday and I have seen worse beef in the cooler. They have been fed all sorts of things but they didn't look so bad in the cooler. If you are feeding some of this soybean-molasses mixture to stock cattle, straw might be added to cheapen the ration. Seven or eight pounds of it might be fed and the rest made up with wheat straw. Early in the fall a man wrote in and asked whether he should buy — silage at $7.50 or alfalfa hay at $20. It takes from thirty-five to forty pounds of silage to take the place of eighteen or twenty pounds of alfalfa. The exact amount depends on the quality of each feed. We have received so many calls this fall and winter relative to drouth rations that we decided to get out a circular on drouth rations. The feeds are clasified in this circular according to the constituents in the feed. I realize that the rations in this circular are not perfect. We have tried to keep within the practical limits as well as the the- </seg>
            <seg id="p602">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE oretical and scientific limits. It may be of some aid in selecting rations in this trying time. The roughages are divided into two classes, low-protein and high - protein. Such feeds as corn fodder, prairie hay, and Russian thistle hay are grouped with the low-protein roughages. There may be a few other feeds, such as rye straw and cottonseed hulls, which we didn't include in the circular. If they were included, they would be classed as a low-protein roughage. These feeds must be supplemented with either a roughage or a concentrate high in protein, because they are sadly deficient in this necessary nutrient. Such feeds as alfalfa hay or meal and soybean hay are classed as high protein roughages. These feeds, of course, can be fed alone, but when they are fed in conjunction with a cheaper, low-protein rough - age, they will be more efficient. The protein that they contain will be more fully utilized. Usually three or four pounds of this high protein hay is equal to one pound of protein concentrate, and the price becomes the deciding factor. When you can buy one pound of protein concen - trate cheaper than you can buy three pounds of hay, it usually is more economical to buy the concentrate and the same principal works the other way around. The fact to remember about the low-protein concentrates is that they must be supplemented with a high-protein roughage or concen - trate. The idea is prevalent that a ration can be balanced with molasses, but this is not the case, as molasses is low in protein. Some feed higher in protein must be used. The medium-protein feeds include wheat shorts, bran, middlings, and such feeds. They are about double in protein over the low-protein concentrates. Cottonseed meal and cake, linseed oil meal, tankage, and soybean meal, and such feeds are classed as high-protein feeds. These feeds, of course, can be used in balancing rations. The price, again, is the determining factor in purchasing and feeding these feeds. The guaranteed composition of these feeds should be taken into consideration. You can't balance a ration with an eleven per cent protein feed. On the back of this circular is a list of feeds, together with their approximate weights in several commonly used feed measures. To be exact, the measures are the bushel basket, the No. 10 can, so-called "gallon" fruit can, and the quart. This might be used where the feed cannot be weighed. . Several feed companies have been putting out feed in cubes this winter. The nice thing about them is that there is no waste. Before buying, the composition should be looked into because there is a chance of filler being used. The cottonseed cake this fall is rather hard. Grinding, of course, is the answer to hard cake. I was talking to a </seg>
            <seg id="p603">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION representative of a feed company the other day and I asked him what made cake hard. He told me that it was a technical error in the heating of the seeds during the extracting process. Tankage is not commonly thought of as a cattle feed, but it has been demonstrated that it makes a successful protein supplement for cattle. A pound of tankage contains approximately as much protein as a pound and a half of cottonseed meal or cake. Cattle do not like tankage at first but it doesn't take them long to get accustomed to it. There is now available a circular on "Tankage as a Cattle Feed" that can be had for the asking. We have also got out this winter a list of all the publications of the Animal Husbandry Department. This may be of some value to some of you and is available free of cost. CATTLE BUYING EXPERIENCES W. W. DERRICK I can't add much to the information as to how the program worked. You know from the daily press, the weekly magazines, and from other sources how it worked. I might be able, however, to give you some general facts and figures. Mr. Loeffel, who heads up the F. S. R. C. in this state, has about ten million cans of beef, and it's good meat, too. This is and will be distributed to the people who need it this winter. At the end of December, we had purchased 476,568 head of cattle in the state. A total of $6,000,000 was paid for these animals. This sounds like a big figure — a mass of money that was spent. But take it in the terms of the cattle population of Nebraska and it isn't so big. Taking the enormous cattle population into account, it represents a cost of $13.84 per head. The last time I figured it up, 53 per cent of the cattle purchased were two years old or over, 17 per cent were yearlings, and 30 per cent calves. If you could have seen some of the scrubs, some of the junk that came in to be sold, you could see one of the main benefits of the pro - gram, that of ridding the country of some of the inferior stock that came in. Most of those that came in were not the profitable sort animals that would not sell at top prices. Several years ago we put on a purebred bull campaign and we thought at the time that we were getting somewhere. From the looks of the cattle that came in, we stopped far short of our goal. Just every kind imaginable was bought by the government this summer and fall </seg>
            <seg id="p604">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE right in those same places where we did a lot of work to get purebred bulls established. As a rule, the bulls that came in were of a pretty good sort, but I remember one morning out in the yards a man brought in a bull. He had a white face, had horns, and was a sort of a black brindle. Now if you can tell what breed he was you are better than I am, and the man had been using him as a herd bull, too. When he got rid of that bull it surely was good riddance of bad rubbish. Just imagine, if you can, using a bull of that description to head your herd. Brindles were common. I didn't know there were so many brindles in the state. On another occasion I remember a calf that was brought in. He was a sickly looking thing. He was spotted just like a bobcat and re - sembled a bobcat more than anything else I can think of. It all goes to show the effect of the program. It was a good thing to get rid of all that inferior stock — the kind that a man could not possibly raise for a profit. Along in the summer when we started buying cattle everything was drying up. The cattle market was low and it looked bad. It not only looked bad but it was bad. They didn't know what they were going to feed their stock this winter and they didn't want to sell them at the low price they would have received on the market. When the government started buying at a price in advance of the market, they were ready to sell. Now the situation has changed, cattle prices have gone up and a man can net more by selling on the market. The feed situation hasn't changed any — hasn't shown any improve - ment. The cattle over the state look good though under the circum - stances. So far we have had a good winter for carrying cattle through. We haven't had much snow and the weather has been open. Some of the farmers only had about three-quarters of a ton of hay per animal to carry them through and they have been doing quite well, and now they are figuring on keeping them, if possible. I want every man to keep his animals if he possibly can. Some feed has been imported. The drouth relief service is importing quite a bit of feed. They have several tons of a mixture of soybean hay and molasses. It is about 3 0 per cent molasses and the rest soybean hay. Contrary to the public belief, it is open for public purposes. I say that because some had the idea that it was for relief purposes only. The relief service also has some corn fodder and some corn feed mixture. They arn't the best feeds in the world but they are good for roughing animals through. This soybean-molasses mixture is a relatively good feed. Soybeans are a legume and contain more protein than alfalfa and can be used as a good substitute for alfalfa. The molasses that is in the feed is a good substitute for corn, which by the way isn't plentiful. The price of this mixture may seem high, but when you figure how far it has been trans- </seg>
            <seg id="p605">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AXD FEEDERS ASSOCIATION ported, it isn't out of line. The price ranges from $23 to $28 per ton. depending upon what part of the state you are located in. We are using a mixture of this soybean mixture and wheat straw down at the barn and our herd of horses looks fairly well. The horses like this soybean hay and they do good on it. On the whole, I think the outlook is favorable. We got rid of a lot of undesirable cattle through the cattle buying program and it looks as though we are going to pull through the winter in good shape. If we have an early spring and the weather stays mild, the cattle should come through looking good for the amount of feed that they have had and under the circumstances. FEEDING PUREBREDS MILES CADWALLADER Generally speaking, the purebred breeders have been very hard hit. First by the depression, second because their market has dwindled to a low level, and third the drouth came along and almost finished the job that the depression and the low market outlet had started. This chart that I have here shows the price received by purebred Hereford breeders for their animals over a number of years, starting with 1892. While this chart shows only the Hereford breeders, it reflects the price received by purebred breeders generally. In 1892, the average purebred Hereford sold for $71; in 1894 it was $73; but this hopped to $300 in 1898; in 1904 it was $117; in 1918 it was $493; in 1924, $135; 1929, $222; 1933, $94; and in 1934, $114. This green line is the median line $200.47. So you see we today are considerably below the median price. The average price for the last 13 years is $163 and for the last four $116, which again shows the position that we are in today. When the price was around $200, we were feeling good, but when it dropped, we did not feel so good and now we are no better. Many of the purebred breeders, especially those who are main - taining show herds, are sticking to their old rations even though it is costing them an increased sum of money. In answer to a questionnaire issued recently to purebred breeders, 90 per cent of them indicated that they were using drouth rations. Forty per cent said that they were using silage to feed their purebred herds. Minerals are also finding a place in the rations. Eighty per cent are feeding bone meal, and the rest indicated that they were feeding limestone. Protein sup - plements are being fed by about 50 per cent of those breeders answer - ing the questionnaire. Many stated that they were feeding all the </seg>
            <seg id="p606">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE wheat straw that the animals would eat, supplementing this with 2 pounds of cottonseed cake. This is a cheap ration, costing only ten cents per day, but it lacks the necessary vitamin A. A drouth ration that is widely used consists of 25 pounds of immature thistle hay, 10 pounds of prairie hay, 1 Vi pounds of linseed cake, and 2 pounds of beet pulp. . Our own ration consists of 40 pounds of corn silage, 2 ounces of limestone, and 1 pound of cottonseed cake., and our bulls in addition are getting some ground ear corn. Many purebreds were s"hipped out this summer and fall for feed - ing. It being too dry for sufficient winter wheat to grow has stim - ulated this movement of cattle to the more favored areas. Many were sent out for feeding for a share of the calves or a share of the herd. This practice was not satisfactory. The best way to do was to buy the feed and ship the cattle to the feed, making arrangements with the seller of the feed or someone to feed the cattle. I wonder if you realize that there are more purebreds per section in Nebraska than there are in any other state? This has had a material effect on the loss of market that I was speaking of. Nebraska is nearer the point of saturation of purebreds than any other state, but we are looking for the market to come back. The cattle buying program has weeded out a lot of the inferior cattle and we hope that the stockman will go on and improve his herd. There is nothing wrong with this country. The money question is back of it all and that would soon be ironed out with a restoration of confidence. Confidence is lacking and only the return of confidence can bring about a cure. HOW CAN WE COME BACK? PAUL TAGGART ■ Let us analyze first where we have been. We judge things by our experience with them and hence I am more able to give you the situa - tion in Webster ccunty and let you make application to your territory by inference. We have experienced nationally one of the worst droughts in the history of the country and Webster county was one of the worst hit, and, in fact, was right in the middle of one of the worst areas. When you realize that only slightly over twelve inches of rainfall was received during 1934 it is easy to see why nothing was raised. Spring grains and forage crops, as well as winter wheat, were dry, and even though they sprouted and came up, only got from six to ten inches high. Corn was planted pretty much in dry dirt and after getting a poor stand, only attained a height from a few inches to a knee </seg>
            <seg id="p607">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION high except in a few favored places where it may. have attained the height of two or three feet. By the first to the middle of July the permanent pastures already badly stunted by the extremely dry weather were picked bare by the stock. In order to help the pastures out and conserve as much feed as possible, the oats, barley, wheat, and forage crops that already had not been pastured were turned in on and they were soon gone. This meant that there was practically no feed avail - able Roadsides and hay lands were utilized to keep the stock going Cornfields were commencing to burn so the stock was turned into the cornfields, but they were soon gone. On July 9 we held our first sale of government cattle. With a quota of 150 head we had something like 67 head. People wanted to see how this plan worked. The next day we had 161 head with a quota of 150 head, and people commenced to list their cattle. April 1st Webster county had a cattle population of 24,000 head. By August 1st we had bought 2000 to 2500 head and had approximately 6000 head listed ahead for sale. In so far as possible, distressed cattle were bought but they were all distressed. Approximately 10,000 cattle were bought by the government. I estimate that three or four thousand were sold privately. With the calf crop that was raised, we still have 15 to 16 thousand cattle, 7500 horses, besides a few hogs and chickens. These latter figures were obtained from the feed survey conducted a month or two ago. With these facts in mind, it is my opinion that more cattle should have been sold to the government. Spring pig farrowings were naturally short on account of the AAA program and it is a good thing they were for it was impossible to feed what they had and pigs sold for five, ten and fifteen cents a head in the community sale rings. In fact many pigs were dumped out along the road just like cats are thrown out. In addition practically no fall pigs were farrowed after our corn fields were pastured off I could not see how we were going to get along. But by continued use of every available bit of feed in the fields, roadsides, right of way and hay lands everyone seemed able to carry on. Then lo and behold the much despised Russian thistle, that so called weed which we have been en - deavoring to destroy these many years came to our rescue and was the Moses that led us out of the wilderness. The type of weather we had seemed to enable this pest to flourish and it furnished pasture some men put it in silos and a great deal of it was stacked for hay Of course it was necessary to ship in a lot of roughage and that was a job because of the distance to feed and transportation adding materially to the cost of feed. During 1926 we experienced a drought year very similar to this year but we did have more pasture, harvested a little straw and fodder. Our cattle population dropped some of course and our hogs a lot but not in comparison to this year for the drought area was very small, only a few counties and it was possible to ship in feed </seg>
            <seg id="p608">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE at a reasonable price. Foundation stock was preserved just as it has been this year and we can eventually bring our cattle population to the point where we are able to take care of it and still find a ready market for it. We have fed all kinds of feed, that ordinarily no one would think of using. Such as Russian thistle hay and silage, sunflower silage and even mature thistles ground up. These for the most part have been supplemented with straw, hay, cornfodder and some concentrate. By mixing these feeds, milk production has kept up fairly well and stock cattle have kept in fair condition. In fact I know of one herd of breeding cows that have had nothing but thistles and cottonseed since August 1 and they have kept up in good shape. The drought may have been hard on us but it helped us in a lot of •ways. I shall attempt to list a few that come to my mind: 1. Taught conservation a. Those feeds we do have available b. Utilization of feed we did not know we had c. Storage of surplus 2. Use of silos o. Culls have been sold hence better grade of cattle to start with in spring 4. Taught value of concentrates 5. Made people ration minded 6. Taught better feeding practices 7. Introduced soybean hay, rich straw and many other feeds most of us knew nothing about 8. Aided the cooperative movement ■'.■"• 9. Use of drought resistant feeds 10. Allowed us to cull our stock. Two other factors contributed to the severity of the situation in conjunction with the drought. First the depression which has made it necessary to sell everything possible to make living expenses. And second, short crops for three or four years leaving no surplus in the hands of the farmer. Webster county has heard of the predicament of the North East Nebraska farmers but we face that situation all of the time, at least about three out of five years and we meet it. We know that we have had too much stock the past few years and statistics show that we had 25% more cattle on farms January 1, 1934 than we had January 1, 1928, and that 25% was just about taken out of the picture by the government buying so I wonder just how far we want to come back. For a number of years our pastures have been picked too bare and not enough temporary pasture has been used but </seg>
            <seg id="p609">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION even with the use of temporary pasture, I doubt that we want to bring our cattle back too far. Of course a normal grain crop will make it possible to handle more hogs that we now have. ATLAS PROVES ITSELF GUY SCUDDER J I come from the northern part of Dawson county and I have been using Atlas sorgo for a number of years. As you know Atlas sorgo Is a cross between sourless cane and blackhull kafir. This variety was developed by I. N. Farr of Stockton, Kansas. It was recognized by the Kansas State Agricultural College in 19 28. In the fall of 1927 I got my first bushel of Atlas sorgo seed. I didn't know how to plant it and I got it too thick and it only got three or four feet tall. This was my first experience with the stuff and I was disappointed in it. Then in the fall of ]!I29 I was driving up through Kansas and in the vicinity of Manhattan I noticed several fields of something that was considerable taller than anything else and was greener and more leafy. Upon inquiry I was informed that it was Atlas sorgo. The next spring I got a bushei of seed from Dan Casement. He told me to plant about eighteen nountM per acre. I planted it as he told me and I have used it every year since. I always plant it with a furrow opener and cultivate it the same as I do corn. It grows very fast and you must be careful or it will get too big to cultivate. It inay l&gt;e planted anytime after the 25th of May. But if you want the seed to mature it must be planted earlier, in our vicinity anyway. It takes a relatively long growing season and it must be planted earlier than the 25th if you want to get seed. In 1932 I put in 80 acres of Atlas and got a yield of 16 tons per acre. That same year corn yielded less than 1/3 of that amount or about five tons. The next year I put in 100 acr*M and received 18 tons per acre while corn was very little better than it was the year before. This year I had out 100 acres of Atlas and it got about 2% feet tall and produced about two tons per acre, while the corn wasn't worth mowing. This was all grown under dry land conditions. But Atlas sorgo is also adapted to irrigation. I have seen Atlns and corn grown side by side on irrigated land and the Atlas got between 6 and 7 feet tall while the corn got only about 3 feet tall. Tho atlas yielded 16 tons and the corn 4 tons per acre. I use Atlas both for silage and as a dry roughage. I find that it is </seg>
            <seg id="p610">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE an outstanding roughage. The stock like it and clean it up well. I have cut up a lot of it and put it in the silo. I think it is better than corn silage. They rate it about 90% of corn here at the Station, but for my own I would rather have it ton for ton than corn silage. Atlas has proven itself to be a great crop to grow. It yields well and is a feed that can compare with any in its class. I think that more and more of it will be grown every year. And if you put in some of it, I'm sure that it will justify all that I have claimed for it. MEETING EMERGENCIES W. J. LOEFFEL One of the best ways to show the value of the grains as hog feeds is to compare them with the standard hog feed, that is corn. Every time I go through the North Platte valley I get rather envious of them on the way they handle their grains. There they always buy and sell feed grains on the basis of a hundred pounds instead of a bushel. The price is always so much per hundred pounds and it makes it easier to compare the prices and also the value of the grains on that basis. We have heard a lot about wheat feeding especially when the price of wheat is low as compared to corn. When wheat is cracked it is just as good as corn for a hog feed. It must be cracked, however to get the full feeding value from it, otherwise it will pass through the animal undigested. Barley is 85 per cent of corn when it is coarsely ground. Rye, too must be coarsely ground and then it is 90 per cent the value of rye. Oats while we do not think of them as a hog feed are worth from two-thirds to three-fourths the value of corn. They mus,t be rolled in order to get full feed value from them. Proso or hog millet which is grown to quite a large extent in Colo - rado and South Dakota is worth from 90 to 100 per cent as much as corn. That grown in Colorado is of a higher value as a feed than that grown in South Dakota. P.lackstrap molasses which is the inferior molasses produced in the manufacture of cane sugar is worth from 75 to 80 per cent as much as corn. Shorts or wheat middlings has a feed - ing value of 85 per cent of that of corn. It used to be worth just as much as corn but the millers have taken out more of the flour with their improved methods. Hominy chop is worth from 90 to 100 per cent as much as corn depending on the grade you purchase. The protein concentrates are lower in comparison to the grains than they have been for a long time. Tankage, the standard protein supplement for hogs, is worth about $50.00 per ton or two and one-half </seg>
            <seg id="p611">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION" cents per pound and corn is about two cents per pound and with those prices it is good economy to feed some tankage. One pound of tank - age will replace from four to six pounds of corn under ordinary con - ditions. This is of course when it is fed as a supplement to corn. One time I was giving a talk on the replacement value of tankage and one man asked me if he could feed all tankage and no corn. No, it does not work that way. All the corn in the ration cannot be replaced by tank - age but it will replace only part of the corn. The amount of corn that tankage will replace sometimes depends on the amount of tankage fed. Usually the less fed the more corn it will replace, relatively speaking A small amount goes farther than a large amount. It is like a man on a low salary. If he is getting only a little, a dollar will go farther than it will if he is getting a high salary. There are cases where tankage will replace as much as 14 pounds of corn and other cases where it will replace only one pound of corn. Skim milk and butter milk are both a good protein supplement for hogs. The two are about equal and a hundred pounds are worth about one-half bushel of corn. Whey, a by-product of the cheese fac - tory is worth about one-half as much as skim or butter milk. Powdered milk is worth about one-half as much as tankage. Cottonseed meal, linseed oil meal and peanut meal are out of the picture as protein supplements for hogs. Alfalfa meal, when made of good, leafy, third or fourth cutting is an excellent maintenance feed for hogs. Brood sows especially do well when alfalfa meal constitutes a part of their ration. When buying feed think in the terms of other feed and ascertain which is the more economical to feed. Protein supplements this year are comparatively low and can well be fed to hogs. THE FEED AND SKED SITUATION IX THIS AREA E. O. POLLOCK The shortage of feed and seed that resulted from the severe drought of 1934 is of vital importance to Nebraska farmers as well as to farmers in other states. In some areas of the country the drought of 193 4 marked the third or fourth consecutive year of complete or nearly complete crop failure, with the results that both feed and seed supplies are extremely short. The Feed Situation You will recall that the condition of pasturage during the summer months was one of the worst on record. This resulted in the feeding </seg>
            <seg id="p612">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE on considerable hay during the summer months that otherwise would have gone into storage for winter feeding. Buyers of hay from relief agencies were very active during the late spring and summer months. Summer movement of hay from such states as Oklahoma, Kansas and Nebraska was unusually heavy. This was reflected in the receipts of hay, which at Kansas City during the months of June, July and August were probably the greatest on record for any similar period. Even in the Platte River Valley of Nebraska, where practically all of the hay is stacked and baled during the winter months, much of the first cutting of alfalfa was baled from the windrow and shipped to the drought areas. As a result of the heavy movement of hay during the past summer, hay barns and warehouses are relatively empty. The 193 4 hay crop for the country as a whole was 32 per cent below the five-year average for the period of 1927-1931. The tame hay crop in Nebraska was 1,421,000 tons, as compared with 2,858,000 tons in 1933 and 2,960,000 tons in 1932. The 1934 wild hay crop in Ne - braska was 790,000 tons, as compared with 1,760,000 tons in 1933 and 2,291,000 tons in 1932. According to the records of the Federal Livestock Feed Agency, 46 per cent of the hay and other forage supplies is west of the Rocky Mountains, 15 per cent is in the southern states, only 12 per cent in the west-north central states, including Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota. Missouri, Iowa and Minnesota, and 14 per cent is in the east-north central states. There is listed with the agency from Nebraska only 1,316 cars of hay and other roughage. Eight hundred of this amount are alfalfa from the Platte River Valley; which is moving rapidly at this time. Nebraska has been a large buyer of hay during the past few months. Personally, I am inclined to feel that your state relief agency was wise in not delaying its feed procurement program. I believe that I am fully justified in stating that the set-up for feed procurement and distribu - tion in Nebraska is one of the most efficient in the drought states. The agency has been able to buy good hay and buy it at a reasonable price. Prices for hay are much higher this year than they were last year. U. S. No. 1 alfalfa sold at the Kansas City market this week for from $23.00 to $24.00, as compared with last year's prices of $12.50 and $13.00 per ton. U. S. No. 1 alfalfa sold in the Platte Valley this week for from $18.00 to $19.50. Contrast this price with last year's price of $8.00 to $8.50, and down as low as $6.25 per ton for low grade hay. U. S. No. 1 Upland Prairie hay sold as low as $8.00 on the Kansas City market a year ago, in contrast to the. $18.50 to $19.50 being received this week. A number of steps have been taken by the department of Agricul- </seg>
            <seg id="p613">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION ture and the States to make the feed situation less acute; among which are: (1) A feed conservation program was inaugurated, which resulted In the harvesting of a million acres of corn fodder and the harvesting and preparation for market of many hays and other roughages that do not ordinarily get into commercial channels, such as soybean, lespedeza and miscellaneous grass hay and fodder and stover. There was also saved large amounts of straw. (2) Reduced rates were made effective to facilitate the movement of hay, straw and fodder to the drought areas. (3) The Federal Livestock Feed Agency was established for the purpose of locating supplies of feed and putting prospective buyers of feed in touch with those having a surplus of feed for sale. (4) A syndicate was formed to import hay and straw into the United States from Canada. (5) An arrangement is now under consideration for bringing into the United States a large quantity of molasses to be mixed with rough - ages on the farm. Consideration is also being given to the shipment of five to ten million bushels of soft white wheat from the Pacific Coast to the drought areas as feed for livestock. All of these measures have had a tendency to increase the feed supplies available for the drought territory. They have no doubt also stabilized prices. Feed Grains Feed grain supplies are also short. The 1934 corn crop in the country as a whole was 45 per cent less than the average yearly pro - duction for the period 1927-1931. The production of corn in Ne - braska in 1934 was 10,014,000 bushels, compared with 22.9S5.000 in 1933 and 253,126,000 in 1932. ' . The oat production for the country as a whole was 55 per cent less than the average yearly yield for the five-year period 19 27-1931. Oat production in Nebraska in 1934 was 8,568,000 bushels, compared with 23,373,000 bushels in 1933 and 74,190,000 in 1932. The 1934 crop of barley for the country as a whole was 61 per cent less than in 1932. This was the smallest crop since 1900. The 1934 barley crop in Nebraska was 2,700,000 bushels, compared with 8,390, - 000 in 1933 and 18,360,000 bushels in 1932. Mixed Feeds Many of the commercial mixed feeds are high-class products. They </seg>
            <seg id="p614">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE are scientifically prepared both as to their physical condition and also as to their chemical composition. In using them the feeder can feel reasonably well assured that his livestock is being properly nourished. Ready-mixed feeds may be used to especially good advantage by the small farmer. It is not always possible for him to get the ingredients that he needs to make up a satisfactory ration, and quite often he does not have the necessary grinding machinery. For these reasons, ready - mixed feeds fill an important place in the feeding operations of the nation. Manufacturers of mixed feeds are required to attach to each bag of their feed a statement of the composition of the feed, also a list of the ingredients used in making the mixture. Examination of this state - ment will enable the feeder to form a fairly reliable opinion as to the merits of the feed. Unfortunately, not all ready-mixed feeds can be called high-class. Because of the competition from other feed manufacturers and be - cause many feeders will buy the cheapest feed obtainable regardless of quality, some of the ready-mixed feeds have been loaded up with low-grade ingredients. As these low-grade materials usually have a high content of crude fiber, the feeder can detect their, presence by an examination of the analysis. A mixed feed containing much over 10 per cent crude fiber is likely to have an undue proportion of low-grade materials. Manufacturing costs of a low-grade feed are as great as those of a high-grade feed. Manufacturing, therefore, makes up a larger pro - portion of the total cost of a low-grade feed than it does of a high-grade feed relative to sales price. The roughages used to cheapen the mixed feeds gain but little in nutritive value by mixing them with other feeds. If roughage is needed, it can usually be bought cheaper in a bale than in a sack, however. Oat feed is a roughage that deserves special mention. This feed is too valuable to discard, and it is normally bagged for shipment, anyhow. Provided the oat feed cheapens the mixture enough so that the feeder will pay only a roughage price for the oat feed and pro - vided also that it is distributed only to farmers in need of roughage, there would appear to be no particular objection to the inclusion of this material in a mixed feed. The Seed Situation The seed situation is critical in some states. The demand for feed has been so great and so immediate that farmers have used what sup - plies they may have had for feeding livestock, preferring to chance getting seed next spring rather than let their cattle starve. In many </seg>
            <seg id="p615">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION' cases prevailing high prices for seed have encouraged rapid marketing with the result that much grain in some areas suitable for seed has found its way into the mills or the feeding pens, or to terminal markets where it has been badly mixed with other varieties. This means that new supplies of seed will have to be shipped in to many of the states that normally produce their own seed supplies. It further means that unadapted varieties must to some extent be used and that the danger of wide dissemination of seed-borne diseases and noxious weeds never have been so great as at the present time. The seed situation is unique, particularly with respect to the large area affected. A severe drought or a shortage of seed is not an un - usual occurrence; but in all previous cases' it has been possible to secure seed in the next county or, at the worst, a few counties away. In the present situation an area comprising the major part of at least six large states in the Great Plains is practically devoid of seed of certain grains, and it has been necessary to secure seed from con - siderable distances in order to secure adequate supplies of reasonably well adapted varieties. It was to alleviate this anticipated condition and to conserve such seed supplies as might be available that the President of the United States last June, at the suggestion of the Department of Agriculture, allocated the sum of $25,000,000.00 to purchase seed for the drought - stricken areas. The responsibility for this activity has been vested in a Seed Stocks committee. Purchase operations were begun in July and with respect to certain grains are still in operation. Approximately 19,000,000 bushels of grain have been bought. The announced objective of the seed procurement program was to conserve seed supplies that would otherwise move into channels of consumption, and this policy has strictly been adhered to. Also it has been the policy to decline to purchase seed for areas and of those crops where it appeared reasonably clear that the needs could be taken care of by the farmers, themselves, or through the regular channels of trade. These policies have a number of important implications and have had several important results as follows: (1) With one or two -minor exceptions, purchases have been limited to the grain crops. No forage crop seeds have been purchased and none is contemplated with the exception of grain sorghums which are used both for grain and forage and possibly a few lots of certified seed of certain varieties of forage sor - ghums of special merit which we have been informed may not be saved for seed unless purchased by 1 the Seed Stocks Com - mittee. </seg>
            <seg id="p616">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE (2) No grain has been, purchased which it appeared -would otherwise be held for seed. Thus, if a farmer or dealer offered grain at a price materially in excess of market or feed prices it was .assumed that he was holding it for seed, and so long as he continued to do so there seemed to be no urgent need for the Seed Stocks Committee to purchase it. Consequently this policy means that we have not been competing to a material extent, so far as the buying is concerned, with those who de - sired to purchase seed for their own requirements or for sale to their clients. It also means that our purchases have been made at prices very little, if any, in excess of the market. Any other policy, we believe, would have discouraged the holding of grain for seed by others. (3) Another very important implication of these policies is that the responsibility of the Seed Stocks Committee is limited to conserving such supplies of grain suitable for seed as may be available; or, to put the matter differently, its responsibility does not include supplying all seed that may be needed if those needs are in excess of the quantities procured in accordance with the conservation policy. It has been the policy to purchase grain for seed at country points so far as possible, in order to save transportation charges into the terminals: It was obvious, however, to begin with that only a part of the needed quantity could be secured in that way. Consequently offices were established at various points, including Minneapolis, Kan - sas City, Chicago, Omaha, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and Great Palls, Montana, to purchase grain as it moved into the central markets. Grain is stored in the terminals and at country points. The policy has been to store it where it was purchased if suitable storage was avail - able; otherwise it was moved into deficit areas in order to avoid extra handling charges. Approximately 40 per cent of the grain we now have is stored in country elevators. It is expected that all grain will be cleaned before it is offered for sale. So far no mention has been made of corn. There are a good many practical difficulties involved in the purchase and processing of corn for seed in large quantities, and the Department has preferred to avoid the actual buying of corn as far as possible. Instead, a plan has been proposed and probably will soon be put into operation whereby farmers having corn suitable for seed are encouraged to hold it until spring. This plan is applicable only to corn in sealed cribs. By its terms the owner is loaned 55 cents per bushel, which he must repay, and in addition is paid 20 cents per bushel, in return for which he agrees to hold the corn until such time, up to May 1, 1935, as the Sec - retary of Agriculture may direct and also agrees to sell the corn to the Secretary at $1.25 per bushel if the Secretary so desires. The essential </seg>
            <seg id="p617">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AXD FEEDERS ASSOCIATION feature of this plan so far as the farmer is concerned is that by its terms he can get an advance of 75 cents per bushel to buy feed and is thereby enabled to hold his corn for seed prices. Although it is not the policy of the Seed Stocks Committee to buy seed corn, an exception has been made In Missouri where, because of the acute situation, the Federal Emergency Relief Association has agreed in cooperation with the University of Missouri to purchase, assemble, shell and grade a limited quantity of seed corn which later is to be sold to the Seed Stocks Committee. This plan is not being fol - lowed in any other states. With respect to distribution, it may be said that the Seed Stocks Committee is neither a relief nor a credit organization and has no authority to dispose of the grain it has on hand except by sale for cash. Its announced purpose is to sell at fair price, taking into consideration the cost of the grain and market prices. Distribution will be effected through country drought committees appointed in most cases by State Extension Directors, the county agents functioning as chairmen of these committees. It is expected that the grain will be handled through regular trade channels, as far as the mechanics of the distribution are concerned. Grain will be shipped to bonded elevators in the deficit areas on the basis of orders previously placed with county drought com - mittee, and these elevators will be authorized to distribute the grain to farmers, receiving a per-bushel compensation for their services. It is anticipated that grain will be ear-marked for farmers or even shipped into deficit areas before payment for the grain is received, such grain being held for the purchaser until approximately thirty days before seeding time or until such time as he can arrange for the financing of the purchase if this is earlier. It has been pointed out that the policy of the Seed Stocks Com - mittee has been to conserve such grain suitable for seed as it has been able to locate and purchase at a reasonable price and that it has not and does not accept the responsibility for supplying all the seed that may be needed. This may be of importance for the reason that there seems to be a considerable group of people who have assumed that the government is going to make seed supplies available in one way or another and have been less diligent than they otherwise would have been in supplying their own requirements. In fact, we have heard of examples of farmers selling their own seed in the belief that they ■would be supplied by the government when seeding time arrived. It is practically impossible to determine with any degree of accuracy just how much seed from outside sources will be needed for the drought areas. A great deal depends on the credit that farmers in these areas will be able to arrange for. Much of the area is still </seg>
            <seg id="p618">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE dry, and If it remains so farmers will be reluctant to take a chance, in. view of the failures of recent years. Some land will undoubtedly be - abandoned regardless of credit or rain. There will probably also be some shift of acreage from small grains to corn because of the cheaper per acre cost of seed, insofar as this can be done within the limits of the acreage adjustment program of the Agricultural Adjustment Ad - ministration, and insofar as it may be accomplished in view of the probable shortage of seed corn. These factors are all more or less im - ponderable, and their effect on seed requirements cannot be predicted at this time. Based on extensive surveys and disregarding the matter of credit, abandoned land and possible shifting of acreage to other crops, and assuming normal acreages with such adjustments as required by the acreage reduction program of the Agricultural Adjustment Admin - istration, it appears that for the drought counties of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas and Missouri about 35,000,000 bushels of wheat, oats, barley and flax must be sup - plied from outside sources. Balance this against the 17,000,000 bushels which have been purchased to date, and it will be apparent that the Seed Stocks Committee will be in a position to supply about half of the total requirements. Just where the remainder is to come from is not clear. It may be that there is more seed grain in farmers' bins and country elevators than our surveys indicate. Seed has a way of showing up in unexpected quantities in the face of an unusual de - mand, and perhaps we may be so fortunate as to find there is after all no occasion for alarm. If on the other hand our estimates of needs is reasonably accurate, it would appear that there are only two alternatives: (1) A large acreage of land will not be seeded; or (2) a large acreage will be planted with very poor seed. There is of course plenty of grain .for seed, such as it is. There is, however, scarcely a lot of grain of any size in the middle west which the Seed Stocks Committee has not sampled and had an opportunity to purchase. A few of these oppor - tunities have been declined because of price, but for the most part they have been due to unsatisfactory quality, usually badly mixed as to variety or badly contaminated with weed seeds. It seems to us quite probable that before the planting season is over many of these lots of grain will be offered for sale to farmers. I shall not attempt to go into detail relative to this year's yields of the various kinds of seed as compared with last year and other previous years. I would like to mention, however, that there is a general shortage of some of the more important legume and grass seeds, as well as seed grains. Supplies of sweet clover seed are the shortest in twelve years. Supplies of timothy seed are the shortest on record, </seg>
            <seg id="p619">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AXD FEEDERS ASSOCIATION and the prices are the highest. Orchard grass seed is below normal re - quirements. Supplies of sudan grass seed are little more than half of the normal requirement. In the case of red clover, however, the short - age next spring will probably not be so noticeable because of the very - poor condition of the 1934 seedings from which most of the 1935 crop of seed will be obtained. The carry-over of alfalfa was the smallest in a number of years. A good demand for this seed is expected because the crop withstood the drought better than most other crops. The 1934 production of alfalfa seed for the country as a whole was 820,700 bushels, as compared with 1,025,700 bushels for 1933. The 1934 alfalfa seed crop in Nebraska was 92,400 bushels, compared with 94,000 bushels in 1933 and 41,600 bushels in 1932. Dry weather is con - ducive to alfalfa seed production, which accounts for the yield of this seed's holding up for 1934 in the state of Nebraska. The yield of sweet clover seed in Nebraska, which amounted to 73,500 bushels, was only slightly less than in 1933 and considerably greater than in 1932. I cannot emphasize too strongly the careful examination of seed before it is purchased, preferably by the state seed laboratories. The Seed Stocks Committee of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration has declined to purchase large quantities of grain for seed for various reasons, including low germination, mixtures, contamination of seed, weeds and so forth. Without any reasonable doubt, many of these re - jected lots of seeds will be offered for sale to farmers at low prices, and they will very likely buy them, because farmers at a time like this are inclined to become price buyers and do not give the necessary at - tention to quality. Perhaps a point worth emphasizing at this time is that no branch of the government has accepted any obligation to supply farmers with all of the seed they will need this year. The Seed Stocks Committee has accumulated a large supply, which will be made available to the most severely affected areas, but these supplies will be inadequate. It is believed that if the normal acreage is seeded next spring probably half of the seed requirements must be secured from other sources. If early surveys in Nebraska are accurate, the proportion of the total needs which must be secured from some source other than that held by the Seed Stocks Committee is considerably more than half. The situation appears to be particularly difficult with respect to adequate supplies of early oats. Since Nebraska will be placed in the position of bringing in seed from other states, it would be a good opportunity to encourage the use of adapted variety of spring wheat instead of using humpback, ■which is, I believe, considered an inferior variety for the state. </seg>
            <seg id="p620">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE It is my understanding that the seed corn situation in the state of Nebraska, with the exception of a few counties, is not particularly - critical. There is a large amount of sealed corn in the state, and I am inclined to think that in most areas farmers made provision for their seed supplies this corn disappeared. There will probably be some in - stances in the state where the supply is inadequate, but I think the situation is not likely to be anywhere near as bad as in Missouri and Kansas. Nevertheless, the importance of securing an adequate supply of seed reasonably early is important. </seg>

MEDLAR Specialists in the various divisions of Animal Husbandry may differ as to what is the most important phase of animal life in our economic system. They may even differ as to which class of animals farmers should emphasize most. And going a step father they may quarrel among themselves as to which breed of cattle or hogs or horses or poultry is the most profitable. You may readily satisfy yourself con - cerning this point by looking over our annual programs. Here are the </seg>

We may look for the Hampshire breeders, the Poland China breeders, the Turkey Growers Association. And if poultry meat and eggs become especially important perhaps the- Leghorn Breeders, the Barred Rock Breeders, and the Wyandotte Breeders will organize. • These things are mentioned only to direct your attention to the many and varied fields and phases of the livestock question. If I were to condense my remarks to a few sentences I could do no better than to set down the thoughts of two men whom I have followed in a measure in the field of economics and in animal husbandry. Professor G. F. Warren of Cornell University has stated that there are three reasons why farmers continue to produce livestock. These are ( 1 ) to utilize otherwise waste feeds, (2) to utilize unemployed labor and (3) to secure a margin in the market for meats and products over their cost. George M. Rommel who was at one time connected with the U. S. D. A. in the Animal Husbandry Division, states the problem some - what differently. He says there are seven functions of livestock in agriculture. These are (1) for power, (2) for manufacturing, (3) for fertility, (4) for an income, (5) for diet, (6) for increasing the interest and attractiveness in the farm home, and (7) to introduce system and management in the farm business. If these three suggestions of Dr. Warren and the seven of Mr. Rommel could be set down in a new way they might be stated as follows: The place of livestock in a long-time program in agriculture may be discussed under two heads: (1) its economic aspect, (2) its so - ciological aspect including health. Under the economic aspect would come first the source of farm power. I like to put this first because from the day that Watt and Stevenson invented the engine down to the present time the beast of burden and of power seems to be fighting a losing battle against mechanical power. Go back into history and read from the time the muzzled ox threshed the corn, or the water buffalo dragged a crooked stick through the rice fields to cultivate the soggy fields or the soldier mounted his steed and charged into battle or the farm horse tugged the heavy farm implements up and down the field in new America. Contrast them with the auto on the road instead of- the driving team, the truck instead of the draft horse in the city or the tractor in the field instead of the sweating teams. What shall be the place of livestock in the future as far as power in agriculture is concerned? The answer does not depend upon our preference or our prejudice. It depends upon the relative profitableness of animal power compared with mechanical power. We do not anticipate that mechanical power will ever displace the horse for the cattleman on the plains although the aeroplane and the auto may invade the field to some extent. We do not expect mechanical power to displace the </seg>
            <seg id="p623">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION' horse or the mule on the small farms or on the non-commercial farms. That is; to say probably one-half of our 6 million farms will always use horses and horses only as power. The majority of the other half of the farms will probably always have some horses though in all likeli - hood the auto will do the light road work, the truck the heavy hauling, and the tractor much of the heavy field work and the belt work about the farmstead. The above intimations may be varifled by the decrease in horses and mules in the United States during the past 20 years and by the increase in the numbers of automobiles, trucks, and tractors. It is just a matter of a question of economic production. My judgment is that animal power will continue to decrease as long as agriculture remains as profitable as competing industries, and that farmers will be benefited when mechanical power is wisely used. The second economic phase to be considered is that of a source of income. Here we find the application of many economic laws. Von Thuneun's law says bulky and perishable products cannot be shipped long distances to consuming centers. We feed 560 pounds of corn and get 100 pounds of pork. The corn is worth only a cent or two per pound while the pork is worth 6 to 8 cents per pound live weight or 10 to 12 cents dressed. We feed 560 pounds of corn and 300 pounds of hay and get 100 pounds of beef. Here again we change bulky com - modities to less bulky ones and thereby increase our agricultural income. You have only to think of the rough pasture land, the corn - stalk pasture, the straw from our grain, the many tons of hay, the bushels of grain which are of no value unless there is some class of livestock to consume them. Then we sell the livestock or their products and get an income from which we supply our other needs. Some people seem to have a notion that livestock do not make a market for our crops. To answer this question you only need to ask the question: How much would pasture land be worth without a livestock man to hire it? How much would corn be worth per bushel without a de - mand for livestock feed? What would hay be worth per ton or what would become of the bran and shorts from our wheat milling industry. The economic laws of by-products, joint costs, marginal returns and division of labor are all manifest in the income from the livestock" industry. So long as these and other economic laws operate just that long livestock and livestock products will remain as one of our chief sources of agricultural incomes. The third economic phase is that of fertility — includes erosion con - trol by grasses and pasture. No one believes or advocates that live - stock should be kept just for the production of manure. Neither does any one believe that by feeding crops to livestock the crop produc - ing power of feeds is increased. Fertility is a matter of conservation and convenience. By feeding the crops the light humus in the leaves and blades of crops is prevented from blowing away and it is also put </seg>
            <seg id="p624">KEPOIiT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE in the soil in such a condition that it readily decays and liberates the plant food elements. There probably never will come a time when agriculture will not be benefited by conserving the fertility and pro - ductivity'of the land through the use of barnyard manure. Possibly the southland in our own nation, the hilly and rolling lands of India, and China might be materially benefited if people would study and apply this phase of livestock to their production problem. The future of livestock in the field of sociology may be briefly dis - cussed under three heads, (1) the health of the family, (2) the diet of the family, and (3) the development of the family. Sometimes when we hear those in charge of our meat, milk, and food inspection tell their experiences with animals and animal products we wonder. But even though we wonder, we continue to eat meat, drink milk, and use animal fats for cooking. The experts in diets advise us that we can get along without meats and other animal products but still we con - tinue to use them in our diet. My own observation in history is the more aggresive and intelligent people have always used meat and animal products in their diets. One other interesting fact has stood out down through the pages of history and that is that there has seldom been a devastating famine among peoples who were meat eaters. They have carried on through droughts, wars, and pestilent diseases and seldom has their diet or food supply been inadequate except under most unusual circumstances. Perhaps this is enough of the past. What will be the future of livestock in the health and diet of our people? Time only can answer the question fully but it is my opinion that live - stock will always play an important place in this field. Not until the pressure of population forces us — if that time ever comes — to abandon the animal products in our living will they decline in their importance. The third phase of the social side of this question needs but little discussion. No statistics have ever been compiled to show that most of the men in industry and business developed their sense of responsi - bility and dependableness by having to feed the calves and shut the gates and stable doors. It is a common observation that dependable, kind and considerate men and women are developed through the animal pets on the farm, through the animal chores which must be done every day and in all weather — the worse the weather the more important the chore, and through 4-H club work including the live - stock clubs. Maybe it is not saying too much to state that in all prob - ability the boys and girls learn more about proper eating and rest through livestock care than through their lessons in physiology. And that the sanitation they learn while caring for livestock leads them to build themselves strong in body and in mind. Some even think that farmers build wind breaks, improve the farmstead and furnish more conveniences for the family because these are beneficial to his; livestock. Well if livestock makes him think — as the thumb on the </seg>
            <seg id="p625">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION' human hand does — probably the claim is not too great. In conclusion I want to return to the economic aspect. We recognize that society is dynamic — that it is constantly changing and that people are always looking for ways to better their living standards. The place of livestock in the plan of living will always be changing. There are some fundamental things which should be remembered. The weather and crop adaptation are responsible for feeds for the live - stock. Farmers respond in production to the price consumers offer. These two things make for an irregular supply and widely fluctuating prices. Livestock act as scavengers for wasle feeds and unemployed labor. This makes for a more or less stabilized source of food and more uniform employment though the wage returns may vary. Out of these conditions come our production cycles and our seasonal market trends. The shrewder producers are studying in this field and even when the majority of growers fail you will find individuals and groups, of livestock producers making a profit from livestock. In a concluding summary we may briefly say: (1) From the economic side — for the source of income the main - tenance of fertility and as a source of power livestock will always have a place. (2) From the social side — our diet, family life and human de - velopment will probably always utilize meats and other animal products. (3) In the efforts of men to make a more satisfactory income the animals will furnish a market for unsalable crops, otherwise waste labor and land and a major portion of our crops. And in the efforts of men to make a better living will be the base for production cycles of all classes of livestock with attendant widely fluctuating prices. THE HOG SITUATION IX EUROPE HARRY REED The pork problem today is a real one. One in which the farmers are vitally interested, not only in this country but in the other coun - tries as well. Any hog raised outside of the United States is in com - petition with hogs raised by you farmers. During the past few years Europe has had a depression the same as we have. Their farmers and industrialists have been in much the same condition as the people of this country. With the depression in Europe came a wave of nationalism, the desire to become self sufficing and not dependent upon other countries for their food supply. The </seg>
            <seg id="p626">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE interest in pork and lard production continued in the United States, dependent upon the excellent export trade in pork and lard which the U. S. had prior to the years of the depression. The countries of Europe may be divided into two classes in ref - erence to pork production. The countries having a deficiency in pork and those having a surplus of pork. The deficient countries tried to do two things, expand pork production and to reduce imports, while the surplus countries set about curtailing production. And I might say that the latter were more successful than the former. The reason for this can easily be seen. If it were possible, increased pork pro - duction would have been established in these deficient countries. But there is little to tie hog production to. In the U. S. we have our huge corn crop which goes hand in hand with our hog production. In Den - mark, though they import a large per cent of their grain, hog pro - duction is tied to the vast dairy industry that is carried on there. Germany raises hogs with potatoes. This tuber constitutes sixty per cent of the ration of the hogs. During the last few years the German farmers have stored their potatoes In silos which tends to make pork a year around product. Before this method of storage was discovered pork was more or less of a seasonal proposition. In November 1932 Great Britain restricted her imports by placing a quota on pork products, her main pork imports being in the form of bacon, hams and lard. At the same time they placed a duty on lard which, they reasoned, was a protection to the home industry. Germany, who imports mostly bacon and lard, placed a heavy duty on these products and now very little is entering its ports. The United States as the important source of pork and lard for these importing countries, should look into their problems. Great Britain is a densely populated country and most of the people are engaged in manufacturing. Consequently food is imported and distributed through elaborate distributing agencies. Any source of feed for Eng - land must have three requirements, regular in supply, adequate in supply and of uniform quality. The bacon required in England is different than what we commonly think of as bacon. They demand a mild cure which does not render it unperishable but it must be consumed in two weeks under ordinary conditions. It is difficult for us to put this mild cure bacon into Eng - land, but the supply must be adequate and arrive regularily. The imports must also be of standard quality. The Danish people have worked up a standard bacon in England which is in great demand. Our bacon also is a standard product but it has a special rather than a bulk demand. The bacon required in England is composed of the whole side and what we use as pork chops goes into the English bacon. </seg>
            <seg id="p627">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION This is called the Wiltshire side. Denmark has specialized in this side and was exporting five and one-half million cwts. per year before the depression. This was reduced to about three million cwts. last year. There was a flood of imports to England late in 1932. Hog pro - duction was at its peak and prices were low everywhere. The English government demanded a reorganization in the hog industry. Now the English farmer contracts in advance for the number of hogs he thinks he can sell and he is assured a market for that number. Bacon only is made from these hogs. The quotas are given out after the English production is estimated from these contracts with the farmers. Let us suppose the English consumption is 10,800,000 cwt. of pork and pork products each year. The English farmer can produce 3,000,000 cwts., and the Dominions can supply 2,800,000 cwts., this leaving 5,000,000 cwts. to be imported from other countries. Of course the English farmers get the first call, the possessions next and lastly the other countries. The English hogs are not uniform but a conglomeration. It is a fact that England has more breeds of hogs than any other country. They are marketed seasonaly, the marketings being high in winter and low in summer. But the demand for the Wiltshire side is uniform throughout the year. So during the warm months is the time of year when most of the pork is imported into England. However, the English have increased their production in the face of adverse condition. But the costs are high because of the lack of feed and consumers are not satisfied with the pork they are buying. Hogs are, of course, a side line enterprise rather than a main enterprise in England. Under the present English system the profit or loss is divided between the farmer and curer. The price being decided by a price fixing formula which takes the growing factors; feed etc. into account. Denmark exported about 85 per cent of her pork to England before the English quota system was put into effect. With this outlet gone they are rapidly cutting down their production of pork. They esti - mate their probable export and base their annual production on that. Each Danish farmer has a card which must be punched before he can market a hog. i Holland, formerly a large exporter to England exporting about 50 per cent of her annual production has a rigid control system. It is unlawful to have a live pig weighing over twenty pounds which does not have a government ear tag. You can see that it is much more strict than our own Corn-Hog program. Germany as we have stated is a surplus area in regard to pork but </seg>
            <seg id="p628">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE must import vast quanities of lard. As their problem is one of ex - change matters, they have conserved their exchange by importing only from those countries with which she has a favorable balance of trade. This situation developed in the last few years and consequently we exported little lard to Germany in 1934. But they would take our lard if they could send us goods in return. ADJUSTING OURSELVES WARD NEFF I am happy to be here today within the walls of an institution and in the presence of a group that, taken together, reflect and rep - resent all that is best and most significant in American education and industry. It is in such meetings as this that the real vital forces of American progress are germinated, forces, which, over the years bear fruits of value and benefit in the economic life of the nation and in the development of human character and ideals which are beyond our power to estimate. In them also are found inspiration and food for thought which enables us to better adjust ourselves to the rapidly changing conditions with which we are constantly confronted. "Adjusting Ourselves" is my assigned subject but it is a rather broad subject for the few minutes allotted me. Its aspects are so com - prehensive that they cover all phases of our life, national and local; political, social and economic; group and individual. The necessity for adjustment in our affairs is always with us, but it is probably more generally recognized in depression times when there is less of certainty as a guide to assist us in fitting ourselves into the scheme of things, and when the alterations in our affairs are less to our liking. They then seem to come closer home. There is a story current of a New York Hebrew whose son, away at college, failed to appreciate the change which had taken place in the family's affairs and failed to reduce his expenditures accordingly. The father, disturbed by what he considered excessive demands for money undertook to impress him with the necessity for readjustment in his habits and his spending. "Son", he said, "you must cut down. Everybody has had to cut down. Look at your brother. No new car this year. Look at your mother. No fur coat. Look at your sister, wearing last year's dress and yes look at me. It used to be wine, women and song but now it's just ice cream soda, the radio and Mamma." </seg>
            <seg id="p629">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION We have war; we have peace. We have prosperity; we have de - pression. We have high prices; we have low prices. We have crops and feed for our live stock; we have drouth and little feed. We have money; we have none. We have republican policies; and we even have democratic policies. These contrasts have all occurred within the span of a few short years. They are but the beginning of the list, but they emphasize the changing conditions we are constantly called* upon to meet in our business, our industries and in our homes. I am not unmindful of the fact that this has been designated an "outlook" program which at least implies that I should to some ex - tent address myself to the question of adjusting ourselves to the future. I am, however, by training a newspaper man and like most newspaper men much prefer the role of reporter to that of prophet. For that and many other reasons, it is fitting that I limit myself to making a few observations on what occur to me to be fundamental truths — proved to be truths by all human experience. When I say that I am reading these remarks both for the sake of clarity and brevity, I am sure you will forgive me for so presenting them. All material progress is the result of pioneering in the use of brains. We would not have such comforts and luxuries as we share on every hand today, were it not for the fact that someone in his time pene - trated the then unknown and gave to the world a new idea. The men who first attached a stone to the end of a club to kill his meat used his head for thinking purposes. So did the man who first fastened a piece of sharpened hard wood to the end of a stick to turn the soil; each was a pioneer in his day; and a succession of pioneers, mastering all hu - man knowledge on a given subject, and developing a bit of new thought from that point, have given us all that we hold precious in a material way. We send our young people to such spendid institutions as this, hoping that they will grasp the challenge that is thrust before them the challenge of mastering their subjects, of absorbing knowledge on those subjects, but above all, the challenge of learning to think and from there moving on to the development of new knowledge. It is only in this way that progress can be achieved. Education, such as we provide today, is primarily a speeding up process. If our good friends here at the college will give our young people the polishing process of intensive social contacts and at the same time teach them to think for themselves, then they will have done all that it is possible for teaching to do. There is no way to measure what the agricultural college and the experiment station have contributed to the development of progress in farm operations. It is true, of course, that our experiment stations </seg>
            <seg id="p630">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE have always occupied a position of leadership in the development and Introduction of new crops and new methods. And it Is certainly true that there is not a single farmer in this or in any other state who is not doing some things differently and to better advantage than he would be doing them without the insistent, intensive research and teaching program that has been followed all these years. For instance, the bacterial processes in the soil, recognized in the simplest of farm operations, would today be unknown except for the careful, painstaking •work of experiment station scientists. The same is true of a thousand and one other things involved in what are today the most commonplace farm practices. For the good of the industry in which we are all so vitally interested, the development of new knowledge through these institutions must have our continued support. It is good to see so many of you here today be - cause it reflects your appreciation of an institution that deserves the highest commendation for the character of its teaching. Knowledge is essential to the correct interpretation of events which in turn is of the utmost importance in adjusting ourselves. Give one the power to correlate facts and interpret them the problem of the present and even the future are reduced to a minimum. To some men come greater blessings in the material things of life than to others. We credit them with being smart with insight into the future. Is it for any other reason than that they are better informed — that they pos - sess more facts and, piecing them together, adjust themselves quickly to the picture which is revealed to them? It must be obvious that here I am not speaking entirely of text book knowledge. Eduction for many does not include information gained within college walls, and for most of those who do enjoy the privilege of such training it does not end there. Each day presents to all of us opportunity to acquire our quota through the daily press and the many other channels open to us. And here I want to pay tribute to those farmers who, notwithstanding fatigue from the day's toil, seek information from their daily newspapers as to what is going on in the world beyond their immediate horizon; who endeavor to under - stand the nation-wide and world-wide factors which affect or determine the course of the markets for their products, who endeavor constantly to keep informed. Their ranks are steadily growing and it augurs well for the future of their industry. It should not be necessary to say anything to an audience such as this in support of work, but the fact of the matter is that there exists in our cities, if not in our rural sections, a widespread belief in the short day and the short week. People without number thoroughly believe that the thirty-hour week should be and is soon to be the estab - lished standard. They argue that through the use of modern labor </seg>
            <seg id="p631">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION saving machines all human needs can be provided, thus leaving a very large number of idle hours each week for leisure and pleasure. An appropriate slogan for this, sort of philosophy, it would appear to me, would be "Make America a Land of Loafers". The theory, like so many other ill-conceived theories extant today, is one readily supportable in argument. The truth is that such a program for any large number of our people would be no other than the road to ruin. No man ever got out of debt lying in bed in the morning. The country will never loaf its way to prosperity. It will never happen over an extended period of time that five hours work will produce as much in exchange for services and com - modities as eight hours work. Furthermore, civilization has not yet arrived at the point where extended leisure would be used properly. The devil still finds mischief for idle hands. The real way out, as every reasonable man knows, is through the development of new industries and the enlargment of old ones to absorb the labor not needed for the production of necessities or provid - ing essential services. Think of the thousands of people now gain - fully employed in industries just a few years ago unheard of — first, because some one's brain held the germ of an idea but second, because of aggressive American development of that idea. We have great needs today. It is easy to name a few off hand and you will think of others — the extension of the use of gas and electricity, the introduc - tion of running water into millions of homes not now provided with it, mechanical refrigeration, television — any of them ready, with proper nursing, to support no one knows how many families of workers. But today we are putting practically our entire effort on reduction of hours and output per man. It is no way to success for the people as a whole, any more than it is for individuals. Labor-saving machinery throws people out of work. It always has and always will, but its contribution to wealth is immeasurable. As a single example, recall the grain binder. And such facilities make possible the employment of more people in other lines of production and in creating new industries. Neither economically nor socially does the labor-saving machine require any defense. It sometimes seems as though we are over-organized in this coun - try. I presume that this is a natural outgrowth of adverse condi - tions. Under such circumstances, people are inclined to group activity to remedy what they believe to be their wrongs or to seek what they </seg>
            <seg id="p632">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE believe will prove to be belpf ul. One result, however, is that as or - ganizations are set up and financed, they give employment to people who, in the course of time seek to reform and remodel this, that and the other thing with the primary purpose, if the truth were known, of enlarging the scope of their activity and insuring their own con - tinued employment. Thus we have so called "movements" which sometimes result in violent disturbances. Our much berated bureau - cracy in government operates in much the same way, as appointees seek to extend their influence and their power. One example of a resulting "reform" wave is to be seen in the development of live stock marketing elsewhere than at our terminal markets, resulting in the weakening of the price determining function of these markets. When the buyers of hogs are independently sup - plied by direct purchases from farmers, and it is no longer necessary for them to act as bidders in the market, it must be obvious that the factor of price influence is on their side. The question involved in direct marketing of hogs is not whether the farmer receives a price that is equitable from the standpoint of the market price, but whether that market price is what it should be on the basis of the free operation of the law of supply and demand. The argument that the hog price has been relatively too low during the past few years as a result of the large increase in direct buying is one that producers cannot . afford to pass idly by. In this connection let us bear in mind that our open competitive live stock markets in this country are the result of three - quarters of a century of experience. During this period men of in - telligence and enterprise have constantly devoted thought and efforts to improvement in the methods of handling and selling live stock on these markets. We cannot afford to throw into the discard a system built on that experience for something that is obviously experimental, that remains to be proved, and that palpably is unsound from the standpoint of scattered producers. If the livestock producers of this country feel that there may be some advantage for them in working together in a co-operative sense, they should realize that the effect of that is nowhere more directly or effectively translated into action than through the operation of the open competitive market. We are all interested in the prosperity of American agriculture. Some of us more directly so than others, but any man who thinks at all must realize that in such a country as ours there can be no endur - ing prosperity for anybody unless the farmer shares in it in full measure. We are launched in this country on a vast experiment in food production control, with which you are all familiar. I do not think there is anyone who does not hope that the plan will succeed. But does not common sense dictate skepticism? The first and greatest difficulty is the difficulty of controlling production in the face of un - controllable factors. We know, for instance, that neither the maxi- </seg>
            <seg id="p633">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION mum nor the minimum of rainfall can be set by law; neither the grass - hopper nor the chinch bug can be enjoined by court action. Man, after all, is a minor factor in crop control, a simple fact which, un - recognized, must ultimately lead to the confusion of those who believe that crops can be controlled by controlling man if it has not already done so. Eventually any man-made plan that limits itself to the con - trol of crops must fail, either because nature proves niggardly on the one hand, or profligate on the other. Another fundamental weakness in any control plan must be another phase of nature's influence, namely, human nature. Some genius dis - covered long, long ago that this is a big country. There are some six million farmers engaged in tilling the soil. Policing the entire country is out of the question on the basis of cost alone. No law, no police force, can prevent men from taking a profit where they see it or keep them from avoiding loss if possible. Not even the power of the United States government can hold down production when production pays. It is not only useless to attempt the impossible; it is extremely costly; for when artificial control influences are introduced, trade is upset and that ever-successful business killer, uncertainty, takes the reins. Briefly, I do not believe that we can create wealth by destroying wealth or by withholding from production our greatest natural re - source, the soil. Nor do I believe that we can restore prosperity by spending. You would scarcely recommend to an individual, unable to meet his bills, that he go out and buy a new radio, a new rug for the front room, a new outfit for the wife and so on and so on as a means of restoring his solvency. .A nation is only a collection of individuals. Furthermore, I do not believe that we should permit in this country the destruction of individual incentive, by limiting what a man may accumulate or retain. All that we have ever been able to accomplish as a people, all that we have been able to build up in the way of national wealth, has been due in the aggregate to incentive for monetary or other tangible reward — a tremendous force that we cannot afford to destroy if we expect to amount to anything in the future or to leave to future generations that which they will prize. The danger of losing this incentive lies in conflscatory taxes, limited returns to capital and to the individuals who in the last analysis supply it, restriction of operations by government control and related undertakings of a new philosophy that is the depression-sired offspring of political expediency. Neither do I believe that competition is out-moded. Consider for an instant, the automobile industry, where competition has given us the utmost luxury for a few hundred dollars. Reflect for a moment and you will realize that if this competition had not existed, most of </seg>

            <seg id="p635">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AXD FEEDERS ASSOCIATION figures of the market pages and then turn to the column of today, we will find much cause for rejoicing. For, while I fully appreciate the dreadful drought of '34, the brown and barren fields, and all the grief and disappointment that followed in its wake, I cannot help but recall that top hogs a year ago today were worth about $3.50, and are rapidly approaching $8.50 as we assemble here. Top cattle that sold for less than $7.00 are now bring - ing more than $11.00. Fat lambs and sheep, eggs and poultry, butter fat and grain, have all shared in a most generous advance; and while we cannot reasonably hope that the market will continue to go on and on in its upward course, we do feel that top levels have not been reached, that world supplies have been greatly reduced, and — therefore, we can look forward with every confidence not only to the hope of a good crop but of good prices when same is harvested. And, as we assemble here this morning, we are starting on a new journey around the sun. Before us is the vista of the New Year, not only beckoning us on but commanding us — each and all — to go forward; and the Great American Army of One Hundred and Twenty Million souls is again marching along what we hope will be smoother high - ways, under more temperate suns, and with more frequent resting places than the journey of the year that has passed. We all have our special trials and tribulations, practically no one can escape; and in meeting them we either develop our strength or reveal our weaknesses, and in conquering them we prepare ourselves for another battle as we hope for another victory. There is no ques - tion but what we are living in a vastly different age and under condi - tions that at times are hard for all of us to understand. Everywhere we turn people are talking of money, talking in terms and in figures that were only used by astronomers when we were boys. Everywhere the word billion greets your eye, and in close conjunction but at the same time far from it we see the words "balanced budget", something that probably will develop when this generation and its children are gone. Only recently our Chief Executive addressed the people in his peculiarly entertaining way, and told them that in the carrying on of the business of the United States he expected to spend "eight and a half billions of dollars" during the fiscal year and at the same time he only expected to take in "four billions of dollars"; and the startling difference of over four billions to be written in red which means "four thousand millions" scarcely caused a riffle in the commercial currents of the country and government securities advanced a few points. I am very much interested in knowing how many of you took the time to read in full the President's message. It wasn't long; it vitally </seg>
            <seg id="p636">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARf/ OF AGRICULTURE concerns you and all the things that you hold most dear, and I wish those of you who have read the message would raise your right hand The no's have it. And while I am not surprised at the rather limited number, I am sure if an audience in the Industrial Centers of the East similar in size to this was asked the same question we would find that a less number had read the message. The President goes on to tell us that by June 30th the United States government, which is you and me, and all the rest of our people will be in debt about thirty-four and a half billions. He could have added very properly that the separate states would-be in debt about seventeen billions more, or a total of over fifty-one billions, or more than "four hundred dollars" per capita for every man, woman and child in this great land. One thing is certain, this debt will never be paid in your day or mine, and another thing is certain— we surely are going to leave something to posterity and probably it is just as well that we won't be able to hear what they say about it, particularly some of their com - ments on the way we spent the money and incurred the debts. I am not referring to these matters in criticism of our Chief Execu - tive; no one, I think, questions his integrity and his overwhelming zeal for social service. Some of us occasionally feel if those who surround and advise him had had to meet the problems of the monthly payroll to take care of the obligations at the bank, and to furnish the oppor - tunities of earning an honest livelihood to their fellow citizens they might be more temperate in their recommendations and be willing to try one experiment at a time, rather than inaugurate so many of the things that we have been wont to call the New Deal and we are now beginning to term the New Order. Many of the President's advisors are undoubtedly well read, but sometimes it seems as if some of them were just red; and I was quite amused recently at the story of one of the numerous democratic congressmen, who in the recent campaign reiterated the universal speech "I am for Roosevelt— I don't know what he wants— I don't care, but I'm for Roosevelt." But one of these spellbinders elaborated this stereotyped speech and indulged in a splendid eulogy of the President, and while exhausting his vocabulary and particularly his command of superlatives, he was frequently inter - rupted by an old-time republican who persisted in saying "I don't like this man Roosevelt", and after the last interruption the speaker said— "But there is a power greater than the President, a Mind and an Arm that is stronger than his, a Spirit that is behind him at all times," and as he paused for the expected applause the old republican said— "I don't like her either". I don't share in those sentiments, but I am inclined to think that we are looking too much toward Wash - ington and we are not looking enough toward home. There are un - doubtedly features of the New Deal that are most commendable- but you would think to hear some of its champions talk that there had </seg>
            <seg id="p637">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION never been anything really worth while in the old days and in the old deal, and I am one of those who are old fashioned enough to believe that while the new methods of transportation and the wonders of science quite generally have brought into our lives a picture that is radically changed, I can't help but believe that all of these things, that all of our hopes for '35 and for the years to follow still rest squarely upon the human factor. And I am wondering if that grand old philosopher and outstanding intellectual giant of the early days of this country, namely Benjamin Franklin, were to come back to Washington for a few days, what he would say. You recall that he was the only man whose name you will find subscribed to the Declaration of Inde - pendence, the Treaty with France, probably the turning point of the Revolution; the Treaty with England in recognition of our independ - ence, and the Constitution of the United States. You will also recall that he commenced as a humble printer, but that at forty-two he had achieved a fair competency, and from then on, the rest of his life, he devoted himself to the public welfare. He was termed by Carlisle the greatest man that this country ever produced, and while he is known for his discoveries with reference to electricity, his brillancy as a diplomat at the Court of France, and above all for his wisdom and his power in directing the affairs of the Colonies, he is even better known as the Aspostle of Common Sense. And I think it would be a fine thing if the school boards of the country would reproduce Poor Richard's Almanac, with its homely sayings, also a pamphlet that achieved world wide fame, entitled The Way to Wealth, in which he pictures Father Abraham attending a public sale, buying the things that he didn't need and later on being forced to sell even his necessities of life. Franklin preached the doctrine of the glory of work. He had no understanding and no patience with those who seem to think there is something degrading in work and the chief end of life is pleasure. It is a long time since Franklin, but if we had more of his spirit today we would have less problems tomorrow and the days to follow; and I am very much interested in an article in the current number of the Saturday Evening Post, written by General Hugh Johnson of the late and lamented NRA Administration. I hope that many of you have read it, and that those who have not will do so, for while you may not have agreed with some of the General's methods, you will realize that he is speaking from the inside and you will be very much interested in his lack of criticism of the President, whom he terms the greatest conciliator the world has ever known, and he goes on to say with that charming voice of his that the President can take a wild eagle and a timid canary, put them in the same room and after talking to them a few minutes the canary will be sitting on the beak of the eagle. And the general further makes the statement that with reference to money he doesn't know anything about it, and furthermore he thinka that no one else does; but the gist of the article is in the clean cut </seg>
            <seg id="p638">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE statement that practically all that is necessary for this country to snap out of its trouble inside of twelve months would be to balance the budget and to give us absolute assurance that there would be no in - flation or further impairment of the American Dollar. But, my friends, I will still believe not only in America and its future, but in America and her people. But I believe it is up to us, up to you and me, and when Dame Fortune hits us on the chin we must pull up our belt, put on a grin, and carry on. And as I look at this audience and see the men and women of years and see the evidence in their faces of toil and anxiety, and realize that many of them are no longer young, I recall the book entitled "Life Begins at Forty", but I -don't subscribe to its doctrines, and it is very evident to you that I am not in a position to do so. I believe, and have always done so, that life commences about six in the morning, and that it ends when you drop off to sleep at night. I believe that the only day you can live in hap - piness or in strife is just TODAY, and this alone, and each day is a life. I also believe that despite our losses and our material disappointments, despite the friends who have gone down to their graves under the pres - sure that they could not bear, that life is worth while; and I some - times think that many of us in looking afar overlook the happiness that is well within the realm of our immediate vision. Green fields are ever distant and are usually over the hill, while fortune is a real coquette, who hardly ever is still; and if a man would win her, he must woo her every day; and it don't make any difference what his job is, or the pay. And this gets right back to the old fashioned philosophy of Franklin and his theory of the dignity and glory of work, and I am sure if the old philosopher were here today he would agree with me in the view that the only real gentleman and real gentlewoman is the one that works, and that the Lord never intended that we should go through life on a pass, and that we should be no more hesitant in pointing out the slacker in times of peace than we are in times of war. As I stand here, I am conscious of the shadow of a great university, one of the great institutions of the country; and whenever I see one of these great schools of learning I think of President Wilson's com - ment, namely, that they have a tendency to make men forget their common origin. But I do not think that is true of the University of Nebraska, whose splendid record I am familiar with — not only in the halls of learning, but on the gridiron and the track; and in speaking of universities I recall that one of the most distinguished educators of this country not long ago made the statement that the attendents in the filling stations of the country had done more to improve the man - ners and the courtesy of the business public than all the colleges com - bined. That might be a good topic for debate, but I will leave it for your consideration. </seg>
            <seg id="p639">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION I am reminded of an incident that occurred at one of these meet - ings years ago, when one of your citizens was awarded a medal as being the best feeder in the state, and when the medal was presented he was asked to make a speech, to tell us how he had achieved his splendid results, and after saying — I cannot make a speech — he added but I love my cattle and my cattle love me; and in those few words he revealed his secret. He loved his work. And I think that the University of Nebraska has never lost sight of the fact that the first aim of education should be manhood rather than scholarship, and I believe there is something in the broad acres of this state, with its windswept plains and ranges, with its strong soil, and its vigorous climate, that has developed an unusually sturdy class of people, and while I know that the good things are not measured by geography and that no one section can rightfully claim all for itself, I do believe that in this country west of the Mississippi and extending from the river to the foothills of the Rockies, and from the Canadian border to the waters of the gulf, you will find the finest physical, mental and moral group of people of any great numbers that you can find anywhere in the world; and this, my friends, to me is the real America, the name which is intriguing, coming from way back in the days of the Goths, derived from the word Amalrik, which in turn is two words: Amal meaning work, Rik, to conquer. In other words, American — all con - quering work. And as we go back to our farms and ranches, as we stand on the land that is ours and look forward and make plans for this splendid new year, let us be glad that we are living; get a kick out of modest giving for some girl or worthy lad. Stop and count your blessings daily, cut out self pity and complaint; try to be a happy mixture, 'twixt a sinner and a saint. And don't forget that the world is full of troubles, in every line and trade, and they don't get any smaller when put on dress parade. And above everything else — don't indulge in self pity. If you are always moaning you will soon find yourself alone; and if you knew the other man's burden you would frequently be ashamed of yourself for magnifying your own. There is hardly any situation, if viewed in the proper light, that could not be worse, and there is hardly any time when a man hands you a lemon but what with a little ingenuity you can make it into a lemonade and frequently sell It at a profit. I knew a man who lived and expressed this philosophy under all conditions and some of them very trying, and as I thought of him one day I wrote these lines — which have often served to carry me over a rough place or through a bad situation: </seg>
            <seg id="p640">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE There was a man who always said: — -It might be worse — That any kind of walking Beats riding in a hearse. And when the folks were sick and sad, And everything was going bad; You'd hear it breaking forth from Dad, — It might be worse — It got upon the children's nerves, But Father didn't care. He always said — It might be worse, No matter when nor where. So they laid to pick him up And make him take it back; They waited long and listened hard To catch him off the track. And so one day at breakfast time He told them how he'd dreamed That he had died and gone to Hell, In unison they screamed — For once, Dear Dad, you must admit The worst has come to you: Oh no, the old man smiled and said — It might be worse, If true. And so, my friends, this is the thought I would like to leave with you, coupled with the further thought that America means work and that salvation is where you live, in a large measure, and not in Wash - ington or any State Capital. FORKW'ARD RALPH BUDD I do not know why I was called to talk this last day, the day of summary. I am glad to see you get together to talk over your problems. I am sorry that I could not be here all week but other engagements prevented it. Nevertheless we have a vital interest in your problems and we hope that you have some interest in our problems. We have them the same as you do and they are much the same problems. Any enterprise in order to survive must perform an essential service, must do it efficiently, and operate at a profit. There is no doubt that both you farmers and the railroads perform an essential service. You </seg>
            <seg id="p641">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION 1 are raising the food that is essential in keeping people alive. Food, of course, is only one of the many products that you produce. Your animals are raised one place and are consumed at some distant point. That is where we perform our service, transportation. With your service and our transportation the animals are placed in the Con - suming centers. Our problems are parallel in efficiency of operation. The only difference is that you deal in animate things and we in inanimate, you in organic and we in inorganic substances. Our efficiency is meas - ured per ton mile of freight. I know nothing of the efficiency of the various breeds, feeds, methods of handling, etc. of livestock. But I do know fuels, tractive effort, what type of engine to use for a certain purpose and other things pertaining to a railroad company. But the answer to both our problems is to get efficiency in production or oper - ation as the case may be. In our organization our efficiency department is always looking for ways to reduce costs. One line of research which we are developing may go a long way in reducing costs and this would allow us to scale our prices downward. It is a problem in metallurgy to find a metal which is light in weight and maintains strength which we have in some of the heavier metals. This new metal is more important in freight than in passenger trains. Because the lighter the metal the wider the ration between the weight of the load and the weight of the car. But this must be done without reducing the strength of the metal. If this is done, the weight of the car can be much less and yet it can haul the same load. And you realize that we haul a car almost as much when it is empty as when it is full. The outlook in this department of research looks good. The stream - lined passenger train which we call the Zephyr is an example of what can be done with a light strong metal. A new type of engine is used in this train. It has the lightest weight per hauling power of any engine yet used in railway trains. It is a Diesel engine. In this train we have done away with weight and bulk and yet we have maintained the strength of the heavier and more bulky trains. The problem is now one of high cost. Even though this metal is light and strong its present cost is prohibitive for its general use. But we have not given up and are still working on this and other problems and our efficiency is increasing. There are people who believe that technology should be given up and not make any more machines but technology cannot be given up. But if you and I can relieve the drudgery and absorb the unemployed the depression will be beaten. </seg>
            <seg id="p642">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 4-H CLUB CONGRESS The most outstanding feature this year of my club work was the - trip to 4-H Club Congress. This trip was awarded to me by Nebraska Breeders and Feeders Association. I looked forward to this trip from the time I won it until I left for Chicago. I arrived in Chicago Novem - ber 29 and on Friday, the 30th, we took part in the National 4-H Club Live Stock Judging Contest winning seventh place. One of the things that I enjoyed most at Chicago was the trip to Museum of Science and Industry. I certainly enjoyed the trip through the coal mine, watching the mechanical machinery in operation. The threshing outfit, being so small, and yet operating like a larger and real machine. The man made cow and the modern vacuum milking machine looked as if they were real. There were many other things very in - teresting, such as sugar refinery, cutting steel under water, and Sperry Groscopic Stabilizer. Another high spot of my trip was the tour through the International Harvester Company, watching the making of tractors and the manufacture of twine. I enjoyed very much the fifty mile motor coach tour of the city of Chicago, going through China town, Lincoln park, University of Chicago, and Washington park. I certainly enjoyed the many banquets which were given us, especi - ally the banquet at the Stevens Hotel, also the many fine programs which were given for our entertainment while we were at Chicago. I certainly appreciated the effort the different people of Chicago made for us, trying to show us a good time while we were in Chicago. I will always remember Club Congress as one of the outstanding times of my life. I wish that every boy and every girl in Club work would have the privilege to enjoy Club week as I did at the National Club Congress. JOHN BECKWITH, Loretto, Nebraska. MY CHICAGO TRIP Where commerce and industry forge onward, where people and traffic move in endless chains, that was my first impression of the city of Chicago. We, who made up the Nebraska live stock judging team, arrived in Chicago Thanksgiving morning. Our destination was the Harrison Hotel, which was to be the headquarters of the Nebraska delegation. Our first major activity was the live stock judging contest, scheduled for eight o'clock Friday morning. I had expected a hard contest and </seg>
            <seg id="p643">NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK BREEDERS AND FEEDERS ASSOCIATION my expectation held true. It was a great contest throughout, although it did not prove as successful as we had hoped. After the contest, a luncheon was given at the Saddle and Sir - loin Club for all contestants and their coaches. At this time, the re - sults were given and Minnesota was the victor. Wisconsin and Ne - braska held a tie for seventh place. Now that the contest was over, we planned to see some of the city sights. Due to street congestion, it was everything but enjoyable. Whether it was because it was Saturday, or if there is such a crowd every day, I do not know. Sunday morning the Nebraska delegation arrived and it also marked the beginning of the nationally known 4-H Club Congress. We were assembled at 11:00 A. M. to attend church service at Central Church, located in Orchestra Hall. For the afternoon program we were taken for a tour of the city, all important and interesting places being visited. The tour extended from the richest section of Chicago to the poorest, known as the ghetto. It was very interesting to notice the wide con - trast between the two places. In the richer section we were shown many places of distinction as the Wrigley Building, Tribune Tower, and the McCormick residence. A first good view was had of Lake Michigan along with Navy Pier. Several parks, including Lincoln Park, were visited. I had no idea such a fine group of parks could be found in such a city. The International Live Stock Exposition was visited for the first time Monday. The building which houses this great show is worthy of the title it holds. The amphitheater which surrounds the huge arena, has a capacity of 12,000 people. Here at the show one could find stock from almost every corner of the U. S. along with some parts of Canada. By the courtesy of Sears Roebuck and Company, we were given a luncheon at the Stock Yards Inn. In the afternoon, all representa - tives were assembled before the 4-H Club building for dedicating exer - cises, the old building having been destroyed in the great stock yards fire. After the dedication, motor coaches were boarded for the Wilson packing plant. Entertainment was furnished us by moving pictures in the Thomas E. Wilson auditorium. At six o'clock we were requested to leave to attend a dinner provided by the host. From the banquet table we were again taken to the auditorium for additional entertain - ment. Other guests present were a few of the prominent sports people as Red Grange and Charlie Grimm. To meet such personages was a thrill to many of us. On our return trip to the International, </seg>

Tuesday's program found the boys and girls in separate groups, the boys visiting the Swift and Armour plants, and the girls, the Chi - cago Mail Order Company. Following is the program followed by the boys. Arriving at Swift and Company, we were given as great a breakfast as anyone could wish for. An educational tour was then taken through the plant. The entire process of slaughtering was viewed from the time the animals were killed until they were storing in the cooling rooms. Previous reading had informed me somewhat of the process, but it was very vague compared to seeing the process. We were each given souvenirs and sent to the Sherman Hotel as guests of the National Live Stock Marketing Association. At 2:15 P. M. a trip was made to the Merchandise Mart, which has the distinction of being the largest building in the world at the present time. As we entered the building, the first thought that entered our minds was what a thrill it would be to skate down one of those halls, approximately two blocks in length. A guide was furnished and we were taken up through the building until we seached the top. An excellent view of Chicago was obtained from the roof of the building. Points of interest were pointed out. Among these were Wrigley Build - ing, Tribune Tower, Grain Exchange, and Lindbergh beacon on the Palmolive.Building. The Mart is devoted entirely to wholesale business and built at a cost of 34 million dollars. We were given a view of the NBS studies, which are located in this same building. Six P. M. found the delegation at the annual 4-H banquet held at the Stevens Hotel. At this gathering, the national winners in different projects were introduced. Wednesday was known as manufacturer's day and an educational tour was arranged through the McCormick works. In the tractor plant we were shown all the operations before the finished product appears. The International Harvester Company provided luncheon that noon. Wednesday evening the Museum of Science and Industry was kept open for the exclusive visit of 4-H Club members. All of the greatest and most useful inventions and products of science are housed in this institution. At every display there was a guide to provide an ex - planation and go through the process of operation. A very interesting trip was taken through an imitative coal mine. Although not a work - able mine, all the processes of mining may be viewed. Thursday marked the end of the Congress. Boys and girls were again placed in separate groups. The boys visited the animal exhibits, </seg>

Afterwards we were at liberty to look at any exhibits we wished for the remainder of our stay. Next we were given the privilege of watching the sun, moon, and other planets go about in the Adler planetarium. It is remarkable how such a machine could be devised to show every planet in their correct places. For those desiring it, luncheon was served at the Field Museum. Immediately afterwards a trip was made to the Shedd Equarium and then to the Chicago Zoological Park. Ten thirty o'clock found the Nebraska delegation departing for home. 1 had a great week's entertainment and truthfully say it is the greatest trip I have ever taken. One may acquire benefits by visit - ing such a city, but one may receive more of an educational trip by traveling with such a group. IVAN SCHROEDER, Albion, Nebraska. AXXCAIi MEETING OF NEBRASKA MYE STOCK itKKKDERS AND FEEDERS ASS'X. January 1O, 1035 President D. M. Hildebrand called the meeting to order at l°-20 P. M. Secretary Derrick read the minutes of the last annual meeting. The minutes were approved. Secretary Derrick read the summarized treas - urer's report, which report was made a record. The election of officers then followed: R. L.

WERNER, Department of Horticulture, Uni. of Nebr. The rotation plots consist of a series of one, three and five year rotations located on three different fields. The plots within each of these fields are identical as to crops, crop sequence and cultural prac - tices but the soil type upon which they are located differs. A major part of the soil at the farm is mapped as a Rosebud very fine sandy loam. This particular soil type predominates in Box Butte County, comprising about 34% of the cultivated land of this county. The surface soil of this series is uniformly dark brown to grayish black in color and has an average depth of about 12 inches. Variations in the subsoil are responsible for a division into two phases, one in which the subsoil is sandier or lighter in texture than the surface, and a second in which the subsoil is heavier than the surface. Field one is located on the heavier phase with a subsoil heavier than the surface. In field two the subsoil is lighter in texture than the surface. Field three is located on a fine sandy loam of the Rose - bud series. This surface soil is a little coarser than the others with but very little difference in texture between the surface and subsoil. The continuous rotations are planted to the same crop each year. Of the three year group we have one with spring grain, corn and po - tatoes, a second, two years small grain and potatoes, third two years sweet clover and potatoes and a fourth with one year spring grain, one year beans and then potatoes. There are six rotations of the five year group. One has two years of spring grain, with a year of corn between them and another year of corn preceding potatoes; another has four years small grain and po - tatoes; a third has three years small grain and one year summer fallow and potatoes; a fourth has three years small grain, one year corn and potatoes; a fifth has two years spring grain, two years sweet clover and potatoes and a sixth has one year spring grain, two years sweet clover, one year corn and potatoes. Thus there are rotations of differ - ent lengths with various crops preceding potatoes. The primary object in growing potatoes is to produce a high yield of tubers of number one size and quality.

            <seg id="p653">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION in the five year rotations did not cause any great differences in yield or relative rank. In the three year rotations containing cultivated crops yields were less than in comparable five year rotations but greater than in five year rotations that did not contain cultivated crops. When considered on the basis of yield of potatoes of #1 size the relative positions of the five year rotations was slightly improved. Their position improves still further when yields are figured on the basis of prime potatoes — that is when all defective potatoes are removed. Scab is very serious in the short rotations and is responsible for much less in grading. In an extreme drouth year such as 1934 the only rotations that pro - duced anything like an approach to satisfactory yields were those in which a cultivated crop preceded potatoes. In this year even these rotations did not produce very well in comparison with the summer fallow rotation, which was the only one that produced a worthwhile •quantity of #1 size potatoes. . THE POTATO AND ITS USES OP SOIIi MOISTURE UNDER IRRIGATION By LESLIE BOWEN, Assistant Irrigation Engineer, Bureau of Agricultural Engineering United States Department of Agriculture The light sandy soil of North Platte Valley is very suitable for growing potatoes. When they are properly irrigated and kept free of disease and insect pests, potatoes, if cropped consistently, provide a profitable means of obtaining ready cash to meet the annual needs of the irrigation farmer. The soils of this valley may be grouped in two general classes: the lighter soils — sands and sandy loams — such as are found on the bench lands; and the heavier, or clay and clay loams, such as are found in the river valley. Each of these soils has its own characteristics a.nd when managed properly produces good crops. With regard to the amounts of water which the soils of the valley retain, the sands and sandy loams, because of their coarse texture retain small amounts in comparison with the heavier clays. In general the sandy soils when completely saturated hold approximately 2.50 to 3.0 inches of water per foot for the upper four feet. Of this amount </seg>
            <seg id="p654">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE about 1.25 to 1.75 inches is available for plant use. The heavier soils, such as the clays and clay loams, being of much finer texture, hold more moisture. The water-holding capacities of these clays vary from 3.5 to 4.5 inches per foot of depth. Of this amount there is perhaps 2 to 2.5 inches available for plant use. The presence of humus or organic matter in a soil increases its capacity to retain moisture. Whether or not the addition of barn - yard manure in such quantities as are commonly applied is of much significance in increasing the water-holding capacity of soils is ques - tionable. Results obtained at the Experiment Farm to date indicate that where manure is applied every third or sixth year, it has little effect on the capacity of the soil to hold water. The absorptive power of the soil, or the rate at which water enters it, varies considerably. Usually water enters sandy soil more rapidly than the clays. Besides the type of soil, there are many factors which affect the rate of absorption, the following being some of the more important: (1) the slope of the land and its state of cultivation; (2) the amount of water in the soil at the time of irrigation; (3) the method of irrigation; and (4) the crop grown and the stage of growth. With any given soil the steeper the slope the less rapidly does it absorb water and the greater is the amount of runoff. Leveling, culti - vation, and mulching aid materially in getting water into soils on areas with more or less heavy slopes. With regard to the amount of moisture in the soil at the time of irrigation in this valley there are certain soils, which if permitted to become depleted of their moisture, "absorb water very slowly. Several instances have been noted where water, after running over the surface for 8 to 10 hours had penetrated to an average depth of only 2 % feet. Reasons for such slow absorp - tion are difficult to explain. It may be that the soils in question con - tain excessive amounts of lime and calcareous materials. These exert a cementing effect which makes the soils impervious to water. Addition of organic matter may aid in breaking down this imperviousness. Such soils should be irrigated frequently. Methods employed in irrigation affect the rate at which water enters the soil. In this valley irrigation is accomplished by means of furrows and flooding. Of these flooding is perhaps the more effi - cient. With flood irrigation, so as to permit uniform water-spreading the lands should be leveled to a reasonably smooth surface and of uni - form slope. By flooding, when properly done, the entire soil surface is covered with a sheet of water. This insures all surface soil par - ticles of being wetted and in contact with water for the duration of the run, such a practice materially adding to the rate of absorption. With the furrow method of irrigation the lands need not be leveled </seg>
            <seg id="p655">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION to the same degree of smoothness as is desirable for flooding. How - ever, time spent in properly grading the field is of material benefit and greatly reduces the amount of labor involved in managing the water at the time of irrigation. With furrow irrigation only a portion of the Boil is covered with water, the total surface depending upon, the spacing of the furrows; then, too, some difficulty is encountered in getting an equal amount of water flowing into each furrow. As a} rule, row crops, such as beets, potatoes, corn, beans, etc., are irrigated by the furrow method, while with wheat, alfalfa, barley,, etc., flooding is usually practiced. With such row crops as beets and, potatoes, as the season advances and the plants become larger, their leaves and vines drop and hug the ground and those in the furrows ob - struct the flow of water during the irrigation. Under such conditions the furrow method of irrigation approaches flooding. With either method of irrigation, where the lengths of "runs" or "lands" for water - ing are too long there results over-irrigation application of too much water at the upper end, while the lower end is being under-irrigated. Suitable lengths of runs for most conditions in this valley would be from 400 to 600 feet. Lateral movement of water in the soils of this Valley is more or less limited. To add a given amount of water to the soil requires more time with furrows than is necessary with the practice of flooding. Data collected during the past three years indicate that on the bench lands where potatoes are grown the soil absorbs water at the rate of about 1.4 inches per hour. Fundamentally the main purpose of irrigation is to supply needed moisture to the soil around the roots of plants. Irrigation is necessary and usually only practiced in localities where rainfall is not sufficient for crop production. Under irrigation and with an adequate supply of water it should be possible to control the soil moisture within the limits of beneficial amounts for proper plant growth at all times, and there should be no excuse for retarding plant growth due to shortage of moisture. From the fact that it is possibble for moisture to be sup - plied as needed, crop production under irrigation farming is more certain and the yield per acre is greatly in excess of that which could be hoped for under conditions where production is entirely dependent upon a limited rainfall. In order to have some understanding of how much water to apply and when to apply it requires some knowledge as to how much water a particular soil will hold, how much and at what time the particular crop requires the most water, and from what depth the plants do most of their feeding. There is a definite quantity which may be stored in a given soil at any one time. With crops there is considerable </seg>

By months this water was used as follows: for the period June 17 to 30, 4.5 per cent or about .6 inch; for the month of July, 22% per cent, or about 3.1 inches; for August, 40 per cent or 5.6 inches; for September, some 33 per cent or about 4.6 inches.

' Pi Kill 3/7 years the crop has usually been planted around June 15-20, and killing frosts have occurred during the latter part of September. These data indicate that the potato uses most of its water during August. Another interesting point brought out by the moisture studies is the depth at which the potato does its feeding. Assuming that use of moisture is an index of root activity, data collected to date indicate that some 56 per cent of all the water used was taken from the first foot of depth; 23 per cent from depth 1 to 2 feet; 13 per cent from depth 2 to 3 feet; and 8 per cent from depth 3 to 4 feet. Prom the above it is apparent that potatoes are shallow-rooted plants, and the bulk or about 80 per cent of their feeding is done in the upper two feet of soil, and that only 8 per cent of the water con - sumed by the potato in making its growth is taken from beyond three feet beneath the surface. With these points in mind it would appear that in irrigation of the potato crop one should endeavor to keep the </seg>
            <seg id="p658">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE upper strata of soil reasonably well supplied with moisture at all times. In order to do this right, frequent applications of water should be made. In crop production, in theory at least, the water requirements on a light sandy soil should not exceed those of a heavy clay soil. More water is applied to porous soils mainly because of the greater percentage wasted. As was mentioned previously, the lighter soils retain little water per unit volume compared with the heavier soils. When too much water is applied the excess soon penetrates downward to depths beyond the feeding zone of the potato plants and is forever lost to the crop. Since water is the common solvent for plant food, it is only reasonable to expect that large amounts of valuable plant food are leached out by excessive applications of water. Particularly is this true with respect to many of the well-drained upland bench soils. In order to make their land more productive many farmers go to considerable expense to properly fertilize their acreage, by adding barnyard manure, phosphate, lime and other commercial fertilizers. These are added for the use of the plants, but, unfortunately, when irrigation water is made available many irrigators in their efforts to irrigate their crops properly apply at each irrigation excessive quan - tities of water. At times considerably more water is added than the soils can hold. An amount that is greater than the soil will retain drains away, and in so doing carries large amounts of plant food. Such practices are wasteful of water and fertilizer, not to mention the time spent in irrigation. In practicing irrigation the farmer should remember that the part of the soil in which the roots function is merely a reservoir, used to store water temporarily for the use of the crop. The capacity of this soil reservoir is limited; it depends upon the type of soil and the depth to which the plants root. In applying water one should not add an amount too much in excess of what the soil will hold. On porous sandy soils, such as the bench lands, water can be stored, for plant use, only at the rate of about 1.5 inches per foot of depth, or a total of 6 inches in the upper four feet of soil. Where attempts are made to add 8, 10, and even 15 inches of water with one irrigation, there is certain to be a loss. The amount of loss will be just that amount of water that is in excess of what the soil will hold. Adding water to the soil may be likened to adding gasoline to the gas tank - the tank will hold only so much and no more; 15 gallons can nol be crowded into a 10 -gallon tank at one filling. When the tank is filled the surplus gasoline spills on the ground. So it is with apply - ing water to the soil: when the soil is filled the surplus water spills and seeps away. Where underdrainage is good irrigators are perhaps not aware of this excess water. In cases where underdrainage is poor and bogged areas appear on the lands to which the water was applied </seg>
            <seg id="p659">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION or those in the vicinity, then one is aware that water has been used more or less freely. Since the potato is a shallow-rooting plant, the greatest change or variation of moisture occurs in the upper 2 feet of depth. Prom these upper 2 feet the potato obtains about 80 per cent of the moisture required for growth. It is believed that if the upper 2 feet of soil are filled with water at each irrigation, there will be sufficient down drainage from the upper strata adequately to supply the plant wants at the lower depths. Three to four inches is all the water that should be applied at each irrigation. Best plant growth will result if there is an adequate supply of moisture in the soil at all times. Irrigation should be light and frequent. IRRIGATION OF POTATOES By W. C. EDMUNDSON, Horticulturist, U. S. Bureau of Plant Industry The method of irrigation potatoes is an important factor in potato production, and the time of application has a deciding influence on the time of setting tubers, on yield and on the quality of the tubers produced. There appears to be considerable difference of opinion regarding the proper time of making the initial and subsequent ap - plications of water. Some growers withhold the first irrigation until the plants have set tubers. Others apply the first irrigation water when the plants show a decided dark green color. Others withhold the water until the plants are stunted and show a tendency to wilt. In recent years, many growers have seen the advantage of apply - ing irrigation water as needed by the plants to make a continuous and vigorous growth. This method of irrigation has also been adopted in recent years by many of the sugar beet growers with good results. Irrigation studies have been conducted at the Colorado Potato Experiment Station 1 at Greeley for many years under conditions very similar to yours, and it is believed that the results will apply to grow - ing potatoes under irrigation in the Scottsbluff section. During my discussion, the application of water as the plants re - quire it, to make a vigorous growth throughout the growing season, 'The work of the station is conducted by the IT. S. Bureau of Plant Industry in cooperation with Weld County through the County com - missioners, and with, the State of Colorado through the State College of Agriculture. </seg>
            <seg id="p660">REPORT OF XE3RASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE will be termed "early irrigation," and withholding the first applica - tion until the growth of the plants is checked, "late irrigation". The first irrigation in the early irrigated plots at the Station la usually applied in the first week of July, the exact time of applica - tion depending on soil moisture rainfall, and seasonal conditions. The first irrigation water is generally applied to the late irrigated plots the last of July or the first week in August. Soil temperatures recorded at a depth of three and one-half inches indicate that early irrigation will reduce the soil temperature from one to three degrees. Some growers have claimed that the early applications of water have a tendency to cause plants to set a larger number of tubers per hill. Irrigation studies at the Station show very little difference in the total number of tubers per hill from plants receiving the initial irri - gation, early or late in the season. Early irrigation has, however, given a slight increase in the num - ber of tubers above one and seven-eighths inches in diameter. Early irrigated plants set their tubers earlier than those irrigated late. At the Experimental Station in Greeley, Triumph is planted for the late crop at about the same time as is the practice in the Scotts - bluff section — from June 10th to June 20th. Early irrigated Triumph potatoes planted at this time usually have a good set of tubers about August 5th to 10th, whereas the late irrigated plot of Triumph does not form tubers until about ten days later. Early irrigated Rural potatoes planted about June 1st set tubers about the middle of August, whereas those irrigated late set tubers about ten days later. In 1934 the setting of tubers was delayed at the Station and in all commercial fields in which the soil did not have a good moisture con - tent. The late setting of tubers resulted in low yields and immature potatoes at time of harvest. The results of eight years' study with early, medium early, and late irrigation, were published in September, 1929 in the U. S. De - partment of Agriculture Technical Bulletin No. 118. The average yield of the early irrigated plots of Rural for eight years was 313.2 bushels per acre. The medium early irrigated plots produced 290 bushels, and the late irrigated plots produced but 23 G. 4 bushels per acre for the same period, or a difference between the early and late irri - gated plots of 76.S bushels in favor of the early irrigation. Studies with light, vs. heavy applications of water indicate that the potato plant does not require heavy applications of water in order to produce maximum yields. The plots receiving heavy and light ap - plications of water were planted, cultivated, irrigated and in every way handled in the same manner except in quantity of water at each </seg>
            <seg id="p661">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION irrigation, the amount being governed by the condition of the soil in the row. Where little water was applied, it was allowed to run until the soil in the row under the hills became moist, or sufficient water was added at frequent intervals to enable the plants to make a con - tinuous and vigorous growth. The plots given heavy applications with each watering were irrigated until the soil was fairly wet around the tubers, the water usually being run about twice the length of time in the heavy irrigated plots. For the three-year period that this experiment was conducted, the yields were practically the same. The lightly irrigated plots produced a total yield of 375.96 bushels per acre and the heavily irrigated plots produced a total yield of 375.26. Plots receiving the heavy applications of water were not irrigated to the extent of saturating the ground above the tubers or excluding the air. Heavy irrigation of potatoes frequently causes protruding lenticels on the tubers, and inferior quality. Heavy irrigation late in the season often causes heavy infection of rhizoctonia and scab. In the Greeley section, flea bettle injury or "worm track" Is much more severe on tubers grown on wet soil. Owing to insufficient snow fall and spring rains, together witn drying winds such as have occurred this spring, or continued hot weather before planting, it sometimes becomes necessary to irrigate the land before planting, or to irrigate up to insure germination, li spring plowing has been delayed, the land may be irrigated and plowed shortly before planting. This will be found to be very successful. Plowed ground is sometimes furrowed, or ditched, and irrigated be - fore planting, but as a general rule, if the soil lacks sufficient moisture to germinate the seed pieces, the moisture is not applied until after planting. When seed of a liberal size is used, and planting is suf - ficiently deep, sturdy sprouts may develop from the moisture in the seed piece, and the sprouts maintain their vigor for some time, but moisture must be available before root growth of the sprouts can develop. The practice of irrigating up the crop after planting must be done very carefully or the Beed will decay. The method which has been found to be most successful at the Greeley Station is to irrigate until the moisture reaches the seed piece or the sprout, but suspend irrigation before the soil above the seed piece becomes wet. Or, in other words, allow the soil above the seed to remain dry. This method has resulted in good germination, with little seed piece decay. Early irrigation has not only given an increased yield of tubers, but early irrigation has also improved the quality of the tubers. </seg>

The larger starch con - tent, no doubt, was due to the fact that the tubers in the early irri - gated plots were more matured at the time of harvest. Owing to the variation in the water holding capacity of different soils, the influence of temperature, rainfall and seasonal conditions, it is realized that it is impossible to prescribe a date on which the first irrigation should be applied, the number of irrigations or the exact time when the last irrigation should be given, but it is believed that the following general rule can be followed with good success: Apply the first irrigation water whenever the plants seem to re - quire it in order to make a continuous, vigorous growth. After the first irrigation, keep the soil moist during the remainder of the season by light, frequent irrigations until about the first week in September. A good method of determining the quantity of water required for each irrigation is to test the soil at the base of the stem, or 8 inches </seg>

Plants supplied with proper moisture should appear vigorous and have the foliage color typical of the variety. Lack of moisture in the soil causes the plant to become dark, whereas an oversupply of moisture causes foliage to assume a lighter color than is normal for the variety. PRESENT DAY PROBLEMS IX MARKETING POTATOES OWEN FRANK, Scottsbluff, Nebraska This is a presentation of the high-lights of the situation as it appears to a grower and relating particularly to the problem of the North Platte Valley. It would seem that the sale of this product in a general way is influenced by the proverbial law of supply and de - mand as it is apparent from government statistics. We note that under the stimulus of reports of short crops that prices advance and they recede when production is heavy. However, we have discovered that due to the inaccuracy of these reports and to other factors such as the use of substitute vegetables and general consumer buying power that too much reliance cannot be given or at least has not always been justified from these reports. This rule of supply and demand also seems to be true when there is a shortage in a variety such as the Triumph, even though other varieties are selling at abnormally low prices as was the case last season. While much of this was due to the demand for Triumph seed of which the supply was limited by drouth, it is also true some buyers will pay a premium for special commercial potatoes that are scarce in order to get them. Triumphs selling at the shipping point for a dollar or a dollar and a quarter pev cwt. are after all a relatively cheap food as compared to other food commodities. The forcing on the market of extra large supplies of a product and the invariable insistance of buyers at such times that the shipper "shave" his price so that the buyer can make a little more immediate profit is largely responsible for drops in values. This is not the only reason for shrinkage in prices but it is of such paramount importance that a concerted effort is being put forth for governmental restrictions of the amount of potatoes that may be marketed so that supply wiil be in line with reasonable demand. Potato marketing has been subject to some remarkable changes </seg>
            <seg id="p664">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE since the period prior to 1928. We can recall that it was a common practice In a normal crop year to sell practically the entire crop out of the field at good prices. This was largely possible because of the speculative storing of much of the crops in the consuming centers. Within the last several years several factors have combined to change this practice. In the first place potatoes are being grown over a more extensive area and by a larger number of farmers. The low prices of other crops such as sugar beets on irrigated lands and wheat in dry areas has had the effect of putting some of this land into potatoes. Almost every potato growing section in the United States has expanded in potato growing. Yields have been increased because of better seed and fertilizer. At the same time competitive vegetables and eating habits have reduced the consumption of potatoes from the amount that they were formerly utilized. , This has had the effect of increasing the competition between different districts for markets, as a result of this, quality must be furnished or the crop is not readily salable. For this reason every reasonable device that this section can use to better the quality must be employed to increase the reputation of our potatoes. Triumph potatoes which is the specialized crop grown here, Is a type that requires the very best of handling to reduce bruising and feathering so that these potatoes may compare in appearance with other potatoes at market displays. Growers should realize that dry rot which comes from this bruising will probably develop and appear much worse on the counter than it appears when shipped. Frost and sun-scald damage is often so serious as to greatly reduce the market - ability of the Triumph potato especially when the weather is warm during shipment or if there is a delay in sale in a warm climate. A bruised, scabby, ill-sorted or damaged car of potatoes packed in bags bearing a Nebraska brand is likely to hurt the sale of a large number of cars of our good potatoes. Incidentally if it is necessary or desir - able to ship out such potatoes we should be careful not to pack them in bags labeled with a Nebraska brand. The merchant or consumer is too often prone to associate such poor potatoes aB being the type that is produced in this district. It is to combat this situation that Federal inspection of all our potatoes has been advocated. Federal inspection also has the further advantage to a shipper that it avoids lawsuits over the quality of potatoes shipped. The low cost for this service which works both to improve quality and to afford insurance against the rejection of the shipment, should not deter us in utilizing inspection. Every shipper and grower has an incentive to send out potatoes that are a credit to them. Their future business depends upon a maintenance of good-will thru the satisfaction that the product is as represented, moreover, a reputation for shipment of high quality potatoes in a specially branded sack is one that gives them a better </seg>
            <seg id="p665">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION market and higher prices than they would other wise receive. It has been indicated this year that well sorted packs have brought as much as fifty cents premium over the average potatoes at the point of des - tination. In this vicinity the poor run of potatoes sold locally have brought not over fifty cents at a time when car lot potatoes of good quality were bringing a dollar. At a meeting recently held a buyer who carefully grades and ships his product under a special quality brand objected to the universal inspection for the farmer. A farmer asked this pertinent question "If this practice is a good thing for you why isn't it a good thing for the farmer to do the same thing?' 1 This logic should appeal to every grower who is looking forward to the successful marketing of potatoes in this section. One item of inspection that has not been stressed heretofore which seems important is that the grower should receive a notification from the inspector informing him of his grade and the approximate per - centage of defects. A low grade on a car is not relished by anyone and is the surest method of focusing the attention of the farmer on the fact that certain defects of growing and sorting and packing should be corrected if he is to stay in the potato business. Careful grading and inspection of our potatoes should tend to make buying competition keener and also stimulate a better demand in the con - suming centers. A second consideration of the grower in marketing his potatoes is to foster competition for them at the loading point. This competi - tion is materially advanced by the use of co-operative associations which tend to make the farmer independent of those buyers who are short-term speculators. These speculative buyers having better marketing information than the average farmer are in a good position to depress prices to the grower unless he has the advantage of his own marketing organization. One of the knotty problems of the grower as well as of others habitually engaged in the selling of potatoes is due to the increasing use of commercial trucks on our improved highways. Ignoring the detriment of this transportation to the railroads and the communities dependent on them for taxes, or the possible favorable fact that truck competition may be a cause in keeping down freight rates especially on short hauls, it is pretty well established that many of these trucks are a demoralizing factor in maintaining the stability of potato markets. This is particularly the case with the itinerant trucker who in most cases peddles his cargo. Carlot buyers in consuming centers are pretty well informed as to the price that they must have to "come out" on a purchase of potatoes and are not keen for destructive competi - tion among themselves. This is not true of most itinerant truckers. They make no computation for depreciation of equipment and are not </seg>
            <seg id="p666">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE patient to get prices that might he justified. As a consequence, they will "dump" a lot of potatoes under the current prices and create an impression in the minds of consumers that this "dump" price is the proper quotation. Naturally the car-lot dealer and merchant is discouraged from contracting any more potatoes than can be sold immediately and even then they are resistent to prices because of the almost certain outlook for this "down" market due to this truck competition. Since most of our local grown potatoes have to be sold via car-lots it is evident that our growers are not profiting from this situation. Some states are imposing regulations upon trucks to help equalize this condition. If truckers of this kind are to buy our product at the same figures as car lot prices, growers are contrib - uting to the demoralization of their markets. As a natural consequence of the keen competition of various dis - tricts and truck competition, which promotes hand to mouth buying, more and more of the storage of potatoes is being forced on to the grower at his farm. Speculative buying is stifled and buyers will not take potatoes until they are urgently needed. This emphasizes the maintenance of good cellars and storage conditions. Another factor that growers must reckon with and practice ia orderly marketing. As a rule there are certain slack periods in the demand, when potatoes do not readily move, but generally during the shipping season there are active periods that should not be ignored as we have found out to our detriment, even in years when potatoes have been reported as a short crop. Too many farmers seem to be the rankest kinds of optimists when markets are advancing and the worst pessimists when they break. In the first instance they may be per - mitting some other producing section to get the control of a market by their reluctance to sell and in the second place, when the market goes down, they tend to depress the average market by an insistance to sell regardless of price. The best plan is to space the marketing of car lots and forget about being smart enough to estimate the top price. Here are some random ideas that are worth mentioning. Special packs such as open mesh bags and fifty pound bags are increasingly used in many stores to facilitate sales. If enough premium can be gained by the use of such packs this may he a profitable ven - ture for a limited number of growers who have special facilities. However if the potatoes are neatly sacked in new branded bags it would seem at the present time that this would be sufficient. Too much elaborate cost on a product such as potatoes may not give adequate returns for the investment especially if too many under - take it. </seg>
            <seg id="p667">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION The practice of stores, especially chain stores, of making a loss leader out of potatoes is probably as much or more than a contribut - ing factor to depressed prices for our growers of potatoes than the itinerant trucker. The federal codes have sought to cope with this problem of manifestly ruinous competition. A farmer should not hesitate to remonstrate with any merchant who solicits trade by this practice. Various sections seem to demand different sizes of potatoes. As a rule the country districts are content to take the larger sizes but Chi - cago for instance is partial to a size not larger than three and a half inches diameter. Closer planting in rich soil will get away from less desirable large tubers. Many cafes are equipped with peeling machines and they want potatoes that are free from knobs, smooth and shallow eyed. This last specification is hard to fulfill in a healthy Triumph. A bripht color such as the Triumph has is attractive to buyers and is a favorable quality for the sale of red potatoes. The increasing use of our potatoes both for table and seed pur - poses is a tribute to the good sense of many people that it doesn't make any difference whether water is directed on a field with a shovel or drops out of clouds; it takes so much water to grow a potato. How - ever there are still a few people who believe that a potato crop will fail if they are not planted on Good Friday. In our irrigated section care must be exercised that rotation is practiced and that we keep our fields planted with good foundation certified seed at frequent intervals so as to keep away from diseases that progressively develop in every locality. Often objection is made to the red varieties of potatoes in the con - suming centers because they may be watery. We know that this is probably due to immaturity and a further defect in such potatoes is that they feather and air check easily. It might be a good idea to get away from this trouble by planting a little earlier and by the use of earlier maturing Triumph seed. This seed yields less but if the quality is improved this is the consideration that should govern especially if a restricted marketing program is put into effect. The fact that most of our growers are planting good seed and are eager to utilize better practices in growing and marketing would seem to be the encouraging factor that augurs well for the North Platte Valley as a potato producing district. </seg>
            <seg id="p668">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE THE PRESENT ECONOMIC POSITION OF THE POTATO CROP E. P. McKUNE, Senior Marketing Specialist United States Department of Agriculture Your committee has asked me to speak on the subject, "The Present Economic Position of the Potato Crop". Since I am not an economist, it has been necessary for me to contact economists for much of the material used in this discussion. I am especially indebted to Dr. O. E. Baker, Senior Agricultural Economist of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, Washington, to Professor C. H. Metzger of the Department of Horticulture, Fort Collins, and Professor Henry H. Bakken of the Experiment Station of the University of Wisconsin. There has never been a period in the history of the potato indus - try in Nebraska when it is more important for growers to examine their production and marketing methods than the present time. There have been many changes develop in the industry during the past few years and it is going to take time to make adjustments to meet these changes. The growers that is able to make these adjustments in his pro - duction and marketing methods and make them quickly will surely find it to his decided advantage. A study of the economic position of the potato crop reveals a num - ber of interesting facts, some of which are not pleasant. They do not, however, indicate a hopeless situation or a condition that cannot be remedied or corrected. Your Program Committee has advised me to state the facts as I see them. They feel that you should know the truth about the potato situation regardless of whether it is pleasant to hear, or possibly a little discouraging. To get the picture before you as clearly as possible, I plan to divide my discussion into three parts, namely, the past, the present and possibly a glimpse into the future as portrayed by our economists who have a maze of figures at their disposal. The first part of the discussion — "The Past" — is, of course, well known to all and there is little that can be said that you do not already know. However, it may be possible to point out some of the economic causes for the conditions that we have experienced. The past few years have witnessed a material reduction in' tne per capita consumption of potatoes in the United States. This has been brought about through a number of causes. Some of these </seg>
            <seg id="p669">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION causes have been the direct result of economic conditions; others are the result of the changing of the habits of the consumer. The depression lessened the buying power of a great many people, forcing them to exist on only the bare necessities of life. It has also caused these consumers to substitute other commodities for potatoes when such could be purchased more cheaply. The foreign countries formerly using a large amount of our food products have practically ceased to import. This leaves us with food supplies, formerly exported, to dispose of in our home markets. With the buying public's purchasing power limited and our food exports practically stopped, there has been a constant effort on the part of all food distributors to make the public conscious of their particular food product through advertising and other means. This has caused the potato consumers to substitute other foods for potatoes even though it may not mean economy. It is a well established fact that the human being can consume only about so much food. It has been estimated that we, as individuals, eat annually approximately 2100 pounds of food of various kinds. The yearly per capita consumption of potatoes in the United States since 1870 has averaged slightly more than two and one-half bushels, or approximately one hundred and sixty-five pounds, which means that potatoes constitute only about seven per cent of the total foods consumed by the average person. With this percentage as small as it is, any substitutions of other food products for potatoes has a decided effect on the potato consump - tion as a whole. A very instructive chart has been worked out from the United States Department of Agriculture records based on ten years' aver - ages, dating back to 1870. This chart, when studied, reveals a num - ber of interesting facts. While it does not indicate anything that is new, it does confirm some of the things we have known. </seg>

Alter that date the per capita consumption has decreased at a much faster rate than it had increased. (See Fig. 5). The average acreage yield shows a rather rapid increase, indicat - ing better cultural methods and a general concerted effort on the part of producers to increase their profits by increasing their per acreage yields. While we are on the subject of consumption of potatoes, it may be interesting to study a table showing the per capita consumption by nationalities. This table is a part of the information found in a research bulletin recently published by the experiment station of the University of Wisconsin. Mr. Henry H. Bakken, in this bulletin, has made a survey showing the consumption habits, customs, needs, and preferences of consumers of Wisconsin potatoes. This table results from the canvassing of two hundred and sixty-five families of common origin and those classing themselves as American.

            <seg id="p671">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION Mr. Bakken states that a check from reliable statistics pertaining to the per capita consumption of European nations shows a close correla - tion to the order in ranking of the list except, of course the per capita consumption in some of the European nations is much greater than it is in this country. in coming to tne second part of this discussion — "The Present," I consider "the present" as the year just passed and the season that is just beginning. The growers of Triumph potatoes, especially in this particular lo - cality, have held an enviable position this past season in the potato industry as far as prices are concerned. It is true that the dry land sections had practically a crop failure, and the yields in irrigated sec - tions were greatly reduced. Yet the prices, because of the limited supply of Triumphs, has been exceptionally high in comparison with prices received in other parts of the United States. You have secured premiums amounting to fifty cents to one dollar per hundredweight over other varieties. In some instances this has amounted to approxi - mately three times the amount per hundredweight received by growers in other states. The cause, as you have realized, was an abnormal situation, and one we cannot hope to have repeated soon. The almost luxury prices paid for Nebraska Triumphs this year indicate that they hold an enviable position in the markets of our nation. In spite of the fact that Nebraska has disposed of practically all of the 1934 crop of Triumphs at good prices, a situation has developed that should be at least considered. In describing this situation, I am not giving my own opinion or fears, but actual conditions that Ne - braska potato distributors have been faced with this season, especially within the past few months. Markets normally using large quantities of Nebraska Triumphs have found that White or Russet potatoes produced in other states can be substituted at a much less cost. Fear has been expressed that our normal Triumph consumers may be hard to win back, unless we meet this new competition with a quality that is equal to or better than the substitute. The general trend of all potato producing sections seems to be to improve quality and increase the acreage yield. This has been the natural result of competition and other economic problems. The Nebraska certified seed potato growers have been able to meet the quality problems in an excellent manner much better than the table stock growers have been able to do. The increased yield per acre problem has not kept pace with other districts, possibly because of the large acreage in the dry land area. </seg>
            <seg id="p672">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In preparing this discussion I contacted authorities in Colorado, California and Minnesota and secured from them statements as to average and unusual yields. A few of these figures may be of interest to you. Colorado advises that they have eighty-three members in their Six Hundred Bushel Club. This club was organized approximately eight years ago. The largest yield recorded in Colorado was produced by L. G. Schutte. This acre produced 1147 bushels of the Brown Beauty variety. The largest acre yield of Triumphs was produced by John Gredig of Del Norte. This measured acre produced 10G0 bushels. California reports that the Shatter district averages approximately 1S5 hundredweight sacks per acre with yields running as high as SOU hundredweight sacks to the acre. The Delta district averages ap - proximately 130 hundredweight sacks to the acre. The first two sec - tions produce principally the "Pride of Wisconsin" variety. The last section specializes in the "Russet Burbank" variety. California also claims the world record on production of 1156 bushels on a measured acre. Minnesota reported that the drought had had a decided effect on yields in that state. The Red River valley normally averages 100 bushels or more to the acre, with yields as high as 175 bushels to the acre. In the Sandland area, under normal conditions, the yields are approximately 200 bushels per acre with yields as high as 400 bushels. It has been my experience when examining fields of high yields to find that the quality is always consistently better than the quality on average or low per acre yields. The subject of making potatoes one of the basic commodities under the Agricultural Adjustment Act is a very live topic of today. This will be ably discussed later in the program by a speaker who is well versed on the subject. It is not my purpose to make any remarks oa the subject except to state in passing that should potatoes become a basic commodity the producers of good quality will have a decided advantage over the growers of poor quality. In the last part of this discussion — the part that attempts to pierce the future — I am going to use information received from Dr. O. E. Baker, Senior Agricultural Economist of the Bureau of Agri - cultural Economics. Dr. Baker, in an address at the University of Nebraska during Farmers' Week, in January of this year, displayed a number of very interesting graphs and charts, many of which will be of decided interest to you. Dr. Baker has very graciously consented to permit me to use his figures, for which I am truly appreciative, for </seg>
            <seg id="p673">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION they are much more complete and accurate than any that I could have assembled. The following comments are quoted from Dr. Baker's address: "Agricultural production from 1926 to 1931 was about 50 per cent greater than at the beginning of the Twentieth Century, crop acreage was nearly 25 per cent greater, and quantity of labor em - ployed in agriculture in 1929 was 10 to 12 per cent greater. Produc - tion per acre, therefore, increased about 20 per cent, and production per man about 35 per cent. Most of this increase occurred after the War. The trend of production has been rapidly downward since 1931, owing largely to exceptional drought. The base period 1897-1901 was opulent in the relation of production to population, about one - fourth of the production being exported; as compared with one-eighth at present. Consumption per capita has been well maintained, except during the War years, when the decline in consumption was at - tributable mostly to foods, and during the depression years, when the decline is largely attributable to non-foods-cotton and flax par - ticularly." "Ten years ago the population of the United States was increasing about 1,800,000 a year. Now the increase is only 800,000. A station - ary population is approaching rapidly. The number of births has been trending downward since 1921. There are now about 9 per cent fewer children under 5 years of age than when the Census was taken nearly live years ago and 9 per cent fewer 5 to 10 years of age. The number of deaths remains almost stationary, but must- increase after a dec - ade or two, because of the rapid increase of old people." "About 360 children under 5 years of age per 1,000 women 15 to 45 years of age (childbearing age) are required to maintain popula - tion stationary at the 1930 expectation of life in the United States of 62 years. ' In 1930 the seven cities largely of American stock, lacked, therefore, about 38 per cent of having enough children to maintain their population permanently without accessions from outside, and all cities of over 100,000 population had a deficit of nearly 20 per cent, while the smaller cities had a deficit of about 6 per cent. On the other hand, the rural nonfarm (mostly village and suburban) population had a surplus of 30 per cent, and the farm population a surplus of 50 per cent. In 1932 urban deficit and rural surplus about balanced." "Birth rates are declining in northwestern Europe, which has hitherto provided the principal export market for American farm products.

Apparently this tendency is occurring wherever in - dustrialism and urbanization are important. If the trend continues, a stationary population in the industrialized countries appears very probable in a few years, which will be followed later by a declining population." "During the half century, 1880-1930, urban population in the United States increased more than fourfold. Rural non-farm popu - lation scarcely doubled, and rural farm population increased only by about a half. Practically all of this increase in farm population took place before 1900, little change in number occurring between 1900 and 1930. Looking to the future, and using Dr. Thompson's assump - tions as to births and deaths, with no net immigration from foreign lands, it appears that the urban population, under the assumption of no internal migration, will increase less than 3 per cent by 1945, and then decline slowly; rural non-farm population will increase gradually until after 1960, by which year it will be about a half. But assuming the continuation of the 1920-29 migration, urban population will continue to increase until after 1960, by which year it will be nearly 20 per cent larger than in 1930, rural non-farm population will increase about the same as if no migration occurred, while farm population will slowly but constantly decline." "The World War marked significant changes in the diet of the American people. Perhaps of equal importance was the Prohibition Amendment to the Constitution, the prosperity of the urban people during and after the War, and the food education articles and ad - vertisements in the popular magazines. The result has been a decline since the War years of about 80 pounds per person in consumption </seg>

During the depression years, 1930 and 1931, the consumption of milk continued to increase and of wheat, a cheap food, to decrease, but this trend was reversed in 1932 and 1933." "The consumption (disappearance) of fruit per person in the United States has not changed greatly, apparently, during the last thirty years. But there has been a notable shift from apples toward oranges, grapefruit, and grapes, and a greater use of the minor fruits."

The per capita consumption has been decreased through the loss of buying power and the use of substitute food products. All potato producing sections are making every effort to retain their markets by improving the quality and meeting consumers' de - mands. Our exports have been greatly reduced, leaving surpluses of all major foods to be consumed domestically. A stationary population is rapidly approaching, not only in the United States, but in the European countries, and indications are that this may be followed by a declining population.

SCTTCE IDEAS ABOUT GRADING NORTH FLATTE VALLEY POTATOES CARL THOMAS, Moville, la. When I was first informed that I was to speak on this subject I wrote Mr. II. O. Werner and asked him for some pointers on this topic, upon which he informed me that I was to discuss it entirely from my own viewpoint, so you need not expect much. In explaining. the topic I will say that the grading of North Platte Valley potatoes is entirely dependent on inspection, so I will base my talk on inspection; that is compulsory state and federal inspection. In the first place I wish to condemn the selfish interests which, I feel were responsible for the proposed potato inspection bill (which was introduced in the present legislature) being killed in the com - mittee. I feel that our representatives at Lincoln are sincere and wish to comply with the wishes of the majority of their constituents, but the selfish interests that are interested only in their own welfare and not in the future of the potato growers of Nebraska had a great num - ber of letters and telegrams sent to our representatives and naturally led them to believe that the majority of growers were opposed to in - spection, while it is doubtful whether the majority of potato growers </seg>
            <seg id="p677">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION oppose inspection. Even if the majority of growers are opposed to compulsory inspection, I still believe we need it, and in that case we must educate the growers. I recall when the individual sugar test was first introduced into our sugar beet contracts, there was much opposition to that also but the sugar company, told us that it was good for us so we must put up with it. We have no definite proof that the growers have any control over sugar content yet beets are bought on the basis of sugar content. However, we can control the quality of our potatoes to a great extent. In fact, I might say we can fully control the quality of our potatoes, and if we wish to retain our markets we must do it and unless we have compulsory inspection it will not be done. Competitors have inspection and are taking our markets. Some growers may say that our markets are as good as in other territories This may be true at present, because there is a shortage of Triumphs however next year this may not be the case, then what will we do? Now the question arises, how can we control the quality of potatoes ' This is a rather lengthy subject. In the first place the selection of seed and treating and caring for same prior to planting; also selection of ground to be planted to pota - toes. I feel that, in order to raise good quality Triumphs we must have, either alfalfa or sweet clover ground. . Next to selection of seed and ground I feel the time of planting is of paramount importance, there is some question as to what is the proper time for planting I would simply say, don't plant too early. I feel that June 15 to 20 is about right, however some years this is too late for we never know how early the frost may catch us in the fall. We may lose in yield by late planting, and may even get caught by a frost, but the late potatoes, I believe, are always better quality. Under irrigation we should irrigate immediately after planting if soil is dry and keep the potatoes growing right from the start. After the crop has been produced great care should be taken in harvesting. I have known farmers to practically stay with their potato crop day and night for four months and then ruin them while harvesting. Some of the injuries that can be avoided are: digger bruises, basket bruises, cuts, bruises from dumping into sack, bruises from rough handling of sacks, bruises from dumping into bins in cellar. The digger bruises and cuts can be avoided largely by the depth the digger is set, and by removing kickers from apron, also by using con - tinuous apron instead of dropping from one apron to the other. The </seg>
            <seg id="p678">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE digger should always carry some dirt clear over with potatoes. The basket bruises and other injuries caused from rough handling can be largely eliminated by careful handling from the time the potatoes are picked up until they are in the cellar. It is also beneficial to per - mit the potatoes to lay in the sun for a short time before picking, so that the skin may set on them. They should never be left in the sun too long however as this may cause sun scald. After the potatoes are in the cellar we still can avoid further in - jury, or rather developing of decay which is caused from slight bruises as well as major injuries. The cellar should be wet down thoroughly before the potatoes are put in, and then it should be well ventilated. The cellar should not be cooled off to quickly after the potatoes are put in, as they will heal better under warm temperature. After all possible precaution has been used in producing high quality tubers, and taking all possible care in avoiding injury during harvest and storing we must still be very careful in sorting for market if we wish to safeguard our markets. Now to get back to the subject of inspection, I hope that I have, at least to some degree, established the fact that we can, to some ex - tent, control the quality of our potatoes. My idea is that we must have compulsory inspection on all potatoes shipped, whether by truck or rail, and that inspection certificate must accompany shipment if by truck and must accompany bill of lading if shipped by rail. This will eliminate the possibility of a dealer buy - ing inferior potatoes at a reduced price and then selling them to the trade as a higher quality than what he paid for. We want inspection that will protect the dealer on the other end as well as our local dealer. Some of our local dealers oppose inspection because they feel they can deceive the grower on the grade of his potatoes, conse - quently buying them below the market, and then deceiving the dealer on the other end by selling him a better grade than he bought, consequently hurting the reputation of Nebraska potatoes. Most of the opposition to compulsory inspection seems to be on the ground that in the past there have been certain objections to in - spection as we have had it. It is contended by some, that we have had dishonest inspectors, others claim that inspection has-been too rigid, others claim that inspection has been too lenient, still others claim that inspection certificates have been changed in cars of potatoes after same were loaded; many of these objections are very likely well founded, and I positively know that there have been many well founded causes for complaint. There are however many growers who object to inspection be- </seg>
            <seg id="p679">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION ■cause they feel they can get rid of their inferior potatoes. In other words they want to sell something they wouldn't care to buy. My idea on inspection is to have, whoever we send to the next legislature express himself on the matter previous to the election thus avoiding a great deal of high powered lobbying by selfish interests. I feel that we have a potato producing section second to none, but if we don't quit tearing down our reputation instead of building it up we are doomed. We have our choice, of either adopting a strict compulsory in - spection, and abiding by it; or permitting the far-sighted competitive potato sections to take our markets. If once we lose the markets which we now have it will be difficult and expensive to regain them. I say — let us raise better potatoes, grade them better, and sell them high in the markets which we have established for North Platte Valley potatoes. SOME BOTHERSOME PESTS OF POTATOES AXD THEIR CONTROL, H. M. McLEAN, Alliance Grasshoppers Grasshoppers over winter in the egg stage, the eggs being de - posited % to 1 % inches below the surface of the ground, usually in uncultivated ground such as field margins, pasture land, roadsides and ditch banks. The eggs are laid in late September and October, hatching out in the spring. The eggs may be destroyed in the fall and winter by plowing or tilling such ground as they may be laid in to a depth of 4 inches, thus exposing them to the weather and birds. After hoppers have hatched the only effective method of control is poison bait. A very effective control can be secured by using the following formula: 100 pounds of coarse flaked wheat bran; 6 pounds white arsenic (or 5 lbs. paris green); 3 ounces amyl acetate (or pulp and juice of 2 dozen oranges or lemons) ; water enough to moisten. Mix bran and arsenic, add water and amyl acetate. Scatter by hand from 5 a. m. to 9 a. m. 100 pounds of bran should cover 10 to 12 acres and will cost 15 to 20 cents per acre. The most effective time to apply poison bait is when the hoppers are still small and confined to their hatching grounds. Two applications two weeks apart are usually sufficient to give a good control. Bait spread just preceding a rain is ineffective. </seg>
            <seg id="p680">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE If the bait is not too moist that it sticks together and is applied thin there is little danger to livestock and poultry- Flea Beetles Plea beetles are small black insects about 1-16 inch long. The adult lives on weeds until potato plants make their appearance and then transfers their activities to the potato plant, eating holes in the leaves that give them the appearance of having been peppered with small shot. The larvae is about 1-6 inch long, white body and brown head. They do their feeding on the tubers, roots and stolens of the potato plant, causing "worm tracks" and "beetle stings" or "pimples" on the tubers. The flea beetles passes the winter as adult beetles, emerging in late May and June when the weather warms up. They deposit their eggs in the soil around the potato plant and the young larvae hatch out in a few days, starting to feed at once upon the roots and tubers, leaving the characteristic worm tracks that often become infected with scab. Crop rotations are of little value in controlling the flea beetle as they will often travel half mile from one field to another. Clean cul - tural methods and early burning of dead vines and weeds along fence rows help in reducing the number of adults. Late planting is effective to some degree. Calcium arsenate applied as a spray at the rate of 3 pounds to 100 gallons of water has been shown to give an S5 per cent control within five days. The spray should be applied as soon as the beetles become numerous and repeated in 10 days. Psyllids The tomato psyllid has just been recently recognized as giving trouble in Nebraska. The adult is a small gray insect about 1-16 inch long, shaped like a miniature locust. They are very active and hard to catch as they will jump or fly when disturbed. They deposit their eggs along the margin of the leaves where they stick out like small pegs. The eggs hatch within a few days and at first the nympths are very small and orange colored. I The mature nympth is nearly aa large as the adult and light green in color. These nympths feed upou the plants for a period of about two weeks. They take up a position on the under side of the leaves and suck the juices from the leaves of the plant. Their sucking tube has two canals, one for sucking juices from the plant and the other for carrying a secretion from the mouth of the insect into the plant. This secretion is what causes the damage to the plants. </seg>
            <seg id="p681">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION When a field becomes infected with psyllids the plants begin to •change color, becoming light green or yellow while a reddish purple margin appears on the leaves and the leaves begin to roll and pinch. The leaves will feel harsh to the hand and rattle. The plant forms a mass of small tubers close to the stem or short stolons. The only effective control at the present time is a lime sulphur spray applied with a high pressure sprayer, using at least three nozzles to a row, a concentration of 1 gallon of liquid lime sulphur to 40 gallons of water will give a good control of the insect without damage to the plants. The first application should be made as soon as the psyllids first appear and followed in about two weeks with a second application. Blister Beetles The blister beetle is an old fashioned potato bug. They are usu - ally gray or black in color, have long slender bodies about four times as long as wide. The damage is done by the adults which eat on the foliage of the plants, often completely defoliating them. Often when the blister beetles first make their appearance and are still localized they can be controlled by hand picking or knocking them into a bucket of water and kerosene with a paddle. When they once become spread out through the fields this is not always practical. This insect is very much resistant to poisons that will not burn up the plants to which it is applied and is therefore hard to control. Often an appli - action of bordeaux mixture will serve as a repellant and drive the blister beetles from one field to another. Dusting with sodium fluosilicate mixed equal parts of hydrated lime and applied at the rate of 10 to 15 pounds of sodium fluosilicate to the acre, depending upon the size of the plants, will give a good control. This is the only type of compound that is effective against the blister beetle and it is necessary to apply in such a manner that it comes in contact with the insect. The blister beetle is beneficial in some respects, helping to control the grasshopper. Blister beetles lay their eggs in capsules of grass - hopper eggs and when the young beetle hatches he feeds on the grass - hopper eggs. Jackrabbits can be controlled quite successfully by the use of strych - nine mixed with salt. Mix at the rate of one ounce of strychnine to one pound of salt. Drill holes about one inch in diameter into a 2x4 several feet long, placing holes about six inches apart. Fill the holes with the salt mixture and place the planks near the rabbit's runway where they are doing the damage. This method permits collecting the poison as a protection to live stock, enables the poison to be re - moved from one location to another, and prevents waste of the strychnine. </seg>
            <seg id="p682">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE OX THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF THE STORAGE OF POTATOES H. O. WERNER,* Department of Horticulture, University of Nebraska The objects to be attained in storing potatoes are to preserve the tubers until such time as they are desired for use for human consump - tion, seed purposes, stock feed, or industrial purposes. This involves protection against adverse atmospheric conditions such as injurious temperature, light, or humidity which might destroy them directly or indirectly, or which might cause undesirable changes in the com - position or physical condition. It especially involves protection against losses due to disease producing organisms. The purpose for which potatoes are intended to be used will have some bearing upon the ideal to be attained. Very early sprout growth is desirable if potatoes are wanted for fall or winter plantings in warmer climates and a small amount in the spring is desirable when planting the northern crop. All sprouting is undesirable if the potatoes are to be used for food and potatoes that have accumulated a large amount of sugar in storage are liked by some people but disliked by others, but they are very undesirable for making potato chips or French frying. Therefore the suitability of different storage methods must be judged by the purpose in mind. This paper is a brief review of most of the papers dealing with the storage of potatoes. (The references cited are given in full in the rear of the paper). Changes Occurring in Potatoes During Storage General Cycles The storage life of the potato may be divided into three fairly definite cycles or periods somewhat as follows: First — The period of several weeks immediately after harvesting, when weight loss is very rapid and respiration very high for a few days and then gradually declines reaching a fairly constant rate after about 2 to 5 weeks. Second — The long period of rest during which there is little weight loss and the respiration is greatly reduced. This period will vary from one to five months or more according to storage conditions and terminates when growth processes begin as shown by the elongation of buds into sprouts. ♦Published with the authorization of the director as paper 168 aL the Journal series of the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station. </seg>
            <seg id="p683">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION Third— The final period during which active sprout growth is occur - ring and during which weight loss is very great because of increased rate of water loss and respiration through the young sprouts. The duration of each of these periods, and the extent and rate o( various physiological activities within the tuber during each period are controlled by the genetic nature and physiological condition of the tubers at harvesting time and the environmental or atmospheric conditions surrounding the potatoes during storage. Nature of Weight Losses Most of the weight lost in storage from potatoes that do not rot is water loss. The life processes of the tuber use up some material and cause some loss but it is relatively small. When a potato is re - spiring the chemical reaction is as follows: Simple sugar + oxygen = water + carbon dioxide. Thus as oxygen is taken from the air and sugar is broken down carbon dioxide goes back to the air and some water is added to the general water supply of the tuber. When calculated from actual data it was found that this carbon dioxide given off amounted to only about 3.01% of the total weight loss of the potatoes (Appleman, Kimbrough &amp; Smith 1928), when water loss was very great. Later as the water loss de - creased it amounted to between 8 and 10% of the total loss. Smith (1933) concluded that the loss attributable to this pro - cess of respiration amounted to 6% to 11% of the total loss of various lots of seed. At low temperatures, the sugar that is being formed from starch takes up some of the free water in the potato. Consequently with some of the life processes material is being built into the tuber. Influence of Conditions Prior to Storage Upon Weight Ijoss Spindly sprouts on potato tubers have been attributed to the production of the potatoes during hot and dry weather. This was reported from Long Island (Stewart &amp; Sirrene 1915) and from Mary - land (Appleman 1924). This is, however, not the only cause of spindling-sprout as it seems to be a symptom appearing with several virus diseases and with physiological derangement due to other causes. The conditions under which the tubers were grown have some effect upon the losses in storage. Increasing the amount of nitrogen in the fertilizer in growing the crop, resulted in an increase in weight loss in storage as reported in an experiment from Germans (Berk - ner &amp; Schlimm 1933). Likewise tubers from plants fertilized with potassium chloride lost more in storage than when potassium sulphate </seg>
            <seg id="p684">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE was used. Potatoes produced in Alabama -with a complete fertilizer lost less weight when stored than those grown without any fertilizer (Ware &amp; Kimbrough 1933). The storage losses were increased when nitrogen was omitted from the fertilizer. Omission of potassium and phosphorus appeared to exert little or no effect on losses in storage. Influence of Maturity of Tubers Upon Weight Loss As tubers mature the per cent of sugars decreases and starch in - creases (Appleman and Miller 1926). In storage the percentage of sucrose decreased in immature tubers, simple sugars showed little change. Very immature tubers had a much lower percentage of starch at the end of a storage period at 68"P than did mature tubers. This was thought to be due to their high rate of respiration. They and Smith (1933) found that this higher respiration rate of imma - ture tubers also continues for a longer time. Smith (1929) reported that the respiration rate declined more rapidly if potatoes remained in the field than if they were harvested and stored at 25"C. In our southern states and in the sub-tropics potatoes are pro - duced in the cool season and are stored, with more or less success, during the warm or hot season. When stored at high temperatures potatoes will remain dormant for a number of weeks (depending upon variety) if kept dry, but during such a hot dry storage period they may become soft and flaccid or spongy but not necessarily rotting. According to the results of Dastur and Agnihorti (1934), for most satisfactory storage potatoes should be harvested when the "up grade" pectic process or building up of pectic compounds ceases. These pec - tic substances are found in the cell walls and as a cementing material holding the cells in place. When these compounds break down there is a loosening of the cell walls and then potatoes soften. Tubers maturing early in the growing season have been found to have a shorter rest period by 1 to 6 weeks, than those harvested in the fall (Wright and Peacock 1934). Complete maturity of the vine at the time the potatoes are harvested is not necessary according to BuehnQlI (1.M27) who reports that Michigan grown potatoes harvested from vines killed by late September or early October frosts sprout earlier than the fall grown crop raised in north central Ohio. The Michigan potatoes are actually more mature physiologically. Immature tubers lose weight more rapidly in the early part of the storage season than do mature tubers. However, at a very low temper - ature the immature potatoes lost water at a more rapid rate for a longer time which Appleman, Kimbrough &amp; Smith (192S) thought might have been due to delayed cork formation. Peacock and Wright (1926) showed that at low temperatures, — below 50°F especially 36°F and below immediately after harvest, immature tubers were- </seg>
            <seg id="p685">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION •damaged. After the long winter period of slight loss the immature Triumph potatoes were found, by Werner (1932) to again lose weight more rapidly than the more mature tubers. Stuart et. al. (1929) reported that in their Pennsylvania experiments the lots that lost most weight were the most immature. ( Effect of Scab Upon Weight Loss Scabby potatoes have been found to lose more weight — as much as 40% more with severe scab — than sound tubers (Lutman 1929). Most of this increased loss occurs in the fall. During the long dormant period the weight loss is generally not much greater than with healthy tubers. Sometimes toward the close of the dormant period the loss from scabby tubers is least. This is also shown in the curves by Werner (1932). Recent work by Lutman (1934) indicated that the final development of an impervious periderm (cork) in the scab spots accounts for some of the decreased weight loss and in addition to that the scab retarded sprouting a week or ten days. Respiration is greater in scabby than in healthy tubers (Lutman 1934). Loss of Weight in Damaged Potatoes Potatoes injured in any way so that the periderm (skin) is broken respire and lose water at a more rapid rate for several days, until the wounds have suberized or corked over, than do undamaged tubers. Cracks have been found to cause an increase in respiration almost as great as did a flat cut of twice the area (Lutman 1926). The response of wounded tubers in storage is discussed under the various •other headings. SIGNIFICANCE OF TEMPERATURE IN POTATO STORAGE Chemical Changes in Storage as Influenced by Temperature Some 50 to 60 years ago a German plant physiologist named Muller-Thurgau (1S82) pointed out that sugar accumulates in pota - toes held at temperatures below 4 5 "P. At that time he demon - strated by chemical analysis that potatoes do not turn sweet when they freeze but that sugar accumulated during the long exposure to low temperature prior to freezing. This work was confirmed by Appleman (1911) who reported that both simple sugars and sucrose accumulated at 32°F. The sucrose accumulated most rapidly at first but after 6 weeks the simple sugars were more abundant. Later (1914) he reported that when such sweet tubers were returned to a warm room much of the sugar was rapidly converted into starch. Similar results are reported by Hopkins (1924). i In a recent study Green Mountain, Triumph and Irish Cobbler potatoes were stored at six temperatures from 32° to 70°F from </seg>
            <seg id="p686">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE November 5 to June (Wright 1927, 1932). He found that at 32°F ilk all varieties sugar increased from November to March 24 and then it decreased slightly till June 1, when the last determination was made. At 36°P there was a similar but lesser increase. At 40°F" there was much fluctuation but in general they also showed sugar in - creases. At 50°, 60°, and 70°F the sugar content decreased steadily in proportion to the temperature increase. The sucrose content — the sweetest of the sugars occurring in potatoes — was at a maximum at 32°F having been 1.9% with Cobblers, 2.41% with Green Moun - tains and 3.22% with Triumphs. At 40" and above the sucrose con - tent was almost constant and mostly between 0.2 and 0.5%. The simple sugars were always more abundant than sucrose. The ratio of reducing sugars to sucrose at 32°F was generally as follows: — Cobblers 3:1, Green Mountain 2 or 3:1, Triumph 1.5 or 2:1. When potatoes were moved from 32° to G0°F the sugar percentage dropped so that in 2 or 3 weeks it was lower than the original percentage in November. Freezing and thawing followed by a month of storage re - sulted in a sugar content higher than when freezing had not occurred. From 50°F to 104 c F., Ziegenbein (1893) found that the respiration rate followed the Van't-Hoff-Arrhenins generalization of doubling for each 1S"F rise in temperature. This law has been found invalid with potatoes stored below 41° or 43°F (Hopkins 1924, Bennet &amp; Bartholo - mew 1924). Hopkins (1924) found the respiration rate higher at 32°F than at 40°F with the lowest rate sometimes as 38° F. Wright (1932) found the respiration rate higher at 50°, 60° &amp; 70°F than at 40°F and the rate at 3G"F higher than at either 32° or 40°F. Muller-Thurgau (18S2) and later Appleman (1915) and Kim - brough (1925) found that tubers stored at 32°F respired very rapidly if moved to a higher temperature. Kimbrough (1925) re - ported that the extent and duration of the high respiration rate when storage temperatures were changed was proportional to the lowness of the original temperature. Many of these findings were confirmed later by Wright (1932) and Smith (1933). The production of heat accompanying such a rapid increase in respiration may often be a factor in shipping potatoes. The great demand for oxygen may re - sult in a scarcity so that black heart may occur. Sprout Growth as Influenced by Temperature • Some years ago when studying the question of dormancy in potato tubers and more especially in endeavoring to establish some method of breaking the rest period of the potato, Rosa (1928) found that at harvest time only a few of the buds in the eyes of a freshly harvested potato tuber were developed — and they only slightly. These buds were found to continue their development in storage. More re - cently a very careful microscopic study was made at frequent intervals,. </seg>
            <seg id="p687">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION or the development of the buds in eyes of potatoes stored at different temperatures, in a storage experiment conducted in New York by Hart - man (1932, 1934). He reported that when potatoes were stored at 32° and 35°F there was practically no growth at all in the buds any time during the winter or even as late as the following June 29th. At 40°F he found a slight but constant development and an increase in the size of the buds, amounting to an average length of only 1.5 milli - meters (about l-16th inch) by June 29th. At 50&lt;-F the buds had grown to sprouts 9.1 mm. (3-8th inch) long by March 24th. At an earlier date, in reporting in an experiment at Washington, D. C. r Stuart, Lombard &amp; Peacock (1929) found that when potatoes were stored for 510 days at 32°F there was no sprouting but much rotting whereas at 40°P there was much sprouting and no rotting. From his work in Maryland, Appleman (1924) reported that prolonged storage at a low temperature retards sprout growth, lowers their vigor, in - creases the number of sprouts and results in loss of apical dominance. In the Marble laboratories in Pennsylvania dormancy was preserved in tubers in large bins with a temperature of 30° to 35"F but when the tgmperature increased to 38° — 40°F in 6 ft. bins sprouting oc - curred in February (Penna. Comm. 1924-25). In preliminary reports of work done in western Nebraska, Werner (1933) has reported that storing at 3J °-39'F after April 1st was about as effective in retarding sprout growth as was continual storage at that low temperature. High storage temperatures have been found very effective in break - ing the rest period of potatoes (Loomis 1927), but as we are not in - terested in) that phase of the storage we will not discuss the ex - tensive literature. Before leaving this matter of sprout growth it is well to keep in mind that most of the rapid shrinkage in the spring is due to thb loss of wat&amp;r thru the sprouts. The tubers lose weight at a fairly constant rate during the winter and this rate increases but very little until the sprouts are about one-half inch long (Appleman, Kimbrough, &amp; Smith, 1928). When potato sprouts are developing they are giving off a great deal of heat. The heat from all the potatoes confined in a bin may cause a rapid rise in the temperature, which together with the shortage of oxygen in the pile may cause a serious situation, such as black heart or suffocation of the sprouts, etc. Consequently, while a deficiency of oxygen may retard sprouting without serious consequences, continuation of such deficiency after the sprouting has begun may be extremely serious. Various storage conditions do bring about different types of sprout growth and sprout tuber formation. The literature on these aspects, was reviewed quite fully in another publication (Werner 1934). </seg>
            <seg id="p688">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Weight Losses as Influenced by Temperature Temperature: It is commonly thought that low temperatures, i. e. at least below 42°F are most desirable for storing potatoes and preventing weight loss. The work of Wilcox, Link and Pool (1913) emphasized the significance of low temperatures for the purpose of inhibiting the growth of the fungus which was responsible for serious storage losses in the form of a dry rot. Butler (1919) published data which showed very distinctly lower losses at 39" than at 48° and 60°F. The losses at the end of 60 days having been 1.4%, 2.5% and 2.8% while at 120 days they were 2.3%, 4.2% and 6.7% re - spectively. When temperatures below 40° have been used the weight loss has generally been greater than at 40°F or at higher temperatures and' at 32 U F they have frequently been lowest of all. Rural New Yorker potatoes harvested and stored on Oct. 30 by Appleman, Kimbrough &amp; Smith (1928), when held at 35°-37°F lost 10.34% by April 2nd or when held at 42" lost 9.44% by April 2 in spite of lower humidity at the higher temperature. Repeating the experiment next yftr the losses between Nov. 7th and April 7 were: for — 40°-41°F 9.27% 44°-49°F 6.45% In another series the tubers were held at a constant temperature and losses from Oct. 30 to Feb. 22 were as follows: 50°F — 3.6%; 40° — 4.04%; 30° — 5.30% and 32° — 5.62%. At higher temperatures losses were greater for at room temperatures — losses were three times greater than in the cellar — for the first 14 days — after that they were never more than half greater. They did not attribute these losses to faulty wound healing but suggested that they might be due to the slower corking of the periderm (skin) of the sound potatoes at the lower temperature. This probably was a contributing factor. It has been shown that the chemical nature of the old skin of a potato is quite different from that of new wound cork — but that as the latter becomes older it has a composition very similar to that of ordinary periderm (skin), Rhodes (1925). From New South Wales, Pinn (1928) reports weight losses at 40, 38 and 36°F as 3.7,. 6.0 and 3.5% and he reports Willaman's work in Minnesota wherein losses at 36, 34 and 32 C F storage are reported as 3, 4, and 6% respectively. When some Gold Coin po - tatoes were stored 510 days at 40", 36°, and 32 C F the weight losses were 9.4, 15.2, and 14.5% and of these potatoes the decayed stock amounted to 3.2, 48.5 and 88.5% respectively as reported by Stuart, Lombard, and Peacock (1929). The decay was due to a physiological </seg>
            <seg id="p689">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION breakdown which was followed by rots. Irish Cobblers stored by them from October to April lost 3.42, 1.55, and 3.70%. Undamaged Irish Cobbler potatoes stored by Peacock, Wright and Whiteman (1932) for 12 weeks, beginning 3 days after harvest, at several temperatures lost weight as follows: 70° — 2.3%; 60° — ■ 1.8%; 50° — 4.8%; 40° — 7.2%; 36° — 5.0% and 32° — 16.3%. The slightly higher loss at 70°P was due to more rapid shrivelling. When storing potatoes until June Hartman (1932, 1934) got a greater weight loss with 32°F storage than at 35°F or 40°F. It is quite evident that 32°F has been a poor storage temperature whereas 36"F seems to have had some merit frequently but not always. Probably the condition reported by Peacock &amp; Wright (1926) was a factor in some of these cases. They reported that when immature tubers were stored at 32°-36°F the tissues around the eyes and lenticels blackened and that buds were killed. In 1927 they reported that immature tubers stored at 60" to 70°F for 6 days and then at 32°F for 60 or more days, showed none of the damage occuring when stored at 32° or 3G°F. Feathered stock stored well under the former treatment but mummified if stored at 32°F at once. When storing feathered and sound stock Peacock, Wright and Whiteman (1932) discovered losses to be very high at 32°F and lower at higher temperatures having been 13.8%, 4.5%, 6.7%, and 4.4% for feathered tubers stored for 10 weeks at 32°, 36", 40°, and 50°F respectively. Sound tubers lost 4.4%, 1.9%, 2.8%, and 2.6% respectively under the same conditions. In this case low tempera - tures did not permit adequate corking of the feathered surfaces or even of the completion of it on sound tubers. In 1933 Smith re - ported distinctly less loss and rot when potatoes were held in a warm moist place for 12 days before cellar storage. This applied to sound and damaged as well as to mature and immature tubers. With Triumph potatoes cold storage of 3 6°-40°F has involved less weight loss than cellar storage (Werner 1933-34). With cold storage early and cellar storage later rot was more prevalent than with continual cellar storage. With cellar storage till April and cold storage from then till June, rotting was at a minimum and weight losses were about as low as any — sprouting being inhibited. The work of Benhet (1934) promises to throw much light on this decisively detrimental effect of storage temperature between 32° and 36°F. He reports that at these temperatures the cells of the po - tato cannot hold their solutes or solids. By means of an electrical, conductivity test he determined the quantity of material that would pass out of pieces of potato, of uniform shape and size, into water in </seg>

The conductivities registered were as follows: Storage Conductivity Temperature Milli. ohms xlO 32.0°P 1492 35.6°F 892 41.0°P 478 50.0°F 51 Sugar was very high at the lowest temperature the parts per mil - lion of sugar in the solution having been 6133, 2145, 1794 and 14 for these temperatures. The amount of total sugar lost at these temper - atures was 27, 15, 13, 1.5 and 0.6%. These were materials that the cells were not able to hold in the solution in the tuber and consequently they were probably of little or no value to the tuber. They con - sisted of minerals in solution, sugar, soluble nitrogen compounds, etc. The culinary undesirability of tubers stored at low temperature which permitted sugar accumulation and the feasibility of restoring the starch and depleting the sugar content of such potatoes by hold - ing them at a higher temperature was first discussed by Muller-Thurgan (1SS2) and later elaborated upon by Appleman (1914) and Wright (1925), (1932). Sweetman (1930) discovered that the poor results frequently secured during the winter (Walter 192S) iu making po - tato chips was due to the caramalization of the sugar when potatoes that had become sweet at low temperatures were dropped into hot fat. Low storage temperature was found to have a detrimental eSect on tubers regardless of cooking method, but especially when used for chips or French fries and best table quality was attained by storage at 60 to 70°, poorest at 32 C F (Peacock, Wright, Whiteman and Fuller, 1930). Potatoes stored at 40"F and lower are described as teing watery, coarse grained and darker (Peacock, Wright and White - man, 1932). Humidity ns a Factor In Potato Storage Humidity may influence weight losses during storage because of an effect upon: — a. The wound healing process. b. The process of tuber rotting due to micro-organisms. c. The saturation deficit of the atmosphere. d. The permeability of the skin which in turn affects respiration and sprouting. High humidity is necessary for the wound healing process (Shapo - valov &amp; Edson 1919, Priestley &amp; Woffenden 1933, Artschwager 1927), </seg>
            <seg id="p691">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION but when the temperature is low humidity is less effective (Artschwager 1927). If wounds heal promptly, early losses due to transpiration are greatly reduced and later losses by rotting may be avoided because the organisms cannot penetrate the wound cork. In order for a tuber to become infected by rot producing Fusaria (the group of fungi re - sponsible for most of the dry rot in western potatoes) a moist sur - face on an unprotected wounded area during the first ten days of storage, seems to be necessary (Weiss, Lauritzen, &amp; Brierley 1928). Goss (1921) found that infection and rotting were favored by high humidity, but Weiss, Lauritzen and Brierley (1928) concluded that humidity was not of great importance if the surface of the potato was dry. Stech (1S91) and later Johnstone (1925) showed rather conclu - sively that whenever oxygen is made accessible to interior tuber tissues respiration is greatly accelerated. Smith (1929) demonstrated that moist tubers are more permeable to oxygen and carbon dioxide than dry tubers. As a result of this greater permeability tubers stored in a moist atmosphere had a higher respiration rate than those stored in a dry atmosphere and that they also sprouted earlier. The skins of moist stored potatoes being more permeable to gases etc. were consequently more responsive to substances capable of breaking the rest period. Growth of Sprouts as Influenced by Humidity Humidity has been found to have a very great effect upon sprout growth. Smith (1929) found that the skins of potatoes stored at a high humidity are more permeable to gasses than when stored at a. low humidity. Appleman (1914) showed quite conclusively that the growth of buds in dormant tubers is dependent upon a supply of oxygen getting into the young eye tissues. Consequently as high humidity increases the permeability of the skin to oxygen it is condu - cive to early sprouting. In 1919 Butler demonstrated the value of low humidity as a means of keeping potatoes dormant. When stor - ing potatoes at 49 C F at the Marble Laboratory (1924) potatoes sprouted very early if they were permitted to get damp — but if the humidity was kept very low sprouting was delayed for more than a month. Bushnell (1927) considered that keeping the potatoes dry was one of the most effective methods of preventing sprout growth. The "sweating" which frequently occurs in piles of potatoes results in early sprouting in spots where sweating occurs. That problem will be discussed later. Weight Loss as Influenced by Humidity As humidity decreases weight losses increase. Butler (1919) re - ported that even though a temperature reduction from 50° to 39°F </seg>
            <seg id="p692">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE reduced the weight loss of a 120 day period by 1.8 times, that s - change from dry to moderately dry air reduced the weight loss 4.5 times or about 2.5 times more than lowering the temperature 11°F. In a saturated air weight loss was reduced still further but molds grew on the surface. When cut potatoes were stored at 95% relative hu - midity they remained in good condition but at 65-70% they shrivelled badly in. 10 to 20 days. (Wright &amp; Peacock 1927). The air in the bin has been found to be more humid than in the cellar outside of the bin and in the middle more than in the bottom - or top and in the middle the weight loss was least (Smith 1933).. In the early part of the season weight loss was greater in the bottom than in the top of a bin, but by the end of the season, when sprouts - were growing the shrinkage was greatest in the top of the bin. In considering humidity it is important to realize that at different temperatures an atmosphere of the same relative humidity will have a different effect upon the tubers. This is because the saturation deficit — which represents the evaporating power of the air increases as the temperature increases. For example, at 44°F one would con - sider air rather dry if the relative humidity is only 45%. However, such air has an evaporating power equal to that with a humidity of 62% at a temperature of 54°F or 80% at a temperature of 73°F. The Oxygen Supply as a Factor in Potato Storage Oxygen is absolutely necessary for maintaining life in potato tubers. Bartholomew (1913, 1915) concluded that black heart was due to excessive temperature and insufficient oxygen. He produced black heart at will by holding potatoes for 14 to 4 8 hours at 100° to 113°F. A few years later Stewart and Mix (1917) showed that black heart was essentially due to oxygen deficiency liable to occur at any tem - perature. Black heart was produced at 32°F by sealing the jars (Bennet and Bartholomew 1924). Stewart and Mix (1917) re - ported that when the volume of air and tubers was about equal black heart occurred in 10-12 days at 70°F; 20 days at 55°-60°F; 23-40 days at 40°F. If the air in the sealed jars was only ten times the volume of the tubers sprouts were barely produced' and were not normal till the air volume was 19 times that of the tubers. Black heart resulted if a still greater oxygen deficiency occurred. In an oxygen deficient atmosphere sprouts that do develop are club shaped with conspicuous swollen lenticels. Potatoes subjected at any time to an oxygen deficient atmosphere grew normally later when oxygen was supplied. They concluded that at a temperature of 45"F potatoes might be stored to a depth of 6 feet, but at a temperature of 50°F the depth should not be over 3 feet, so as to provide an adequate air supply. </seg>
            <seg id="p693">NEBRASKA rOTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION Butler (1919) delayed sprout growth 108 days by reducing the oxygen supply around the tubers. This was accompanied by a de - crease in weight loss. The interrelation between the air supply and temperature was clearly shown by Bushnell (1927) when he kept potatoes at 50°F in a large tight can with only one air hole 1/1 6 th inch in diameter. When held in this meagerly ventilated can no sprouts or black heart de - veloped at 50°F prior to the middle of May — but then when the temperature rose to 60 c F sprouts grew, respiration increased and black heart occurred and a very undesirable situation was created in a short time. A very interesting experience is reported in a French journal by Schribaux (1914). We have not checked on this method but it does seem reasonable and may merit repetition. He reported that when potatoes in a cellar were covered with a sufficiently deep layer of soil they kept till August. If not covered quite enough they produced an excellent crop of secondary tubers — i. e. new tubers were formed directly from the old tubers. If covered still less they produced nor - mal sprouts. This dormancy appears to have been due to a shortage ■of oxygen. Light has been found to stimulate sprout growth in relatively im - mature freshly dug tubers (Appleman 1914) but not in mature tubers or tubers harvested for some time. However, observations indicate that with some varieties the eyes of relatively mature tubers appear to be sensitive to light. It is thought that the oxygen produced by the photosynthetic activity, in the greened portion of the exposed tuber, is responsible for activating the sprout growth. Sometimes gases in small quantities from other products in the same storage may exert an inhibiting effect on growth of sprouts of potatoes. A few years ago Elmer (1932) in Kansas found that po - tatoes stored in close proximity to apples did not sprout. Experi - menting further, he found that the potatoes in a bushel box could be kept from sprouting by putting a few apples in the box. Some volatile product given off by the apples prevented sprout growth. When the apples were removed normal sprouts soon appeared. Anything which permits the entrance of oxygen to the tissues around the eyes is favorable for sprout growth, hence the reason for sprouts developing earlier close to cuts and rotting areas. Tubers that are badly bruised — though not necessarily cracked — frequently produce early sprouts. This is probably because of the fact pointed out by Artschwager, (1927) that in a young tuber, the young cells which give rise to the cork are crushed by a blow or bruise and there is little or no development of cork beneath these crushed tissues. </seg>

            <seg id="p696">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Thus in these portions, the potato is not sealed off by the rather im - pervious periderm or cork. Lutman (1934) reports that scab on potatoes causes a delay in sprouting. Ventilation Some of the ventilation experiments with potatoes might appear to have given contradictory results. However, when one considers the temperature, humidity and the oxygen supply some of the apparent in - consistencies do not appear to exist. "When the air supply used in storing potatoes at 50°P was dry but greatly restricted the loss of weight was only 2.79% as compared with a loss of 17.2% with the normal air supply (unrestricted). Tubers given a restricted air supply were still firm and dormant, the latter had long sprouts and were shrivelled (Butler 1919). In the Marble laboratories in Pennsylvania (1924-25) streams of dried air moving at various speeds were passed through potatoes stored at 49°F. They found that with one air change in 24 hours the weight loss from December to February 18 was 0.80%. This was increased to 3.1% with one change per hour and 5.74% with 4 changes per hour. At this temperature the potatoes were very moist with less than one change of air per .hour and as a result they sprouted the latter part of February. With 4 changes per hour sprout - ing was delayed till the latter part of March. However, delaying sprout growth by such excessive ventilation caused an excessive weight loss by May 1 of 15.8% as compared with 9.2% loss with one change per hour or 1.64% loss with one change in 24 hours. In an - other study they found that forced ventilation was useful but not entirely effective in preventing sprout growth in bins 6 feet deep at a temperature of 38-40°F and that at 30°-35°F ventilation was not needed. It was shown by Stewart and Mix (1917) that sprout growth may be prevented by reducing the air supply without causing black heart or without doing any permanent damage to the potatoes. They found that if the air reduction is carried a little too far black heart occurs —the tubers discoloring at the surface more than when black heart is due to heat. They considered six feet as the maximum depth for storing potatoes for several weeks at 42°F and 3 ft. if the temper - ature is 55°F. Bartholomew and Bennett demonstrated very clearly that as the temperature is raised ventilation is more and more neces - sary in order to prevent black heart. Ventilation may stimulate respiration. Lutman (1934) found that respiration was distinctly greater when air was drawn through </seg>
            <seg id="p697">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION* a vessel storing potatoes as contrasted with the respiration rate of tubers stored in still air. Butler (1919) referred to the accumulation of sugars in potatoes stored in still air. This finding has been confirmed by the later work of Bennet (1931). Bushnell (1927) maintained that ventilation was necessary only to control temperature and to keep potatoes dry (to prevent sprouting, etc.) but that in a cellar it is not needed to supply oxygen. This seems to be borne out by the simple experiment by Appleman, Kimbrough and Smith (1928) in which they found that a shrinkage of 3.03% occurred in the weight of a basket of tubers in the center of a barrel, from November 3 to June 17, as compared with a shrinkage of 8.1% in a comparable lot placed on top of the barrel in the air of the brick vault. Smith (1933) studied the carbon dioxide and oxygen content of the air in various parts of bins of potatoes and concluded that ven - tilation was not needed to take oi'C carbondioxide or to supply oxygen at the bottom of the bin when potatoes were stored from fall till late winter. He also reported a very slightly greater loss of weight in a slatted bin than in a solid bin (0.2 to 1.1% difference). How - ever, with a solid bin the potatoes were damp and at some places they were wet, so possibly the lower weight loss may have been due to condensation of atmospheric moisture on these potatoes. They un - doubtedly would have sprouted earlier, hence, if storage had been continued till later the potatoes in slatted bins might have been in better condition. In studying storage losses in three types of cellars he found that weight losses decreased as humidity increased and evaporating power of the air and temperature decreased. "Sweating" of potatoes was studied in the Marble Laboratories. They concluded that because it encourages mold growth and early germination it is to be avoided. It can be avoided by: 1. Storing in small quantities so heat can escape on all sides — as crates or bags. 2. Storing in shallow bins (except at low temperatures) and maintain temperature uniform throughout the bin. 3. Keeping air over bin warmer than air in bin so as to prevent condensation from moisture laden air. 4. Moderate ventilation to prevent excessive humidity in the storage pile. Cold air should be admitted under the potatoes. Bringing much cold air into a bin of potatoes may cause excessive weight loss because </seg>
            <seg id="p698">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE' the cold air has a greater water absorbing capacity. At 40°F and 90% humidity the temperature needs to drop only 2.7°F to cause moisture to condense. This does not occur at 80% humidity till the temperature has dropped 5.6°F. Storage Conditions and Seed Value Potatoes stored at 36°-38°F yielded approximately 11% more than those stored at 32°-33°F during 4 years in trials in Ohio and they yielded more each year (Bushnell 1927). As the temperature of the bins is 3°-5°F higher than of the cellar air he recommended an air temperature of 36°F. Potatoes stored at 40° and 50°F for several weeks before planting emerged earlier, produced better stands, matured earlier and produced greater yields than those stored at 32°F (Peacock &amp; Wright 1927). It was pointed out that in early potato regions such warming up permits later planting thus avoiding losses incident to planting in cold wet soils. Results by Stuart, Lom - bard and Peacock (1927), while not consistent, showed a tendency toward higher yields from 36° or 40°F storage than from 32°F. They reported definite increases when potatoes were held at 70°F for 12 days after removal from temperatures of 32°F to 40°F. When cut seed potatoes were held 10 or 20 days before planting those stored at 32°F yielded less than those stored at 40°-50°F and those stored at 65-70% humidity yielded less than those at 95%. In Illinois yields of 135, 132 and 55 bushels per acre were secured when potatoes were stored at 40, 33, and 31°F respectively (Pieper and Flint 1928). Hartman (1934) in New York found a temperature of 40° superior to" 35 and 32°F inferior to both when considering yields when po - tatoes were planted. Jehle &amp; Henberger (1934) got definitely in - creased yields by storing Maryland fall grown seed at a high temper - ature for several weeks before planting. Werner and Zook (1935) secured higher yields at North Platte, Nebraska from cellar stored than from cold storage seed potatoes. Application in Nebraska From all these experiments it seems that the soundest storage prac - tice is somewhat as follows: Permit the potatoes to dry off before bringing them into winter storage. Do not endeavor to lower the temperature during the first two weeks but rather endeavor to maintain it at not less than 50°F but not necessarily over 70°F. At this time provide sufficient ventil - ation so as to prevent a shortage of oxygen because of the rapid respiration of these freshly dug and often immature or damaged tubers. The temperature should be lowered to about 40°F after the first two weeks. High humidity should be maintained in order to provide better conditions for wound healing and to reduce shrinkage losses. </seg>
            <seg id="p699">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION To accomplish this the entire cellar should be soaked down before dig - ging time and the dirt in the driveway should be kept damp during the fall months. Fresh air should be brought in under the potatoes so it will rise through the pile thus absorbing both heat and; moisture as it rises. Deposition of moisture on potatoes near the top of the pile will thus bo reduced to a minimum. Because of such "sweating" it is inadvisable to admit cold air over the tops of the bins of potatoes. After the initial period of several weeks when most weight loss occurs, the temperature should be maintained at about 40 to 38°F. The air should be kept moist during the early fall months but as this moist atmosphere may stimulate early sprouting it may be advisable to permit the air to become somewhat drier during midwinter and in the spring months if the potatoes are to be held for seed. If the potatoes are to be marketed during the late winter or early spring as table stock, then continued humid storage may be desirable. In the spring the best means of retarding sprout growth is to maintain low temperatures by means of a very deep cellar, by bringing ice or snow into the cellar, by mulching the cellar roof with straw, by admitting cold air at night and closing the cellar in the day time or by the use of some method of artificial refrigeration. If the tem - perature is kept down little or no ventilation is needed in a cellar during late winter and spring. If the temperature rises then ventil - ation will be needed in order to keep the potatoes dry, or in rare cases to prevent black heart. If the potatoes are not kept dry as the tem - perature rises they will sprout rapidly and extensively. The intro - duction of cold air at night will help to both lower the temperature and the humidity during the spring months. Sprouting can also be retarded by storing the potatoes in shallow piles in sacks or in crates. When ventilation is excessive it will cause excessive weight losses and will also stimulate sprouting. Therefore it should be used only to keep down the temperature and to keep potatoes dry, hoping to re - tard sprout growth by these two methods. For early plantings or if cold storage is used for late planting a warming up period of several weeks before planting seems to be very desirable. As field cut potatoes are liable to sprout and rot most rapidly they should be planted first of all. (As will have been observed this paper does not review the liter - ature dealing with losses due to rot producing organisms.)

Considering the condition of fields throughout western Nebraska at this time, it is imperative that all growers con - sider the matter of moisture conservation, and give thought to prepar - ation for a possible continuation of dry weather. One of the first things to consider in the matter of preparation for a dry season is care of the seed bed. In selecting the location for a field, the previous crop that was on the laud should be considered. By all means, the best seed bed is that which was summer-fallowed the previous season. Our experience in 1934 shows that the next best is soil on which beans were planted the year before. Apparently a bean crop takes out very little moisture, and the result is very similar to that of summer fallow. In some instances, potatoes on bean land produce practically as much as potatoes on summer fallow. As a general rule, corn ground is to be desired over stubble fields. In seasons when there is ample moisture, there has been practically no -difference in this connection. The effect of the previous crop on potatoes may be considerable in some seasons, as outlined above. Probably the most direct effect, however, is that of the handling of the soil previous to planting the potato crop. Several methods of handling will be outlined. Methods of handling the soil are fallowing, early discing and early plowing and packing. Each of these methods will be taken up in further detail. </seg>
            <seg id="p708">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Fallowing the soil is performed by several different methods, principally that of plowing in the spring or early summer, and fol - lowing that with discing, or other tillage, to keep down weed growth. Special equipment is used for that purpose in sections where large quantities of winter wheat are produced. This equipment includes rod weeders, spring tooth weeders, and Campbell packers. I will attempt to describe a system of fallowing that may be practical for those sections where summer fallowing is not practiced as a general rule, and where special equipment is not available. The land to be fallowed may be opened in the spring with an ordinary corn lister. No corn, of course, will be planted. Following this, culti - vation may be practiced, as weed growth appears. As one approaches the fall, the land will again be leveled. Two advantages are to be gained by this system of fallowing, namely, no special equipment is needed, and erosion from blowing will be prevented, where the laud is light and sandy. The latter feature is most important, as it has been the deterring factor from summer fallowing with many growers. An item in this connection which may prove of value is to run the lister rows at right angles to the slope of the land. This, of course, will result in irregular and circutous rows, but that need have no serious results. In fact, the benetits accruing from this are that quick, dashing rains will be caught, and washing prevented. In many respects, this is a very desirable factor. It is being practiced consider - ably in the eastern part of this state, and in sections where water erosion is a factor to be considered. It is simply adapting the idea of terracing on a minor scale. Fallowing may also be performed by discing the ground, and keeping it clean in that manner, but this is not an efficient method, as results have shown. In all systems of fallowing, the secret is pre - vention of plant or weed growth, and this should be accomplished by the minimum of effort. Overworking of the soil is easily possible, and from this has resulted a great deal of wind erosion. The preparation of the seed bed has a great deal to do with the moisture conserved, as well as the control of weeds later in the season. The best general practice is early discing. This not only conserves the moisture, but keeps down the weed growth, or kills early weed growth. Plowing is generally best when done early, that is, a month or six weeks in advance of planting. A sub-surface packer, used with the plow, is probably the most desirable treatment. It is to be desired over harrowing because it firms the lower part of the seed bed, thus eliminating any air pockets, and preventing the loss of moisture. Like - wise, use of a surface packer is to be discouraged, as it crushes clods that are effective controls of wind drifting, and unless weighted ex - cessively, will not pack the lower part of the seed bed. </seg>
            <seg id="p709">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION Following the preparation of the seed bed, we are now ready for planting. la the event that there has been rainfall to pack the seed bed, it may be necessary to disc just before planting. If this has not occurred, such discing will not be necessary. Some items are of con - siderable importance in connection with planting, and the most im - portant is that of putting the seed pieces into moist soil. Those planters which are equipped with furrow openers are most successful in this respect. The furrow openers throw back the top layer of dry soil, and prevent it from falling directly on the seed piece when the covering discs come along. Of course, when the seed bed has suf - ficient moisture, this precaution is not an important one. In several seasons past we have noted where 50% stands were secured with ordinary planters and where good stands were found in the same vicinity resulting from the use of furrow openers on the planters. Usually after planting, it is highly desirable to blind cultivate. The principal effect of blind cultivation is that of prevention of weed growth and resultant conservation of moisture later in the season. In those seasons when we have ample moisture, it is of double importance, be - cause it is the most effective method of control of weeds. . Following blind cultivation, harrowing or going over the field with a weeder is - desirable. These, also, are effective tools for the prevention of weed growth. Weeders are again used after the plants come up, and many successful growers follow this practice, generally using the machine until plants are 6 to 8 inches tall. Further handling of the soil is necessary, of course, but most growers err in this connection by going into their fields too often dur - ing the summer. No more cultivation is necessary than to keep down weed growth. To reiterate, early cultivation is the most important in the matter of control of weeds. The old adage "A lick in time saves nine" certainly applies here. We have been taking up only those methods of soil control which are effective for conservation of moisture. There are other consider - ations which are desirable, and most important among these is the matter of seed. Owing to the extreme drouth of last season, the greatest proportion of seed potatoes will be small. In one sense, thiB is a desirable thing, because these potatoes may be planted whole, which is especially desirable if the ground is dry. It has been found that whole, uncut seed may be planted in a dry seed bed, where it will lay without rotting for a month or six weeks, and upon the arrival of moisture, these potatoes will grow and make a crop. One caution must be registered in that connection. In the event that moisture does come later in the season, it is very easy to plant single drop potatoes too thick. Such whole seed should be planted no closer than eighteen </seg>
            <seg id="p710">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE inches, and they may be planted as far apart as 22 inches without any danger. Since most growers will have some seed that will be cut, the best manner of handling these is to cut the seed pieces as large as pos - sible, thus giving a large amount of food matter to start the new plant. The best manner of handling cut seed is to have it cut a number of days in advance of actual planting. In this manner, the seed will have an opportunity to suberize and thoroughly heal. Such seed is in practically as good condition as small whole seed, inasfar as its ability to withstand rotting in the soil. The ideal condition for cutting potatoes in advance, to have them healed effectively, is to store them in a moist, warm place. Of course, they should not be piled very deeply, but if the conditions are very humid, healing is a simple process. Most of the trouble with spoil - age of early cut seed is due to storing in cold, or in extremely dry conditions, neither one of which promotes Healing. This entire discussion, is, of course, based upon our having a con - tinuance of dry conditions. It is easily possible that such conditions will change, but even though that may be, the application of many of the principles outlined will still be possible. ANNUAL REPORT OP THE SECRETARY The present activity in redesigning potato machinery serves as an example of the value of persistent organized activity. During the last several years the members of this association and the representatives of the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station have been paying considerable attention to potato machinery with special concern aa to the adaptability of that machinery for doing the work it should do. During the last lew years numerous growers have experimented with changes in their machinery. Some of these were found very desirable and have now come into general use — such as running the digger belt in one instead of two chains. In some cases, however, it has been found difficult or awkward to modify present day machinery ade - quately. During this time a very satisfactory digger of new design has been developed in one of the western Nebraska potato towns and a number of farmers have reconstructed old diggers so as to have lower diggers that will do less damage. Several of these diggers were exhibited at our field meetings last summer. Resolutions passed at those field meetings, calling the attention of manufacturers to their tardiness in providing improved and more adequate machinery, were forwarded to the potato machinery manu - facturers supplying growers of western Nebraska with their machinery. The response from these manufacturers revealed that some of them </seg>
            <seg id="p711">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION were very well satisfied with their present machinery and even argued that the changes called for by the potato growers were unnecessary. One concern — thinking perhaps that the secretary might be a "dirt" potato grower, wrote a high pressure salesmanship letter, which, how - ever, was not convincing. On the other hand several of the manu - facturers have shown a very keen interest. One of them is putting a new and excellent type of digger on the market in the south and east this spring, another one is putting an entirely new machine into commercial production so that the machine will be available next fall. The experimental machines of both of these manufacturers were tried out under a variety of field conditions in 1934. There is some evidence that some of the other manufacturers will be turning out machines of improved design before very long. During the last few years some of our potato planters have been found inadequate when dealing with dry soils. As a result from com - plaints, demands and suggestions, several manufacturers have made some very definite improvements which it is hoped will take care oi the difficulties formerly encountered by inadequate planters. It seems, therefore — that something has been accomplished by persistently keeping after this question of improving potato machin - ery. It remains now for potato growers to use it intelligently, for up to the present time no machine has been found that can be substi - tuted for the intelligent human brain, in growing potatoes. The most fruitful problem of Nebraska growers at the present time is the age old one of distribution or marketing of the crop. This association should give considerable study to this question, remember - ing that intelligent "marketing" is a great deal more than waiting for the highest cash carload or truck buyer. It involves studying the markets available, the demands of these markets and how such de - mands can best be satisfied so as to hold them or better to still further increase the demand. The association has been encouraging 4H Potato Club work by offering an annual contest. This year several of the winners will be awarded trips to the annual 4H Club Week in Lincoln. This is a memorable event for any boy or girl. The Association should give more thought to the place which it Bhould hold in the activities of this association. The future of the potato industry of western Ne - braska and consequently the future of the civilization of these western communities is the thing to keep in mind. Your Secretary — upon authorization of the officers — again at - tended the annual meetings of the Potato Association of America and of several other scientific organizations, held at Pittsburgh in De - cember. As usual Nebraska interests were involved in several matters </seg>
            <seg id="p712">REPORT Ol" NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE in connection with certification, and the new matter of a federal potato control program. As usual — he again got many new ideas from many different sources and it is hoped that some of these will be of value to the potato growers of Nebraska. This contact with other workers who are studying potato problems in various part3 of the continent seems worth while and should be kept up. H. O. WERNER, Secretary. MINUTES OF ANNUAL MEETING, MARCH 21, 1935 The Annual Meeting of the Nebraska Potato Improvement Asso - ciation was held in the Alliance Hotel following the Annual Dinner at noon. The prize winners in the 4-H Club contest and in the certified seed contest were announced by Marx Koehnke. Mr. L. I. Frisbie of the Agricultural Extension Service discussed 4-H Club work as it applied to potatoes in western Nebraska. Following his discussion 4-H Club work was discussed further by County Agent Nibler of Kimball, John Pospisil of Alliance, and August Gadeken of Bushnell. The auditing committee consisting of R. H. Mclntyre, Chadron, R. Stannard, Gordon, and Robt. Young, Kimball, reported that the ac - counts of the Secretary-Treasurer were inspected and found to be in good order and coinciding with the bank account; report was approved. The following resolutions were presented by the resolutions com - mittee, consisting of John Pospisil, Gail Russel, and Frank VanDusen: "Be it resolved that — 1 — The Nebraska Potato Improvement Asso - ciation go on record in favor of compulsory inspection for all carload shipments of potatoes originating in Nebraska. 2 — That the Association institute a vigorous campaign in the inter - est of the better grading of market potatoes. 3. — That the organization continue to sponsor the 4-H Potato Club work and that the program be expanded. 4 — That the Officers and Board of Directors take steps to greatly enlarge the membership of the organization, extend the activities of the Association into fields other than educational wherever the interests of the potato growers will be served and organize local branches wherever it may seem feasible. All of these resolutions were discussed individually and passed individually by the voting members present. In connection with the last resolution there was some discussion by Mr. J. Pedrett and Mr. Wm. Morrow. The latter pointed out that many matters of concern to all growers in western Nebraska are con- </seg>
            <seg id="p713">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION tinually arising that at the present time there is no ono organization that is large enough or sufficiently well established to represent all of the potato growers of the state, eastern, central and western Ne - braska included. He called attention to the fact that in' many of these matters the Nebraska Certified Potato Growers has been taking the initiative in matters of this kind but that such procedure is not the most desirable because this organization represents only a small fraction of the total number of the potato growers in western Nebraska and therefore cannot be considered as being truly representative and furthermore should not be called upon to bear the financial burden. He pointed out especially that in the next few months the potato interests of western Nebraska should be concerned with the defense of their rights in connection with changes in freight rates; that if the changes that are now being proposed go into effect a serious reduction in the price paid western Nebraska potato growers will be inevitable because some competing regions will not be affect in the same manner. He pointed out further that in matters of this kind it is the potato grower who is fundamentally concerned, as the potato dealers make essentially the same profit regardless of whether the potatoes in any one locality sell at a relatively high or low figure. He also called attention to the fact that this year Idaho potatoes are invading the Nebraska territory to a very extensive degree and that some organization should be looking into the matter to determine the reasons why and the possibile remedy. The nominations committee consisting of Ora Randall, Scottsbluff, Frank Uhrig, Hemingford, and Ed Peterson, nominated the following for the various offices: W. T. YOUNG, Jr., President J. PEDRETT, Vice President CARL THOMAS, as a member of the Board of Directors suc - ceeding W. T. Young. The report of the nomination committee was adopted and there being no nominees from the floor, the nominees were unanimously elected. After some closing remarks by the President and Secretary con - cerning some minor items, the meeting adjourned. </seg>
            <seg id="p714">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MINUTES OP THE MEETING OF THE BOARD OP DIRECTORS TUESDAY, MARCH 21, 1035. 6:00 P. M. — ALLIANCE The following Officers and Directors were present: W. T. Young, Jr., President. J. Pedrett, Vice President. Directors — Anton Stenberg, Fred Ehrman and H. O. Werner, Secretary-Treasurer. Because of some matters which were to be discussed, Mr. H. J. Gould and L. I. Prisbie of the Agricultural Extension Service and Wm. Morrow and Marx Koehnke of the Nebraska Certified Potato Growers were invited into the meeting. Upon invitation of the President Mr. Gould stated that if the Potato Improvement Association would contribute $100 the Agri - cultural Extension Service would contribute a like amount to a fund to be used to employ Haskell Hankins during the spring months to organize 4-H Potato Clubs and to assist them in their work in western Nebraska counties, it being the understanding that the counties through the office of the County Agricultural Agents would take care of local travelling expenses. Mr. Frisbie contributed to the discussion as did most of the members present. The following motion was made by Fred Ehrman, seconded by Anton Stenberg: That the Association contribute $100 to match a similar amount supplied by the Agricultural Extension Service to be used in establishing 4-H potato club work in western Nebraska on a sounder basis. This motion was unanimously passed. After a very animated discussion concerning the type of award that should be made as recognition of 4-H Club work, the following motion was adopted, having been made by J. Pedrett and seconded by Fred- Ehrman: That the Association expend not to exceed $110 to be awarded to outstanding 4-H Club members in such manner as the President and Secretary shall deem most advisable. There was considerable discussion of the suggested expansion of the activities of the Association but because of other previously made engagements some of the officers could not remain for a longer session and no formal action was taken. The following were listed as several of the objectives to be considered: That the Association should have a very much larger membership so as to have a true cross section of all potato communities in Nebraska. That the Association might well be considered as the organization responsible to see to it that the interests of the Nebraska potato </seg>
            <seg id="p715">NEBRASKA POTATO IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION growers be properly conserved in connection with such matters as freight rate changed, traffic problems, legislative problems, and that the Association should be the agency to see to it that proper educa - tional work is done to improve the quality of Nebraska potatoes over those grown at the present time by doing field demonstration work with a view to improving harvesting methods. That the Association should be the agency that should take what - ever action the growers wish to take with regard to federal inspection, advertising Nebraska potatoes, etc. From the discussion it appeared that a single important freight rate change case might at times involve expenditures of $1000 to $1500. It was evident from the discussion that to have the Association do the work suggested, considerable thought would need to be given to the method of procedure. The of - ficers and directors were requested to exchange their views and opin - ions through the Secretary in the hope that some ideas might be crystallized and that a reasonably early date a meeting might be held for the purpose of formulating a program of procedure.

            <seg id="p718">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE • NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION ANNUAL MEETING Agricultural College, Lincoln, Nebraska January 7th to 11th, 1935 The meeting was called to order by President Smiley. The follow - ingg officers responded to roll call: E. Smiley, Martin Norberg, Harry Knudsen, and J. M. Burnham. A quorum of the board of directors was found present: John Klingeman, Sam Schwerin, Lloyd Colglazer, John Skinner, Earl Jewell, and C. L. Ellis. Roll call was followed by the reading of the minutes of the 1934 meeting by the Secretary. It was moved and seconded that the min - utes be approved. Motion carried. Treasurer Burnham's report was read and approved, followed by a motion presented by Sec. Knudsen, calling in the remaining $2.50 on each membership, with the amount of $1.00 being paid in return for a receipt in full. Mr. Knudsen went on to explain that many of the members have gone into the Great Beyond, some of them are no longer interested, and a great many of them are out of the business. It would therefore be a good thing for the organization to sift out the membership, and would be a material help financially as well. Of the 700 or so members, there is no other way of determining how many are actively interested. Following the reading of Amended Article 4, the motion was seconded and carried.

Mr. Knudsen stated that the amount could be paid within two or three years, but that voting power would be suspended during that time. Mr. Lang moved that the names of all members who pay in should be incorporated in the next premium list. Motion seconded, so carried. Following this motion, Sec. Knudsen read a letter from the Omaha Chamber of Commerce, inviting the Association to hold its next show in that city. In reviewing the high spots of the show, the secretary stated that there were over 750 birds entered, from five states, but in spite of this large number of entries, the fund had been diminished materially by free entries. Mr. Knudsen stated that although he is in favor of the free entry idea, if the next show were held in Omaha, the free entries would have to be cut down. Presidest Smiley, then proposed that a legislative committee be ap - pointed by the incoming officers. He explained that the appropriation for the Poultry Ass'n. is made in a lump sum with the State Fair ap - propriation, under the heading of Organized Agriculture. The $1,000 allotment for former years has been cut down to $600.00 for the past two years, and the duty of the committee would be to try to get an increase. Moved and seconded that a committee of 3 or 5 be appointed to contact the legislative body on behalf of the organization. Motion sec - onded and carried. Mr. Smiley suggested that various members of the Ass'n. might help out by writing members of the Finance Ways and Means Committee. </seg>
            <seg id="p720">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE This discussion of new and miscellaneous business was followed by the election of officers for the coming year. Mr. Smiley was nomin - ated for President, followed by a motion by Ellis that the nominations be closed. Motion seconded and carried.

Knudsen, and Treasurer Burnham were unanimously re-elected. The two retiring members of the board of directors, Skinner and Klingeman, were also unanimously re-elected.

SECRETARY'S REPORT NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION The Nebraska State Poultry Association was held in Lincoln, Jan - uary 7th to 11th, inclusive, 1935. As stated above, this was the fiftieth anniversary of this organiza - tion. Gold medals and prizes were awarded in accordance with the occasion. The Show was held at the Agriculture College in the horse judging barn and was really a very fine show. There were about one thousand birds on exhibition of practically every standard breed variety with a great number of banties, ducks, geese and turkeys. The weather was fairly good. A great number of people attended not only the exhibition but the many programs which were in evidence each afternoon and evening. One of the outstand - ing events was the afternoon judging exhibitions put on by Judge Smiley going over the winners in the different classes showing why these birds were first in their respective classes, and the defects, if any, were pointed out to a large crowd of people who gathered for this occasion. It was said by all who attended the judging that it was the most educational feature that had ever been put on at a State Show. The Hatcherymen of the State put on a great meeting and it was attended by a great number of hatcherymen from all over the State. Representatives from the International Baby Chick Association were there and gave some very good talks. Short talks were also made by the State Association officials and others who were on the program. A banquet was held at the Capitol Hotel on Thursday evening and was well attended, and at which time a gold offering that was to have been presented to Mr. L. P. Harris, a life-long member of the Nebraska State Poultry Association, was shown to the banquet crowd and then </seg>
            <seg id="p721">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION' delivered by President Smiley and Secretary Knudsen to Mr. Harris at his home in Lincoln. Mr. Harris was unable to attend the banquet due to the serious illness of his beloved wife. There were many outstanding birds in the different classes. This was especially true in the Hatchery Class, and the winners are to be complimented on their fine showings. The regular yearly meeting was held on Friday. All officers and directors were re-elected which are as follows: Erie Smiley, President, Seward. Martin Norberg, Vice-Pres., Franklin. J. M. Burnham, Treas., Adams. Harry Knudsen, Sec, Omaha. Hoard of Malingers S. C. Schwerin, Norfolk C. L. Ellis, Hastings L. A. Colglazier, Falls City John Skinner, Herman John Klingeman, Ulysses E. C. Jewell, DeWitt A good number of things came before this meeting and it was understood that the 1936 exhibition would be held at either Columbus or Omaha, Nebraska. The majority favoring Columbus on account of its new auditorium facilities. The Show closed on Saturday afternoon and it can truthfully be said that it was one of the most successful shows, (although not the largest) that has been held for many years.
