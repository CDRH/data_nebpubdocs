            <seg id="p015">. IN consideration of the fact that the annual meeting of the National Creamery Buttermakers' Association was to be held in our State this Winter, it was deemed advisable by the Board of Directors of the Nebraska Dairymen's Association to dispense with the usual program at their annual meeting, and to hold only an informal meeting and elect officers and adjourn. Consequently the material for this report has been collected from a good many sources, and we are under special obligations to Mr. E. Sudendorf, Secretary of the National Creamery Butter - makers' Association, for several very valuable papers and dis - cussions, which he has very kindly furnished us from his report of the Lincoln meeting of the National Creamery Buttermakers' Association. We are also under obligations to Hon. Henry Wallace, of Des Moines, Iowa, and to Prof. D. H. Otis, of Man - hattan, Kansas, for original papers for our report. F. H. Vaughan, Secretary. </seg>

            <seg id="p019">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL, CONVENTION. 19 REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON RESOLUTIONS Committee on Resolutions reported as follows: Resolved, That the State Legislature be urged to amend the law under which the Nebraska Dairymen's Association exists, so as to provide that the regular time of holding the meetings of our Association shall be in December, and that all Associations receiving appropriations from the State shall be required to hold their meeting on the same day and date. Resolved, That our members of Congress be, and are hereby most respectfully requested and urged to use all honorable means to secure the passage of a law taxing all oleomargarine colored in resemblance of butter, ten (10) cents per pound, and that the Secretary be authorized to forward a copy of this resolution to each Representative and Senator from this State. Resolved, That it is the sense of this Association that the Board of Managers use such amount of the funds as they may deem best for legal expenses in securing the enforcement of Pure Food legislation, in so far as the same relates to dairy pro - ducts. R. Smale, J. C. Merrill, S. C. Bassett, Committee. On motion the report was accepted and adopted. In regard to the Pure Food law, Mr. Rushton of the Pure Food Commission spoke of the work being done along that line. He said that when a man had no money to pay his own expenses nor funds to pay help, and the hands of those he relies upon are tied, he is most generally discouraged. That Mr. Hibbard was entitled to a great deal of consideration for what he had done, and has done all that he could do with the means at his com - mand. There was no man who could do any better. I would move that this body authorize the Board of Directors to extend such sums as they shall think best in their judgment for fees and costs in prosecuting oleomargarine cases wherever they may arise in this State. It we are ever going to have the laws of this State respected and enforced against this fraud, we must stand together and fight </seg>
            <seg id="p020">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. 20 them in the only way they can be fought, and that is by legal process. This resolution was then taken up and duly acted on. There being no further business before the meeting it ad - journed sine die. ADDRESS OF PRESIDENT Members of the Nebraska Dairymen's Association, Gentlemen: At the annual meeting of the National Dairy - men's Association held at Sioux Falls in February, 1899, the Association pledged itself to hold the next annual meeting at Lincoln, Nebraska. In view of this fact the State Dairymen's Association decided to dispense with a program at their annual meeting and to hold simply a business session during December and there arranged to join forces with the National Convention that was booked two months later. We decided to procure as much subject matter as possible or as we thought feasable from the addresses and reports at the National Convention and to incorporate these in our Annual Report, thus making what we thought would be a stronger report by far than what would or could emanate from a State Convention. Through the kindness of President Boardman and Secretary Sudendorf, we have been granted the privilege of incorporating much of this subject matter that we feel will be of interest to the readers of this our Annual Report. We have much to feel thankful for to all our friends for the willingness shown to make the convention at Lincoln a success. In the matter of' exhibits of butter, Nebraska showed up with fifty-one packages as against eighteen, that being the highest number at any previous convention. There being only about sixty-odd creameries in operation in February in this State, we feel Nebraska was thoroughly represented in the butter exhibit. As to scoring, we scored only one and forty-five one-hun - dredihs points below the State that secured the prize banner and came fourth on the list; Illinois first with fifty -nine entries, </seg>
            <seg id="p021">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 21 average score of ninety and fifty-two one-hundredths; Minnesota second with one hundred and ninety entries, average score of ninety and seventeen one-hundredths; Iowa third with one hun - dred and ninety-one entries, average score of eighty-nine and sixty-six one-hundredths; Nebraska fourth with fifty-one entries, average score of eighty-nine and seven one-hundredths; Kansas, Wisconsin and South Dakota following in order. The second prize for gathered cream was adjudged to our State with a score of ninety-three and the silver cup for separator goods with a score of ninety-five. The total number of entries of butter was seven hundred and eight packages, which was upwards of an hundred in excess of exhibits at any previous convention. I wish to personally thank those gentlemen, namely, Messrs. Haskell, Kelly, Weaver, Brooks, Lytle, Bassett, Vaughan and Stouffer, for their generous aid in collecting butter exhibits and as a Committee of Entertainment at the convention. This convention proved to be one of the most enjoyable and profitable of any yet held. So much for the convention. At the close of the fourteenth annual meeting of the Nebraska Dairymen's Association held at Fremont, December 22nd, 1898, it was ordered that President Haskell be empowered to appoint a Legislative Committee to draw up, and if possible secure the passage of a Pure Food bill at the coming State Legislature, the President to act as one of the committee. The following leport from J. H. Rushton gives in as few words as possible an idea of the work accomplished and condi - tions of the bill at the present writing: "Mr. Bassett, Mr. Haskell and myself were appointed as a Committee on Legislation to secure the passage of a bill creating the office of a Pure Food Commission. We drew the bill and secured its passage and the Governor signed the same promptly. On July 1st, 1899, Governor Poynter appointed Hon. F. B. Hibbard as Deputy Food Commissioner as provided in said bill. Owing to the position taken by Auditor of Public Accounts, the fund created by the bill has not been available to pay the salary and expenses of the office. </seg>
            <seg id="p022">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. 22 As soon as the position of the Auditor became known, and especially after the Armour Packing Company, of Kansas City, appealed for and secured a temporary injunction against the Governor and Deputy Food Commissioner Htbbard, in the United States Court, it became necessary to obtain counsel to look after these matters. To this end Mr. Haskell and myself were authorized in the name of the Dairymen's Association to employ such counsel. We employed under that authority Hon. A. M. Post, ex-Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and Hon. E. J. Hainer, of Aurora, Nebraska. Several parties were arrested in Omaha for violating this and the prior law, brought to trial before Police Magistrate Gordon, of Omaha, who determined that the law was unconsti - tutional and against public policy. This decision however, is not quotable in legal circles as binding the Supreme Court. A mandamus proceeding was commenced before the Supreme Court to compel the Auditor to honor Mr. Hibbard's vouchers and is now pending. We hope for a speedy and favorable de - cision from the Supreme Court in this case. The foundation for a successful defense of the injunction case in the Federal Court has, we think, been laid and we look for a favorable decision shortly. We beg leave to state that the thanks of the association are due to George Brooks, S. C. Bas - sett, George Haskell, Maurice Friend, Ed Lytle, W. E. Riddell, George M. Weaver, Thomas Frey, Mr. Christey and many others for hard work done and encouragement furnished, and to Hon. E. J. Hainer for his advice concerning the bill. This work is only partly done, the foundation is laid but there is much more to do. So far, the practical results have been much less than hoped for but the foundation has been laid and the superstructure must be built. Butter must be protected from the fraudulent imitation. Yours truly, i George Haskkll, S. C. BasSett, J. H. Rushton. </seg>
            <seg id="p023">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 23 i I have asked the Secretary to have incorporated in this report the "Brief on Part of Relator" as a matter of record. To this Legislative Committee consisting of George Haskell, S. C. Bassett, and J. H. Rushton, the sincere thanks of this As - sociation are due and through the President is heartily given, and individually to J. H. 'Rushton for his untiring energy and solicitude in the passage and prosecution of the violators of this law, without any return for time and expenses attending it. Now a word as to the dairy interests of the State. Many new separator stations have been built throughout the state and a number of creameries that have been abandoned have started up as skimming stations, the cream being shipped to some central point to be manufactured. This tending to centralize the manufac - ture at a few given points would seem to obtain a greater extent than in any other dairy state in the Union. The price of butter has ranged higher during the year 1899 than for a number &lt;5f years in the past. A heavy shrinkage in the make of butter began early in August and continued up to the end of the year, very few if any sections reaching their normal make again that year. In part I think this came about from the exceedingly high price of beef cattle, giving the farmer a chance to turn his old cows to the block at a very advantageous price thus deplet - ing the number of milch cows all through the State. This con - dition obtained through the northeast part of the State and I pre - sume was general. The high price of butter did not tend to increase the price of cream proportionately, as the cost of gath - ering and manufacturing was increased way beyond normal by ihe decrease in production at each station with the same expense attending the separation at given points. To the readers of this the Fifteenth Annual Report, these few lines are respectfully submitted. </seg>
            <seg id="p024">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION 24 « DAIRYING IN NEBRASKA. [A paper prepared by Hurmr Wallace, of Des Moine*. la. . for the Annual meeting of the Nebraska Dairymen's Association.) I am always surprised when I receive an invitation to talk to Nebraska farmers about dairy matters, because I always feel that there are certainly men in Nebraska familiar with local conditions who can discuss the subject more intelligently than any man living under somewhat different conditions. I shall, therefore, confine myself to the discussion of the generals, or those principles which underlie dairying under all conditions, rather than the details which pertain to the particular locality and State. First, then, the prime condition of successful dairying any - where and everywhere is an abundance of food suitable for dairy cows, and at all seasons of the year. Nebraska is a level plain, gradually rising from the Missouri, with a soil of wonder - ful fertility, having the latitude of winter wheat, corn, oats, barley, clover, timothy, and blue grass, and the longitude of all these on the eastern edge and gradually rising westward cover - ing the longitude of alfalfa, meadow fescue, brome grass, sorghum, Kaffir corn, and soy beans. All therefore, that it needs to secure not only an abundance of food, but of properly balanced cow food, in all seasons of the year, is the skillful cultivation of the soil by farmers who add to this the capacity to successfully care for the cow and her calf. I find that most farmers moving westward undertake at first to farm according to the methods to which they have been accustomed. They are growing clover, corn, and other grains, and they undertake to force nature to do their bidding instead of reverently inquiring what nature would have them do. They try to adapt the country to themselves instead of adapting them - selves to the country. I have not been all over your noble State and hence do not undertake to assert that in all parts of it and on every section you can grow an abundance of the foods I have mentioned, but I believe that except in the "extreme west, and possibly even in parts of that, the cow need not go hungry any </seg>
            <seg id="p025">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 25 month in the year nor consume anything but a balanced ration, provided the farmer adapts himself to the country and grows what the Maker of the country intended the land to produce. As an illustration : In Southeastern Nebraska you should have no trouble growing corn, winter wheat, clover, and timothy, and, in many sections, blue grass. With these you can form a dairy ration and have at all times an abundance of dairy food. As you pass to the northwest, however, you approach other con - ditions where clover cannot be depended upon, timothy and blue grass even less so, and you are obliged to substitute something «lse for dairy feed. This, however, has been provided to your hand if you will reach out and take it. There is no trouble in having an abundance of balanced rations for the dairy cow where j'ou can grow alfalfa. You can grow sorghum almost any - where and with" alfalfa, sorghum, Kafir corn, and soy beans, there is no difficulty in your answering the prayer of Agur, when ■offered by the cow : "Feed me with food convenient for me." Corn, alfalfa, and sorghum, or Kafir corn, soy beans, and *orghum, with other things grown on the farm, will furnish you a ration that will make the cow give down satisfactorily. Now, I undertake to say that in any part of Nebraska that can be called an agricultural country and where agricultural operations should be attempted at all, these can be grown and grown successfully, and will be as soon as the farmer learns to adapt himself to Ne - braska and ceases the vain attempt of adapting Nebraska to him - self. The food question, therefore, in all the agricultural sec - tions of the State is of easy solution if the farmer sets himself in dead earnest to solve it and farms like Sir Joshua Reynolds said he painted, "with brains, sir." Next to the food question comes that of the type of cow that should be used in the dairy. There are two types quite distinct; one the special purpose dairy cow, or, to speak plainly, the Jersey or the Holstein. This type should always be adopted when the farmer confines himself exclusively to the production of milk and butter or cheese. If he does not care to grow steers for the .market, if his farm is small, if he is a special purpose dairyman, 3 </seg>
            <seg id="p026">26 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. I would not advise him to waste his time in even considering anything else. Either of these are good enough for him and will be good to him if he is good to them. I would not advise him, however, to grow the steer calves of these breeds for the purpose of selling them as feeding steers. The Jersey and the Holsiein are each good enough as milk producers to justify the farmer in selling his steer calves for veal and growing only those that are essential to the building up of the dairy herd. Where, however, as on most farms in Iowa, the farmer is of necessity largely a grain raiser and cattle feeder, I would advise him to avoid these breeds and select the dual purpose cow. This is the cow for him. He is only incidently a dairyman. His main object is growing broad acres of corn as raw material for the manufacture of beef, and he must necessarily have an animal that will produce beef, good beef, and plenty of it. It is vital to him if he would maintain the fertility of his soil. I do not mean the absolute and essential fertility, for he could not exhaust this in a hundred years if he tried, for the good Lord will not let him, but he can in fifteen or twenty years by constant cultivation in grain so exhaust the humus that the Lord locks up the rest and hides the key where it can be found only by the man who will combine stock growing with grain raising, and both these with grass growing and the careful husbanding of his manure. That fellow will find the key to unlock the fertility and be well fed by nature's bounty. And the dual purpose cow is the cow for him, no matter what specialists may say to the contrary. If they were compelled to take his position and farm as he has to farm, they would soon find that they are confronted with a condition, not a theory, and modify their views to meet the condition. Now this kind of cow can be obtained in many ways. Were I starting out on a new farm and had cow feed in sight, I would buy up the best heifer calves I could find in the country, mate them either with a Red Poll, Short-horn, or Polled Durham sire, and among these I would seek for the best individual and prob - able succession of individuals. I would then raise the calves by hand and milk the heifers, giving them all the while exceedingly </seg>
            <seg id="p027">KI FT UK NTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 27 generous feed. I would give them all they could eat. Those of them which on full feeding would lay on fat, I would fatten and sell to the butcher, and those which persisted in keeping thin and turning into milk I would retain for my use. In this way, without a large expense, the farmer can let nature select for him a class of cows that will furnish both beef and milk. However, I would be careful in feeding them a balanced ration; that is a dairy ration. I would give them plenty of what - ever feed, whether corn, Kafir corn, or sorghum I might feed them. I would give them in due proportion alfalfa, sheaf oats, or soy beans, and clover where I could grow it. For pasture I would use timothy, clover, and blue grass where these would grow. Where they would not, I would use a mixture of grains or succotash and make my permanent pasture of brome grass, balancing up with alfalfa hay where I could get it, and where I could not get it I would use sheaf oats or soy beans, and failing in these would piece the ration out with bran where it could be had. Having the feed and the cows, the next essential to success in dairying is to take proper care of the calf. If I was patronizing the creamery, I would make the return of the milk sweet by sterilization in the summer season an absolute condition of my patronage of the creamery. Nothing disgusts a farmer so much as to be compelled to spoil his calf by feeding it milk sour one day, sweet the next, and each day with a different degree of acidity. His cows will give little enough to start with, possibly 125 pounds of butter fat per year, and when the farmer realizes that he is losing about as much on the calf as he is making out of his butter fat, he will conclude that dairying is a poor business and will say at his leisure what the old prophet said in his haste: "All (creamery) men are liars." When, however, he has his herd brought up to 200 pounds average, which with patience he can easily do, and has his skim- milk delivered to him sweet all the year round, he is not up to his business if he can not grow a calf worth, at present, at six months old, from $15.00 to $20.00, and when you can persuade the farmer that </seg>
            <seg id="p028">28 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. he can get $50.00 per year per cow, he will milk with joyful - ness of heart and sing while he is milking, the family joining in the chorus, and until you come in sight of this point, dairying is necessarily a slow business. Skim-milk, however sweet, is not enough. It is a wholly unbalanced food for a young calf, and one of the nice things in connection with dairying is to know how to balance the food and feed it properly. Fortunately, the work of our experiment stations is now available. It has now been clearly demonstrated that you can grow a first-class calf, if you have the skill in manipulation, on separator milk and corn, or Kafir, with per - haps the addition of u little flax meal at the start. We are foolish if we do not avail ourselves of these demonstrations of the experiment stations and do likewise, for the success that these stations have had in growing skim-milk calves is not the result of their superior skill in feeding the calf, but of their un - questioned obedience to the laws of Nature. Corn, or carbo - hydrates of some kind, is essential to success in growing a calf on separator milk. It supplies the one thing lacking. It goes to the sore spot. It is the pork added to the beans, the butter added to the bread, or the potatoes added to the codfish or the buttermilk. These are all balanced rations, and in mixing up foods for the calf we must do what our grandmothers have done for ages in providing rations for use on the table. The farmer should find out as soon as possible that any cow fit to be kept in the dairy will furnish enough separator milk for her calf and the calf's weight of pigs. While the pig's corn is needed to balance the calf's milk, the calf's milk is likewise needed to balance the pig's corn, and when we get to feeding half the separator milk to the calf and the other half to the pigs, we will at once grow good calves and good pigs, and inaugurate a period of "William" prosperity (whether you spell the rest of the name "McKinley" or "Bryan," it matters not). It will be a prosperity on the average Nebraska farm that no change of ad - ministration can upset. There is a time coming when the problem of securing sweet </seg>
            <seg id="p029">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 29 milk on the farm, which is now one of the most serious, will not vex us. For a new country like most of Nebraska, the skim - ming station, controlled by the central creamery, is essential. There is no use talking to the farmer about buying a separator until he has passed the A B C of dairying, whether he learn hat in Nebraska or somewhere else; hence, the skimming tation is the natural order of evolution. It is to the dairyman what the tabernacle was to the children of Israel in the wilder - ness, a temporary affair, and no less essential because it was emporary. When these people came into the promised land and were there a good while, the temple superceded the taber - nacle, and just so in time — it may be a long time, it may be a hort one, but in time the farm separator will supercede the kimming station. Why? Not only because it saves the ex - pense of hauling, but because it renders it possible to feed the separator milk to the calf, not only sweet, but warm, so that the armer with the aid of a hired hand or an active boy, can milk wenty cows, separate the milk, put it where it belongs, in the stomachs of the calves and pigs, in an hour and twenty minutes n the morning, while his good wife is getting the breakfast. They can then all sing, "Unto me, happily, the lines in pleasant places fell," and kneeling down thank the Lord of all that they live in a dairy section in Nebraska. And then when the milking machine is perfected and the farmer and his son can, without soiling their Sunday clothes, milk one hundred cows and feed the calves before breakfast, they may well conclude that the millennial dawn is purpling the distant East. I might go further and show you that with the closing up, sooner or later, of much of the range country, and with the in - crease of population, it will become imperatively necessary for the farmers in the corn and grass states to raise the bulk of the feeding cattle of the best quality, that these can be grown more cheaply on the dairy farm than on any other, and that the time is coming when no sensible farmer will undertake to feed any - thing else but steers of the best quality, which the dual purpose cow can furnish. </seg>
            <seg id="p030">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. 30 FEEDING AND DEVELOPING THE KANSAS DAIRY COW. [By Pmor. D. H. Otis, of the Kansas State Agricultural College.] The young man starting out in life sometimes wishes he had the wisdom of a Solomon, the eloquence of a Webster, the bravery of a Dewey, and the longevity of a Methuselah all wrap - ped up in his own little self. He would then be able to accomplish something in the world. As a dairy state Kansas is still a youngster, and at times some of her citizens long for a combination cow that gives milk with the richness of a Jersey, the sweet flavor of a Brown Swiss, and quantity of a Holstein, and at the tame time have the beef producing qualities of a Hereford. Such a cow would be a howling success. But fortu - nately, or unfortunately, Kansas cows, like her young men, have not inherited all the traits and characters of every individual of its species from Adam to the present generation. In every walk of life we find ourselves hemmed in by certain limitations, and the question is not so much how to get rid of these limita - tions as it is how to make the most out of them. We have in Kansas a large number of common, or scru cows, that are being used for dairy purposes. These cows are not all we might wish them to be, but they are what we have and we want to know how to get the greatest profit from them This thought in connection with the need of milk for our dair school led the Agricultural College to purchase a herd of typica Western Kansas cows, which, at the time of purchase, wer admitted to be below the average of the State. A record of part of this herd has already been published, but since then larger number have completed a year's record, and we now hav complete results from 28 head. The following table gives summary of the results: </seg>

            <seg id="p032">32 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. It will be noticed that the above record is divided into four parts, the most profitable five cows, the least profitable five cows, the debt contractors and the average of the herd. Taking up the differences in individuals, it will be noticed that the best cow gave 9,116 pounds of milk, which is 5,641 pounds, or 162 per cent more than cow 1 1 of the least profitable group, and 6,975 pounds, or 325 per cent above lowest debt contractor. The average of the most profitable cows is 3,019 pounds, or 68 - per cent above the average of the least profitable, and 4,350 pounds, or 140 per cent above the average of the debt contrac - tors. The largest yield of butter fat was 383 pounds, the lowest profitable yield 161 pounds, a difference of 222 pounds, or 137 per cent. Comparing the largest yield with the lowest yield we find a difference of 282 pounds, or 279 per cent. Com - paring averages we find that the best cows yielded 318 pounds butter fat, an increase of 140 pounds, or 78 per cent over the least profitable, and 190 pounds, or 148 per cent over the debt contractors. In the column headed "Cost of Feed", it will be noted that the best cows ate the most, the average cost of the most profitable being $31.49, the least profitable $27 40, and the debt contractors $26.32. This shows ihat good cows are good eaters, and it pays to feed them well. Suppose that the most profitable cows had been given only half the feed they received. They would still require about the same amount to maintain the animal system, and as is customary among cows, this require - ment will have to be met first, and the result would have been a very large shrinkage in profits. A man that is stingy in feeding a good cow is simply extravagant, and is working against his own best interests. Under "Value" we have three columns.one giving the income of butter fat produced at creamery prices, another giving the in - come from skim milk at 15 cents per 100 pounds, and the last column giving the total income per cow. All these figures are interesting and instructive to the dairyman, and will bear study, reflection and comparison. Perhaps the most interesting column in the table is the receipts, less the cost of feed. Here </seg>
            <seg id="p033">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 33 it will be noticed that our best cow gave us $40.37 profit, and our least profitable cow $3.28, a difference in annual income of $37-°9» or "3 per cent. In other words these figures mean that our best cow, as far as dairy products are concerned, is worth twelve cows like No. 27. By adding the receipts less cost of feed of our poorest eleven cows, we have a total of $41.63, or just $1.26 cents more than the receipts from our best cow. Taking an average of the most profitable five cows, and we have receipts of $28.89 P er cow - Contrasting this with $6.35, the average receipts from the least profitable five cows, and we see there is a difference of $22.54, or 355 P er cent. In other words an average cow from the most profitable five cows is worth as much as 4J4 cows from the average of the least profitable five cows. As will be seen from the table, there were four cows that run the college in debt for their feed, the average deficiency being $2.35 per cow. Three of these cows are al - ready sold for beef and their connection with the college will be severed as soon as the Dairy Association is over. The last column is also an interesting one, showing the cost of producing a pound of butter fat. Our best cow produced butter fat at 8 cents per pound, and our poorest at three times that, or 24 cents per pound. It should be noticed that the cows that cost us the most for feed, are those that produced butter fat the cheapest. The cost of a pound of butter fat was 9 cents with our most profitable five cows, 15 cents for the least profitable, and 20 cents for the debt contractors. In the portion of the table headed "Average of Herd," the first line gives the average of the whole herd of 28 head under experiment. The second line gives the average of the herd as it would have been without the four unprofitable cows. In both cases the test happens to be the same, but it will be noticed that these four unprofitable cows reduced the average of the herd of 411 pounds of milk and 17 pounds of butter fat from what it would have been with 24 cows. They caused a reduction in the average income per cow of $3. 27, and in the receipts, less cost of feed, of $2.68 per cow. With the 28 head butter fat was </seg>
            <seg id="p034">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. 34 produced at 13 cents per pound; take away the four unprofit - able cows and it cost 12 cents per pound. In the above calcu - lations the price of feed has been figured at what the farmer could realize for it if he sold on the local market in Manhattan. la considering profits from the cows, we must bear in mind that the farmer has first realized a good profit in growing the feeds. So the dairy farmer who raises his own feeds obtains two profits instead of one. With all the above facts and figures before us, can any one doubt the necessity of studying individuality of cows, and yet there are men who say that a cow is a cow wherever she is found, and will pay little attention to weeding out and grading up a herd. What stronger evidence does a man need to show him one of the greatest leaks in the profits of the dairy business. No mechanic would continue to use an engine that would con - sume more fuel than the value of the product that it turned out. How much less should the dairy farmer continue to use an un - profitable cow machine- Both are not only useless, but they are eating up the profits made by the profitable machines. Improvement: The history of this scrub herd is not all told in the first year's record. Ten of these cows have commenced on their second year's record, and the following table gives the length ( For this )f time milked in the second year, the yield of butter fat period, and the yield of butter fat for the corresponding i last year. period &lt; PROGRESS REPORT ON SECOND YEAR RECORD.

            <seg id="p035">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 35 From this record we see that cow No. 28 became ashamed of her record as given in the first table, and started out for the second year at the rate of 98 per cent increase. Nos. 5 and 11 follow with 65 per cent and 62 per cent increase, respectively. There are two cows, Nos. 6. and 30, that have fallen below their first year's record. On the average, these cows have improved at the rate of 32 per cent. The greatest improvement seems to be with the poorest cows, although the best ones increased from 1 1 per cent to 24 per cent. This table shows very clearly that it is possible, by proper feed and care, to materially increase the productive capacity of the cow, even after maturity has been reached. This improvement not only shows in the record, but in the appearance of the animals also. We have pictures of some of these cows shortly after arrival on the college grounds, and again after one year of college education. A glance at these pictures will reveal some remarkable improvements. But the improvement of the dairy cows does not stop here. This is only a beginning. A trip to the college barn will give you an opportunity to inspect a small herd of dairy calves, from which we expect great results in the future. These calves are grade Guernseys, iheir grand dam having produced as high as 600 pounds of butter in a year. They are being fed and han - dled with a view of developing dairy cows. This process of grading up, coupled with weeding out the poor cows, will result in a few years in securing a herd that will far exceed the orig - inal slock. The results obtained in the above tables are largely due to feed, and if improvements are to be made in the future, the feed problem will have to continue to receive serious consideration. I take it that we are all familiar with the "balanced ration" and that we all agree that the cow cannot make milk without raw material to work with, and that in order to do her best she must have this raw material in certain relative proportions. But even after the ration is "balanced" there is still considerable latitude for choice. One ration may be much more expensive than an - other. </seg>
            <seg id="p036">36 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. We have tried a number of rations, and find that on pasture or by feeding soiling crops to our cows, we can produce butter fat at from six to nine cents per pound. From January 29 to March 25, 1898, our cows were fed on alfalfa and Kafir corn meal and produced butter fat at an average of 11.9 cents per pound. For a period of two weeks we fed Kafir corn meal one-third, bran one-third, ground oats one-third, and what Kafir corn stover they would eat During this short period we produced butter fat at 10.8 cents per pound. A ration of one-half Kafir corn meal, one-half soy bean meal, with what Kafir corn stover the cows would eat, produced butter tat at 12.3 cents per pound. When it became necessary to use high-priced concentrations, the cost of producing a pound of fat increased to 15, 16, and 17 cents per pound. This points to the fact that it will pay the dairy farmer to raise his own feeds. For this purpose alfalfa and corn or Kafir corn are undoubtedly the cheapest. If impossible to get alfalfa, try red clover and soy beans. The clover is worth about two-thirds as much as the alfalfa, and the soy beans are richer in protein than oil meal. By knowing the value of the different feeds and exercising a little forethought, it is possible for the dairy farmer to grow all the feed necessary for his cows on the farm and thus save all or nearly all the high-priced feed bills. Notwithstanding the fact that there is money in milking cows, money in raising feed for them, and prospects for a much greater profit by proper feeding, selection, and breeding, the crying need of our creameries and dairies is more milk. Just at present there seem to be a tendency to quit milking cows in order to raise calves for beef, many farmers believing that a good steer cannot be raised on skim milk, but must have whole milk and all that the cow gives. How to convince men that there is money in dairying even when beef is high, is one of the problems of the day. With some men this is impossible; with others it will re - quire a certain amount of education. The first thing to be con - sidered is whether the farmer knows how to feed. Considering the way some men feed their cows, it is no wonder they are dis - gusted with the dairy business. The best way to teach a man </seg>
            <seg id="p037">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 37 the principles of feeding is to send him to the Agricultural CoU lege. If he cannot take the regular course, let him plan to take the short dairy or farmer's course during the winter months. It is to the interest of every dairyman, creameryman, and creamery patron in the State to see that as many young men as possible from their neighborhood shall avail themselves of the opportun - ities offered at this college. Whenever a farmers' institute is held or ought to be held in your community, it is to your inter - est to see that it is well worked up and advertised. Don't wait until the day of the meeting and then live in hopes that some way or other there will be a good turn out, but for weeks before the subject should be so agitated that everyone in the neighbor - hood will feel that he cannot afford to miss it. By getting the people together in this way it would then be possible to give them instruction in the principles of feeding, which so many need. Another valuable way in which the desired instruction could be given is for the creamerymen to see that the men at the weigh cans thoroughly understand the principles of feeding, and can figure out balanced rations and vary the ingredients so as to cost the least. By a combination of these various methods it is impossible to give great impetus to dairying from the feed stand - point alone. But Kansas can never expect to reach the goal in dairying un - til she applies more business principles to the handling of cow machines. This shifting from milk to beef and back again from beef to milk, is a practice that is eating the very bottom out of our profits. After a man spends several years in grading up a dairy herd, it is folly for him to change to raising beef animals from the same herd, just because beef is higher than butter fat. Such changes cannot be made in a day, and by the time he has accomplished this end the tables will be changed, and butter fat will be higher and beef lower, and he will then wish he had the experience, the growth, the development he would have had by sticking to one thing and making the most of it. What would you think of a doctor who had spent years in preparing himself for his profession, to decide to become a lawyer, just because </seg>
            <seg id="p038">38 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. lawyers were drawing larger fees at a given time? By the time he completes his law course, likely as not, the doctors will be reaping the largest profits. In the meantime he has lost all the experience and skill he would have attained by sticking to med - icine. By shifting this way from one thing to another, a man will go through life making a failure of everything. What men need to be impressed with to-day is that they should have a specialty, and stick to it. As will be seen from the above figures, the question is not so much how we can get more cows, but how we can get cows of a better brand. We want and ought to have cows that yield so much that the farmer cannot afford not to milk them, no matter the price of beef. To do this, records and the methods of men who are making a success of the dairy busi - ness need to be brought before the public. This, in connection with experiments and instruction at the college, in connection with constant agitation along the lines of feeding and breeding, will undoubtedly bear fruit, sooner or later, in raising the standard of the dairy industry throughout the State: THE VALUE OF THE SKIMMING STATION IN DEVELOPING THE CREAMERY INDUSTRY. [A paper read by F. H. VAUGHAH at the State Farmer's Institute, held at Lincoln. Dee. 17th. | Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : Something like ten years ago in the town of Saint Albans, Vermont, the experiment was first tried of building up a large creamery business on the skimming station plan, which plan means the establishing of skimming stations in locations where sufficient milk can be obtained within easy hauling distance from the station, and a large and thoroughly equipped central factory so located by reason of its railroad connections, that cream can be quickly and cheaply transported from the station to the central plant.

            <seg id="p039">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 39 Europe, and the result has been unqualified success, inasmuch as it cheapens the cost of manufacture, improves the quality of the goods produced, and in many ways tends to give the creamery business a stability and a commercial standing which it had never enjoyed before, and the general tendency among our most suc - cessful creamery operators for the last few years has been to - ward consolidating their business by the skimming station system- It is a sad fact, but a fact nevertheless, and a fact which can be easily proven by the idle creameries and the discouraged patrons, not only in our own State but almost every State in the Union, that capital invested in the creamery business has been, so far, a mighty risky investment, and that while the business of dairying in itself is one of our noblest industries, and should be one of our safest, inasmuch as the investment is not large and the return is sure, yet I will venture the assertion that there has been more money lost in the creamery business within the last twenty-five years in proportion to the amount of the investment than in any other business proposition which the agricultural public has had to deal with. The reasons for this state of affairs are probably many and are somewhat varied with different localities and different condi - tions, yet in my judgment there are two reasons which stand out particularly prominent, and these are, first, that the supply of milk was too small to enable the plant to be run successfully as a creamery, and the other reason is "inefficient management." It is the same old proposition that any fool can farm and it has been demonstrated over and over again that almost any one who has had no previous experience in dairy or creamery work can "bust" up a creamery. While as a matter of fact there is no business enterprise, which, to be successful, requires a more thorough understanding of the details of the business all the way down, from the cow on the f.irm to the time when the butter is on the consumer's table. In the management of creameries in the past there has been too much haphazard work, too much trusting to somebody else, and above all, a lack of business methods and business ability, the appli- </seg>
            <seg id="p040">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. 40 cation of which is just as necessary in running a creamery success - fully as in running a bank or mercantile business, and the creamery manager who lacks these qualifications very soon drops out of the race, the creamery is closed up and the patrons get dis - couraged and declare that the creamery business is a delusion and a snare, and that hereafter they will let the calves do the milking and give all creamery promoters a wide berth. There is scarcely a town of any size in the State of Nebraska that hasn't had its creamery experience, and in a very large per cent of these cases, the experience is about all the people have left to show for their money. But the advent of the skimming station and the central factory bids fair to work a revolution in the creamery business and place it on a sound business basis. In fact it is doing all of this, and the tendency among creamery operators everywhere is to - wards consolidation. In consolidation there is economy in real estate and equipment. A well equipped skimming station costs about one half as much as an equally well equipped creamery, and the operating expenses are correspondingly less. Just exactly as economy comes in dis - pensing with fifty churns and fifty butterworkers on fifty farms and using one large churn and one large butterworker in the small creamery, so economy and advantage come from using two or three still larger churns in the central factory and dispensing with the fifty churns in the fifty small creameries and instead of employing fifty buttermakers in the small creameries to make fifty different kinds of butter, 75 per cent of which sells from one to two cents per pound below the highest market quotations, we employ one buttermaker and this one buttermaker, the most skill - ful and competent of his class, in the great central factory and give him a half dozen helpers to make a carload of butter a day of one kind and of one quality, and which is shipped on to market by the carload, and which by reason of its uniformity and its high character, has a market value for either immediate consumption, storage or export, of from one to two cents per pound over the comparatively small shipment of the small creamery. </seg>
            <seg id="p041">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 41 In labor the same advantages are true, the same in fuel, the same in the purchase of salt, the same in the purchase of pack - ages. At every step the net cost of making a pound of butter decreases with the number of pounds made. The possibility of reducing the cost is in direct proportion to the magnitude of the business as it is carried on, provided that the concern is well managed. The more farmers that can be brought together, the greater the number of farmers whose product can be brought together to be manufactured into butter at one place, and under one man - agement,the less the cost and the greater the advantage to every producer of milk and cream contributing to the manufacturing establishment. When you increase the magnitude of your busi - ness, you increase the possibility of paying well for competent men to conduct the work, and one of the special advantages in this skimming station system is that it makes it possible to secure the ablest possible management, which the small creameries can not afford. I fail to see where there is one serious objection to this system. Every point in the whole matter shows the possi - bility of advantage and economy. I do not need to go outside of our own State to furnish you with a practical illustration of the success of a great creamery system built up on the skimming station plan, for, right here in the City of Lincoln, you have one of the largest and finest equipped creameries in the world, and, while I have no personal interest with the Beatrice Creamery Company, yet, from the standpoint of a friend of the great dairy industry, I consider that the promo - ters of this great enterprise have practically solved the problem of how to build up a large and successful creamery business in Nebraska and place it on a sound commercial basis. Its financial affairs are conducted as systematically as are the finances of any bank in Nebraska. The thousands of patrons who bring their milk to the eighty odd skimming stations of this great concern, have perfect confidence that they will get their checks for butter fat furnished on a certain day of every month, and the creamery has never disappointed them. </seg>
            <seg id="p042">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN 's ASSOCIATION. 42 They have leased at least a dozen creameries which had failed up, and were standing idle, and have again lighted the fires under the boilers and started the separators to whirling, and have breathed new life and enthusiasm into the discouraged patrons. They have caused skimming stations to be established in the remote parts of our State, and in localities which had never before been able to avail themselves of the benefits of dairying, and have placed within the reach of a good many thousand farmers a good and safe market for the milk products of their dairy herds. Whenever and wherever they have leased a creamery or started a skimming station, it has always been run with the regularity of clockwork, whether it paid out or not; and, while it is probably true that they are operating several stations which have never, as yet, paid running expenses, yet, considered as a whole, the results have been very satisfactory. While the business of this great creamery enterprise is, as yet, in its infancy, and the output of butter ought to, and doubtless will, be doubled and trebled as the business gets to be better understood and appreciated, it has furnished a practical demon - stration of that grand old principle that in union there is strength, and that "united we stand and divided we fall," and the people of Nebraska have a right to be justly proud of the great creamery enterprise which has already accomplished wonders in developing the dairy resources of our State, and which owes its success first, last and all the time, to the potency of the skimming station. KEEPING MILK IN SUMMER. I From the Experiment Station of the Kansas State Agricultural College, Manhattan.] During the Summer of 1898, the milk from the college herd of thirty cows was sent to the Manhattan Creamery. Our object in sending the milk to the creamery, instead of making butter, was to test how cheaply milk could be handled, and yet be delivered in good condition, and how few and cheap things could be used to keep milk sweet for a sufficient time, so that Saturday night's and Sunday morning's milk could be delivered in good condition </seg>
            <seg id="p043">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 43 on Monday. Many creamery patrons are unable to keep milk sweet longer than eighteen hours, and either feed the milk of Sat - urday night and Sunday morning, or else set it and make butter for family use. They are not properly equipped for making butter, and most of them do not secure nearly all the butter fat from the milk, while at the same time, as it only comes once a week, the work is a nuisance. If milk can be kept sweet at a reasonable cost from Saturday night until Monday morning, those who live at a distance from creameries can hold their milk and deliver every other day, sav - ing half the expense of hauling. Creamery men told us that if we could make alternate-day delivery of milk practicable for farmers with little money, a large amount of milk could be se - cured for creameries and skimming stations in the newer dairy districts, where the amount now secured is not sufficient to make the business profitable. The Manhattan Creamery is one and one-half miles from the college dairy, and our milk was hauled to the creamery by a neighboring farmer, who handled a milk route, the college milk receiving exactly the same treatment while on the road as that given the milk from the neighboring farms. We had a creamery room which cost us $100, and was fitted with a cement floor and ice box; but farmers, who had difficulty in keeping their milk, said that they, too, could keep their milk if they had such a place, but that the average farmer could not afford the expense. We therefore abandoned this room, and built what one of our farmer boys called an "every-farmer-can-afford-it" milk house. We set some posts and nailed to them old fence boards, making a room ioxioxio feet, with a dirt floor. As the old boards could not be set close enough to keep out either sun or rain, we covered them with building paper. This building, if made of new ma - terial, would not have cost over $10, and did not cost us over $5. The room was built around a well. We had a windmill, but did not use it, as we wanted to keep milk under conditions where a farmer could not afford one. For tanks in which to set the cans of milk we used oil barrels, sawing them in two. We also took </seg>
            <seg id="p044">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. 44 a half-barrel and boxed it in, packing the spaces with wheat chaff. This box was covered with quilts made from bran bags. The only apparatus used not generally found where milk is handled cheaply was a milk cooler. At different times we used the "Star," made by the Star Cooler Company, Haddonfield, N. J., and the "Champion." made by the Champion Cooler Com - pany, Cortland, N. Y. In handling this milk, the care was taken that previous experi - ence had taught us was necessary for keeping milk under any conditions. Every utensil touched by the milk was thoroughly washed, and then sterilized with scalding water. If even a small quantity of dirt is left in the seams or corners of pail, strainer or can, it supplies an abundant source of the bacteria which cause milk to sour. No matter how clean the milker's hands seemed to be, they were washed in hot water just before milking, to destroy all milk-souring germs that might be in the dust or dirt on them. The sanitary milk pail was used. This pail has a cover into which a 6-inch opening is cut. In this open - ing fits a removable strainer. The milk is milked directly into the strainer, and the cover keeps out of the milk the fine dust which falls from the cow's body during milking. This dust is full of the bacteria which sour milk. When the milker sat down to milk he wiped the cow's udder with a damp cloth to remove as much dirt as possible and dampen the rest, so that it would adhere to the udder and not fall into the milk. The milk was strained into 40-quart cans, and as soon as a can was filled, it was taken to the milk room, where it was immediately cooled to 60 ° to 62 ° by passing over a milk cooler. The cans contain - ing it were then placed in the half-barrels, and these barrels filled with freshly pumped water,and barrels and cans covered with bran bags. The water was changed morning and night. With this treatment, and without ice, milk was kept and delivered regu - larly, through our hottest weather, in good condition, to the creamery, when forty hours old, the time required to hold Satur - day night's milk for Monday's delivery at the creamery; and much of the time we were able to keep the milk in good condi- </seg>
            <seg id="p045">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 45 tion fifty-two hours, the time required when Saturday morning's milk is kept for Monday's delivery. We believe that this trial, extended through the Summer, proves that any farmer in the State can deliver milk in good con - dition to the creamery in the hottest weather, and deliver Sunday's milk as well as that of other days. Most farmers can afford very much better conveniences than we had, and those who can will be able to handle their milk with less labor than we had to use. The souring of milk is caused by the growth of bacteria in it. The fewer the bacteria in the milk, and the slower they grow, the longer will the milk keep. If cleanliness be observed, the number of bacteria in new milk will be few. Bacteria double in number in new milk every twenty minutes when it is at blood heat. They grow slowly at 50 ° and not at all at 39 ° . The sooner milk is cooled after being drawn from the cow, the longer it will keep. The usual way to handle milk is to set the cans containing it in a trough of cold water and stir occasionally, until the milk becomes cool. It may be an hour or two before the milk in the center of the can becomes thoroughly cooled, and all this time the milk-souring bacteria are developing rapidly. It will pay any Kansas farmer to use a cooler. In these machines cold water flows through the interior, while the milk flows over the outside in drops, each drop being quickly and thoroughly cooled. The saving in labor over the usual method of stirring, will soon pay for the cooler, while the quality of the milk is made much better. With freshly pumped well water, the Star cooler will reduce milk in hot weather from blood heat to 62 ° as fast as the milk will flow over it. The Champion cooler will reduce the milk to within 10 ° of the temperature of the water by once passing over it, and a lower temperature can be secured by run - ning the milk over the cooler a second time. With either cooler the milk is aerated while being cooled. This removes the "cowy" odors from it. Where a cooler is used, we prefer to use the New York can instead of the Chicago can, now generally used by Kansas dairymen. As is shown by the cut, the New </seg>
            <seg id="p046">4 6 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. York can has a raised cover. This can may be entirely covered with water in the cooling tank, yet it will not leak. When used for hauling milk it will not collect dirt, besides being easier to clean than the Chicago can. We found in hot weather that the temperature of our milk rose 10 ° while on the road to the creamery, and that some farmers were delivering milk as high as 97 ° . Milk should be kept as cool as possible while on the road, and ought not to be above 70 ° when delivered at the creamery. If it is, the quality of the butter from it will be be injured, and the creameryman will have to pay a lower price for butter fat. MILKING SCRUB COWS. [Press Bulletin No. 39. Kansas Experiment Station. Manhattan.] From January i to April 15, 1898, the College bought thirty head of common scrub cows, with the object of testing the value for the dairy of this class of cows when properly handled. These cows were purchased in Lincoln County; cost, delivered at Manhattan, an average of $34 each; were selected by a farmer who was not a dairyman, and in quality were below the average cows of the State. The cows were shipped from Lin - coln County to Manhattan (100 miles) in mid-winter, the excite - rhent and weather causing a serious drop in the milk yield of those that had calved. The first week the average daily milk yield per cow was i$j4 pounds, the second week 21 pounds. At the start the cows were fed alfalfa hay and a mixture of two-thirds bran and one-third old process linseed meal, a ration rich in protein, designed to stimulate the milk flow, and to par - tially overcome the effects from shipping. As soon as the cows were brought to a fair milk flow, they were put on a ration of alfalfa hay and Kafir corn grain. This ration produced the greatest flow of milk with butter fat at least cost, but had to be dropped at the end of seven weeks, so that various feed-stuffs could be fed, in order to show our dairy classes the effect of various feeds on the texture of butter. The daily grain ration </seg>
            <seg id="p047">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 47 averaged about eight pounds per cow while on dry feed. While on pasture the daily grain ration averaged three pounds of a mixture of four parts corn meal and one part of bran. Alfalfa hay was also kept in a rack where the cows could eat it at will when they were brought in at milking time. The yield held up well through the fall drouth. For a short time green Kafir corn was fed with the pasture, and the cows were pastured on wheat in the Fall until the ground became frozen. Twelve cows were fresh when received January 5, the rest calving in from one to five m'onths. The records here given are for the twelve for 1898. The butter fat yielded has been cred - ited at the prices paid each month by the Manhattan Creamery, which were as follows: January, i7j£ cents; February, 17 cents; March, 16% cents; April, 15 cents; May, 14^ cents; June, 13 cents; July, 13 % cents; August, I5J4 cents; September, 16 cents; October, 18 cents; November, 18 cents; and December, 17 cents. The feed has been charged at the average retail price in Manhattan for the year: Cost per 100 pounds, corn meal, 55 cents; Kafir corn meal, 55 cents; linseed meal, $1.25; soy bean meal, $1; bran, 55 cents; cotton seed meal, $1. Cost per ton, alfalfa hay, $4; corn ensilage, $1. Pasture, 75 cents per month. It would pay many Kansas farmers who live distant from market to milk cows, if, through the milk, they could obtain the above prices, with no additional profit. Results. — Average yield of milk per cow, 5,707 pounds; best cow, 9,116 pounds; poorest cow, 3,583 pounds. Average yield of butter fat per cow, 238 pounds; best cow, 383.7; poor - est cow, 135.7 pounds. Average cost of feed per cow, $29.20; best cow, $32.80; poorest cow, $26.75. Average value of butter fat per cow, $37.75; best cow, $60.88; poorest cow, $21.39. Average value per cow of skim milk at 15 cents per 100 pounds, $7.69; best cow, $12.29; poorest cow, $4.83. Average income per cow from butter fat and skim milk, $45.44; best cow, $73.17; poorest cow, $26.22. Average receipts per cow, less cost of feed, $16.25; best cow, $40.37; poorest cow, receipts 43 cents less than cost of feed. Average cost of butter fat per pound, </seg>
            <seg id="p048">48 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. 12.2 cents; from best cow, 8.5 cents; from poorest cow, 19.7 cents. The* average price received for butter fat for the year f was 15.8 cents. To the receipts given above should be added the value of the calf at birth. This test shows the difference in value between different cows with feed and care alike. The year's record of our best scrub cow (9,116 pounds) of milk, 383.7 pounds butter fat, equal to 451 pounds butter; value of products, $73.17; returns, less feed, $40.37, is one that many a pedigree dairy cow would be proud of. This cow is of mongrel breeding, but has a pronounced dairy form. The poorest cow's form is good beef type, and her yield of 3,583 pounds of milk and 135.7 pounds butter fat was Worth forty-three cents less than the feed she ate. Is stronger argument needed to induce Kansas dairymen to cull their herds and keep only the best? This test shows that Kansas cows can be made to give greatly increased yields with proper feed and care. We collected the records of eighty-two herds owned by creamery patrons, in one of the leading dairy sections of the State,finding an average annual yield of milk per cow, 3,441 pounds; butter fat, 104.5 pounds; value of butter fat, $19.79. Contrast this with the average for the College scrub herd: Milk, 5,707 pounds; butter fat, 238 pounds; value of butter fat, $37.75, and remember that the Col - lege herd is much inferior to the average herd of the State. We attribute the greater yield secured from the College scrub herd to three causes. First, at all times their rations were either balanced, or contained an excess of protein — the material which builds blood and milk — while the Kansas cow usually, while on dry feed, has only half enough protein. Second, kindness and shelter. Our scrub cows were petted, comfortably sheltered, never driven faster than a slow walk, and never spoken to in an unkind tone. Third, a full milk yield was secured through the summer drouth by giving extra feed. </seg>

            <seg id="p050">50 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. HONORABLE JAMES WILSON. [From the Eighth Annual Report of the National Creamery Buttermakers Association.] Mr. President, I came out here to meet the dairymen of the United States because I wanted new inspiration for my work. I thought I would enjoy it because I belong to your crowd. I prepared a paper for you, consisting of about sixteen to eighteen typewritten pages. I will give that to your Secretary, and will now talk to you a little while off-hand. I want to find out on my visit here what instructions you have for me and the other people of the Agricultural Department down there. I must say this is the most interesting butter convention I have ever seen. I did not know anything about Nebraska until I came here. The dairy industry of the country has been moving west - ward from the Atlantic seaboard until it has reached the Mis - souri Valley. It has moved westward because a pound of butter or cheese can be made more cheaply here than it can be made further east, and crops are most profitable where they are most naturally at home. The Missouri Vaiiey produces everything along agricultural lines more cheaply than it is produced any - where else that I know of. The cheapest meat, poultry, butter and cheese are produced out here. The dairy industry of the country will not move further west because the conditions that produce cheap butter and cheese are not found further west. There has been a movement, and is a movement now, westwardly to supply the demand in the moun - tain districts of the country and on the Pacific Coast. A good deal of butter and cheese has gone out that way. It is a most interesting study if one would take up the growth of the United States and find how our friends in the eastern states are benefited by additions to our territory, and their development and settle - ment. We are living here in what is known as the Louisiana Pur - chase, and if it had not been purchased, we would all be Frenchmen to-day. None of the acquisitions of the United </seg>
            <seg id="p051">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 51 States meant so much to the eastern people as the Louisiana Purchase. It begins down at Louisiana, goes up on the west side of the Mississippi River, goes out to the Rocky Mountains, and then goes down. If we did not happen to own that country there would not be very much balance of trade come back to the United States from the foreign countries. Our eastern fnends made railroads into that Louisiana Purchase, and that meant markets for manufactured goods, and it meant close competition for the products of meat and grain. I might say, incidentally, that the acquisition of territory from Mexico added very little to the total surplus of agricultural products in the United States. The Mountain States do not begin to feed themselves; the Pa - cific Coast can not feed itself. Carloads of poultry, butter and cheese go out to feed the Mountain States and to California and other Pacific Coast States all the time. We are endeavoring in the Department of Agriculture to extend our markets further than that. We are just getting reports from two tons of butter and cheese sent to the isles of the Orient, to ascertain what the market is out there, and how it should be packed when it is sent there; what the customs are out there; whether it would be profitable for you, under present conditions, etc. We merely want information. We want facts to lay before you in the bul - letins to the farmers and dairy articles which may be of interest to you. At the present time there is not very much profit in shipping good butter to the Orient. We found the Canadian there; we found the Dane. And there is nothing more interesting to me than to study this Dane and his manner of producing butter. Out here, in this grass and rain belt, perhaps you do not realize it, but the oil meal and most of the raw material which fed his dairy cow was furnished to him by us, and he sold on the mar - ket $33,000,000 worth of butter. In the isles of the Pacific and the far West, there we meet the Dane with the result of that oil meal we sold him. Then I come to respect and admire the en - terprise of the Dane in doing that kind of work. He goes over 3,500 miles of water, and more than 1,000 miles of land to get </seg>
            <seg id="p052">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. 52 the corn of Nebraska and Iowa and the oil meal from Minne - sota, and takes it back to make butter and cheese of it, and then sends it across the world to compete with the butter and cheese we are making. But, brother, can we not do better? Can not the royal free-born American citizen do better than to raise feed for Danish cows? Why can we not make butter out of that corn and oil meal out here, and ship the stuff westwardly, and have the market to ourselves? The Canadian, bright fellow, comes down south across the line and gets feed for his cows, and he meets us in the markets of the world. I am reporting facts to you, gentlemen, as far as that is con - cerned. The price paid for Canadian and Danish butter in the Orient at the present time is very much as the price being paid now in the markets of the United States for butter and cheese. Our people in the United States have been growing the last few years in capacity to consume butter and cheese, and the work - man is busy everywhere. He is getting big wages every - where; he eats creamery butter every where. (Applause.) And there is no market on the face of tht earth like the United States market. If you would study political economy a little while you would find a strange disposition on the part of the people of all nations to come into this market of ours. Still, I regard it as the duty of the Department of Agriculture to find markets for you in every part of the earth, and to find means of getting there. There is no refrigeration beyond San Francisco. We must find a means to ship from there. When we wanted to ship butter, it had to lie there three weeks and then be shipped in a Japanese vessel, at their terms, of course. We cannot make terms with a foreigner. We can always do something with a railroad company ; they sympathize in all our efforts to extend the markets of the United States. Now, another fea - ture in foreign markets, and that is we developed the fact, in shipping to Great Britain, that you make just as fine butter as is made anywhere. The English buy $80,000,000 worth of butter a year; their capacity to buy butter grows at the rate of $10, - 000,000 per year. They get their butter made in that country, </seg>

(Applause.) Now, we have the facts regarding shipping to that country ; turning our attention elsewhere, we established the fact that American butter is not excelled, and very seldom equaled any - where. Then the fellow with his process butter of different kinds — there may be a good process butter; I never saw any — (applause) — and the fellow with oleomargarine and these other abominations, slipped in behind us and marked it "Fine creamery butter," and fooled the Englishman once; they could do it once, but not a second time. So we shipped to Canada, and the Cana - dian sent it over, and the fine butter is sold as Canadian butter, just as our beef is sold as English beef. I had thought, if you thought well of it, to see to it that the certificate of the United States is attached to first rate creamery butter when it is sent out of the country. One or two men in New York, one in Penn - sylvania, and one in Boston could see to it, and they would be of very little expense. We lost the market for cheese one time after it had been built U P by good cheese; we lost it by the filled cheese; and now we are losing our good name for butter by the rascality of the people who substitute inferior for first-class goods. The proposition is before Congress to assess a tax of ten cents per pound on all imitations of creamery butter. The fat of the cow's milk, averaging fine goods, will bring twenty cents per pound throughout the year; just now the fat from the steer, hog, horse and other animals that have fat, is worth four cents per pound. Now, it is not only wrong to call this creamery butter, it is not only wrong to defraud the creamerymen, but it is wrong to defraud the poor man who goes out to buy butter for his fam - ily. If it is originally worth four cents, and the labor attached to getting up the deception costs four cents more, then there is still eight or ten cents between the product of creamery butter and oleomargarine. Now the objection that they make to this bill is that it is wrong and unfair in commerce to stop the sale of </seg>
            <seg id="p054">54 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. any food which the poor man may be willing to buy. We are willing to agree to that — to agree that horse fat, hog fat and any other fats may be sold on the market for what they are. (Ap - plause.) But we do not want them to be sold in imitation of the product of the cow. (Applause.) I want to touch on another point to-night, as I am speaking in Nebraska, in the corn belt. There is no industry that can bt pursued by the western farmer that will permanently maintain the fertility of the soil, and bring in so much monev year by year, as the product of th« dairy cow. You may go on making butter forever and forever out here, and as you sell it and make money and get rich, you are only selling off the atmosphere. Nebraska has three sugar factories: Now, there is just one thing: They are either wasting tke by-product of the factory, or they are feeding it to the cheap steer. I made experiments regarding the sugar beet in Iowa. It makes excellent butter; it colors it yellow ; it has no deleterious volatile acid like turnips, cabbage and some other vegetables have; it is worth just as much to the dairy cow after you have taken out the sugar as before, because the cow gets all the carbonaceous matter she needs in hay, corn, etc. It will save the dairymen of the coun - try the purchase of nitrogenous matter with which to feed the cow. I know of no industry that can be engaged in by the people of the great northwest that will equal the raising of sugar beets, making sugar out of them, and then feeding to the dairy cow. These rich prairie soils will give you twenty tons to the acre wherever you can get a good crop of corn. The sugar that grows on one acre is worth $60, and that comes from the atmosphere just the same as butter. The raising of beets, to - gether with the dairy industry, will enable the farmer to go on year after year without destroying the fertility of the farm to any ex - tent whatever. I have a good many statistics in that paper I have written. The dairy interests of the United States has grown to be $500, - 000,000 worth a year. It might occur to people at first blush that, on account of such an enormous output, and such an in- </seg>
            <seg id="p055">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 55 crease as is coming on in all of the states, particularly in those of the Northwest, that butter will eventually be a drug on the mar - ket. Let me say that as far as other countries are concerned, it will not be a drug, because other countries will quit before we do. We can produce it cheaper than they can. I asked an agent in my Department once why more factories were not built out in the corn belt, and he said there were so many things they could do out there and get rich, that they didn't have to build factories. There is $100,000,000 held up to pay the people who make sugar in the United States. They buy 1,800,000 tons every year from foreign countries. We could grow the whole thing here without paying anything out for fertilizers, as they must. We can even compete with the people in the Hawaiian Islands, and I have no doubt at all that, just as soon as American customs, habits and day wages reach those islands of the East, that have become the property of the United States, we will be able to produce sugar as cheaply as they do down there. Gentlemen, I have talked quite a while. I thank you for your attention. (Applause.) PAPER PREPARED BY SECRETARY OF AGRICUL - TURE, HON. JAMES WILSON. [From the Eighth Annual Report of the National Creamery Buttermakers' Association.] The dairy industry of the United States has moved west - wardly with the movement of the people. More than half of the 16,511,950 dairy cows found in the United States ten years ago were in the Mississippi Valley. Dairying has been increas - ing in this section of the country ever since, but we must wait for the next census to give the exact figures on this subject. Crops are naturally produced where they can be grown cheapest. The cheapest butter and cheese are made on the prairies, where grass and grains grow most abundantly. The </seg>
            <seg id="p056">56 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. pioneer would not milk cows. The exclusive grain grower did not take kindly to dairying, nor does he now. Early education on a dairy farm, or dire necessity, are the prevailing influences that lead to the establishment of dairy herds. Nebraska in i860 had 6,995 cows, which was 241 to the thou - sand persons. She had 28,940 head in 1870, which was 235 to the thousand persons. She had 161,187 head in 1889, or 357 head to the thousand persons. In 1890 she had 505,045, or 477 to the thousand persons; and no doubt the census of 1900 will show an increase of dairy cows compared with the population, indicating the necessity of the dairy as population increases, where conditions are the same as they are in Nebraska and other northwestern states. Where the farm is small and the family large, the dairy cow makes work that is always profitable. She has no equal on the farm as an employer of labor, and as a faithful rewarder of those who care for her, provided she is located where food is abundant and cheap. The Eastern States, including New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, are decreasing as dairy states, compared with the growth of population. In 1870 the group had 230 cows to the thousand persons. In 1880 it had 220, and in 1890, 193 to the thousand, while the number of cows increased from 2,833,022 to 3,351,061 in the twenty years. Cheap feed and cheaper trans - portation are the factors that control these conditions. The cen - ter of dairy activity will not move further west; as population increases west of the Missouri River, as far as American juris - diction extends, the demand will increase for dairy products. The mountain districts and the islands of the sea will grow in many directions, but they cannot compete with the Mississippi Valley in dairy lines. The dairy industry has had, and is still getting, direction and impulse from our state agricultural colleges, where the sciences relating to milk are being studied, and where correct practice regarding the making of dairy products is being taught. The dairyman is well ahead of the milk producer in these directions, </seg>
            <seg id="p057">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 57 and the transportation of dairy products from the West to the East is quite up to the requirements of the occasion in most neighborhoods. We generally send butter from the Mississippi Valley to New York for about the same price the commission man charges to sell it when it gets there. This can be done be - cause it goes from the dairy districts of the West in carload lots. The Department of Agriculture is sending out dairy goods to foreign countries. We find Danish butter products in every market. Inquiry shows that we are in league with the Dane to help him compete with us. In 1898 we sent him 16,874,943 bushels of Indian corn and 155,121,048 pounds of oil cake with which to balance the ration and make it suitable to the dairy cow. We send him our mill feeds generally, which enables him to make very fine butter, suitable for all climates. We meet the Dane everywhere we send American butter and cheese. We sell them raw material; they sell the product of skill; and they sold $33,000,000 worth of butter products last year. I admire the enterprise of the Scandinavian who sends to the Mississippi Valley for cow feed, that he may better operate in the markets of the world. Can not the American farmer do better than grow cow feed for anybody? Why not use our own raw material at home, and sell the products of skill in the markets of the world? This will all stop in the next few years. Our people will want the profits that now go to the foreigner. We will feed our cheap stuffs to horses, cattle, sheep, hogs, poultry, and the dairy cow. Prosperity within the United States makes a home market, and causes -the consumption at home of most of our fine dairy goods. Our people are all busy at the present time, get - ting good wages, and are eating the highest selling products of all kinds. American manufactures now equal the combined out - put of the three greatest European nations, and the people who make these goods live better than the workmen abroad. This makes a demand for butter and cheese. We are growing faster than any three nations of Europe, which will make a growing demand in future. Foreign workmen do not use fine creamery 5 </seg>
            <seg id="p058">58 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. butter, as American workmen do; they can not afford it. We expand at home as we manufacture for the outside world, and, as we expand within the United States, build more factories and shops, set more people at work, who do not make butter and cheese, and provide a better market for the dairyman. We expand abroad where the dairy industry is not likely to be a leading feature for many years to come. When our new 12,000,000 brown people begin to go to school and learn from us to grow better crops of coffee, rubber, and other tropical products that we cannot grow, they will get a taste for fine dairy products, for beefsteak and corn dodgers, and, as they rise in the scale of living, they will call for more of our products of all kinds. They will earn better wages growing the things that we buy, but cannot produce here in the States, and as they earn more, they will buy more. I remember when we who pioneered out here forty years ago, did not have quite as many things for our table as we have now. We could not afford to indulge then. We have not expanded for the sole purpose of selling creamery butter to the brown men, or selling anything else, but home expansion of our industries gave cream - ery butter to our workingmen, and expansion over the islands will set a better table for the brown men — clothe them better, and give them better houses to live in. The time should come when the American dairyman, after fully supplying the home demand for his goods, will have a surplus to send abroad. The markets at home are demoralized when just a little more than they require is sent to them; and, besides, we can furnish the world with its butter, cheese and condensed milk cheaper than any of our competitors can. The prairie country can have no rival with equal facilities. To the end that our people should be entirely familiar with foreign markets and their requirements, shipments have been made, and will continue to be made, to countries where there is any prospect of doing business- along dairy lines. Acting upon the advice of a special agent, who made a personal investigation in the early part of the year 1898, no trial exports have yet been made to France. Hamburg was tried, but the results were such as to discourage the continuance </seg>
            <seg id="p059">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 59 of the experiments. Great Britain was settled on as by far the most attractive market now existing for American dairy products on the other side of the Atlantic. Great Britain imports far more butter and cheese than any other nation. In order to supplement her own product, she is now paying other countries more than eighty million dollars an - nually for butter. The imports of the United Kingdom for a number of years show a pretty steady increase of ten thousand tons of butter a year. That is, the British need to import for their use at least ten thousand tons of butter every year more than they did the year before. This offers ah opening for supply from other countries which exists nowhere else. The United States can easily supply this demand if it is expedient to do so. We have demonstrated conclusively that we can send over just as good butter to England as they can get from any other source, place it in the markets there in just as good condition, and the only difficulty in doing a large business in this direction seems to be that, for a large part of the time, our own people want all of the good butter we can make in this country, and will pay more for it than anybody else. This has been the case during a large part of the time, for a number of years, and all the time in some years. Of the different British markets, London and Manchester have been those most carefully tested by the experimental exports ot the Department. London has been found extremely conserva - tive and difficult to persuade to even try a new article, instead of one already known, so long as the latter can be had. Manches - ter is more liberal, and has readily taken all the butter we have sent to it, paying fair prices, expressing itself pleased with the article, and wanting to get a good deal more than we have been able to furnish. There are still difficulties encountered in the export of perish - able products, because of the lack of accommodation in the es - tablished lines of transportation. These can be overcome, how - ever, and are likely to be whenever the growth of the business is sufficient to warrant regular provision of satisfactory facilities. </seg>
            <seg id="p060">60 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. Inquiries have also been made as to the needs of Oriental mar - kets in the way of dairy products, and experimental shipments have been made to the Sandwich Islands, and several places in Japan and China. No refrigerated transportation can yet be se - cured from our Pacific ports, and, consequently, all butter sent to the East must be in tins or other hermetically sealed packages. Our people have paid very little attention, in the past, to prepar - ing butter for export in this form, and up to the present time we hardly do so well in this line as some other countries. Conse - quently, in the matter of preparation and suitable packages, we have found successful rivals in the markets of the Orient. These subjects are receiving necessary attention now, however, and we shall shortly be able to do as well as any country in these particu - lars. The matter of price, however, seems to be against us in China and Japan. The markets for butter there are at present quite limited, and seem to be pretty well supplied with a satisfac - tory article, which is sold considerably cheaper than we can at present afford. During the past year Canada has been selling good butter in Japan, and Australia has been doing the same thing in China, at just about the same prices as those which have prevailed in San Francisco and Portland. Under these circumstances, there is, of course, no present inducement to export westward from the Pacific Coast. Every western farm, where milkers can be had, should have a dairy herd. I have gradually come to the conclusion that feeding and handling for milk is quite as potent as milk - ing heredity. Any farmer can have a profitable dairy herd by beginning with the common cattle of the neighborhood, feeding abundantly for milk, and sending to the butcher every cow that is disposed to fatten rather than give milk. He should use the best milking blood he can afford to buy on the male side. He should grow luguminous plants to avoid buying mill feeds, and have green forage for his cows where his pastures have dried up at any time in Summer from possible drouth. He may breed fat steers from his dairy cows, if he requires feeding </seg>
            <seg id="p061">61 FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. steers, or he may select toward the extreme dairy type, if he so prefers. Meats are dear and will continue to be dear, because population increases faster than cattle. The ability of people to eat beef also grows, and the demand abroad continues to increase. The western dairyman cannot always milk as many cows as will consume all his grain. The corn-growing states will be the leading dairy states, but the dairy cow can not consume all the corn. It is most economically fed in making fat after the dairy cow has had enough of it to keep her warm. The hog could use up the surplus corn, but much roughage is wasted when grain is fed to the hog that might otherwise be turned into money by making beef and mutton. The opening up of new markets has an evil attending it that requires correction. We convinced the English people that American butter is as fine as anything they can make at home, or get from any other foreign country. The consumer there will pay as much for it as he will for the finest English, Irish, French or Danish make. As soon as these facts were estab - lished, and the demand for American fine creamery butter became brisk, imitations were sent abroad, branded "Fine American Creamery." You can deceive a man once that way, but you are not likely to deceive him twice. The people in Great Britain became suspicious of American butter. Inferior goods, process butter, etc., were sent over and branded with the name of our fine American creamery goods, but the reputation established by the Department of Agriculture was destroyed by this substitu - tion. We have ascertained that those who do make and handle the finest creamery butter are sending it by way of Canada. The Canadians take great care that their beat dairy goods go from the Dominion to the world's markets with the Dominion's certifi - cate. Much first-class American butter is going to foreign mar - kets that way at the present time. We have proof of this, and no one can blame the American creameryman for desiring to get his butter to the consumer who will pay the most for it. In fact, there is no question of patriotism connected with it. The Cana - dian can come over to the United States, buy our finest creamery </seg>
            <seg id="p062">62 NEBRASKA DAIRYMKn's ASSOCIATION. butter, label it Canadian, and send the Canadian certificate with it, which commands the highest price. I have recommended to Congress the wisdom of having certificates given to first-class creamery goods going to foreign countries. This could be done at very little expense, and the certificates on our dairy goods would protect them, as the certificates on our meats commend them to foreign countries. The whole thing could be done by a few agents ;«t export cities, under the management of the Bureau of Animal Industry, which controls the inspection of our meats. The cows in ihe United States were not counted until 1840, but have since been enumerated for every decennial census. It has required from 23 to 27 cows to every 100 of the population to keep the country supplied with milk, butter and cheese, and provide for the export of dairy products. Tne export trade has fluctuated much, but has never exceeded the produce of 500,000 cows. With the closing years of the century it is estimated that there is one milch cow in the United States for every four persons. This makes the total number of cows about 17,500,000. They are unevenly distributed over the country, being largely concentrated in the great dairy states. Thus Iowa leads with 1,500,000 cows, followed by New York with almost as many, then Illinois and Pennsylvania with about 1,000,000 each. The states having over 500,000 each are Wisconsin, Ohio, Kansas, Missouri, Minnesota, Nebraska and Indiana. Texas is credited with 700,000 cows, but very few of them are dairy animals. In the middle and eastern states the milk product goes very largely to the supply of the numerous large towns and cities. In the central West and Northwest butter is the principal dairy pro - duct. The following table gives approximately an exhibit of the quantity and value of the dairy products of the United States in 1809: </seg>
            <seg id="p063">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 63 • ESTIMATED NUMBER OF COWS AND QUANTITY AND VALUE OF DAIRY PRODUCTS. Cows Product *$£ per^Siw' Total Product Rate cts. This gives the grand total of the dairy products of the country a value of $451,600,000. If to this be added the skim - milk, buttermilk and whey, at their proper feeding value, and the calves dropped yearly, the annual aggregate value of the produce of the dairy cows exceeds $500,000,000. Accepting these estimates as conservative, they show that the commercial importance of the dairying of the United States is such as to command attention and justify all reasonable provisions for guarding its interests. THE TRUE POSITION OF THE BUTTERMAKER AMONG THE PATRONS. [From the Eighth Annual Report of the National Creamery Huttermakers' Association.] The true position of the butter maker among the patrons is the subject assigned me. I will be as brief in my remarks on this subject as I possibly can. The patron of the creamery is the one that furnishes the milk, in either good or bad condition, out of which the buttermaker makes the butter, which has to sell upon its merits. The patron, therefore, must be, without question, recognized as one of the interested parties, and should be so treated by the buttermaker, because without his patronage and a good quality of milk or cream, the creamery would have to close down. Now, to get a better idea of the buttermaker's duties among the patrons, it will be necessary to find out the weak points of P. H. KIEFFER, STRAWBERRY POINT, IOWA. .1,000.000 Butter J 1,000,000 Cheese 5.500.000 Milk 130 lbs. 300 lbs. 380 lbs. 1,430,000,000 tt&gt; 300,000,000 tb 2,090,000,000 el I •257,400,' 27,000,i 167,200, </seg>
            <seg id="p064">6 4 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. the patron. The patron of a creamery, as a rule, takes up dairying as a secondary business, and does not give it his main attention; therefore the buttermaker should assist and instruct, the patron on the points directly connected with dairying, which makes the position of the buttermaker among the patrons very plain. He should interest himself, and at every available opportunity talk to the patron about dairying. Tell him how to take care of his milk in order to deliver it at the creamery in the best condition. Tell him to first brush off the loose dirt on his cows before he commences to milk, so that no dirt shall get into the milk. Always strain the milk after milking before setting it to cool. Teach the patron how best to cool milk by setting it in cold water right after milking, and then stir it once or twice, about an hour apart, so as to check the growth of bacteria, leaving that part to the buttermaker. Tell him how to wash milk pails and cans: First, to rinse them well with warm water after emptying them; then wash them with as warm water as one can bear the hands in, using plenty of soap or washing powder; then scald them with boiling water, and set the pails and cans in the open air with covers off until used again. Also talk with the patron how best to feed milk cows, to get the most milk at the least possible expense. Prof. Haecker, of the Minnesota Agricultural College, gives us great light on this subject. He says that in feed stuffs there are three groups of substances which must be considered in formulating a ration to secure best results. These are known as protein, carbohydrates and fat. Protein is the name of a group of nutrients containing nitro - gen, and furnishes material for the formation of lean flesh, blood, tendons, nerves, hair, horns, and wool, and of the casein and albumen of milk. It is therefore necessary for an animal to receive a certain amount of protein in order to maintain existence, grow, or produce milk. The other elements in all foods are simply fat and heat producing. A cow, or, in fact, any animal, can use only from five to seven </seg>
            <seg id="p065">65 FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. pounds of the heat producers to one of protein. If we feed more carbonaceous matter without increasing the protein, there will be an abnormal shrinkage in the flow of the milk, because the increase will cause the animal to commence laying on fat. He also says that all our ordinary food, both in grain and rough - age, contains carbohydrates largely in excess of an animal's needs, and, mix the grain and roughage grown on the farm as we will, it always follows that we are short in protein, or have too much of carbohodrates. In compound rations from crops, we always find it necessary to resort to some mill products containing a high percentage of protein to make good the shortage, except in cases where clover hay and alfalfa are available. From the above we learn, in order to get the best results, one should feed a proper ration, and the buttermaker should advise each patron to write to some good dairy paper asking it to give him the proper ration for the kind of feed he has and wishes to feed. Be social with patron; invite him into the creamery. Tell him all about the machinery; explain the running of it; tell him all about the testing; show him your butter; let him taste of it. In fact, let him feel that you are interested in him, and are anxious that he should do well with his cows. Let him feel that he is really interested, then he will take more pains and look at the dairying part of his business more carefully, and furnish better milk, and possibly more of it. I have always noticed that the patrons that are the best acquainted with the buttermaker, and talk the business over with him, are the ones that make the best success of dairying. Thanking you for your kind attention. DISCUSSION. Mr. White: I think the one point brought out by Mr. Kieffer, that the buttermaker should know more about the quality of the feed is a very important subject. It is true that less than half of the dairymen are feeding anywhere near a balanced ra - tion, or a ration that will produce a good flow of milk; this could be obviated if the buttermaker would use his influence </seg>
            <seg id="p066">66 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. along this particular line, and every buttermaker should be, and can be, influential if he will take the pains to look into it a little bit. Mr. Nelson (Minn.): Mr. President: I have had a little experience on the question. We have had several men up there lecturing on the question of balanced rations. Mr. White was up there, and he talked some on the balanced ration, and he also had a blackboard and figured out the balanced ration, and the farmers saw the figures, and saw what they were doing, and you would be surprised at the results. I took my pencil and paper and figured out a balanced ration, and I have tried to stay by it. One man came to me and said he didn't know how to figure it out. I told him if anybody else asked him, for him to send them to me. I told him to read the circulars that were sent out, and he could figure it out in a minute. Now, Onega County is pro - ducing much more butter than it did. I would ask the farmer what he is feeding, and then suggest to him what changes to make. F. L. Park: I would like to know what he thinks of the silo; whether he thinks it pays or not. Mr. Nelsons I am not prepared to answer that question, but there are several here who have had experience, and I would like to hear from them. Mr. Michels ( Wis.) : I have had no experience with the silo; I have had experience in feeding a balanced ration. A neighbor of mine thought he was not doing as well as he ought to, and I figured out a balanced ration on the feed he was feeding, and inside of four days he was getting 468 pounds of milk, and the test was was just the same as before, and he had gained 120 pounds. President Boardman : The buttermaker should figure out the balanced ration and tell it to the farmer. If he leaves it to the farmer we do not know of one in ten who will figure it out and see what it should be. I think the buttermaker or cream - eryman ought to figure it out and distribute the figures among his patrons. </seg>
            <seg id="p067">6 7 FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. Mr. Nklson: I think the President's suggestion is a very good one. Those who have tried it for the last ten years know it is true. Mr. E. O. Evenson (Minn.): There is no question in my mind but that these points should be brought out in local organi - zations, and I would suggest that every dairy neighborhood havfc an organization, either county or smaller, to bring out all of these questions which will wake up patrons of creameries and dairy - men generally. They will read a paper and not pay any atten - tion to it until they are waked up by some man who knows something about it, and then they get interested, and when they pick up a paper containing something of this kind, they study it and learn from it. I can see more good brought out in the last six months than in any period prior to that, just from our local organizations. Chas. Kaemmer (Minn.): I would like to ask Mr. Evenson how he gets the farmers interested so that they will attend these meetings; we tried it in our county but could not get them out. Mr. Evenson : The only reply I can make to that is that we could not get the farmers to come our, but we go to the farm - ers. We go around to different places. We have had as high as 100 patrons at a meeting. School house meetings, anyway to bring them out; we must not be particular as to formalities. A Member: Mr. President, we have a gentleman with us here, Mr. Bates, who will tell us something about the silo. Mr. Bates ( Wis.) : I have long since decided that a silo is all right. One thing I want to call your attention to more par - ticularly is that on the state farm in Wisconsin they have very thin, light soil. They have thirty-one cows, and on fifteen acres of silage raised on very light soil they fed them very light rations from the time they put them in, in September, until the next June. Sometimes they supplement summer feed with it. There is no question among our practical buttermen that they get a benefit out of the silo at a time when their dairy brings them the most money. It is positive that the farmer ought to have it. They plant it in a great many different ways; some- </seg>
            <seg id="p068">68 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. times they plant it three times — an ordinary corn, a late corn, and a very late corn. They claim it is worth just as much at a time when the corn is in the milk as it is later; by planting it thick they get a much greater product per acre. I have seen cows that looked as good in the months of January and Febru - ary as they did in June on grass, and they did just as much in their milk. W. W. Day (Iowa): There is a point that has not been brought out here on the balanced ration, and that is as regards the cow. Now, we have a man in our county who has been studying this for some time — the secretary of the creamery. He tested his cows a few days ago, and thought that he had it down fine. He has two cows that have been milked the same length of time; each gave the same amount of milk. It seems that each cow was fed identically the same. The feed was weighed to the cows, so that he knew it was just the same kind of feed. One tested 4 per cent and the other 4.5 on the same feed. He has another cow that is fed exactly the same feed as these cows, and she gave nearly three times as much milk, with a test of 5 6 per cent, and that cow will test over 5 per cent the year around. She is giving now something over forty-five pounds of milk, with a test of over 5 per cent. So I think the point that the farmers should test their cows is a good one. I know one man who was continually finding fault with his test. I tested his milk separately, and found his highest cow only tested 3.2; his aver - age test is always small. I think the balanced ration will cut no figure with some cows, so it is best to get rid of these. Mr. Anderson (Iowa): This gentleman from Minnesota covered most of the ground on which I intended to speak. We have got to commence with the farmer. There is no use of this convention talking over a balanced ration; that is the work of the patron of the creamery, and if we can not get them inter - -ested, it is of very little use for us to talk about it. The move that Iowa dairymen and buttermakers are taking just now is all right, I think. It is to get instructors, the same as Minnesota; to have instructors in the field to rouse the Iowa farmers up. s They are </seg>

Any one who writes him for a bal - anced ration, from any part of the United States.will be answered and given a balanced ration for that particular country. We can not do anything along that line unless we reach the farmers themselves, and as our milk is almost all hauled in by haulers, it. is practically impossible for the buttermaker to make any im - pression with the balanced ration argument unless he gets out to the farmers themselves, and gets them interested. Mr. Van Norman (Ind.): One of our creameries is contem - plating the employ of a man to instruct the farmers along these lines. How many of the creameries represented here have a buttermaker or man connected with the creameries who is able to - give them these instructions? I was wondering how many creameries have such instructors. Member from Minnesota: The Minnesota boys are evi - dently too modest. I know of a number right here who could do that work, but they refuse to rise and say so. They have taken up that work and know just how to instruct farmers. President Boardman : I think that if the creamery will let us know when it needs a man of that kind, and is willing to pay a man well for it, that it will have plenty of applications. Member from Minnesota : I was in Connecticut at a dairy convention, and this question of feed in the East is a very im - portant one. While there I got a statement from my creamery for the month of December, and when this question came up I read my statement from ray creamery, and I found I was getting as much for my butter in Minnesota as they were in Connecticut. I also found they were paying $18 and $18.50 per ton for corn - meal. The other feeds were in almost the same proportions in price, and when I told them how cheaply we could buy bran, and how we could get corn for eighteen to twenty cents a bushel, and as to oil meal, we didn't feed very much because we didn't think we needed it, they said : "You can make butter at half </seg>
            <seg id="p070">• NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. 70 what we can make it, and you can send it to New York almost as cheaply as we can; we can't see why you don't all go into the dairy business and get rich." I could not think of any reason except that the people out our way were get - ting so that they didn't like to milk the cow. I simply make this statement so that you can see the way we are fixed out here, and the way they are fixed back there. Instead of selling our corn, if we would gel it into the right kind of feed and feed it to our cows, we could beat them out of the market. Mr. Sutton (Neb.): This question of silos and balanced rations is one that I can see to be of very great importance to farmers and dairymen. I have no lengthy formula to offer — something that is simple and short: something that may be ap - plied to every farmer, in Nebraska, at least. My formula for a balanced ration would be plenty of good corn ensilage and alfalfa or clover hay. This is something every farmer can pro - duce, and can formulate and mix in proper proportions. Member: I would like to ask Mr. Sutton what proportions of each of these he uses. Mr. Sutton: My practice is to use about forty pounds of ensilage and all the alfalfa hay they will eat, and a very little bran. Alfalfa and ensilage I raise on my farm. Mr. Park: I have made one or two bad mistakes in dairying in so far as this balanced ration is concerned. The only. way we can get the farmers to feed is to get them to feed bran and en - silage. Two years ago I had a man feeding my cows, and they got pretty thin, and I took charge of them and told him I warned to get them to look a little better. We commenced about two months before they came in, and we fed corn meal very liberally, and when they came in they simply kept on gaining flesh, and it was not two months before the butcher was after me for those cows, and we were very much disappointed. I don't know very much about dairying. I know of some cows I wanted for dairy - ing, and I have simply fatted them by feeding corn meal. The only thing for me now is to find out whether silo is best, and we </seg>
            <seg id="p071">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 71 will feed them silo and bran, but as to a balanced ration, I know verv little about it. m Mr. Norton : I have been using a silo for the last ten years. I have always tried to balance my rations as well as I could myself, and last Winter I wrote Gov. Hoard for a balanced ration, and told him what I would have in the way of roughage and grain, and he fixed me out a balanced ration, and my cows never did better. Mr. Anderson: What was that ration? Mr. Norton: 1 had ensilage and clover hay and corn-fodder run through a shredder, and I had grains. The ration he gave me was to give them all the rough feed they would eat, and six pounds of an extra of corn-meal, oals, or wheat, and about two pounds of bran and two pounds of oil meal a day. I have been using corn for silage, planting it in hills about eight and a half inches apart, and we put in four or five stalks in a hill. Question: I would like to ask if it is not necessary to feed a cow very light for the first week or two? Mr. Norton: I wouldn't feed too heavy, but if you are feed - ing a balanced ration, she is not likely to go off on milk. If your ration is balanced, you can't throw her off on milk. Secretary Wilson: I will explain what a balanced ration means. Just a word for the benefit of our friend here who is using prairie hay, and wants to know something about a balanced ration. We have two illustrations of the balanced ration. One is the mother's milk as a balanced ration for the young thing. The chemist, inquiring into the composition of the mother's milk, finds it best according to the per cent of fat and the nitrogenous matter found in it. The cow's milk runs from one part of nitro - genous matter to four or five or six parts of carbonaceous matter. That is one kind of balanced ration. Nature balanced it herself, and she never makes mistakes. There is another balanced ration; let me call your attention to it. When you put the cow out in the Spring to new grass about three inches high, she never gives better milk. You don't need to give her anything else. The experiment stations have been </seg>
            <seg id="p072">72 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. busy in the past few years finding out whether it is necessary to feed bran or anything else while the cow is on green grass, and they find that the feed is all right. M it is young clover, it will have one part of nitrogenous matter to perhaps three parts of carbonaceous matter. As it grows older, the proportion of car - bonaceous matter will increase, one to five and six, or one to seven, as the maturity of the grass gives indigestible matter. Young timothy is not so different from young clover, although it has not so much nitrogenous matter. We go to the mills for mill feed. If you think of it, the mill man only wants the carbonaceous matter. If we go to the sugar mills they want nothing but the carbonaceous matter. Go to the oil mills, and they want the oil, and leave all the nitrogenous matter; go to the flour mills, and they do not want the bran or nitrogenous matter ; they let the cow or the horse get that. You need a great per cent of nitrogen. The most nitrogenous matter I know of is dry blood. This is nearly all nitrogenous. The meal you get from wheat has one part of nitrogenous mat - ter to six of carbonaceous matter; oats about one part of nitro - genous to seven of carbonaceous, and when you come up to corn, it has one part of nitrogenous matter to about ten of carbona - ceous. Corn contains everything to fatten, but if you are feeding it to the dairy cow, then you are not feeding the material from which you can make milk. I want to say this about grasses. They are all valuable to the dairy cow if she gets them while they are young enough. Prairie hay is all right if you cut it when it is young. If you wait until it gets old there is a great deal of stuff that can not be digested by the cow. By all means get nitrogenous matter into your feed. Alfalfa is all right. The alfalfa of Nebraska will beat the dairy cow of Iowa every time. But find out what kind of nitrogenous food will grow in the country where you live, and if you can't find out, write to us down there, and we will set the whole scientific department to work to solve the question. (Applause.) A Member: Mr. Wilson says just when the grass is about </seg>

I have made a practice of feeding a little hay every night when the cow comes up full of grass; the hay seems to relieve her. I always feed a little bran, too, and the cow seems to get away with it. If it is not good for the cow, why does she eat it? Secretary Wilson : I have seen cows and horses both turn from the finest feed on earth to go and pull straws from an old thatch roof. Now, a little dry feed, such as hay, would not be a bad thing for the cow. But as to the bran you are feeding, I assure you the subject has been carefully inquired into by the experiment men, and, as a general proposition, it does not pay. You can't beat the young grass of the West. Mr. Sutton: I would like to ask the Secretary if good, well-kept corn ensilage and alfalfa hay is not a pretty good thing for the Nebraska dairyman to anchor to. Secretary Wilson: It is, indeed, although I was raised in Iowa, where we do not save 10 per cent in silage. When you feed the corn fodder to the dairy cow it is not as good as silage, but if you make a long box and put the corn in it, put some water on it and scatter a little meal over it, and leave it there during the day, it makes a pretty good feed. The difference between the corn fodder and the silage is that one is sweet and one is sour. You don't always get the right scald on silage. If you get it a little bit sour it is not so good for butter. Mr. Littlefield (Kan.): The Secretary spoke of cotton seed meal as good for cows. I would like to ask can our patrons afford to pay the $8 or $10 difference between that and bran — that is, pay $8 more a ton for that than for bran. Secretary Wilson: I know of no one thing, unless you take dry blood, that is equal to the cotton seed meal. It has about one part of nitrogenous matter to two and one-half parts carbonaceous. We fed as high as five pounds a day to a cow on the Dairy Farm in Iowa to see whether it was injurious to the cow, and what kind of butter it would make. There is nothing </seg>
            <seg id="p074">74 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. that will make better butter. If I were a northern man, even if bran were exceedingly cheap, I would send and get some cotton seed meal. HOW CAN THE QUALITY OF MILK DELIVERED FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF BUTTER BE IMPROVED? [From the Eighth Annual Report of the National Creamery Buttermakers' Association.] Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : I am asked by the Secretary of this Association to write a ten - minute paper on the above subject, but I cannot see how I can occupy your attention for more than about two minutes on this subject. I might go on and give a lot of rules for taking care of milk, such as are given out by the Secretary of Agriculture and the different state dairy commissioners, such as: Keep the cow's udder in a clean condition. See that the pails and all milk utensils are thoroughly sterilized. Remove the milk immediately from the stables, and cool or aerate it. Leave the covers off the cans, etc. A great majority of the milk patrons either have these rules, or they know them by heart. Those who do not know how to take care of their milk properly must be taught how, either by the buttermaker or the creameryman, by furnishing them with literature, or by a great deal of talking. Now, when we get all this done, where are we at? We are not much better off than we were before, because there are always a few who know how to keep their milk, but positively refuse to do so. The dairy inspector comes along, and looks at their milk, then goes home and writes them a letter, telling them the condition their milk was in, and for them to keep it in better shape. But he has known that all the time, and pays no attention to it. Then F. W. GRAHAM, LE SUKUR, MINN. </seg>
            <seg id="p075">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL. CONVENTION. 75 the buttermaker goes at him (if he isn't an officer of the creamery), and tells him if he can't do better he will have to refuse to take his milk. Mr. Farmer says, "All right; the other creamer)' will take it and be glad to get it." And this is a fact, too. Then the buttermaker figures, and rightly, too, that if he loses this patron he will probably take his neighbor with him, and this hurts our creamery and helps the other one, so we can't keep up to them on price, consequently I will lose my job. I will have to take this poor milk and do the best I can with it to keep the other fellow from getting it. Of course, the creameries are on an even basis, because they are nearly all doing the same thing. Now this is not the right plan, but what is the buttermaker going to do? It is ten chances to one the poor milk belongs to one of the officers of the creamery, and if he refuses to take it, his position is gone. If the quality of creamery butter has fallen, as appears to be the case, I believe the cooperative creameries are, in a great measure, responsible for it. For, as a rule, the buttermaker of a cooperative creamery is liable to lose his position for not taking poor milk, where, on the other hand, if the buttermaker of a private creamery does take poor milk, he will certainly lose his position. But how can we expect anything else when about one-half of the creameries, especially in a cooperative district, are run by a board of managers that know no more about running a creamery than a commission merchant knows about running a farm. Now I do not say all of them. I say the majority of them are run in this way, and, if you will look around, I think you will agree with me. It is these circumstances that make me believe that when each creamery is put under the management of one man, and he has got sense and nerve enough to reject all of this poor milk, then we will raise the quality of our milk, and hence the grade of our butter, and, until this time, the majority of the creameries will be plugging along with the one-half cent above, while a few are getting what fine butter is really worth. Mr. J. N. Muncey, Jesup, la., kindly volunteered to read Prof. McKay's paper. </seg>
            <seg id="p076">7 6 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. PAPER BY PROF. G. L. McKAY, INSTRUCTOR STATE DAIRY SCHOOL, AMES, IOWA. [From the Eigbth Annual Report of the National Creamery Buttermakers' Association.) I am pleaded to meet with you at your great national gathering. Meetings of this kind are of great benefit to all interested in the dairy business, as it affords the creamery man an opportunity to meet the commission man who handles his goods at the other end of the line. He is more able to judge of his business qualifica - tions. Of course, all commission men are good fellows. There seems to be personal magnetism about them. I have often won - dered why commission men have such influence over creamery - men. I have known men who would not trust their neighbors with $100 without a note, that would send$500or $1,000 worth of butter to a commission man who was an entire stranger to them. I have a lot of sympathy for the commission man, who is expected, in many cases, to sell second or third grade butter at one-half cent above western extras, and how these fellows can do this is one of the mysteries of the business. In attending conventions, we must necessarily hear the same things over and over again. Education along any line is a slow process, and it is the constant repetition of any fact that im - presses it on our minds. I will discuss, for a few moments, the advancement made in the creamery business, and the need for further improvements. No business that I know of requires more skill and strict at - tention than the creamery business. The buttermaker is the man at the helm. He is largely responsible for the success or failure of the plant. In the first place, the buttermaker should be an exemplary man, as his manner of dealing with the public largely influencr s the trade of the creamery. In all my experience in dealing with patrons I have never found a case where kindness did not bring about better results than force. Now I do not mean by kindness that you should take in all kinds of milk, as this would not be </seg>
            <seg id="p077">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 77 right. If you approach a man in an abrupt manner and tell him his milk is rotten, the chances are that if he does not quit sending milk to your creamery, he will be in such a mood that you will not have much influence over him. The question of getting better milk is one of the most im - portant ones that the western creameryman has to contend with. When we look over the list of the world's surplus products, we find the farmers are nearly all doing the same thing; they are putting their surplus products in the same granaries of the world, and that granary is setting the price for all. Prices in London, Denmark, Australia aDd New York are practically the same, less the difference in freight and quality, unless some shortage occurs. Cheap transportation has brought all countries into close competition, therefore it is necessary, if we meet this competition, to have the milk in first-class condition, for no man in any line of work can produce first-class goods if the raw ma - terial is faulty. The patron who cares for his milk, and sends it to the creamery in good condition, has the right to expect good milk back in return. If the creamery man takes in sour or im - pure milk, he is doing a great injustice to the man who is sending good milk. All skim-milk should be pasteurized to prevent the spread of diseases such as tuberculosis. I do not mean by pas - teurizing to run a steam pipe outside into a tank, for some - times the milk is heated enough to pasteurize it, and sometimes it is not. In many cases the milk is returned home in poorer condition than if it had not been heated at all. At the college we are using the Reid Pasteurizer. With this machine the steam does not come in direct contact with the milk. We have a thermometer on the pipe just above the machine, where the milk passes through, and, consequently, we have no guess work. We know just how hot we are heating our milk. This pasteurizer has given excellent satisfaction to the patrons. No country or state can monopolize the dairy business. It was thought not many years ago that the grass in the West could not produce good flavored butter, but the eastern commission man has learned to look to the West for his fine butter. </seg>
            <seg id="p078">78 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. The Mississippi. Valley has a great future before it as a dairy country if we embrace our opportunities. The increase of butter in various countries has made the consumer more fastidious in his tastes. The standard of ten years ago will not suit the mar - kets of to-day, as it is constantly rising. This was demon - strated to us pretty thoroughly at your convention a year ago, when only some thirty odd tubs out of about six hundred exhibits scored 95, or equal to western extras. This close scoring will have a beneficial result, I think. If commission men would adopt the method of having all their butter scored, and pay for it according to quality, we would soon have a great reformation in the condition of milk received. We have been for years training buttermakers to make first - class goods, and we have neglected the patrons. Every Winter we hear complaint from commission men about winter flavors. Some have attributed this to the milk of the stripper cow, while others think the food consumed by the cow is the cause. My opinion is that the trouble is largely due to the bacteria that gets into the milk from the stables. If our patrons would take the necessary precautions to have the udders of the cows well brushed before milking, and the milk removed from the stable as soon as drawn to a clean room, there would be little complaint about winter flavors. One thing is certain, that if we ever make a success of shipping butter to foreign markets, we must improve the quality of the milk sent to most of our cream - eries. Great advancement has been made in the way of creamery machinery. We used to hear separator men talk about leaving one-tenth or two- tenths butter fat in the skim- milk, and they called that good skimming. If we have a separator now that throws over more than .03, we are ready to condemn it. There is one thing that is lacking in the line of creamery machinery, and that is a good milk heater. I do not know of a good heater in the market at the present time. They all heat the milk too quickly. In fact, they merely heat the milk serum, </seg>
            <seg id="p079">79 FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. and do not give the fat globules time to expand so as to change the specific gravity. It is quite a common thing to hear buttermakers and separator men talk about the milk being tough and hard to skim during the winter months. It is true that milk comes to the creamery during cold weather at a very low temperature, and if one of these flashy heaters is used it does not have much effect on the milk ; consequently we lose quite. a lot more fat in the skim-milk than we should. And now to illustrate this more thoroughly, I will mention a separator contest that took place near our school during the fore part of this Winter. Of course the Alpha was one of the separators used. The contest was for one month. After they had been at it for about two weeks, the Alpha expert came down to our school. He told me how well they were get - ting along, and how much better his machine was doing than the other, but he said the milk was so tough down there that his machine was leaving in the skim- milk from .07 to .09 of 1 per cent. They were using a Larkey heater for warming the milk. I told this man that if I were the owner of that creamery and those separators did not do any better work than that, I would throw them both out. I saw this separator man a little while after this and he said they had been heating their milk in the receiving vat for some time before separating, and that now his separator was only leaving .02 of one per cent in the skim-milk and skimming 3,000 pounds per hour. Now this extra .05 that he saved in the skimming by heating milk more slowly would be a very large item in a big creamery. At our college we have been healing in the receiving vat for years, and the records of our skimming are about the same both Summer and Winter. There is an objection to heating in the receiving vat, as it takes too much labor to stir the milk while heating. Taking the other creamery machinery into consideration, we have very little fault to find. In fact the creamery of to-day is a paradise in comparison to what we used to have. </seg>
            <seg id="p080">80 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. I was assigned by your Secretary the subject of sampling and testing milk, but as this work comes under my assistant, Prof. Eckles, I asked him to prepare a paper on this subject. In conclusion I would say that the sampling and testing of milk are among the most important things that the buttermaker has to deal with. Every buttermaker, especially during the summer months, should test his samples twice a month, and should duplicate each test so there would be no mistake in this important matter. A mistake of .2 or .3 would amount to a very large item to a man who was sending 10,000 or 15,000 pounds of milk. I am in hopes that, time willing, this will largely do away with the variation of prices in different creameries and check the dishonesty displayed by some in manipulating the test. I am pleased to know that Secretary Wilson is present at our meeting, as it shows that we have a friend at court. I think the day is not far distant when the brand of America's finest butter will not only mean the top price of the market, but will also be a guarantee of its purity to the consumer. Question: I would like to know if there is anyone in the audience who has tried the Reid pasteurizer, and if so with what results? A Member: 1 will say I have used the Reid pasteurizer, and I could not take it out of the creamery to-day on account of the skim- milk delivered to the farmers. They would not have it any other way. Mr. Griffin (S. D.) : What would you do if the milk was sour? A Member: I would say that by heating the milk rapidly you can overcome this to quite an extent. I can take milk that is tainted in better shape than I could in the old way. It does not take long to run it through and you get a bigger per cent of butter fat. Mr. Armstrong (Iowa) : What kind of a separator do you use? A Member: I use a Reid separator. </seg>
            <seg id="p081">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 81 Question: I would like to ask this gentleman if he thinks that by pasteurizing the milk the quality of the butter is better than if he did not pasteurize, and if so what is his proof? Answer: I haven't any proof with me, but I have a letter at home from a commission house which I have sold for several years, and they say my butter is better than it was before I pasteurized. ADVANTAGES OF THE HOME-MADE STARTER. AAGE VIND, ROCHESTER, MINN. [From the Eighth Annual Report of the National Creamery Buttermakers' Association.] The advantage of using a starter for ripening the cream is tiow recognized by most all our best buttermakers. Not only here, but in all countries where the art of buttermaking has reached an advanced stage. In fact, we might say, there can be no advanced buttermaking without it. It is too much "trusting to luck," to leave the flavor production all to providence and the patrons. We should always try to extend our influence as far as possible, especially on this part. And a buttermaker who does not utilize the starter, really deserves little credit if his butter has a good flavor, and most of the blame if it has a poor flavor, for he might have improved it. Though we cannot make a fine flavored butter from a poor lot of cream, we can always help it some. The home-made, skim-milk starter is, probably, at the present time, the most practical in American creameries. We use it not simply for souring the cream — that will sour anyway, or butter - milk will sour it, but we use it for improving the flavor in the cream vat, for checking undesirable fermentations and propa - gating desirable ones. A starter to do this must be good, and should have a very much better flavor than the average milk received, otherwise it is better not to use it. </seg>
            <seg id="p082">82 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. It is by no means an easy matter to prepare a good starter. It requires long experience and many failures, the same as the rest of our work. The directions generally given by our best authorities are these: Have some patron near the creamery bring a can of morning's milk every morning, and see that it is properly aerated and otherwise receives good care until it arrives. Then separate it and keep the skim-milk at 75 to 80 degrees until next morning, or until it curdles; skim off one or two inches from the top so as to remove the impurities or germs which may have dropped into it, and add the rest to the cream. This method is probably employed in four-fifths of the cream - eries where the home-made starter is used. Some advocate the use of evening's milk, and we probably all have our pet tempera - tures; but the principle is the same. We try to take extra care of a can of milk, from the time it leaves the cow until it is sour. It is a very good method and in most cases the best, yet it is by no means always a success. The mystery of the case is, that we know so little of where the germs come from that produce the flavor we are after. Our bacteriologists tell us to beware of the species that breed in the barn, of those that breed in the hay and the myriads carried in hair and dust. Yet they tell us that milk in the udder is sterile. Where then must we seek those bacteria, which will produce that sweet, clean, and high flavor? Prof. Russell hints that those which find their way into the milkduct of the udder are not necessarily undesirable. But they again come from with - out, from the surroundings of the cow. We can reason that the surroundings of a cow on a June pasture must be very favorable for these, "our small friends," but where do we find them in the Winter? However that be, they come from somewhere; but whether they are present to any extent in the particular can of milk selected for a starter is largely a matter of chance. If they are not, it matters little how good care we take of it, the flavor will not be satisfactory. It has been suggested, therefore, instead of depending upon one particular can of milk, to take out small lots </seg>
            <seg id="p083">83 FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. from several patrons, and after allowing these to sour, propagate the best of them for a starter. The method in detail is this: Fill about half a dozen quart bottles with milk from as many patrons, taking what appears to be the best on that day. Keep these bottles at 70 degrees for 24 hours, skim off the cream with a spoon, shake, smell, and taste of them and add the best to a can of pasteurized skim-milk. Keep this skim-milk at 70 to 75 degrees until sour, then skim off the top, but before adding to the cream, save out a bottle full, with which to propagate the next day's starter. Keep that bottle in ice water until ready to use it, so as not to let it become over-ripe ; then sour another can of skim-milk with it, as before. We can in this way perpet - uate the same starter for one or two weeks, until it degenerates, when new samples are taken. By this method we can most always secure a fairly good starter, and if a certain patron's milk proves to be the best for several times, we may use the first method I mentioned, and have him take extra care of a can of milk for us. For that is the best method if we know where to go for the milk. The principles of preparing starters are of course these: First to have as good milk as possible, that is, milk which con - tains the proper flavor germs, and as few as possible injurious ones. It does not matter in which way it is obtained. And second, to keep this milk at a temperature most favorable for the best flavors to develop. Not necessarily a high temperature at which they develop rapidly, but a temperature at which they will develop proportionately faster than the undesirable ones. The better the quality of the milk the higher temperature can we use without danger, but 70 to 75 degrees are always the safest and best temperatures when they are practical; that is, if the starter will sour within a reasonable time. When we take extra care of the milk from the time it leaves the cow, 80 to 85 degrees may be found more suitable. It is well to stir the starters a few times the first hour or two, but be careful not to shake or stir it while it is coagulating, as that will spoil the curd. If this should happen, such a starter </seg>
            <seg id="p084">84 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. must be strained carefully before adding the cream, for this curd will produce white specks in the butter. A properly ripened starter need not be strained; pouring it from one can to another a few times should give it a smooth consistency like thick cream. Never let a starter become over-ripe. It is best right after it is coagulated, and if we are not ready to use it, it should be cooled to 48 degrees or 45 degrees, at which temperature it will keep a day or two without deteriorating. Properly ripened milk of a good flavor keeps better at a low temperature than sweet milk does. Therefore, in the Winter, when we only take milk every other day, it is better to ripen the starter the first day, and then cool it, rather than to cool it first and ripen it the second day. But in this case, do not skim off the top of the starter until ready to pour it into the cream vat, or else skim it again, because the top will always become somewhat contaminated. The percentage of stacter'to use depends on the quality of the cream. The poorer the cream the more starter should be used, but if the latter is good, we can never use too much, unless it makes the cream too thin to churn. Ten to twenty per cent is the amount most generally used. If we are troubled with a bad flavor in the butter, which the ordinary amount of starter is not able to check, the following method may be used to advantage: Run about one-third of one day's cream into a separate vat or cans; add to this about 50 per cent of good skim-milk starter and ripen it at a favorable tem - perature, say 66 to 68 degrees. As soon as it coagulates, cool it to 48 to 46 degrees, and keep it there until next day. Then use the cream as a starter for two-thirds of that day's cream, and treat one-third as the day previous. This enables us to use 50 or 60 per cent starter and yet add only about 15 per cent skim - milk to the cream. And such a large amount of starter, I have found, will check a rather bad taint. The cream which is used as a starter may, to advantage, be pasteurized lightly, say to 150 degrees for a minute, and the starter added as soon as cooled to 70 degrees. That may not pasteurize it very thoroughly, but it </seg>
            <seg id="p085">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL. CONVENTION. 85 will give the starter much more power. And it being only a small amount of the cream, it is not liable to produce any notice - able pasteurized taste in the butter. Of course, we must not use this method unless we are sure we have a good starter. If we can not secure a good home-made, why use a pure culture. A good way to test a starter, and also cream, is to put a little into a bottle, heat it to iooor no degrees, and notice what odor escapes from it. Or, a slower test is to keep a little at a moderate temperature, for some time, and note how soon it spoils and how the flavor changes. There is no part of our work so interesting and educating as preparing starters. It develops the sense of smell and taste so valuable to a buttermaker, and creates a bacteriological labora - tory in the creamery; and I would advise beginners and young buttermakers to buy a dozen quart fruit jars to experiment with^ and try to find the sweepstake flavor. Member: I would like to ask Mr. Vind what kind of a starter he used in the butter he brought to this convention? Mr. Vind: I will have to admit that I used a commercial starter. At this time of year I usually use the commercial starter. Member: I would like to ask Mr. Vind if he can tell, three times out of four, by the flavor of his butter, whether he used a commercial starter or a home-made starter, or whether he used any starter at all. Mr. Vind: I am not an expert butter judge, but I could tell by the flavor of the cream, at least. COMMERCIAL STARTERS FOR BUTTERMAKING. [From the Eighth Annual Report of the National Creamery Buttermakers' Association.] Commercial cultures or starters have been in use hardly more than half a dozen years, yet their adoption has already become M. MICHAELS, GARNET, WIS. </seg>
            <seg id="p086">86 NEBRASKA DAIRYMRN's ASSOCFATION. so widespread as to include nearly every country in the world where butter and cheese are made. This general use of the starter led to a great deal of investi - gation as to its merits, but first as to its bacterial content. Ex - aminations revealed that these so-called pure cultures really contained many kinds of organisms, and the term "pure culture" was gradually replaced by the term "commercial" culture. Of the cultures that have secured recognition in the market, "Conn's B. 41" and "Hansen's Lactic Ferment" stand at the head. The former is supposed to be flavor producing, while the latter is acid producing. To determine the merits of these starters, experiments were made at the Wisconsin Experiment Station with Conn's B. 41. Butter made from cream ripened with this starter, and that made from naturally ripened cream, was scored by experts and the relative perfection of the two based upon this score. It was found that the butter made from naturally ripened cream was superior in flavor, but inferior in keeping qualities as compared with B. 41. Further experiments were made by Prof. Cooly and myself at the Hatch Agricultural Experiment Station, of Massachusetts, in which a vat of cream was divided into three equal lots, one of which was treated with a natural starter, another with B. 41, and still another with Lactic Ferment. The three lots of cream were ripened under exactly the same conditions, and churned in the same churn, at the same temperature. The three lots of butter were further worked on the same worker, and with the same number of revolutions. Three one- pound prints, repre - senting the three lots of butter, were sent to each of the three experts for scoring. The packages were numbered 1, 2 and 3, and scored by H. B. Gurler, of DeKalb, 111.; A. H. Barber, of Chicago, and A. Belknap, of Boston. There was found a slight difference in flavor by the three experts, which ranked the butter made from the cream ripened with a naturally soured starter first, that with Lactic Ferment second, and that with B. 41 third. Notwithstanding this, the advent of the commercial starter was a great lift to the buttermaker. The good has been found, </seg>
            <seg id="p087">87 FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. not in the starter or ferment itself, but rather in the directions and precautions that have always gone along with it. Before the use of the commercial starter the buttermaker had not the proper methods of preparing a natural starter, and, therefore, the ap - pearance of a starter that could be propagated from day to day was hailed by the buttermaker as a blessing to his vocation. The* natural starter in use at this time consisted of a can of milk or of skimmed milk, ripened under natural conditions. This starter could not be propagated from day to day, and therefore new starters had to be prepared or selected daily, as explained ; starters thus/selected never had flavor or acidity two days alike, and were, on this account, not only an inconvenience to the maker, but often a detriment to his product. The commercial starter is made by pasteurizing about one gallon of milk, to which, after having cooled to a temperature of about 80 degrees Fahrenheit, a small quantity of the culture or ferment is added, and then set aside to sour until it has thick - ened. The thickened milk is introduced into a larger quantity of pasteurized skim-milk,when the latter has reached a tempera - ture of about 80 degrees Fahrenheit. This batch of milk when thickened constitutes the starter, and from this about one gallon should be saved to inoculate the next batch of pasteurized milk. In this way the starter can be propagated weeks in succession. The method for making the natural starter, so much used now, is essentially the same as that for the commercial starter, save that, instead of pasteurizing the first gallon of milk and inocu - lating it with the ferment, it is allowed to sour naturally. The following is my method of preparing the natural starter: Two quarts of milk are selected from a healthy cow, fed on good feeds and not yet far advanced in lactation. After rejecting the few jets, the milk is milked directly into a two-quart recep - tacle, and every precaution exercised to avoid contamination. When the receptacle is full it is at once closed with a tight cover and taken to a place as free as possible from filth, but for condi - tions suitable for the development of germs. The milk is al - lowed to remain in this place until it has thickened, which may </seg>
            <seg id="p088">88 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. take three or even four days. The cream which has risen during the souring is carefully removed, and the thickened milk added to a can of pasteurized skim-milk. On the successful preparation of a starter many precautions are necessary, and one that needs particularly to be observed is the care in avoiding the disturbance of the milk while thicken - ing. If disturbed during the thickening, the starter will whey off and become curdy. Such a starter should not be used. During the seasons of '94, '95 and '96 I used the the commer - cial starter, but have since used the home-made starter, i. e., one prepared by the natural souring of the milk. ADVANTAGES OF THE ALKALI TEST IN BUTTER MAKING. [Prom the Eighth Annual Report of the National Creamery Buttermakers' Association.] In treating upon the subject, "Advantages of the Alkali Test in Butter making," allow me, in connection also, to call attention to the guess-work carried on in the average creamery. I con - sider one of its greatest advantages to be the fact that wherever it is used it does away with a whole lot of guess-work. It might be supposed by many that this guessing at anything in connec - tion with buttermaking would be something of the past, but, on the contrary, also at the present time do we have plenty of it ; we need not go any farther than to the cream vat during the ripening process of the cream, if it be a creamery where the ad - vantages of the alkali test have not yet been considered. We find the buttermaker, while stirring the cream, at the same time testing, smelling and guessing at the amount of acid his cream contains, and when it may be necessary to cool it down in order to have it sour enough for churning the next morning; the results of all this guessing generally is, that we guess either a little too far or not far enough. J. P. NEILSON, BRAYTON, IOWA. </seg>
            <seg id="p089">8 9 FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. There are, however, other places in the creamery than at the cream vat where the alkali test may be used to advantage, and, to start at the beginning, I will commence at the weigh can. Now, some one may wonder what good an alkali test will do here, and this may really be more than I can tell at the present time, but the following may show my ideas about it. From Farrington &amp; Woll's book on testing we learn that there is a direct relation between the bacteria found in normal milk and its acidity. The larger the number of bacteria per unit of milk the higher the acidity of the milk, and the increase of acid - ity in milk on standing is caused by the breaking down of milk sugar into lactic acid through the influence of acid-forming bacteria. We have also learned that such bacteria get into the milk through lack of cleanliness during the milking, as well as care - less handling of the milk after milking; if this is kept under con - ditions that favor the multiplication of the bacteria in the milk, it is evident that the alkali test will give us a very good idea of how the milk has been cared for, as it will also show which patrons take good care of the milk and those who do not. The results which I have obtained so far in applying the alkali test on different lots of milk as they arrived at the creamery, only goes to prove this, as these tests were made when the milk was only delivered at the creamery once in every two days. I secured two samples of each lot, one sample of the oldest and one of that which was fresh; in every instance I found that the old milk contained a higher acidity than did the fresh from the same patron. In one lot the old milk contained nearly i per cent of acid more than the fresh, and upon investigation I learned that this milk had been kept in the barn over night, and for this reason the bacteria had had a better chance to multiply. Another small lot containing milk from several days, and to which un - doubtedly had been added some kind of a preservative, showed an acidity of nearly 4 per cent; this milk neither tasted nor smelled sour, but the alkali test showed me that it was unfit for buttermaking. 7 </seg>
            <seg id="p090">90 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. Now what does this show? It shows that this paying our patrons for milk regardless of quality is an injustice, and that the receiving and rejecting of milk as it is generally done at our creameries is more or less a kind of guess work. Here is an example : When a patron arrives at the creamery with a lot of milk of which the cleanliness may be doubtful, the butter maker, knowing this to be so, and being a little particular in regard to the quality of milk he is receiving, he will surely examine such milk before letting it enter the weigh can. It may be that this milk rarely contains 3 per cent of acid, and for this reason neither tastes nor smells sour, being that this buttermaker has nothing but his own good judgment in tasting and smelling, and the patron, insisting on it being received, the buttermaker, as a rule, lets it pass. Another patron comes along with a lot of milk that may be very clean, and, if an acid test was applied, would not show much over 1 per cent of acid; this milk is weighed and dumped into the receiving vat and mixed with the other. Now, it may happen that the Babcock test will favor the unclean milk with a higher test than the clean milk, and consequently when pay day comes the patrons who furnish the creamery with dirty milk will receive more money per hundred pounds for milk than the one furnish - ing the clean milk. The only way that I know of to settle this without injustice would be to apply the alkali test to each patron's milk as it arrives at the weigh can, then grade it according to the amount of acid it contains, and making a difference in the price paid for such milk. Then, and not before then, can we expect our unclean patrons to practice better care and cleanli - ness. The alkali test may also be used to advantage in preparing a good starter. We know that to obtain comparatively good results every day a good starter is indispensable in cream ripen - ing, but we also know that all starters are not good starters; a good starter should contain the right kind of flavor producing bacteria, but in my experience I have found that a starter can also be ripened too far. The best results I have obtained from a </seg>
            <seg id="p091">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 91 starter was when it contained about 60 per cent acidity (Mann's test). A starter containing this amount of acid, and with a clean, sharp, acid taste, can always be depended on to produce good results. The advantage of the alkali test in cream ripening are many, and I shall endeavor to bring out but a few. In ripening a lot of cream for churning, two things are of special importance, namely, to secure exhaustive churning, and a good flavor in the finished product. We know that to obtain the first, the cream should be sour, or ripened, to a certain de - gree of acidity, but to obtain the latter may not at all times be so easy. But that the amount of acid developed in the cream at the time of churning constitutes, to some extent, the flavor in the butter, as well as the keeping qualities of the butter, is not a question. Now I do not want to be put on record as saying that to make butter with a good flavor it is only necessary to have a certain amount of acid developed in the cream, for this cannot be had unless the bacteria present are of the right kind, but the using of the alkali test as a guide during the ripening process of the cream enables the buttermakers to at all times know how the bacterial fermentation goes on.as it will also show when the desired amount of acid has been developed. In the making of high grade butter, by which I understand butter with a high flavor, it is of special importance that the ripening process of the cream be closely attended to. How can we then for a moment believe that this can be done by guess? The fer - mentation of the cream does not always carry on with the same speed, even if the cream is kept at the same temperature; while one day it will only take four hours to ripen the cream to a cer - tain degree of acidity, the next may require six or eight hours. The reason for this is not for me to tell, but the fact is that when this is done by guess, the chances are that the cream will either be over-ripe or under-ripe, and the result will be a pro - duct with a flat flavor or no keeping qualities. The best results that I have obtained were from a cream con- </seg>
            <seg id="p092">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. 92 taining about 38 degrees of acid (Mann's test), this being a cream of about 25 per cent fat. I found that if the acidity was carried to 40 degrees the butter would usually go off on flavor after a week old. Now no man shall ever make me believe that he can tell by taste whether a lot of cream contains 38 or 40 degrees acidity. I have often wondered why so many buttermakers do not use the alkali test; the only explanation I know of for this is, that as long as extras and firsts are selling at the same price, so long will this prevail; but when the time comes that butter is sold on its merits, then I think will the advantages of the alkali test in buttermaking be taken more into consideration. Mr. Kinnky : About the spring of the year, about the first of the year, we get grass and weeds, and how do you get that flavor out of the butter? That is what is bothering a good many people in this part of the country; how can you get fair butter those two first weeks in May? Mr. Nielson: I guess there is no way to help that. Mr. Kinney: It is in the milk before we get the cream. We must find some way to get it out of the cream. Mr. Jensen: Pastturize your milk. Member: I think you stated that on some days, four hours develops the same degree of acidity it would take eight hours to develop on some other days; how do you account for that? Mr. Nielson: That was not the subject assigned for me to answer. I can't account for it. </seg>
            <seg id="p093">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 93 THE ADVANTAGES OF SKIM STATIONS. [From the Eighth Annual Report of the National Creamery Buttermakers' Association. The latter end of the nineteenth century marks an epoch of unparalleled advancement in all the branches of the mechanical arts and sciences. The closing years of the century show the most remarkable changes in this wonderful advancement of our industrial life. Every new feature of this industrial revolution has produced remarkable changes. The new inventions and discoveries, the new methods of taking advantage of the busi - ness faculties afforded by this extraordinary development pro - ceed with such marvelous rapidity that it is difficult for some of us to accommodate ourselves to the new conditions; taking ad - vantage of what must naturally bring success; more difficult possibly for us to be willing to abandon and discard old ways and means, old business traditions; most difficult for us to keep abreast with new influences, thus escaping disaster. What is true, generally speaking, of this material advance - ment throughout every branch of our industrial life, is particu - larly true of the progress and advancement in the creamery business, the manufacture of butter. The advent of the skimming station, or its substitution as a feeder, a part of one great central plant, instead of having so many small individual and separate factories, has marked one. of the principal epochs of the material advancement of the manu - facture of butter in this country. It substitutes new features and methods, new business principles that are recognized and acknowledged as being preeminently necessary for the building up and maintaining, for the advancement and success of business generally. We naturally look first to the benefits which ordinarily come to any business by changing. We find, among these advantages, E. S. SNIVELY, LINCOLN, NEB. </seg>
            <seg id="p094">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN 's ASSOCIATION. 94 the first to be that of centralization, of being able to conduct a business that has its ramifications scattered over a wide range of territory, at one central plant, under one management, and with the best of skilled labor, making each station an integral part of a common whole. It is obviously unnecessary for us to enter into a discussion as to the plan of centralization as applied to our business. We learn, however, that the same process of evolution that took the manufacture of most of the product demanded by commerce from the hands of the individual producer, placing it in the hands of the small manufacturer, is now, and has been, undergoing a second change — that of changing from a small or local manufac - turer to to a central business; turning out at one place a product not merely for one community, but for many. The reasons for this change are not artificial, but natural. We have, on one hand, the consumer of all products, demanding that the articles shall be sold to him at the lowest price; that they shall be manu - factured in such style and of such quantity and quality as he may demand; and that the supply of these products shall be uniform and reliable. On the other hand, we have the man who produces the raw material, demanding that he receive for his material and labor the very highest possible price. The small or local manufacturer is in no condition to meet either of these demands, as his product is entirely regulated by the supply, which, like the supply, is local, and is affected by every flurry in local weather conditions, by local crops, liable to sudden and dangerous changes — causing him to add additional cost to his product, to cover the uncertainties of supply. Thus we can readily see how, by spreading past local condi - tions and local supply, an enterprise is enabled to place its pro - duct within the reach of the best possible buyer at the best possible advantage, and at the same time pay the best possible prices. As general conditions maintain a fairly equal balance, the demand of one year will not differ materially from that of another. The short crops, the unfavorable weather conditions </seg>
            <seg id="p095">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 95 and limited supply of one section being offset by an opposite con - dition in another section. Our first deduction from the plan of centralization must neces - sarily be that of a certain evenness and sureness in the supply. Again, the economical advantages of this plan of centralization in the manufacture of butter, are great beyond comparison. We have, first, the saving of the original cost of buildings, machinery, power, appliances, etc. We would have one building capable of producing five hundred times the amount of a smaller individual one, costing less than twenty-five or thirty small ones would. We have, on the one hand, the individual or small factory, manufacturing at a maximum cost per pound; while, on the other, the central plant manufacturing at a minimum cost. The cost of labor, transportation, of necessary supplies are minimized; all are at the very lowest point. A factory that on an average handles five thousand pounds of milk daily throughout the year, must practically have as much labor expended on the product of the five thousand pounds of milk as if it were five thousand pounds of butter. Thus, the large central plant is enabled to supply itself with men in each department who devote their entire time to the work, who must necessarily keep posted on every improvement and invention in their department, securing, comparatively speaking, perfection in every particular, which, of necessity, must give a decided advantage to the complete product over the local or small manu - facturer, where the individual workmen has charge of several departments, knowing a little about all, and not much about any - thing. As this advantage carries in the mechanical part of the business, so does it carry in the clerical department, allowing a central plant to maintain on its staff those who are not ordinarily within the reach of the local or small manufacturer. Again, the freight rate per carload lot being less than local rates, the cost of transportation of the finished product is at the lowest point, as everything is shipped in carload lots. This also brings to the shipper advantages of a special arrangement of cars, purposely built for the transportation of dairy products, by </seg>
            <seg id="p096">96 NEBRASKA DAIRYMB.Vs ASSOCIATION. means of which he can place his product on any market in the best possible shape. The individual cannot do this, as the make each day is too small; and to hold it until a sufficient quantity is made to reap the benefit of carload rates, is out of the question. This also brings the central plant to a position of theoretically having the market come to it, instead of having to seek the market. It is a well recognized fact that the person having a large quantity of any product for sale at any and all times, has a continuous inquiry from would-be purchasers, while the person who has the product in small quantities must invariably seek the purchaser, calling attention to the fact that he has a certain article of a certain quantity for sale. I would not have you understand me as advocating that the small manufacturer has trouble to dispose of his wares; but that the larger one has facilities and advantages which cannot come to the smaller one. Again in the cost of material, tubs, salt, liners, color, and the hundred and one little things that are a necessary and attendant expense, to have the product finished for the market, there is a great saving, if in nothing but the cost of transportation charges. Beyond this, however, we have a saving in the purchase in large quantities. The manufacturer of material and supplies is always anxious to secure the large orders, and the management of this central plant is able to make a saving in the purchase. With reference to the consumer, it is a decided advantage in that of uniformity of the product; of being able to supply any and all of his peculiar or necessary demands. The man who places the butter in the hands of the consumer — ihe commission merchant — has been very quick to recognize and appreciate this advantage. Again in the small enterprise or manufactory, every new im - provement or invention that is adopted, expensive as they are, must be divided over a comparatively small product, while in the central or large one, the same improvement can generally be adopted with little, if any more expense than in the small or in - dividual one, and when divided over such a heavy product it </seg>
            <seg id="p097">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 97 becomes practically nothing. This is especially applicable to attendant and necessary expense of refrigeration. Again, another important feature and advantage of the Skim - ming Station plan — especially in this western country — is that of being able to establish and maintain a business in localities where it would be impossible to maintain a business should it depend upon a local, or the individual creamery. It affords a good and steady market for the product of the dairymen, which under other conditions he could not have. It makes it possible to nurture a business that at first may be small, but with care and attention must eventually thrive and grow. It develops the business of producing and is a safe and sure guarantee to the producer that he will have a market where he will receive the highest possible price for his product, and one which will give him the best continuous returns for his labor. DISCUSSION. Mr. Armstrong (Iowa) : 1 would like to ask the speaker if he thinks the skim station would be practicable as well as profitable in the older sections of the country — as much so as in the more thinlv settled sections? Answer: 1 should think so, because you would have less to contend with. Mr. Armstrong: The only way to get at that would be in comparative prices. Take one of your skim stations; I noticed one here represented from the western part of the state, claiming something like 28,000 pounds of milk per day. Take for in - stance what you would pay there for December for a 4 per cent butter test. Answer: About 20 cents per pound I should think. You must remember that the business in this western Nebraska is only fairly started. There are men milking cows who as yet do not know, and have not made an effort to find out what they are getting from their cows, simply getting the total receipts </seg>
            <seg id="p098">98 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. for the milk they do not sift out the best milkers in their herd. In the more thickly settled parts of the East the price paid is much higher. Question : Do you have your milk delivered by the patrons or have it hauled? Answer: Delivered by the patrons and hauled both, just as we can get it. Mr. Day (Iowa) : I didn't understand your answer. What did you pay for December butter fat — the average price? Answer: I am under the impression it was 20 cents per pound. Mr. Day: We have a little creamery over in Iowa where we receive 7,000 pounds of milk per day on an average; we paid 27 cents per pound for butter fat. The average test was 4.23: the average yield at the creamery was 4.78. Mr. Kinney: Is each station self-supporting, or do you draw from the head station to pay for the expense of the dif - ferent skim stations? Answkr: That is rather difficult to answer. The majority of them are self-supporting. Mr. Brandt: I would like to ask how far you find it is prac - ticable to transport your cream from skimming stations to churn - ing stations? Answer: It is about 450 miles to Crawford, one of our skim - ming stations. Mr. Brandt: Do you find any difficulty about receiving your cream in a good condition? Answer : Generally not. Mr. Brandt: What process is adopted at the creamery in preparing the cream for transportation? Answer : There is absolutely no milk received that is not in perfect condition. Immediately after. receiving, it is cooled to about 56 degrees. We can get our cream down to about 58 or 59 degrees by continual stirring and pumping cold water. The cream is shipped on trains that travel mostly during the night and get here in the morning or early forenoon. </seg>
            <seg id="p099">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 99 Mr. Chester: I would like to ask the gentleman who paid twenty-seven cents per pound for butter fat, whether he gave the patrons back their milk free? Answer: Yes sir. Mr. Brandt: Inasmuch as this gentleman who is on the floor has tried to tell this convention the advantages of skim sta - tions on the centralization plan, and the price they have paid for butter fat is twenty cents per pound, and this gentleman from Iowa tells us that his creamery, receiving, on an average, 7,000 pounds of milk per day, pays twenty-seven cents per pound, I think it is only fair to this convention that the gentleman from Iowa will tell us how his creamery is able to pay twenty-seven cents per pound for the month of December, on the co-operative basis, and that Mr. Snively explain to this convention why, in his opinion, a creamery company operated on the centralization plan can only pay twenty cents per pound. Mr. Day: The butter netted the farmers at the creamery twenty-six cents, net, from New York. The yield from the churn was 4.78; the average butter fat was 4.23; the difference be - tween 4.23 and 4.78, you can see, would pay our expenses for the creamery. Now, in answering this other question, I think, so far, it is plain enough to anybody. We consider, generally, tine difference between the test and the churn will pay the run - ning expenses of the creamery. Of course, when an individual starts a business he does not expect to do business for nothing. As I understand it, this gentleman's business costs them some - thing; they have an incorporation of $150,000. They must make the interest on that money. On the cooperative plan they figure no interest on the money except to keep the creamery in repair; these gentlemen have to keep their creameries in repair, and also have the interest on the money. Mr. Armstrong (Iowa) : I will substantiate Mr. Day's figures. I am running a cooperative creamery, and the last year I have paid an average of twenty cents on what you would call the old Davis and Rankin system. We have to-day $400 or $500 in the treasury. For December we paid twenty-seven cents for butter </seg>
            <seg id="p100">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. 100 fat on an average of something over 4 per cent. I do not think our average test was quite as high as Mr. Day's, but we paid the twenty-seven cents in December and had a surplus left. Mr. Dvke: I would like to ask our friends from Iowa if they could have paid such a price for milk if they would pay for coal and packing and ice? Mr. Armstrong: There are farmers who have stock in our creamery, and they have been in it since it was put up. Our ice and coal is always put up by ourselves. Mr. Coleman (Neb.): I know of some cooperative cream - eries that last year paid only eleven cents, and others paid sixteen and eighteen, and still others hauled their own ice and charged up for it, so this should be takon into consideration. Mr. Welch: I corroborate the statement of the gentlemen from Iowa. I am running a creamery, where, during the month of January we paid all the expenses and cash for everything, and we paid twenty-three cents for butter. Mr. Day: I would like to answer this gentleman who quoted the different prices. You go over this dairy belt of the north - west where some cooperative creameries have started, and the first thing they do they employ a cheap man to run their cream - eries, and what is the consequence? You put the same skill into the cooperative creameries that these gentlemen do, and you will be able to pay a good price. Mr. Casey: I corroborate the man from Iowa. I only take in about 11,000 pounds of milk in a creamery in Iowa, and we pay twenty-seven cents per pound for butter. We put up our own ice; that is the only thing we have put up free, and we pay twentv-seven cents. Mr. Clark (Neb.): If the cooperative creamery pays the patron so much more money than the one we are talking about — if the patrons have to furnish the money to build the skimming stations, why could they not run it on the cooperative plan and save the money ? A Member: I take the cream from seven stations and make </seg>

President Boardman: I think you are making compari - sons that you ought not to make; comparing the thickly settled country with the thinly settled country. A Member: I would like to ask the gentleman from Iowa who netted 26 cents per pound for January, what price he sold his butter foi ? Mr. Day: You are mistaken; the month was .December. The average price was 26 cents net at the creamery. The price in New York varied. The highest price was 30 cents. We sold one ton for 30 cents. Mr. Sutton: I think in discussing this question of the benefits of the skimming station we should take into considera - tion some of the disadvantages as well as the advantages. Not - withstanding all the advantages which they may claim for the commercial and manufacturing departments, it strikes me that there are at the same time other interests worthy of the consid - eration of this convention. I speak of the producers — the men who milk the cows. Now I think he will agree with me that when the entire community's product has been mixed together and held 24 hours in order to have feed enough until the next skim-milk is returned, that this by-product is not worth so much to the farmer for his pigs and calves, and they will not thrive so well on it as if the skimming station was abandoned and the skimming done on the farm. We are all aware that some of our herds are afflicted with tuberculosis. These germs may be taken to the skimming station and disseminated, together with other germs, throughout the entire milk brought to the creamery. I would not, if I could, patronize a large skimming station. I think it would be well for this convention to take account of the disadvantages to the producers of milk. </seg>

(From the Eighth Annual Report of the National Creamery Buttermaicers' Association! Ladies and Gentlemen : It certainly affords me great pleasure as I look over this vast audience here and these banners that indicate how many states are represented here, and the . delegations that surround these banners. It speaks well for the manufacturing department of this dairy business; it shows that the buttermaker takes a deep interest in that part of the work. I remember well attending the first convention, in the city of Madison, Wisconsin, eight years ago, where this association was organized. There were then merely a handful of buttermakers assembled. It has gradually grown and spread and is now exerting a wonderful influence in developing the butter interests of the United States. There is probably no one factor in the dairying business that does so much to improve the product, for the milk producers as the man at the weigh can. And when one sees the progress that is being made it is encouraging. It stimulates us to further efforts in trying to help the milk producers to a large return for their product. But on the other hand when we look over the progress made in certain lines it is exceedingly discouraging. There have been a great many conventions, farmers' institutes and schools of Agriculture, and bulletins issued, and everything is being done to educate the milk producers. But are we suc - ceeding? It is appalling to note the indifference with which the producer is carrying on his business, if we may call it that. We pride ourselves in Minnesota on the wonderful aggregate the dairy industry is bringing into that state. We have reason to feel proud of it. Iowa has reason to feel proud of her net return. But what is it in comparison with what it might be </seg>
            <seg id="p103">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 103 with just the least bit of common sense and business tact on the part of the farmers. (Applause.) Now you all know me, know that I am interested in the farmer's welfare, that I am not prejudiced against him, that I would not say anything against him were it not brought out by actual facts, and I am very lenient at that. I know that the average cow in Nebraska or in the Northwest can produce from 250 to 300 pounds of butter per year; and what is she giving us? From 100 to 150 pounds; that is all the fanner is getting out of it. We must look to the boys who are at the weigh can to make the farmers realize this. They are working hard and faithfully and we appreciate their services, and I only hope they will not get tired of well-doing. There are yet some very good indications. I have just re - turned from Wisconsin; the week before that I returned from the Elgin district. The week before that I was in the upper Red River Valley. Which shows that after all there are some people who want information and are trying to better their con - ditions, but when I examine into the details of each invitation and see who was back of it, I always find that there are a few common sense business men who take the interest of the com - munity at heart, and they are the ones who bring about these conventions. It is not the farmers. If these business men will work a week or ten days offering inducements to the farmers to attend the meeting, the farmers will come and sit and listen to them and then go away. Now and then there is one who will take some of the advice and try to better his condition. But they are very ready to find fault if they do not get the very last cent they expect ; they are quick to criticise ; if their test is not as high as it was the last time you will hear from them surely. But do they attend to their business carefully? Do they see that their cows are carefully housed, carefully looked after, and carefully fed to bring about the best results? No, the farmers who do are the exceptions. * Now, there is probably no one thing which has so much an - noyed the boys who have charge of creameries as the criticisms </seg>
            <seg id="p104">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. 104 that are made on account of variation in the test. When a farmer gets his test, and it is 3.4, and the month before it was 4.4, he will come to the creamery and say: "I know my herd tests 4.4, and here I have only a test of 3.4." You hear these things wherever you go; it is universal. Now, for the purpose of throwing a little light on this subject, I wish for a moment to call your attention to the wonderful machine a cow is. We know that the average cow has not proper care; that she is not kept comfortable; that one day she has all she wants to eat and another day she has not; that some nights she is cold and some nights she is comfortable. Now, here we have a record from cows properly cared for. One tests in the morning 4.2; in the evening she tests 4.1; the next morning she tests 3.7; the next evening, 3.5, 3.8, 3.6, 4.8, 3. 4. Just see the variation from one milking to another; all of 1 per cent; or, in other words, the cow gives 25 per cent richer milk at one milking than she does at another. Now, that is so far as the daily test is concerned, for we test every milking, and have since 1891. Now, the same peculiarity exists from week to week. Let us take the first milking of the cow — 7 per cent fat; the next 5.4, 5.7, 6.1, 5.3, 5.1, 4. Well now, suppose some farmer had taken this cow and employed some to make these tests at his farm, and then found at the end of the week that she averaged 5.5. Why he has a 5 per cent cow, and you would hear that every week. Now examine what she will do later. All that week she averages 5.4. This is taking one test in the morning and one in the evening, and should give us a pretty good idea of what she did. But next week I find she gives 4.4 on an average; and when I tested the third week, all the week, every milking, she tested 4 per cent. Another week, testing every milking, and she tests 3.2. Now here you have the whole month's record of averages for each week, commencing with 7 and ending with 2.9, and ending with a week's test of 3.2. Possibly we should be a little more charitable to the farmer who finds fault, because these things are not generally under - stood. Let us take, for instance, a whole herd. I will read » </seg>
            <seg id="p105">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 105 notes of a few tests made during 1895. First, for three consecu - tive days the herd tested 4; the next day it tested 4.1; the next 4.3, the next 4.3, the next 3.9. These variations can not be accounted for. We have a daily Teport made by the stock foreman, where everything that would occur to cause a change in the quality of the milk is reported each morning, and at the time these tests were made there was nothing we could see in the conduct of the herd to change the test from 4.3 to 3.9. Take the next four days, and the-ljerd tested 4.4, then 4.1, then 4.2, then back to 3.9, and so it goes on through the month of April, the lowest being 3.8, and the highest being 4.5. Now, sometimes there is a certain herd turned out to pasture, and they shrink considerably as to fat. We have made a summary of the herd for the four weeks preceding the time they went to pasture. Their average test was 4.1. Then we take the first four weeks of pasture, and we find that the average test is 4.2, being prac - tically no different than it was under dry feed. Now let us take for the year 1896, covering exactly the same character of work, and we find there that the changes from day to day in the quality of the milk are similar to what they were the year before. The whole herd ran somewhere about 4.5, sometimes reaching as high as 4.9, and again dropping to 4.1, the whole herd varying almost 1 per cent of fat from one day to another. Now let us examine the milk before the herd went to pasture, in 1896, and the four weeks after they were on pasture. The average test for the whole herd from the 6th day of April until the 3d day of May before going to pasture was 4.58 — nearly 4.6; taking the four weeks after they were on pasture, and the average test was 4.3, whereas, you will remember that the year before there was no shrinking in the quality of the milk. So it can be seen that one year's workings — even two years' working with the herd, testing every day, does not decide the point whether cows will give thinner milk on pasture than they will on dry feed when they get grain. Let us take the third year. Here we find the same variations, 8 </seg>
            <seg id="p106">106 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. the result being 4.1 for the lowest, as against 46 for the highest, being a difference of .5 of 1 per cent in butter fat. As the milk is 4 per cent milk, the variation from one day to another is one - eighth. The four weeks before they went on pasture the test is 4.26. The four weeks on pasture it was 4.24. Here again, we will see that there is no difference between the period on pasture and on dry feed with grain feed. In 1898 the average for the month of April was 4.37, and for the month of May it was 4.39, the month of May being the first month on pasture ; so there was practically no variation there. Looking over the details of this work, we were satisfied that there were great changes taking place from the time the cows went on pasture until they had been on about six weeks. So to investigate we made an average test for the two weeks before they went on pasture, and two weeks prior to that, etc., etc., in periods of two weeks, and then again after they were on pasture. We found that the test for the last two weeks before they went on pasture was always lower than it was for the two weeks pre - vious. Now, there must be some reason for this. They had not gone to pasture but the last two weeks it was lower than when they were on pasture. Every cow was that way. And we finally decided that this was the reason. The cows scented the fresh grass; they wanted to get out to pasture and they worried about it. In 1895 the last two weeks on dry feed it was 3.75; the first two weeks on pasture it was 3.89, being considerably richer the first two weeks on pasture than it was the two weeks prior on dry feed. But going on we found that the next two weeks the cows all dropped off so that the monthly average was practically the same as it was for the month preceding their going to pas - ture. The effect of the succulent foods does not take place until some two weeks after the cows have been on pasture and then the test is lower. So far as I have been able to ascertain the food has very lit - tle effect on the quality of the milk in this way. If we give a cow balanced ration with a reasonable amount of succulent food </seg>
            <seg id="p107">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 107 with it, she will give her normal flow of milk, and we may en - rich that food as much as we will, there will be no effect on the quality of the milk, unless we create a sort of fever in the sys - tem, and then there will be for a time an increase in the per cent of butter fat of the milk, but we also find that whenever that congestive condition recedes she falls in her per cent of butter fat as much below as she had been above. Mr. President, I guess this is all I will say, unless there are some questions you wish me to answer at this time. Member: Will the chasing of the cow by a dog or the hit - ting with a milk stool cause an increase in the test? Prof. Haecker: Some cows if handled roughly will give a much lower instead of higher test, and if the cow is excited and gives a higher per cent milk, then there will be a re-action later and it will fall below what it would have averaged had she re - mained in a normal condition. Mr. Brandt: I would like to ask the professor a question that comes to us very frequently. He went over the situation of trying and testing for the herd for four weeks, giving the rise and fall of per cent of butter fat, and that is a very fair idea of what is being done right along by farmers all over the country, and then they will come into the creamery and insist that their teSt for the month is not all right. They will say : "I know my cows produce more b.utter fat than that test shows," and when the creameryman attempts to explain, the farmer will make comparisons by saying, "Last month it was so and so and the month before it was such a figure." Now what would be your best plan to give a satisfactory answer to this man and in a conscientious way explain to that gentleman why his test is lower, after of course asking him a number of questions as to food, etc. However they usually come in in the first place and say that they are feeding the same feed; they are the same cows, and they gave the same amount of milk, but the test is lower. Prof. Haecker : That is the point exactly, and it is a very hard thing for me, but I have heard quite a number of patrons </seg>
            <seg id="p108">108 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN S ASSOCIATION. say: "Well I kicked on my test and the next time it was higher." (Applause.) The best way is to stick right to the exact test, never varying one way or the other. Give them some literature which will set out that where cows have been tested year after year with the same feed, etc., that they will vary and that no reason is known for the variation; that they will vary under the very best of care. Now if he learns that his herd will vary — sometimes test 3.2 and sometimes 3.6, and sometimes more, he will not be so unreasonable. We certainly are not prejudiced in this matter of testing at the college, and if we test at the stations and find the same variation and cannot account for it, he cannot expect you to give him the same test every month. Member: When there was this variation in the test of the milk, was there any variation in the quantity of milk that the cows gave? Prof. Haecker: The variation in the quantity of the milk per day is not so much as the variation in the butter fat, but there is some. Some years the cows will increase in their flow when they go to pasture and sometimes they are so contrary that they will decrease. Member: When they give a lower test, is there an increase in the quantity of the milk? Prof. Haecker: Let me read one item: One week we have 223^ pounds of milk and 13.95 of butter fat, the second week 256 pounds of milk, butter fat 12.41; third weeek, 230 pounds of milk, 12.55 butter fat; fourth week, 273 pounds of milk, 10.06 pounds of butter fat. Mr. Brandt: I do not believe the fault is all with the creameryman, neither do I believe it is all with the farmer. I have had occasion to work a great many testers, and I have come to the conclusion that there is a great deal of fault and slip-shod work with the tester himself. He does not understand the handling of the Babcock test. Take in an individual creamery or a cooperative creamery, he may test for six months, and some times for ten years before he can test properly. I </seg>
            <seg id="p109">109 FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. ■&gt; contend that if a man can test five or six times and have the test come out the same he understands his business, and if he cannot do this he does not understand his business, and has no business to operate a Babcock tester. I believe there are any amount of men handling the Babcock tester who can not repeat their test and make it the same, and I do not blame the farmer for making a roar in his case. Mr. Kinzey: borne one raises the point that the steam testers are increasing the per cent of butter fat more than they should. Have you made any experiments along that line? Prof. Haecker: I have not made any definite experiments. The Wisconsin station has just completed some experiments along that line, and the professor at the convention last week re - ported that the Turbine test, which injects some considerable steam into the box, expands the fat from .1 to .2; that in such cases the over-run will be short. Member: I would like to ask the professor if he has inves - tigated closely, and knows that his instructions and orders are followed out closely. Prof. Haecker: I am in very close touch with the boys and the cows. I am there two or three times a day; I watch nearly every milking and I inspect the milk. I have absolute confidence in my stock foreman and milkers. Mr. Day: In all the papers we have heard upon the subject of creamery management, the boys all seem to agree that it re - quires the most skill at the weigh can, knowing how to take the milk, knowing what to take, and how to sample the milk, and what to say to the patrons. Now it is a very difficult matter to manage each patron, for some will kick on their test. Now a man who understands his business can tell instantly what the patron is kicking for. If a man kicks on his test who is always kicking, explain in a gentlemanly way what you think is the cause of his low test, and if he still kicks, do not pay any atten - tion to him. One point that is made in regard to skim stations is that there is a saving of the price of labor in the stations. Can they employ a cheap man — at say $35.00 a month — who is </seg>
            <seg id="p110">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. 110 - capable of running the business to. the advantage of all parties concerned? I say they cannot. Just as soon as they cut a man's wages down you cut down the skilled labor. If a man cannot get what his skill is worth he will go into other business every time. Mr. Brandt: The subject before us is the variation of tests. Now I think that we ought to have a great deal of patience when a farmer makes a roar about his test, and we ought to take pains to take inlo consideration the quality of milk he has to deliver for the entire year. I will relate an experience or two I have had in the last ten years. A patron of ours came into the office and had a test of 2.8 for the month of January; for the preceding month it was 3.2. He began to complain, and said that during the month of December we had bad weather, that he thought the test should be better for January. I investigated as to the number of cows he was milking, and during the month of January from six cows he had 4021 pounds of milk, while from four of these cows the year before he had but 2100 pounds of milk for the same month, so he increased his milk nearly 100 per cent on the two cows. He had decreased the test, it is true, from 3.5 which was his test for December, 1898. He had decreased his butter fat; the quantity of milk tells the story. I went over his milk record for the entire year, showing the gradual increase and decrease, and found that although we had dropped from 3.5 to 2.8 on test, still he had made 50 cents on each cow by the increase in the amount of his milk. He went home satisfied. When they come in I go over the milk test and records with them and try to convince them that their test is all right, and under no circumstances have we any right to change the test. In the first place you want to be sure that the test is all right, and then when the farmer comes in to complain about the test, give him the glad hand, tell him to come in and you will see about it, show him the whole record for the year, or two years, if he has been with you for that length of time, explain the record to him and you will not have any trouble in convincing </seg>
            <seg id="p111">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 111 him that his test is all right. Another patron of mine had a test of 9.2. He said, "That test is not right; I know it is not right." We brought him into our office and then sent our man out to his farm to question every one around the farm as to how they were handling the milk, and we found that he was skimming his night's milk and putting the cream in the morning's milk and the test was right. If we had changed it he would have said: "Those fellows down there don't understand their business. Tney don't have any faith in their test themselves. We asked them to change the test and they did so." C. L. Rutter (Grand Junction, Iowa) : Have you noticed any difference in the sampling of the milk at different tempera - tures? In taking these samples, do you take them at a normal temperature? Prof. Haecker: The samples are brought up into the dairy hall and in just a certain length of time the test is taken. Question: Have you noticed any difference in putting on the acid at once or in leaving it several hours? Prof. Haecker: I couldn't tell about that. IS THE STANDARD OF SCORING BUTTER CON - STANT OR CHANGING? CHAS. E. MCNEIL, CHICAGO. (Prom the Eighth Annual Report of the National Creamery Buttermakers' Association.] Mr. President, Members of the National Creamery Buttermakers^ Association, Ladies and Gentlemen : The low scores given the bulk of the butter on competition at the National Convention in Sioux Falls last year were very disap - pointing to the buttermakers affected, and gave rise to the ques - tion whether or not the standard for scoring was changing and becoming higher. As far as I can learn, the butter at Sioux Falls was scored on the same basis, and in the same manner as </seg>
            <seg id="p112">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. 112 usual, but the quality of the goods was, as a whole, below the standard of the previous year, 1898, as that year's butter was inferior to the exhibits of 1897. As far as body and flavor are concerned, the standard for the season of the year in which the butter is scored is the same throughout the world. Anything that will pass for extras in creamery in one part of the country will pass as extras anywhere. The standard from year to year in this respect admits of no change. Butter that was good enough to grade extras in 1895, for instance, would be good enough to grade extras in 1900, for the standard is the same to-day as it was then. Salt and color, however, are largely a matter of local taste, and the buttermaker must therefore of necessity, be thoroughly posted on the requirements of the market or markets in which his butter is sold. For instance, for St. Louis and other southern traue, butter must be colored a deep yellow;* in New York and Chicago a light straw color is about the right shade; for export trade very little color is needed; Boston wants a higher salted and colored piece of goods than some other eastern markets, and so on. I even hear that the representative of a certain house in the East claims they have a special trade for mottled butter that will pay a cent per pound above the price of unmottled goods. "But," he adds,"this trade is very limited," so I would advise you buttermakers who are having trouble with mottles to do your level best to get rid of them, instead of seeking this "very limi - ted" trade. In scoring butter at national conventions, the judges, as I un - derstand it, allow for variations in color and salt to the extent of the peculiarities of the different markets, but butter that contains no color to speak of, or too much to suit the requirements of any market, must be scored off accordingly; and the same with regard to salt. It is different, however, where you ship butter regularly to a certain market. The color and salt must suit the The color standard of St. Louis has since been changed to conform with the standard of New York and Chicago— a light straw color. </seg>
            <seg id="p113">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 113 requirements of the trade in that market exactly, or else you will have trouble. Chicago is, perhaps, better situated in this respect than other markets, because she fills orders from all over the East and South, and, consequently, usually has some place in view where such butter can be sent, if it can not be used by the local trade. It is better, however, to take no chances; know the trade you are catering to, and give them what they want. That is the wisest plan. Now with regard to package; if there is one thing more than another that helps the sale of a line of butter, it is a clean, neat appearing package. Dirty, sloppy-looking tubs prejudice a buyer against their contents. If it is your fault that the tubs appear on the market in such shape, change your ways at once; if it is the transportation company's fault, get after the offender, and give him no peace until he either quits his job or does what is wanted. Do not keep your tubs in a damp place. Moldy tubs look bad and act worse. Very often every package showing mold has to be gone over by the receiver, and the butter scraped and put into new tubs before it can be sold. This means a shrinkage in weight, if nothing more. If, then, the standard for scoring butter is the same as in the days when Elgin was the highest grade known, why is it thtt» despite all the improvements of late years in machinery, all the valuable information in the art of buttermaking disseminated by the dairy schools and the dairy papers of the country, and through the various scoring contests conducted by supply people and others, the percentage of poor, butter exhibited at our na - tional convention is so large? There are a few reasons which I would like to touch upon, and one of them is mottles. No matter how fine a piece of butter may be in other respects, how high in flavor or perfect in body* the very fact that it is mottled throws it out of the grade of extras, and, strictly speaking, such butter can only be classed as seconds in creamery. You can readily understand, therefore,, that, regardless of what anxious solicitors may tell you, it behooves you to remedy this defect. </seg>
            <seg id="p114">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. 114 Another reason is carelessness or want of attention, resulting very often from the fact that some house is paying one-half or three quarters of a cent per pound above the top for your output, leading you to believe that you are making very fine goods right along. I asked a buttermaker last year : "How did your butter score?" "Oh," said he, "I was not in it up there," pointing in the direction of the convention hall. "I only scored eighty-six points, but my butter brings one half cent above top quotations, so I am not worrying." Do not think for a moment, though, that I mention him as being representative of latter-day butter - makers. Not at all. I believe that there never were so many hard-working, studious, conscientious men in charge of cream - eries as to-day,but from the fact that they never get a complaint about their goods from their commission man, and that, regard - less of quality, returns come in with the same premium added, week after week, and the further fact that they seldom, if ever, have a chance during the year to compare their goods with others, their butter is apt to run down gradually in quality, until the first thing they know they are making a poor first or second, instead of extras. This is not the case so much in the warm months, perhaps, as in the cold season, when the run of milk is so light. Still another reason for low scores is the season of the year when these gatherings occur. It is the very worst time for the production of fancy creamery butter. The milk or cream, as a rule, is gathered only two or three times a week, and weather conditions are usually such that despite all the care and atten - tion and skill of the competing buttermakers, it is simply impos - sible for many of them to turn out a fancy, high-flavored tub of butter. And lastly, we must remember that the entries are increasing every year, and that in order to establish the relative merits of each and every tub scored the judges have to be more critical, though without in any way raising the standard of perfection. We are all here to learn something that will benefit us in our business; the commission man as well as the buttermaker, the </seg>
            <seg id="p115">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 115 supply man as well as the creamery manager. We should not be disappointed, therefore, if we find that there are ways in which our methods can be improved, our wares increased in value or our skill made greater. Honest criticism hurts nobody. The object of our association is to further the interests of the great buttermaking industry we represent, so let us learn all we can and go home feeling that our time has not been spent in vain, but that the lessons learned may be carried into our every day business with good results. CHAS. V. KNIGHT, SECRETARY NATIONAL DAIRY UNION. {From the Eighth Annual Report of the National Creamery Buttermakers' Association.] I am not going to bother you with a great many details re - garding this work, because you are all pretty well informed, I think. There is one thing, however, I want to say, and that is that we are right now in the midst of the difficult part of the work. You will remember that this matter was brought before you a year ago. At that meeting we announced that we would need, in order to carry this work forward, a fund of a least ten thousand dollars. We said ten thousand dollars because any large sum would have seemed to be out of the question. We were confident we could raise ten thousand dollars. The result has been that during the past year, through the efforts of the buttermakers, we have taken in cash and pledged contributions a sum amounting to almost $15,000.00. The work has gone forward in a manner which is beyond our fondest hopes. Nearly 24,000 farmers have contributed their mite toward carrying this work forward, and from almost every state. We took up the work right after the Sioux Falls meeting, and our office force has increased from one stenographer a year ago to a goodly - sized office force at the present time. Last May we took on, for the purpose of perfecting our or- </seg>

Later in the year we felt the need of another organ - izer, and we took on Mr. McKinstry, also of Minnesota. Aside from that we have a force in the office, and during the past week — during the week ending last Saturday — we paid out for the purpose of disseminating information regarding this move - ment $1,000.00 for postage. Last week we mailed 40,000 postal cards to 333 congressional districts of the United States, to names we had collected and corrected during the twelve months preceding. We have had this force and have gathered these names and have interested some workers in every con - gressional district in every state. Bills have been introduced. There are some five or six in Congress now. You are all more or less acquainted with the fact that when we started in for a 10 per cent tax we found opposition in the East. They thought such a tax on oleomargarine might impair their state laws. It was necessary for us to hold a great many meetings. At a meeting of the Dairy Association held at Courtland, N. Y., which was attended by at least half a dozen representatives from the West, we arrived at an understanding with the eastern people. It was a short time ago, however, that they decided upon the exact wording of the measure which we were to support in Congress. For that reason our work has been delayed somewhat. Congress assembled in December, and here it is almost the first of March. But just as soon as the Grout bill was settled upon as the bill which we were to support, East and West, we put our machinery in motion as I have told you, by sending out instructions to people in all parts of the United States as to what to do in order to influence Congress in this matter, and asking for replies as to what they would do. I want to explain to you people here something that every - body does not seem to understand. I had a letter, for instance, from a buttermaker in Congressman Tawney's district, in Min - nesota. Now Congressman Taw'ney is one of our best workers, and we think a great deal of him for that reason. But this but - termaker answered and said : "We know that our congressman </seg>
            <seg id="p117">117 FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. * is all right, and we do not see any need of sending him petitions." I am gratified to be able to-day to record the sentiments of the two senators from Nebraska. Now if those from the north - western states, where the dairy interest is most prominent, say: "We do not need any petitions to our men, because they are all right," and confine the petition to Congress to those districts which need help, when they examine those petitions they will say: "Look here, you have only got 15 per cent of the people asking for this, and your state is supposed to be one of the most prominent in dairy interests." So we want Congressman Tawney's people to petition him just as strongly and just as ac - tively as though he were some congressman from Mississippi. The Grout bill, of which I spoke, feduces the tax on eleomar - garine made without color, from two cents to one-quarter cent per pound. This is for the purpose of showing our good faith to Congress, of showing that if anybody wants to eat oleomar - garine, as oleomargarine, we are willing they should have it, and have it cheaper. That bill is referred to the Agricultural Com - mittee. In that Agricultural Committee we have a man from Kansas, Mr. Bailey. Nearly every man and voter in the State of Kansas is a constituent of Mr. Bailey's. Mr. Bailey is sup - posed to be against us; is supposed to be working for the oleo - margarine people, but I am confident that if our Kansas friends will wake up and convince Mr. Bailey, I think he can be con - trolled. Outside of him and a man from Chicago, I think there is no one who is doubtful. If a petition with 100 names is any good, one personal letter is just as good as that petition, so you can make up your mind when you write your congressman a personal letter to support that bill, you are doing just as much good as if you circulated a petition. We people who are in Washington, as we will be in a short time, are at the front, overlooking the field of action. We will find here and there a weak or wavering man, and when we find him we will write you who are in his district, and ask you to ask him to do what you wish. There is no use of my going to the </seg>
            <seg id="p118">118 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. Kansas or Nebraska man and asking him to do so and so, because in that work he will be guided by yourselves. The retailers of New York are in favor of this measure. They endorse it, and at their meeting a few months ago, we found the retailers generally anxious to stamp out oleomargarine, because they lose trade by it. I think I have said everything that is necessary to say here to-night. I trust that when we send out word to you, asking for your help, you will not lay the work aside and leave it, because it is you who must do this fighting. We can tell you how to do it, but we cannot do it without your assistance. (Applause.) SALTING AND WORKING OF BUTTER. [From the Eighth Annual Report of the National Creamery Butter-matters' Association.] While salting and working butter is something I have prac - ticed with great care for many years, the preparing of a paper on a subject of this kind is something new to me, but I will try to comply with the request of our secretary, Mr. Sudendorf. In the first place it is very necessary to have the cream in proper shape to churn. After the cream has been separated and cooled down and the starter added there is much yet to be done, which I fear many of our buttermakers overlook or neglect. The cream room should be looked after and kept at the pro - per temperature and free from bad odor, dust or dirt. The cream should be stirred often, for if it is not, a partial separa - tion sometimes takes place, and the thinner part of the cream will form in a curdy mass at the bottom of the cream vat, and the top and that which sticks to the sides of the vat will dry and become hard, and small portions of it may work through the GRANT MALLORY, FREKPORT, ILL. </seg>
            <seg id="p119">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 119 strainer and not take color, and by so doing produce "white specks." Much care should be given to the churning of the butter so as to have it come in proper shape to receive the salt. The salting of butter is a question of what the customer wants. It is simply a matter of taste. Some want a half-ounce, some three-quarters. I think it is customary to salt one ounce to the pound. Much depends on the moisture of the butter. I will give you my way of salting and working butter. Our butter is churned into granules, not lumps. This butter when spread on the worker is very loose. We weigh the amount of salt required, and sprinkle about two-thirds of in on the butter. The worker is then started, and the butter is turned over — it is turned by the use of a large butter spade; then the balance of salt is sprinkled on. By doing this way the salt gets all through the butter before it is worked, and it does not require so much working. There can not be any set rule as to how butter should be worked as conditions are so changeable. The temperature of the room and the kind of worker must be considered. The operator must use his judgment as to what is best to be done under existing circumstances. Great care is to be taken in the working of the butter and much depends on the conditions as to length of time it should be worked. Light streaks or waves through the butter, commonly called "mottles," are often due to an uneven distribution of the salt and uneven working. Care must be taken not to break the grain and yet not have any streaks in the butter; also, that too much moisture should be left in, or I might say too much water left in. I once saw a buttermaker work his butter. He had a large stream of water running over it all the time he was working. This butter,when ready to pack, was a sloppy, watery mess, and a glance at a package of this kind is very good evidence that the butter has been "soaked," and we are sure that our com- </seg>
            <seg id="p120">120 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. mission men in New York, Boston, Chicago, and elsewhere do not care to pay from 28 to 30 cents a pound for water. After our butter has been worked, it is then put up in differ - ent size packages from a one-pound print to a 60-pound tub. Great care is taken in preparing the packages. When using tubs they are soaked in brine over night. In the morning the brine is poured out and the tubs are lined with parchment liners. Care is taken that the liners are put in smoothly and that the side lining projects about one inch over the edge. When filled the top of butter is cut off level with the edge of the tub, the inch of side lining is then folded over edge of butter, the cloth circle put on, and a small handful of salt sprinkled or sifted over the top. Four tins are used to fasten the lid, being placed equal distances apart. The smaller packages and cases for prints are all lined. Prints carefully wrapped, cases nailed up, and all packages neatly marked and stenciled are then ready to ship. DISCUSSION. Mr. Michels (Wis.): How much salt do you use to a pound and how much of a difference would you make between a table worker and a Disbrow worker? Answer: At the present time I am using an ounce per pound for the table worker. I haven't had any experience with the combined churn. % Mr. Michels: How many revolutions do you give • the butter — how much time? Answer : That depends upon the condition of the butter. </seg>
            <seg id="p121">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 121 THE BUTTERMAKER'S DREAM. [From tbe Eighth Annual Report of the National Creamery Buttermakers' Association.] Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen of the National Cream - ery Buttermakers' Association : I have not the least idea in the world why I was picked out to read a paper on "The Juttermaker's Dream." It may be perhaps that being an ex - mttermaker myself, I had not gotten over the habit of seeing visions and building air castles. It is perfectly natural for a mttermaker to dream ; more so perhaps than any other class of people in the dairy business, for it is said that a dream "Cometh through the multitude of business," or in other words, a man in business who is full of projects and perplexities and anxieties, goes to bed with his mind so excited that he sleeps imperfectly and has vivid dreams which remain in his memory after he awakens. This buttermaker's dream was dreamed just before a National Buttermakers' Convention, and hence his projects and anxieties; and I think if every buttermaker present would recall his dreams previous to this convention, they would be more interesting than this dream I have to relate. The sun had gone down behind the fleecy clouds on a Febru - ary evening; all Nature seemed to be in peace, and not a sound arose to disturb the solemn silence, as the author of this dream gave the vat of cream the last stirring for the night. There were many hopes built on this vat of cream, for when the morn - ing came he was to churn out a tub of butter which was to go into competition with 700 more which were to be considered at the National Creamery Buttermakers' Convention, held in the beautiful City of Lincoln. All day he had worried over this vat of cream; he had made preparations for a week to get this milk into the creamery in fine condition. He had instructed the patrons F. A. LEIGHTON, NEW HAMPTON, IOWA. </seg>
            <seg id="p122">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. 122 I how to.feed and care for the milk, and he had also lectured the milk haulers how to care for the milk while on the road, and it seemed to him if he failed to make a premium tub it would not be his fault, provided that the patrons and milk haulers did their duty. But the day before, as usual, one load failed to come in, and, of course, when on the next day it came, he had to receive it, because he would not have had enough milk without this load. This, then, was the beginning of his trouble, and it seemed to him that, just because he wanted to do his best, things went wrong. First, the starter was not right ; it did not seem to have the same odor and aroma that many of the starters he had used previous to this one contained; then the cream did not seem to ripen well, and, as he gave it the last stirring, and locked the door and walked to his boarding house, his thoughts were troubled, and anxiety was written on his countenance. As he walked along even the creak of his boots on the frosty snow seemed to say, "Not right, not right," and long before he reached home he heartily wished that the convention was over. He went to his room and retired, only to sink into a restless, troubled sleep, and, as he was a bachelor buttermaker, and had nothing to disturb his dreams, they came unmolested. The first scene in his vision seemed to carry him back many years before, when he was a younger man of fifteen years or so, and he seemed to be making butter in one of the old-fashioned creameries prevalent at that time; there was the old blind horse, the square box churn and the hand worker, and even in his dreams his arms ached as he pushed the heavy roller back and forth, back and forth; and still in his dream there was a peace - ful happiness, for with all of the inconveniences there were not these perplexities and troubles which came later. There were no annoyances about mottles, for such a thing was unknown ; there was no worrying about butter flavors or starters, or acid tests; no, even these things were unknown, and our dreamer dreamed on, perfectly content to stay in this blissful and peaceful scene forever. But suddenly he became restless; the scene had changed, and </seg>
            <seg id="p123">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 123 his vision carried him back to the present. This present was as much different from the past scene as the bustling, scheming crowded South Water street is different from some quiet country village, where is heard only the murmur of the soft evening breeze, mingled with the faint tinkle of a bell, as the cow is driven home by the village dairy maid. As he dreamed, it seemed as though all the faults of the butter he had ever made during the past few years had paraded themselves along the foot board oL his bed; they were like the past sins of the drowning man; all he had ever committed came to him in a few brief mo - ments. In the first place, there was a tub of butter walking along the foot-board, and it was red in color, and it was marked ♦'Sold two cents below." Then came a tub from which the water was dripping, and it was also marked "Sold at a loss." Next came a package marked off on salt; then one with a weak body; another very flat in flavor; the next one contained too much buttermilk; then there was one with a steam pipe wrapped around it, and at first this puzzled him very much, but it became more clear as he thought of the live steam he had used for years, and he gave a great sigh in his sleep. Then there was one which walked across the bed, and he could see the prints of his dirty hands on the side; and then there was one marked "Sioux Falls Exhibit, Score 88," and it stopped half way over, and seemed to mock him, as if accusing him of spoiling it and then sending it to the convention to be a disgrace to itself; but the dreamer waved his hands and ordered it to move on, for perhaps it was not his fault; and the pictures of Collyer, Douglas and Healy tacked on the wall seemed to smile at the torture he was undergoing. Then there was quiet for a while, but soon a great troop of tubs of butter came marching along; they came arm in arm, by twos and by fours, whole companies of them, and they danced before his eyes along the foot-board, and he could see they were all marked "mottles." He turned over as if to hide them from his view, but still he could hear them clamoring along the bed, and at last, in his agony, he cried out, "Is there no end of them?" and it seemed to him he could hear them say, as they </seg>
            <seg id="p124">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. 124 passed along, "No end, no end." In time, however, they all passed over,and then came trooping along bills of sales, and there were multitudes of them, dating back for years, and he could see that nearly every one of them was marked one-half cent above, and one would have thought that this would have soothed his troubled spirit, but it did not, for his memory went back to the faulty butter which had just moved past, and his conscience smote him, for he knew he did not deserve this half-cent above. Again, there came over his foot-board whole rows of test tubes, and he could see that many of them were marked 3.40, but would plainly read 4 per cent, and some of them over; this made him groan in his sleep. In his vision he could see in the distance numerous patrons of his competitive creamery, and they were quarreling among themselves and comparing their checks, and accusing their manager and bultermaker of all kinds of mean - ness and mismanagement for not paying as much for butter fat as their neighbor. As he viewed this scene great drops of per - spiration stood out on the forehead of the dreamer, for he real - ized that it was his own miserable self who was responsible for it all, for it was caused by juggling the tests, or reading them low and thereby making it possible to pay a bigger price per pound of fat than his neighbors. In his terrible anguish he made a firm resolve that never again would he be guilty of com - mitting such an outrageous crime as juggling the test just to make his creamery the most noted one in the State. After all the faults and defects in his past work had passed before him in review, and when it seemed he could stand no more, the scene again changed, and he was transported to many years in the future. It seemed to him he was in a place where butter was made, but everything was so much different from anything that he had ever gazed upon before that it was a long time before he could recognize the place as a creamery, but he soon discerned that it was not only a creamery, but was one of the grandest institutions of the kind that his highest imagination could picture. The walls were the finest granite, and the floors marble; every room was divided from the other by plate glass </seg>
            <seg id="p125">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 125 partitions, and the whole building was built on this magnificent scale. One of the most peculiar things which he was first im - pressed with was the presence of so many young ladies with long white aprons, as white and spotless as the snow flakes, and his mind went back to the apparel worn by his helpers and himself, and he wondered how they could keep clean. He could only see one man in the entire building, and he judged that this must be the buttermaker, or foreman, and the young ladies his helpers, and we must not blame him if he envied this man his position; who would not? What an improvement over the help he had had to contend with in the past years! There were many familiar objects that came to his notice as he wandered over the building, and then there were other objects that were new and strange to him; one of the latter held his attention very closely; this was operated by one of the young ladies. A load of bright and shining cans containing milk would be driven up to the weigh room and placed on the elevator, and as each can was set on the scales an instrument resembling a lactometer was placed in the milk just a second, then some kind of a reading taken, and if it read 95 or over it was conducted to a vat marked No. 1, and the name of the patron and weight of the milk was entered on a sheet marked "High grade milk, price $1 per 100;" but if the reading was below 95 it was weighed and conducted to a vat marked No. 2, and the entry was made on the milk sheet marked "Second grade, price 90c." This seemed to him one of the greatest improvements he noticed, and the feature of showing the patron just what his milk was worth that day was one of the most commendable of anything he saw. He was somewhat amazed, however, to notice that none of the patrons raised such objections as they would had such a thing occurred fifty years before, but he laid it to the education they had received during all that time. He also noticed that every one showed a great deal of respect to the buttermaker; if it had been in his day he might have thought that instead of being a buttermaker he was a bank president, or some high official, and he could not help but being amazed at this singular </seg>
            <seg id="p126">126 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. circumstance, for it was so much different from what he was used to. He also learned that the office of manager had been done away with, and that the two offices had been merged into one, the buttermaker being his own manager, and he concluded that this was also a big improvement over the old system, where there were seven managers and sometimes about too. He also learned that in this country there used to be twenty - five creameries, but at the time of hia dream there was only this one, and that their daily output was 30,000 ponnds, or the same amount of butter was made in the one creamery as used to be made in the twenty-five. He could see that this was a great saving in expenses, but he wondered what had become of the other twenty-four buttermakers. However, he learned later that each buttermaker had been appointed township instructor or inspector, and gave instructions in the care of the milk, and on feeds and breeding, to the patrons of that territory. He was informed that they were kept very busy, as the patrons were very forgetful, just the same as they used to be fifty years ago, and h-d to be reinstructed every month or oftener in order to keep the grade of milk up to a high standard. He was very much pleased to see a machine in operation which was heat - ing the milk for the vast number of separators in operation without the aid of live steam. He was informed that it was just within the last year that such a machine had been invented, and he wondered at the idea of taking a half century to invent such a machine, and still it was not so strange, for there had been nearly a quarter of a century before this that the butter - maker had used live steam. By the time, in his dream, that he had gone all over this mag - nificent institution, a gentleman drove up to the creamery whose face was very familiar to him, and he soon learned that it was the son of one of his old New York commission friends, and he was out on the same mission as his father used to be in long years of the past, soliciting butter. He accompanied them to the refrigerating rooms, where the butter was to be examined, and he could not help but notice that the buttermaker produced </seg>
            <seg id="p127">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 127 one of Orin Douglas' butter triers. The butter was bored by the buttermaker and handed to the solicitor, and then how famil - iar it sounded to hear the solicitor brag up the butter! Why, he had a certain trade that would handle this butter every week, but he would want it all, as a big lot sold better than just a few hundred tubs. After the solicitor had expatiated on the merits of the butter, he passed the trier over to our friend, and it was fine butter and no mistake; salted just to a perfection; and what grain! Never had he seen the like. And the flavor! There was only one thing he could compare it with, and this was as if the aroma of twenty-five tubs of his best June creamery had been extracted and concentrated in one tub; then it might have equaled this in flavor; but when he passed his finger along the trier he started, and it nearly wakened him, for the old familiar sight of mottles greeted his eye, and the last thing he remem - bered before he awoke was the solicitor taking the buttermaker aside, and in a low tone telling him he would guarantee him one - half cent above. Mr. Mortensen, of Willow Creek, Iowa, being absent, Mr. Burnett, of Nebraska, was called upon to read his paper. WHAT ARE MO FTLES, AND ARE THEY THE FAULT OF THE BUTTERMAKER ? M. MORTENSON, WILLOW CREEK, IOWA. [From the Eighth AnauU Report of the National Creamery Buttermakers' Association.] The question of mottles is an old one; perhaps no other sub - ject *has been discussed as often as this; nevertheless, mottles appear to be more plentiful than ever. Thousands of dollars are lost every year on account of mottles, although the American dairyman of to-day, with all his education and intelligence, ought to be capable of producing a more perfect grade of butter. By mottles we understand any variation in the color of butter that is caused by uneven distribution of the salt. The parts of </seg>
            <seg id="p128">128 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. butter coming in closer contact with the salt will have a darker shade than the rest. Several years ago there was a great deal written in dairy papers about mottles being caused by small particles of curd or butter, which were in the cream before this was put into the churn, and did not take the color as the rest of the butter while churning. The buttermaker of to-day is not familliar with that kind of mottles. His education has taught him to strain his cream, and the only kind of mottles he knows are those caused by uneven distribution of the salt. The question is now asked, "Are mottles the fault of the but - termaker?" Fellow buttermaker, do not believe that it is my in - tention to throw all the blame upon you. The American buttermaker is often working under so discouraging conditions that it is impossible for him to do perfect work, even though he may have the very best intentions, and understands his work to perfection. He is often doing two men's work, and in that way it will be almost impossible for him to do good and satisfactory work. There are creameries in this country in which you have no way of controlling the temperature. In the winter season the floors are covered with ice, the cream is churned in a box churn, and as soon as the butter is placed on the open worker it becomes hard and dry. After working, the butter is put into the refrig - erator, where the temperature is about zero. As the salt requires both heat and moisture to dissolve, it is clear that it will not dissolve readily under such conditions, and no buttermaker is, in this case, entirely to blame if his butter is reported mottled. It has been claimed that too cold refrigerators cause mottles in butter. A certain maker placed a tub of butter in a f\)om where the temperature was about 60 degrees, while another tub of butter from the same churning was put outdoors where the temperature was about zero. The next day when the butter was examined, the tub placed outdoors proved to be mottled, while the butter in the other tub was free from mottles. This has been explained that, during working, the salt is not fully dis- </seg>
            <seg id="p129">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 129 solved, but if the butter is kept under favorable conditions, the salt will dissolve and penetrate all the particles of butter. This is true to a certain extent. If the salt is not thoroughly dissolved in working, it will partly dissolve if placed in a warm room, but the writer has made experiments the same as tht above men - tioned and found that both the tub that was placed outdoors, where the temperature was about zero, and the one placed at a temperature of 64 degrees, were perfectly free from mottles. This goes to prove that the salt can be fully dissolved and evenly distributed by working, and that the temperature will not cause mottles if the butter has been thoroughly worked. The most complaints on mottled butter are heard in the Winter and Spring. During the summer season conditions ap - pear to be more favorable for the production of even colored butter. Of course in the winter season some of the butter - makers have conditions to contend with as described, but in - most cases it is the fault of the buttermaker. In the Spring of the year when the cows come from dry to fresh food a change takes place in the amount of the various fats which the butter contains. The percentage of olein, which melts at about forty-one degrees, increases, while the percentage of palmitin and stearin, which melt at 140 degrees and 150 de - grees, decreases. Under such conditions the butter will come very soft unless we churn at a comparatively low temperature, but many buttermakers are churning at the same temperature as they did in the month of January, perhaps at 5b to 60 degrees^ without allowing the cream to be cooled any length of time be - fore it is churned. The result is that the butter will be very soft, the salt will mix with difficulty, and the grain does not stand much working before it is overworked. If the cream had* been cooled to about 48 or 50 degrees and left at that tempera - ture one or two hours, and then churned at the same tempera - ture, the grain of the butter would have been firm and in condi - tion to readily dissolve the salt, and it would stand a great deal of working before the grain was injured. When the cows in the Winter change from fresh to dry food, </seg>
            <seg id="p130">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. 130 the olein decreases while the palmitin and stearin increases. The butter is now harder, and churning at a higher temperature is necessary, otherwise we will be apt to have a hard grain which will hold less moisture. In washing the butter it is quite common to use the water as it comes from the well, often at a temperature of 46 degrees or below. The water is allowed to remain in the churn while this is turned a few times and then drained. The particles will be of uneven temperature, and it is impossible to distribute the salt evenly when part of the butter is hard and part soft. During the winter season I churn at a temperature of 54 to 56 degrees. I never use a great deal of water, just enough to float the butter. The water is left in the churn for about five minutes, or until all the butter has reached the same temperature. It is now drained, and salt is added. The churn is then revolved five or six times, then left for about 30 minutes and the working is finished. At the Iowa Dairy school butter has been worked in two minutes this way, and it was free from mottles. Why would other buttermakers not be able to do the same thing? Some buttermakers are very careless in salting the butter in a combined churn; they do not distribute the salt evenly, but often put it all in one place. As the churn itself is not able to distribute the salt from one end to the other, we will in this case have more salt in the butter that is in the center of the churn than in the butter that is close to the ends. The salt is often left in a room where the temperature is about zero. If the salt is used while at that temperature, it will be found to be quite difficult to dissolve. Have the salt at about the same temperature as you have your butter. If the butter is over-churned it is difficult to dissolve the salt and to have it evenly distributed. A buttermaker may separate too thin cream, then by churning at a comparatively low tem - perature he will always be sure to have a hard, round and dry grain, which is the most favorable condition of butter for pro - duction of mottles. My advise to the buttermaker is this : "Buy a butter trier </seg>
            <seg id="p131">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 131 and examine your butter after it is a day old." If you find your butter to be mottled then vyork it again. Rather work your butter two or three times and be free from mottles, than work it once and have the mottles left in the butter. I know but one cause of mottles, "Uneven distribution of salt." COMPOSITE SAMPLING AND TESTING OF MILK AND CREAM. C. H. ECKELS, IOWA DAIRY SCHOOL, AMUS, IOWA. (From the Eighth Annual Report of the National Creamery Buttermakers' Association. ] The system of paying for milk according to quality as shown by the Babcock test, and not by quantity, has become so gen - eral, that it seems unnecessary to say anything regarding the great advantages of the systen. The test is a simple process, but in order to make it of any real use in the creamery careful attention must be given to the details of manipulation. Taking the daily sample is a simple operation, but it must be done right. There are three common ways of taking these samples: With a small dipper, from a small hole in the spout carrying the milk, known as a drip sample, and by using a sampling tube, ihe most widely used of these, probably, being the "milk thief." Any one of these methods will usually give satisfaction if correctly used. Theoretically, the drip or sample tube methods are the most accurate. A fair sample should be a correct average of the entire amount of milk brought by the patron, and in order to get this, it should be remembered that the fat rises rapidly to the top, so the sample, when taken with a dipper, should be taken at once after the milk is emptied. For keeping samples of milk, corrosive sublimate gives about the best results. The tablet forms are more convenient to use, but also more expensive than the powdered substance, which may be bought at any drug store. Potassium dichromate </seg>

Then if there be any complaint, the milk may be tested again in the presence of the patron, and the error, if any, corrected. Before taking a sample for testing from a composite jar the cream which collects around the sides should always be mixed with the milk. This is easily done by using a brush. When the samples are so cold that the cream will not mix regularly, it is good policy to set the jars in warm water until the temperature of the milk is raised to about 90 or 95 degrees, when the cream will easily mix. Many operators have difficulty in getting clear tests, especially with some of the modern steam turbine machines. A careful observation will show that there are three conditions which pre - vent clearness of tests. First. — When the top of the fat column is covered with a dirty scum or with bubbles. This indicates that the water used for filling the bottles was not right. The bubbles come from the action of the acid on minerals in the water. The bubbles in rising carry dirty sediment to the top. Any lack of clear - ness on the top of the fat column may be at once charged to the water used. The remedy is to use rain water or water con - densed from steam at some distance from the boiler. Second. — Where the column of fat is light yellow in color with a whitish sediment in the lower part: This shows the.ac - tion of the acid was not strong enough, and can be remedied by using a little more, or often by warming the milk before adding the acid. Third. — Where the column of fat is rather dark yellow, with black sediment in the lower part or below the fat. This shows too strong action of the acid. The action of the acid is greatly affected by heat, so this burned condition may not indicate that the acid itself is too strong, but that the milk or acid was too warm or the machine heated the bottles too much in whirling. Some of the steam machines will invariably produce this burned </seg>
            <seg id="p133">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 133 condition if a full measure of acid is used. The amount of acid used should be regulated to suit the conditions. The amount used does not affect the amount of fat present as is often thought, but affects only the clearness of the test. No one need be afraid for this reason to use whatever amount their conditions require. By observing the manner of reading the test by a large number of experienced men when first coming to the dairy school, I am convinced that about three-fourths of the creamery men of the State read the test too low. In general they read from the center of the curved upper surface instead of from the top, which gives the reading about 2 per cent too low. To compare with the chemical analysis, which is standard, the column of fat must be read to the extreme top and bottom, even if it does make a smaller overrun. CREAM TESTING. The wide use of farm separators has brought a new problem to many in regard to testing cream. Judging from the number of inquiries received, this.is at present a question of considerable concern to maqy creamerymen. Most of the creameries paying for milk by the test pay for cream by the same method. How - ever, I find quite a number paying for millc by the Babcock test, but are testing cream that is brought them by the oil test churn. Accurate testing of cream with the Babcock system involves more difficulties and requires more care than the testing of milk, but any creameryman can, by using the proper care, do work accurate enough for all practical purposes. There is no reason why cream should not be tested and paid for by the Babcock test just as milk. It is evident that when the same price per pound is paid for butter fat in milk, according to the Babcock test, as in cream by oil test churn, there is injustice done. The basis of payment in one case is the total amount of butter fat, in the other the amount of churnable fat. In sampling cream even more care is needed than with milk, as it is harder to get a uniform mixture. Before taking a sample from a bottle for testing, it is generally advisable to warm the </seg>
            <seg id="p134">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. 134 cream to near ioo degrees. In mixing cream air bubbles will become mixed in if agitated violently, and this will reduce the amount measured by the pipette. Pouring from one jar to another is better than shaking. If the cream tests more than the cream bottle will yield, a pipetteful may be divided about equally between two bottles. A pipetteful of water is also divided into the bottles, then, after the tests are completed, the results are added. If cream is tested by measuring out with the 17.6 cubic centi - meter pipette the results are too low for two reasons. The basis of the Babcock test is 18 grams. The 17.6 cubic centimeter pipette delivers this much milk, but as cream is more adhesive than milk, a considerable amount will stick to the pipette. In sour or thick cream this error may be as much as 2 per cent. This error is easiest removed by filling the pipette about one - third full of warm water, shaking to loosen the cream from the sides, then adding this to the cream in the test bottle. The other error is on account of the lightness of cream as compared with milk. A pipetteful of cream does not weigh i&amp; grams, the regulation amount, but somewhat h*ss — depending upon the richness of the cream. If it is necessary to have an exact test of cream, especially of thick cream, it may be obtained by using delicate scales and weighing out the desired amount. During the past few months we have made about 1500 tests of cream in an experimental way. As a result of these tests we have prepared a table which shows the amount of the error due to the lightness of cream when measured with a 17.6 cubic cen - timeter pipette. When the cream that adheres to the pipette is rinsed out, cream that reads 10 per cent should read 10. 1 per cent; 15 per cent should read 15.2 per cent; 20 per cent should read 20.4 per cent; 25 per cent should read 25.7 per cent; 30 per cent should read 31 per cent; 35 per cent should read 36.4 per cent; 40 per cent should read 41.8 per cent; 45 per cent should read 47.4 per cent; 50 per cent should read 5^.9 percent. By the use of this table a man can test cream by the Babcock </seg>

The details of sampling and testing require, and are worthy of, the creameryman's most earnest and careful attention. The Babcock test, under proper conditions of use, does exact justice to all, and instead of being a cause of friction between patron and creamery, it should be a peacemaker and a judge that in - creases business and encourages improvement among the herds of the dairyman. It pays, as a business policy, to give a man just what he is entitled to, no more and no less. I believe a crearo - eryman should know when he finishes a set of tests that he would be able to go before the supreme court and swear they are cor - rect. It does not take the patrons of a creamery long to find out whether the testing is being done carefully or not. I don't believe it pays for a man to keep the time of testing a secret, and allow no patron present; rather announce the time when the tests are to be be made, and invite anybody that wishes to be present. Let the creameryman once gain the confidence of his patrons by accurate, careful work, and his troubles on account of tests will be light. DISCUSSION. Mr. Armstrong: In testing the milk, would not the over - run from cream be just the same as it would be in the over-run for milk? The oil test is so scaled that it is supposed to give you the butter oil of the cream and not the fat. If a man brings 100 pounds of 3 per cent milk into the creameijy, and is paid by the test, he would only be getting his proportion on three pounds of butter, while the man who would bring 100 pounds of cream would hardly be treated fair if the creamery would be paying for the butter fat instead of the over-run. President Boardman: I don't see the difference. The man who wants pay for twenty-five pounds of butter fat has to send 1,000 pounds of milk. Member: I think that the over-run on cream is a trifle larger </seg>
            <seg id="p136">136 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. than the over-run on milk. For instance, I get in a certain quantity of 4 per cent milk and a certain quantity of cream. I have nothing to do with the cream but churn it, while with the milk I must separate it and handle it, and that would naturally cause a certain amount of loss which we can not avoid. I think the cream will give you a little larger over-run than the milk. I have found it so. Member: Has any one had any experience in weighing the sample of cream instead of testing? I understand there is such a way of testing the cream by weighing instead using the Bab - cock test. President Boardman: They use the Babcock test whenever th'ey weigh it. They only weigh it instead of using the pipette. The cream varies so in richness that the same pipette will not do. Member: I think Mr. Armstrong was getting at the differ - ence in cost between producing a pound of butter from milk and a pound of butter from the cream. Mr. Armstrong: I will state it a little plainer. I have a few figures. Suppose I take 3 per cent milk with an over-run of 15 per cent, which is usually figured. That would give a small fraction over .4 of a pound on the over-run in 100 pounds of milk. If you paid by the Babcock test, that would give you .4 of 1 per cent for handling that milk. We were talking the other day about some of us paying our expenses by the over - run. Now if a man brings in 100 pounds of 30 per cent cream and I take 15 per cent over-run, that would give me 4.5 pounds of butter for handling that cream, which would be a large per cent. You would also have a great deal less wOrk in handling that, cream than you would in handling the same amount of milk. Member: But don't you see, you would have to pay ten times more money for the cream than you would for the milk. Member: I would like to ask of anyone in the room who is having milk hauled to the creamery, and also taking in cream separated on the farm, whether there is any difference in paying </seg>
            <seg id="p137">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 137 for the butter fat separated on the farm and that separated in the creamery? Member: I skim milk at the factory and also have skim stations. In testing cream I use the 18 centimeter pipette in - stead of the 17.6. The over-run in the milk would run from 12 to 15 per cent, where the over-run in the cream would run from 20 to 25 per cent — that is over-run of the butter. Of course in my case it doesn't matter. Mr. Fulmer: I don't know as I have anything to say along that line. It seems to me that this question has been miscon - strued. The question of over-run is one that I have had to deal wUh in connection with dairy students for some years back. They have always seemed to have more or less trouble in under - standing it. It seems to me the correct way to do would be to drop the question of over-run and pay for a pound of butter fat. For instance if a certain number of men deliver a given amount of milk to the creamery it is tested and a certain amount of butter fat is found in it. They should be paid for the number of pounds of butter fat they deliver and the question of over- run should be dropped. Mr. Armstrong: Cooperative creameries figure that the number of pounds of butter they get over and above the num - ber of pounds of butter fat they pay the patron for will pay the running expenses of the factory. Therefore the claim is made that where you take in both milk and cream, by the use of the Babcock test, that the man who is delivering cream is paying a larger per cent of the running expenses of the creamery than the man who is delivering milk. Mr. Fulmer: Perhaps absolute justice is not done. When we get down to an absolute test perhaps the Babcock test does not do justice. The man who has the richer cream is the loser in the end. That loss is found in the skim-milk. It seems to me the proper way would be to deduct the running expenses from the sale of butter. Mr. McKinstry: Let me state the question from the patron's standpoint. I milk twenty cows and I use the Baby 10 </seg>

I started in delivering cream that would average 30 per cent butter fat, but I found out that I was getting it "in the neck." I tried to get it through the creameryman's head where the trouble was, but I was in a minority and the board didn't see it the way I did, so I was left in the lurch. We have about thirty of these separators in the creamery, and we are getting an awful good over-run, and we are getting it on this one point. They do not weigh the test, and hardly ever use the 18-cc. pipette. Mr. Green: We have had some little experience along this line. We have some skimming stations, and our method of doing business is to sample cream with the 18-cc. pipette. We get almost the same results from the cream test that we do from the milk test. Member: I would like to ask the buttermakers what they find the best method of taking the test? The 17.6 pipette or what they use; also what they use for getting the sample of milk. I have been using a pipette with a rubber bulb. I do not think it is very good. President Boardman: I agree with you there. W. H. Adams (Clarion, la.): I would like to state that we are using the farm separator system altogether. We started in with part milk and part cream. We used the Babcock test on the milk. The patrons thought they wanted the oil test on the cream. Our milk was very light. We commenced using the oil test on the cream. Our milk kept dwindling down, and to-day we are only taking the cream. 1 use the 18-cc. test. We have no complaints. The patrons are satisfied. Our prices are good and our patrons are getting out of debt. I do not see any great necessity for taking expenses out of this over-run. I do not see why the creamery man can not get his expenses out of the produce. President Boardman : I think when you were running milk and cream both, that you were not running fair. Now you are all right. Mr- Armstrong : That is why I asked the question. We </seg>
            <seg id="p139">FIFTEKNTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 139 have but one farm separator in our territory. The man who uses this separator thought he wasn't being treated fair, and, honestly, I can't figure out but what it is wrong. I didn't tell him so, of course. I told him before he got his farm separator that I would do the best for him that 1 could. I told him, how - ever, that I would rather he did not buy it. He insisted on geting it, and then he afterward got so dissatisfied with the cream - ery that he dropped out. That is the reason why I asked the question. Mr, Adams: I would like to ask the man where the injustice comes in if each man is tested with the oil test and the Babcock test not used? Member: Well, that is all right then. Mr. Fulmer: I would like to ask the gentleman who uses, the oil test how he reads the test? Mr. Adams: By the formula that came with it. THE CAUSE OF MOULD AND HOW TO PREVENT IT. [From the Eighth Annual Report of the National Creamery Buttermaicers' Association.! Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen and Brother Buttermakers : You will find on the prepared program this subject: "The Cause of Mould and How to Prevent it." Our esteemed Sec - retary wrote me away up in South Dakota, and asked me to write a short paper on that subject. The request coming so late to me did not give me time to prepare very much to say, but for the benefit of my brother buttermakers I will give my method of preoaring the package for use which has proven very satisfac - tory to me, so much so that in my ten years' experience as but - termaker I have never had a case of mould reported. As to the causes of mould, I will pass over these, as I believe the causes are various. What we are interested in most is to prevent mould, and I maintain that lies within our power as but- M. L.

I don't like the idea of filling tubs with water to leave stand - ing over night; it is liable to burst the hoops, and tubs often get out of shape, and it won't prevent mould. The afternoon of the day before I want to use them I immerse the tubs in scalding water for at least a half hour. This soaks them inside and out, and the hoops at the same time, and 1 have no bursted hoops. Then the scalding water enters the pores of the wood and kills the mould germs. I then sprinkle the inside thoroughly with salt and let stand empty over night. As soon as I have steam in the morning I steam each tub three minutes, then fill with cold water and let stand till ready to pack. You now have a perfectly water tight package and one that is dry and clean when it reaches the market, and I am very certain you will have no mould. DISCUSSION. Mr. Oltrogge : I would like to ask whether the salt has any - thing to do with the mould. I soak my tubs thoroughly a half hour before using them, and then wash them. I have never had a case of mould. Mr. Armstrong: Does not this method make a tub look wet and soggy — that is, if you scald them in hot water? Mr. Adams: My tub sent to the convention was soaked in the same way, and it looks as dry and bright as the rest. I just soak it one-half hour. I didn't soak the tub itself; I simply put the water in the tub, you understand. The water will run over the outside of the tub onto the hoops. Mr. Wilson: I think the difficulty is that most creamery - men do not heat their water hot enough. If the water is boiled the tub will be perfectly dry when it is taken out if the cooling room is in proper shape. Most cooling rooms are too damp. President Boardman: I want to state along that line that when I was dairy commissioner nine-tenths of the refrigerators I went into in Iowa were not fit to have a tub of butter left in for </seg>
            <seg id="p141">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 141 twenty-four hours. They were not fit to be called refrigerators. You would find mould on the walls and ceiling, and the smell there was not at all pleasant, and I only wonder that more butter is not mouldy. Mr. Brandt: I would like to ask if there is any one here who has ever practiced the habit of scalding the tubs in hot brine in addition to salting them, and if so, how long have they kept them and how successfully? Mr. Armstrong: I will say that I personally follow that plan, but of late I have thought of adopting another plan that I find leaves the tub in splendid shape. That is to have a tank of hot water and take a brush and thoroughly scrub the tub; then I dip the tub in, and then put it over the steam jet, and in ten minutes it is perfectly dry. In the evening I fill them up with cold water, and leave them standing until morning. In put - ting the tub over the steam jet, I find that the steam will leak through if there are any cracks in the tub. Personally I like this method of scrubbing the tub with hot water. The water soaks it and then the steam closes it up, and it does not discolor in this way. Mr. Adams: I think I will find better satisfaction from scalding the tubs and then turning them up, as Mr. Armstrong says, and then filling them in the morning with cold water and a handful of salt, than he will in steaming them. Mr. Bee (Minn.) : I have lost hundreds of dollars on mouldy butter, but we put in a Herrick refrigerator, and are treating the tubs just the same, and we have never had a speck of mould since. Member : Well, we never lost anything on mouldy butter, but we saw the time was coming when we would be liable to do so, so we tore up the old, soggy, mouldy refrigerator we had and put in a factory-made one, and the tubs would come in there wet after packing, and within four hours they would be dry. I think more mould is created in the factory than in the prepara - tion of the tub. It is a wonder to me that more complaint is not made about mould. I went into a refrigerator in Minnesota — </seg>
            <seg id="p142">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. 142 one of our best creameries — and their refrigerator had gotten into such a shape that in order to keep dry you really had to have a rain coat while you were in there. They had to provide some - thing else, and so they put in a factury refrigerator, and now they are all right. I think all the creameries will have to come to some such an arrangement. Mr Armstrong: I will say that they will have to put the directors to soak a good while before they can get what they want in the line of refrigerators. President Boardman: I have thought that if I didn't have anything else to do I would take a good carpenter and canvass Iowa and Minnesota and interest the directors — providing I could get somebody to soak them — and do a good business in carrying out their refrigerators and putting in new ones. Mr. Casey: I am not a buttermaker; I am the manager of a creamery, and they just now threw a little reflection on the creamery manager, and it kind of hurt me, but 1 will tell them right now that the creamery managers in Iowa have been soaked well enough by the builders of the creameries in Iowa. However, we have gained some experience and we can use that later. We have a very good refrigerator in our creamery. I think I will be borne out in that statement. Mr. Moore: You mentioned a while ago that you were sur - prised that there were not more mouldy tubs from Iowa, consid - ering the class of refrigerators used. The cause of mould, how - ever, has not been touched upon, and I am left to say that I feel convinced that the principal and primary cause of mould lies in the fact that the wood from which the tub is made is cut while the sap is in the wood. We have had considerable trouble with our tubs lately because the timber lands from which came the wood used in making these tubs were flooded, and it was im - possible to get the wood in season, and so it was cut later in the Spring, when the sap was in the wood. If the wood is cut when the sap is in the ground and in the roots, there will be no trouble with mould. Of course tubs will mould from other causes than those I have mentioned, but you take a tub made </seg>
            <seg id="p143">• FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 143 from wood cut while the sap is in it and it is bound to mould, even under the most favorable conditions. If you get tubs made from that wood you will get mould, whatever the conditions. It seems to me that we will see this mould disappear within the next few years, for the reason that the manufacturers of the tubs are discovering the cause, and every manufacturer is trying to avoid it. The buttermakers want to be careful about not going too far; they can soak their tubs too much. If I found that my butter was moulding I would throw the tubs in the fire, and if I had some in the tubs I would have the purchaser strip these tubs and place the butter in other tubs. The cheapest thing in the end for you, if you get a line of tubs that produce mould, is to throw them away, and if you can possibly do so, return these tubs to the manufacturer and get others in their place. Mr. Sutton : I have no theories to offer which would be of any benefit to the convention. I will state briefly the experience of some fifteen years along the line. The creamery I first operated was one that was rather carelessly built, and when you went into the cooling room it was so damp that it was necessary to have an umbrella and rain coat to keep one's self dry. I used that cooling room for several years, and all the tubs we used were apparently made from wood cut while the sap was in the wood. But by the advice of a man who knew what he was talking about, I put in a cooling room on new principles, and after that the wood from which the tubs were made must all have been cut while the sap was in the ground, because the tubs could be put in the refrigerator dripping wet, and in twenty-four hours you could strike a match on them. * </seg>
            <seg id="p144">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. 144 IS PASTEURIZING OR STERILIZING SKIM MILK A SUCCESS? W. F. JENSEN, BELOIT, KAN. [Prom the Eighth Annual Report of the National Creamery Buttermakers' Association.! The question is asked me, "Is pasteurizing or sterilizing skim, milk a success?" I will answer "Yes, in every way." The leading question among creamery patrons of to-day is how to raise a good calf. In some localities, the success or failure in that respect more than overbalances the returns for milk or butter fat. By overcoming the obstacles in the way of raising a good calf on creamery skim-milk, we have also practically solved the hand separator question, the principal argument of the hand separator enthusiast being that a larger and better calf can be raised on hand separator skim-milk. The experiment station at the Kansas State Agricultural Col - lege has experimented along these lines in order to determine whether any difference existed between hand separator and sterilized creamery skim-milk. One lot of calves was fed five months on sterilized creamery skim-milk and kaffir corn meal. Another lot was fed five months on hand separator skim-milk and kaffir corn meal. We have the following results : The calves fed sterilized creamery skim-milk made an aver - age gain each of 1.76 pounds per day. The "calves fed hand separator skim-milk made an average each of 1.75 pounds per day. Practically the same gain on both lots. The patron prefers sweet skim-milk returned, and knows, in order to receive it, he must furnish the creamery his milk fresh and in good condition. This will eventually lead to a general improvement in all milk received at the creamery. The pro - cess of heating the milk sufficiently destroys all the disease </seg>
            <seg id="p145">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 145 germs that can be found in milk, and thus eliminates the danger of any disease germs being scattered from the creamery. What are the disadvantages? They are very few. More fuel is used, of course, and if milk in a poor condition is delivered at the creamery, it will curdle and become of small value as a calf food when sterilized. We have two methods, pasteurization and sterilization, ac - complishing the same object. Let us look into the characteris - tics of both. Pasteurization means heating the milk above 185 degrees, cool - ing it immediately below 60 degrees. We find one serious ob - jection to this method: There is generally a small amount of milk left in the milk can when weighed and emptied at the creamery. This small amount is sufficient to contaminate the pasteurized milk put in the can, and germs will commence to in - crease in the milk, and the milk will not keep sweet the length of time it should to fulfil its purpose. Sterilization means heating the milk to 200 degrees and above, with no immediate artificial cooling. Any small amount of milk left in the milk can will be properly sterilized when mixed with the skim-milk from the creamery. We find that with the different apparatus on the market, skim-milk can be sterilized to perfection by the exhaust steam from the engine. This method has many good points. No additional fuel is needed, and an even and perfect sterilization can be obtained at all times. The skim-milk vat and the exhaust steam sterilizer should be located outside the building, under a porch, so that the surplus exhaust steam can escape. To obtain the best re - sults, the sterilized skim-milk should be placed in cold water after being returned to the farmer, or, by some other method be cooled down as rapidly as possible. It will then keep sweet a long time. There is no question but that pasteurization or sterilization of skim-milk is a success. It affects a very large and valuable product of the dairy. In late years, science has taught us its food value and has suggested this method of treating it so as to </seg>
            <seg id="p146">146 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. retain this value and free it of all disagreeable disease breeding germs. It is one of the improvements that has to come in every creamer}', and the man who opposes it is opposing his patrons and his own best interest. I know of a little country across the sea, small in territory, but great in dairy knowledge, where this question has been taken up and a law is enacted compelling all creameries to pasteurize or sterilize their skim-milk. They have seen the necessity of this step. My own practical experience in every way bears out the theory advanced on this subject. DISCUSSION. Mr. Hurst: I would like to ask the gentleman how long a can of milk, sterilized at 10 o'clock to 150 degrees, at average methods at the average creamery, and put up in the farmer's can — how long that will keep in the average can sent to the creamery ? Answer: Personally I have had no experience with pas - teurized skim-milk. I should think that under ordinary condi - tions it would keep until the next day, as long as would be neces - sary to keep it to feed. ■ Mr. Sonoergard: Do you mean you do not sterilize your milk? Answer : 1 mean I do not pasteurize it. Mr. Michels: What sterilizer do you use? Answer: We use the Pioneer, manufactured in South Da - kota. Member: How long will average milk keep sweet in or - dinary weather? Answer: It will keep sweet from two to three days. If taken care of it will keep nearly a week, except in Summer and Fall, when it is too hot. Mr. Brandt: I would like to ask whether or not there is any objection on the part of the farmer to the sterilizing of the </seg>
            <seg id="p147">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 147 milk, by which I mean the milk being boiled to about 200 and then cooled. Is there any objection, and if so, what is it? Answer: I can answer that. I have never heard any ob - jection. There has never been any objection advanced to me. Mr. Hurst: I have heard one objection in our territory, and that is that the milk got back so warm that it was a little too hot to feed to the calves; when it was 150 degrees they couldn't feed it to the calves. Mr. Brandt: We have had an objection brought forward in our country, too. That is that in the summer time it is very warm, and it is too uncomfortable for a man to sit on top of a load of cans heated to 150 degrees. It is too warm for him. That is the only objection I have heard, and it is as sensible as any other that could be made. There are a great many farmers in other territories that think it is not necessary to sterilize the milk, and they have various excuses for not doing so, but the best dairy men .sterilize their milk and insist on it. Mr. Hurst: I would like to ask another question. Suppose you took a can of that milk at 150 degrees and cooled it down to 70 degrees or colder; wouldn't it keep sweet longer at 150 degrees than it would colder? Answer: It would. Mr. Armstrong: How do you manage when the milk comes in sour on a hot summer day? Mr. Jensen: I would say that on an average there are not more than six or seven days — never more than ten days when the milk comes in sour. Then, of course, we do not sterilize. Mr. White : Is it not a fact that if milk goes through the separator it can be sterilized? If it is fit to go through the sepa - rator you can sterilize it, can't you? Mr. Jknsen: Yes, it is a fact. At the same time I have received milk coming in on a hot, sultry day, when if you refused any you would, apparently, have to refuse it all. As I said before, however, there are probably only six or seven days this would occur. There might not be so many days when it would be sour in Minnesota and the northern states. This is </seg>

Mr. Brandt: I would like to ask, also, whether or not the skim-milk from the farm comes in in better shape when you ster - ilize the skim-milk than when you do not? Answer: It does. Mr. Brandt: What is the reason? Answer: The patrons are interested in this matter. They want to receive the skim-milk back sweet ; they are interested in furnishing the whole milk sweet. The average fanner does not scour his can properly. By sterilizing the milk we get it out in better shape, and the milk will come in in better condition. Mr. Strayer: I wish to say that we have been pasteurizing our milk for about a year, and I haven't heard of but a couple of people who didn't like it. The rest are well satisfied. In regard to the matter Mr. Jensen spoke of, we probably only missed about eight or ten days last Summer that we couldn't pasteurize it, when it came in sour. I pasteurize by exhaust steam, and when the milk is too sour to pasteurize, I turn it off. President Boardman: Those ten days that you didn't pas - teurize, did the patrons make any complaint? Answer: No sir, because we told them why we couldn't. President Boardman: Your experience has been different from mine. In my creamery some time something breaks down and we can't pasteurize, and we have complaints: "What is the matter with the milk?" "We don't want that kind of milk." And in order to keep the farmers good-natured and make the calves grow we must pasteurize it. I think it is one of the necessities of the creamery. Mr. Howard: I would like to know what method to follow with that milk after it is loaded into the wagons. . Must the can be closed tight until the milk is fed, or will it keep sweet any - way, if the cans are left open ? Mr. Jensen : Why, I really don't think it makes any difference whether the cans are left open or not. If they cool the milk it </seg>
            <seg id="p149">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 149 will keep sweet a longer time. That is probably the only way it will help the keeping power of the milk. Mr. Day: Will you tell us what kind of a pasteurizer you are using, Mr. Boardman? President Boardman : We are using one manufactured in South Dakota; I think it is called the Pioneer sterilizer. My buttermaker, who is a sort of an ingenious fellow, wanted to fix up something of his own, and I told him to go ahead. He has used it now six months, and it seems all right. He has a small cylinder with a steam pipe blocked up at the end, and a lot of holes bored into this little pipe. We ao not use exhaust steam, because we use that to heat the boiler. We turn the steam on from the boiler, and it goes into this pipe and into the cylinder, and the milk is pumped into the cylinder. As the milk goes out of the cylinder there is a little thermometer which gives the exact temperature of the milk. He has the full credit for this system. It is perfectly satisfactory, heats up the creamery less and does the work well. There is one difficulty with pasteurizing milk, and that is the foaming. I think when the milk is a little sour or tainted that it is more liable to foam. To avoid that, we have placed in the creamery a large galvanized tank which will hold twice as much milk as we ever get, and underneath this tank is placed a galvan - ized floor with a 2x4 rim around, all solid and tight. In one corner of it is a waste pipe, so that if any runs over it is caught in this pan-like floor and is carried down. Now the skim-milk tank is scalded off clean just as often as the churn. We may have more churnings than one, but the tank is cleaned every day. If the skim-milk is not all taken off by the farmers, it is drawn off by a drain, so the tank will be perfectly clean, so there are no germs to accumulate. Mr. Andbrson : I would like to ask the relative value of the two systems of sterilization or pasteurization of skim-milk, and also the relative qualities of the two. The difference, I under - stand, is about 50 or 60 degrees. Mr. Jensen: I will say that we use the exhaust steam steril- </seg>
            <seg id="p150">150 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. izer, and that it practically doesn't cost anything to sterilize the milk. About a year ago we used live steam, and I think it cost us forty cents for io.ooo pounds, and I should imagine it would be about the same for pasteurization, and in addition, the cost of ice, if ice were used for cooling the skim-milk. Mr. Anderson: Can you give me the relative value of the milk for feeding purposes? Mr. Jensen: I do not think I can do that. Mr. Anderson: Does sterilized milk foam as much as pas - teurized milk? Mr. Jensen: No sir, it does not. We are not troubled with any foaming. That is one point in favor of it. Mr. Armstrong: Do you think the pasteurized skim-milk, if we only heat it to 150 degrees, will keep for any length of time? Mr. Jensen: I do not know. I never tried it, but I know that our skim-milk, if it is only heated to 160 or 180, will not keep sweet a sufficient length of time. We have to heat it to 200 or above. Mr. Hurst : ' After that gets cooled down to say 70 degrees, do any bacteria begin to grow? Mr. Jensen: Yes, I think so. THE PRACTICAL MANAGEMENT OF THE COM - BINED CHURN AND WORKER. [Prom the Eighth Annual Report of the National Creamery Buttermakers' Association.) Next to the great revolution brought about in buttermaking by the invention of the centrifugal cream separator, the combined churn and worker stands paramount. However, they can not exactly be compared with cream separators, for with these sev - eral years elapsed before a practical and efficient machine was manufactured, while with the combined churn and worker, the J. K. BENNETT, CLINTON FALLS, MINN. </seg>
            <seg id="p151">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 151 very first was a decided success, and with the exception of im - provements for easier" manipulation and durability, the combined churn to-day does not differ materially from the first to appear on the market. Like all other good things, it was hard to protect by patents, and there were several other combined machines soon on the market, selling in competition with the original. These latter productions have met with varying success, as have the various makes of cream separators. It was the beginning of a new era in buttermaking, as almost anybody could make butter with one of these machines. Still, there were those who were skeptical of its merits, and I may say there are those to-day who find little favor for these machines. The change from the old box churn and table worker to the new improved was a red letter day with buttermakers. All that the buttermaker would have to do was to start the thing and it would do the rest. But with its introduction different conditions presented themselves, heretofore unthought of. It called for a decided change in churning temperatures; this in turn presented new conditions and requirements for washing and working the the butter. In short, the great invention, instead of saving the buttermakers trouble, brought with it a multitude more. Never - theless, the combined churn and worker is a success, and in the few years it has been on the market, it has fast superseded the box churn, and to-day, none, or very few of the latter, find their way either in new creameries or to replace worn-out predeces - sors. In presenting this subject, "The Practical Management of the Combined Churn and Worker," I must confine myself to the make of the churn I am used to handling, with all respect for others with which I have had no experience. 1 refer to the Disbrow. The churning temperature best adapted for the combined ma - chine, I can give only approximately. Different localities, feeds and conditions call for different temperatures. That tempera - ture which will give exhaustive churning in a reasonable length of time, and at which butter will granulate sufficiently to readily </seg>
            <seg id="p152">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. 152 draw off the buttermilk, and to a condition which, when the wash water is run on and a few revolutions given the churn, will leave the butter in a clean-cut, fine granular form. This time my experience has shown me to be about an hour, and at a temperature varying all the way from 48 to 60 degrees, accord - ing to the season of the year and density of the cream. Do not over-load your churn. Nowadays when thick skim - ming is considered the best, it is very easy to churn more butter than can be properly worked. The temperature of churning, and amount churned, according to capacity of churn, has very much to do with so much weak and short bodied butter. The temperature of wash water, and not maintaining an even tem - perature during the process of working, is the principal cause of so much salvy, wavy, streaked and mottled butter. If you churn at a high temperature you will very likely get a weak bodied butter, but at a low temperature not necessarily a short bodied butter. Usually low temperature insures good body, but my observation has lead me to believe that much of this short bodied butter, so much a mystery, is often caused by that condition of cream churned at such a low temperature, that it takes too long after the cream first begins to break until it is churned enough to allow of the drawing off of the buttermilk. We have all probably had this same experience when it has taken perhaps 1 5 minutes to gather the butter, so to speak. The continued pounding and pouring over the necessary internal parts of a combined churn and worker seems to wear out the grain and make a short, brittle-bodied butter. As to the temperature of wash water, it must be cold enough to so temper the butter that it will stand working to thoroughly incorporate the salt without over-working or destroying the grain and making it salvy. Some contend that wash water should be tempered to the same degree that the buttermilk is, when it it is drawn off. To this I do not agree, as seldom will butter be churned cold enough to give the butter a body firm enough to allow sufficient work - ing. The objection raised is that part of the butter, will be chilled by running in this cold water, so that it will not take salt, </seg>
            <seg id="p153">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 153 &gt;ut if butter is properly granulated, and after a few revolutions of the churn, how can there be anything but an even tempera - ure? There may be a few granules where the water runs in hat are colder than the rest, but how long will it be before these ew granules will be tempered by the surrounding mass, scat - ered as they are through the whole churning? Ordinary water, just as it comes from the well, I consider a good, safe emperature. Ifow as to the working. Aim during the whole process to p the butter at an even temperature. Keep the churn door ed until wash water is drained off. Have your salt tem - id to the same degree as that of the wash water as it runs and you will be on the right road to make a piece of butter ierfect color. You know the combined churn and worker i a greal deal of the credit for so much mottled butter, er salt has been evenly scattered over the butter, give the rn a few revolutions on slow motion before changing to a ker. This will mix and thoroughly distribute the salt &gt;ugh the whole granular mass. Then change to a worker work until the salt is pretty well incorporated and the brine ins to squeeze out. Keep churn closed tight and allow it to id about an hour to dissolve the salt. Then finish working, wing the brine to drain off as desired. The absolute control r the drainage of brine from one of these combined machines commendable feature in regulating the moisture left in the ter. As to how much or how long to work the butter, I cannot say. One must use their judgment and work more or less as shown by a careful inspection of their dair^work with a butter trier. When the working is divided into two workings, as I ad - vocate, cutting with a string as working approaches the finish is a very good plan to tell when it is worked enough. During the hour in which the butter is standing for salt to dissolve, the butter will become quite mottled, and as a rule, when these mot - tles disappear entirely with the second working, the butter is worked enough, provided that an even temperature has been </seg>
            <seg id="p154">NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. 154 maintained. Too much importance cannot be attached to this even temperature. It is the greatest mottle conqueror. In calculating the amount of salt for a churning, the most practical way, I think, is by the thousand pounds of milk, the same as for coloring. The amount of salt required will vary somewhat, according to the moisture in the butter, which mois - ture can only be estimated by judging from the size and appear - ance of the granular butter. The smaller the granules the more moisture and more salt required. The larger the granules the less moisture and less salt required. It is practically impossible to always have your butter in just the same condition when it is ready for salt. It requires judgment and care every time, and even then it is a good plan to taste of the butter as it is nearly a finished product. A very little salt scattered in at this time may avoid too light salted butter, as well as a little fresh water added may avoid a too heavily salted butter. These machines are easily cleaned. It requires a thorough washing every day. By the use of plenty of hot water, a little washing powder or sal soda, no trouble will be found in keeping them sweet and clean. In summing up the practical management of the combined churn and worker, 1 will say of" it that nothing in a creamery requires more careful handling, the exercising of more sound judgment or that responds more quickly to a buttermaker's skill. DISCUSSION. Chairman: Mr. Bennett, the author of the paper, is present and ready to have you ask him questions. Mr. Armstrong : What do you mean by the varying density of the cream? Answer: The amount of butter fat in it. Mr. Hurst: Suppose your butter was at 60 degrees, with 200 to 250 pounds of butter. How many revolutions would you give it to work it? Mr. Bennett: I don't know. I don't work it at as warm a </seg>
            <seg id="p155">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 155 temperature as that, and I don't know as I ever counted the number of revolutions. I don't count them at all. Mr. Bechte: I would like to know whether you maintain the same speed from start to finish during the churning? Mr. Bennett: In churning 1 use the fast motion; in work - ing it I use the slow motion. Mr. Eicher: Would it be advisable to change to the slow motion just as the butter began to gather? Mr. Bennett: I shouldn't think so. I should think if you would do so you wouldn't get a good granulation on the butter. Mr. Vind: What effect would it have on the butter if you would run the churn faster or slower? Mr. Bennett : If you run it too fast when it commences to break you would not get a good granule. Mr. Schlosser: Do you always work your butter twice? Mr. Bennett: Yes sir, always twice. Question: Do you have more than one churning a day? Answer: Only on Tuesdays. Mr. Emery : I would like to ask if it is absolutely necessary to use some cleansing powder to keep the churn clean? Mr. Bennett: I think it advisable; I never tried doing without. Mr. Palmer: How many times do you wash your butter? Mr. Bennett: Once. Mr. Sondergard: I would like to know the temperature of the water with which you wash butter at this time of the year? Mr. Bennett: I am churning at 52 degrees and washing at 50 degrees. </seg>
            <seg id="p156">156 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. THE OPERATION AND CARE OF SEPARATORS. [From the Eighth Annual Report of the National Creamery Butter-makers Association.] In dealing with this subject, we can not go into many of the interesting mechanical details. As there are several different types of separators, which are quite dissimilar in construction, we cannot enter into the discussion of a set of details that would necessarily refer to the management of one special make. In the time allotted we will try to deal with a few of the general conditions that are more or less associated with them all. We have had experience with various separators, and never saw two of the same make run exactly the same. While in the main some general rules will apply to all machines, it is also true to a certain extent that each separator "is a law unto itself." To write a complete set of conditions that apply to separators, we would have to write an individual history of each machine's every day work. With these facts in mind we will briefly deal with the following five points that affect the efficiency of separation with a centri - fuge: Condition of milk, temperature of the milk, speed of the bowl, rate of skimming, and the proportion of milk taken for cream. Condition of milk. — Milk always separates the easiest when fresh from the cows. As soon as exposed to the air, innumer - able changes begin to take place, which are largely influenced by local treatment. The longer the milk is allowed to stand, the harder it will be to separate it, other conditions being equal. The changing of the chemical composition, the formation of lactic acid, and traces of fibrin, all tend to hinder separation. The viscosity of the milk serum is, perhaps, the greatest fac - tor that we have to overcome in the perfect creaming of milk. This factor is at a minimum stage soon after the cow is fresh in milk, and increases as the milking period is prolonged. In con - nection with this is another factor that works along with the F. B. FULMER, ETTRICK, WIS. </seg>
            <seg id="p157">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 157 other conditions, that tends to render the milk harder to com - pletely separate, and this is the size of the fat globules. They are largest at the first stage of the milking period, and gradually decrease in size and increase in number as the time advances. This last condition, in conjunction with the increased viscosity, makes it doubly hard to obtain a complete separation. Accepting the statement that the average diameter of the largest fat globules is six and one-fourth times the average diameter of the smallest, we find that a given amount of butter fat will have very much more surface exposed to the viscosity of the milk serum, in the case of the small globules, than if it were in one globule of the largest size. The actual diameten of the average fat globule in milk is not ar from 1-5000 of an inch, while a sphere of butter fat weigh - ng one pound would have a diameter of about 3.87 inches. With this set of conditions Prof. F. H. King states that there would be 19,350 times more surface exposed with the small glo - bules, than if they were all collected into the one-pound sphere. Then as the friction or resistance increases with the surface, and more force being required for rapid creaming than slow, we see hat a very strong force is necessary to effect thorough separa - ion. The per cent of fat in the milk has also an influence. Usually he separator should be adjusted slightly different for a rich milk than for a poor one. Ordinarily a rich milk will separate as closely as a poor one, as there are a greater number of large at globules in a rich milk and only about the same number of small ones as in a poor milk. Temperature. — The temperature of the milk is another im - portant factor. Within reasonable limits the higher the tem - perature the cleaner the skimming will be, or the more milk can be separated in a given time. The normal blood temperature is, perhaps, the best, and milk that has been allowed to cool much below 75 should be reheated to a higher temperature, de - pending on circumstances. The higher the temperature, the less will be the viscosity or resistance of the milk serum, but it </seg>
            <seg id="p158">158 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. is not best to go much above ioo, unless when pasteurization is practiced. It may be necessary to separate at a lower tempera - ture under certain conditions, but then it is usually advisable to decrease the milk supply to the separator. The more gradual the milk is brought to the separating temperature the better will be the results. The method of heating should never be by direct injection of steam; the milk particles will not be heated evenly, and as a result the separa - tion will not be satisfactory, as practice has shown a larger loss in the skim-milk by this method. Speed. — A separator should always be brought up to speed very gradually. The time necessary to do this will be from six to ten minutes. We have seen the flow of milk started in a separator in less than two minutes after the belt had been started on the intermediate. The practice of such quick starting should be discouraged, as aside from the undue strain given to the separator spindle and bearings, it is an unnecessary strain on the belts leading to the machine. With a slower starting of the moving parts in the bearings, the oil is given a better chance to lubricate the wearing surface, a smaller amount will be re - quired to do the work, and the usefulness of the belts greatly prolonged. After the proper speed has been obtained it should remain constant at this point, as any material fluctuation will in - fluence the skimming and the consistency of the cream. The speed of a separator bowl should never be much greater than that recommended by the manufacturers. While there is a large factor of safety allowed above the speed stamped on the machine, we are verging near the danger point when we go much above it. The amount of friction is increased as the square of the speed. For instance, if we double the speed of a shaft, we increase the friction on the oils four times. The strain on the separator bowls can be well understood from the following supposed case: We will take a separator with a bowl 12 inches in diameter, with a required speed of 6,000 revolutions per minute, which will give us a centrifugal force of 6130. If we increase the speed of the same bowl to </seg>
            <seg id="p159">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 159 7000 revolutions per minute, we will have a centrifugal force of S343. In other words, while we have increased the speed one - sixth we have increased the centrifugal force one-third. Looking at this question from the efficiency of the separation with the same bowl, we find that if, by reason of small pulleys or slack belts, we lose speed from 6,000 to 5,000 revolutions per minute, we lose the centrifugal force from 6,130 to 1,257, or by decreasing the speed one-sixth we decrease the creaming force one-third. From this we see the necessity of running separators at their proper speed. Under this head it might be well to briefly note the smooth and irregular running of separators. With a solid foundation, proper adjustment of all bearings, and a perfect level, all separators ought to run at or nearly to perfection. The causes why they do not are many and obscure. It is a frequent occurrence for a separator to take a "day off" and then run all right for perhaps a week or two, but the persistent trembling, jarring or wabbling indicates that something is radically wrong. It will be admitted by all that a watch is a delicate machine and must have the best of care to do the best of work. It would be just as rational to expect a watch to run accurately after being thrown around on the floor, as to expect a separator to run smoothly all the time, after the promiscuous droppings of bowls and spindles that frequently occur. While a separator with all its parts is very much larger than a watch, we must remember that a very slight jam or dent is apt to spring some part, or to get it a little out of balance, and when the separator is run up to speed, the high velocity will intensify any small defect, and cause a trembling or shaking of the bowl. The high speed demands perfect mechan - ical construction. Nicety of construction and perfect adjustment -are the prerequisites of satisfactory results. All bearings of the separator should be taken out and cleaned and all parts thoroughly inspected every two weeks to a month, depending largely on local conditions. If the separator is not run over two hours each day, and nothing has any access to the bearings, except a good grade of oil, it will not be necessary to </seg>
            <seg id="p160">160 M&amp;oKASKA DAIR 1 MEN S ASSOCIATIONS take apart very often. When taken apart special care should be exercised that the different parts are replaced in their proper po - sitions. If this precaution is not fully observed, trouble is very apt to follow. We have in mind a case that occurred a few years ago, of a separator being taken apart and cleaned, all the parts inspected and put back in position, and the bowl put in place, to all appearance in a normal condition. On starting up the next morning to skim the milk that was being delivered, it all went wrong. The bowl jarred very much and the lower bearings heated quite badly. After laying the trouble to grit in the oil, etc., the machine was taken apart and the cause found. The lower bearing was a ball and point one, and in some unac - countable way the ball had got up out of its proper place and rested on the top of the lower box. The point in the spindle passed the ball, and allowed the edge of the lower spindle to rest on the ball. Thus the point of support was to one side of the center, and the ball rolling around with the edge of the spindle, caused the jarring of the bowl. This particular thing might not occur again in 1,000 other cases, but there are 999 things that are apt to happen with each of the other separators We have had trouble in the operation of separators, but invaria - bly found that over 95 per cent of it was due to conditions that we ought to have foreseen, or could reason out after the trouble was manifested. There are difficulties that can not be rectified inside of a creamery. While some degree of success may be obtained by operators of a mechanical turn of mind, it is the better practice to send a bowl for balancing, and like work requiring skill, to a repair shop. We have seen professional experts work from one to two days in balancing a separator bowl, so it is not advisable to attempt very much with an imperfect outfit and limited experience. It is also our belief that very often more oil is used than is necessary. By way of experiment we found that with a little more attention the use of oil could be reduced to one-fifth and even one-tenth of the amount that was ordinarily used. This. </seg>
            <seg id="p161">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 161 shows that a little time spent means the economy of oil, as well as a much neater aspect around the separator. If a separator does not do satisfactory work, the speed should be slightly increased or the flow of milk should be varied; in short a system of moderate experiments will determine the indi - vidual conditions for each machine. With normal conditions the skim-milk test should never exceed o.i per cent fat, and only about one-half of this amount is usually obtained in the best of practice. However, the churnability of the cream should be closely watched, as a separator may do close skimming and still deliver dream that will not churn exhaustively. This may be caused by the cream delivery outlet being jammed or bent so as to "cut" or churn the cream as it escapes, or by too great a speed of the separator bowl. Rate of Skimming. — About two-thirds of the separation is considered to be instantaneous. Of the remaining one-third about one-half is quite readily obtained in all machines. The remainder, or one-sixth of the total fat in the milk, is the hardest to recover. This portion is composed of the smallest fat globules, which are retarded by the action of the milk serum. It is for this one-sixth (more or less) that the high speed and great cen - trifugal force are necessary. The more milk that is allowed to flow into a separator bowl in a given time, the shorter must be the period that it can re - main within the bowl, subject to the action of the centrifugal force. The longer that a given quantity of milk is subject to the centrifugal force, the more effective the separation is apt to be. The time that the milk is apt to remain in the separator bowl is determined by the rate of the inflow and the size of the bowl itself. However, the milk supply should be sufficient to keep the cream smooth, even, and free from all lumps. The flow could be slow enough to cause the cream to churn in the bowl. Proportion of Cream. — The proportion of the inflow of milk that is taken for cream is also an important point for considera - tion. As a given amount of milk enters the separator bowl, say </seg>
            <seg id="p162">162 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. in a minute,, it necessarily follows that the same amount must find its way out again in the same space of time. The more that is allowed to escape as cream, the less will be the demand on the skim-milk outlet, and as a result, the lower will be the test of the skim-milk. Some few years ago it was recommended to take about one-fifth of the whole milk as cream. The prac - tice at the present time is to take about one-eighth, but this de - pends somewhat on the richness of the milk. As a rule it is well to have the cream of such a consistency that it will test about 30 per cent fat, and at this point the separators ought all to do good work. The manufacturers are the best posted on the merits of their respective machines, and their advice should be often sought when any serious difficulty occurs. The instruction book sent with each separator is a most valuable hand book for the operator and should be carefully studied. The proper adjust - ment and care of the different parts are fully explained and any point not dealt with, the application of a little deliberate judg - ment will usually remedy all trouble. DISCUSSION Mr. Sondergard: I would like to ask Mr. Fulmer what he does when he gets in a two-days milk. Dots he take a thin or heavy cream? Mr. Fulmkr: That should be decided largely by local con - ditions. If it is In shape to skim quite readily, as some milk will be, it would be well to take a thicker cream; after that a thinner cream. Question: We often hear about getting the flow of milk down too much in separators, so that we leave too much fat in the skim-milk. Mr. Fulmer: That undoubtedly is true with many machines that are so constructed that a givep capacity is required. If you take a machine of a given capacity, sometimes when it is not more than half full the cream is apt to be churned. Question: Would the Alpha do it? </seg>
            <seg id="p163">163 FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. Mr. Fulmer: I am not sufficiently posted as to the Alpha, or any Other make of separator, to reply at this time from this platform. Mr. Hurst: Will the efficiency of separation vary in the same bowl at the same speed at the same capacity, skimming say a 40 per cent cream or a 30 per cent or a 20 per cent? Mr. Fulmer: It perhaps would slightly. A machine may do good work at one point and not at another. You can get cream too thick, so that the cream globules are not given a chance to reach the center. The thinner the cream is, as a gen - eral thing, the better the separation will be. I have separated cream all the way from 17 to 68 per cent fat. You would do best at about 30 per cent. Mr. Hurst: Is there a difference in the quantity of fat that will flow through in these different per cents of fat? Mr. Fulmer: That is controlled by the per cent of inflow. If you let a certain amount get in there it certainly must get out, either as milk or cream. </seg>

This is an application for mandamus to compel the defendant as auditor, to draw a warrant on the State Treasurer against the appropriation made by Sec. 12, Act of April 3d, 1899, entitled "An act creating a food commission; defining its powers and duties, and of the officers and agents thereof; regulating the manufacture and sale of foods, including "imitation butter" and "imitation cheese" and dairy products; providing for a system of reports, inspection and permits, and fixing fees for the same; providing penalties for violations of this act; making an annual appropriation for carrying this act into effect; and repeal - ing all acts or parts of acts in conflict herewith." laws 1899, p. 173. An agreed statement of facts is submitted. The relator was duly appointed Deputy Food Commissioner on July 1st, 1899, duly qualified, and has ever since been acting as such officer under the provisions of said act. </seg>
            <seg id="p165">165 FIFTEENTH ANNUAL. CONVENTION. The defendant, while admitting that relator has rendered the services claimed, refuses to audit his claim or draw his warrant for the deputy's salary, alleging that the act in question is un - constitutional. The sole objection interposed by respondent to the legislation involved in this proceeding is that it appropriates money for the salary of an officer of the government, to-wit:the Deputy Food Commissioner, within the prohibitive features of Section 19, Ar - ticle 3, of the Constitution of 1875, viz: "Bills making appro - priations for the pay of members and officers of the legisla - ture and for salaries for officers of the government shall contain no provision on any other subject." ARGUMENT. Government in the broadest sense of the term, is frequently employed as synonymous with state or body politic, likewise as applicable to the administration, or persons charged with the execution of the law. It is, however, in its technical or consti - tutional meaning "That form of fundamental rules and principles by which a nation or state is gc jrned." (Rap. Law. Die); and in the latter restricted or concrete sense of the term it is evi - dently employed in this connection. Although the precise question here involved does not appear to have been determined, like constitutional restrictions have been by this court unifoVmly held applicable alone to officers named in the Constitution itself, and never to such mere subordinates, or agents, of the executive officers of the government, as the Deputy Food Commissioner, or Deputy Commissioner of Labor, etc. Such, indeed, was the contemporaneous interpretation by every department of the State governmont, an interpretation which, by a subsequent uniform and consistent course of the several departments, has become the fixed and settled policy of the State. Fdr instance, in State ex rel Tzschuck vs. Weston, 4 Neb., 234, it was held (1) That the relator who, under the former constitution held the office of Secretary of State by election, and </seg>
            <seg id="p166">166 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. the office of Adjutant General by appointment by the Governor, was not by Section 26, Article 5, of the present Constitution, rendered ineligible to the last named office, which was declared not to be an executive state office within the constitutional pro - hibition last mentioned; (2) That as Adjutant General the relator was entitled to receive the salary of $1,000 per annum pertain - ing to that office, notwithstanding the provision of Section 24, Article 5, of the Constitution, that the executive offices therein named "shall not receive to their own use any fees, costs, inter - est upon public moneys in their hands or under their control, per - quisite of office or other compensation.'''' The ground of that decision is shown by the following quota - tion from the opinion of the court by Lake J: "As before stated, this (the constitutional salary) would undoubtedly apply to all acts or duties required of the relator as Secretary of State, and as to such acts and duties he is confined to his salary of $2,000 per annum for his compensation. But the duties imposed upon him as Adjutant General are in no sense of a civil char - acter, but purely military, • • • duties in no sense pertain - ing to or relating to the office of Secretary of State, and not imposed upon him as such officer." In re Appropriation, 25 Neb., 662, the prohibition of Section 26, Article 5, of the present Constitution, against the creation of additional executive State officers, was held not applicable to deputy for Secretary of State, Auditor of "Public Accounts, Treasurer and Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings. It was further held that the language of Section 24, Article 5, of the Constitution, viz: "There shall be no allowance for clerk hire in the office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction and Attorney General" refers to clerks within the common law meaning of the term, or, in other words, persons charged with the duty of registering the transactions of their respective board or tribunals, and not to prohibit the appropriation for the salary of a stenographer in the office of the Attorney General. In Douglas Co. vs. Timme, 32 Neb., 272, the prohibition of Section 16, Article 3, of the Constitution, against the increasing </seg>
            <seg id="p167">FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. 167 % or diminishing of the compensation of a public officer during the the term of his office, was held (following State vs. Kalb, 50 Wis., 176), applicable only to offices created by the Constitution. And in State ex rel Smith vs. Hastings, 35 Ne"b., 14, the pro - visions of Section 12, Article 5, of the Constitution, conferring upon the Governor the power to remove for malfeasance, incom - petency, etc., any officer appointed by him, was held applicable to officers mentioned in the Constitution only, and not to include fire and police commissioners for the City of Omaha. II. Among the many legislative and executive acts evidencing in - terpretation of the constitutional restrictions here involved, in accordance with the foregoing contention, may be cited: 1. "An act regulating the State Library" — fixing the salary of the State Librarian and authorizing the State Auditor to quarterly draw his warrant for such salary as it became due, and annually appropriating $200 for the use of the library. Laws 1871, p. 52. 2. The creation of the office of bookkeeper in the offices of the Secretary of State and Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings, by provision of the act making appropriations for salaries of officers of the government (Laws 1877, p. 237), and the creation and appropriation from time to time for salaries of insurance deputy, bond clerk and stenographer for the Auditor of Public Accounts. 3. Act creating the office of Superintendent of the Reform School, and making appropriations for the salary thereof. Laws 1879, p. 413. 4. Act creating the office of Superintendent of Census, and making appropriation for salary thereof. Laws 1885, p. 97. 5. Act creating the office of State Veterinary Surgeon, mak - ing appropriation for salary thereof. Laws 1885, p. 73. 6! An act creating State Board of Pharmacy, and making provisions for the payment of salaries of its secretaries. Laws. 1887, p. 507. </seg>
            <seg id="p168">168 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION. 7. Act to provide for stenographers for the judges of the Supreme Court, and making appropriations for the salary thereaf. Laws 1887, p. 381. 8. Act creating the office of Commandant of the Soldiers and Sailors' Home, and making appropriation for salary thereof. Laws 1887, p. 622. 9. Act creating office of Commissioner and Deputy Commis - sioner of Labor, and making appropriation for salary thereof. Laws 1887, p. 470. 10. Act creating a State Board of Health, providing for compensation of secretaries and fees to be paid by applicants for certificates. Laws 1891, p. 280-6. Laws 1897, p. 278. 11. Act creating office of Commissioner General for Nebraska at the Columbian Exposition, and making appropria - tion for salary thereof. Laws 1891, p. 395. 12. Act creating a State Board of Dentistry, and providing for means to carry out its provisions and to pay its secretaries. Laws 1895, p. 197. 13. Act creating Board of Directors of Trans-Mississippi Exposition, and making appropriations for salary thereof. Laws 1897, p. 367. The money appropriated by the foregoing, and acts of like character, have been, in every instance, paid out upon warrants drawn by respondent and his predecessors in office without re - corded objection. And, as further illustrating our proposition, may be mentioned the fact that counsel for respondent for several years has filled, with credit to himself and the State, the office of insurance deputy for the Auditor of Public Accounts, an office created and existing solely by virtue of a provision contained in the several acts appropropriating money for salaries of State officers. III. The contemporaneous construction of a constitutional provis - ion, which has for many years been adhered to by the legislative and executive departments of the government, will not be lightly </seg>
            <seg id="p169">169 FIFTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION. disregarded by the court, and will, even in doubtful cases, gen - erally be held conclusive. State ex rel. vs. Holcomb, 46 Neb., 88. State ex rel. vs Harrison, 116 Ind., 300; (19 N. E., 146] and cases cited. IV. Another and quite as simple a solution of the question is ound in the fact that the Deputy Food Commissioner, the creature of his principal, and depending upon the pleasure of he latter for his tenure, is not within the inhibition relied upon, or the reasoa that he is a mere employe, and in no constitutional ense of the term an officer. Somers vs. State (S. Dak.), 58 N. W., 808. Somers vs. State (S. Dak.), 59 N. W., 962. Gibbs vs. Morgan, 39 N. J., 128. State vs. Johnson (Mo.), 27 S. W., 399. It is clear the objection made by the defendant is without merit, and a peremptory writ should issue as prayed. Respectfully submitted, A. M. POST and E. J. HAINER, Attorneys for Relator. 18 </seg>
