            <seg id="p002"/>
            <seg id="p003">GOVERNOR S. R. McKELVIE 3 INAUGURAL ADDRESS of GOVERNOR S. R. McKELVIE Gentlemen of the Legislature: It is with a feeling of sincere gratitude and deep responsi - bility to the people of Nebraska that I come before you as the Chief Executive of this commonwealth. We are met here as the chosen representatives of the people at a time when the problems of government are more momentous in their importance than they have been before in a half cen - tury. The world has passed through the cataclysm of the great - est war of all history and in this contest for principles our na - tion — America — played the deciding role. The conflict was waged about principles of government in which democracy was arrayed against the champions of hered - itary right. Democracy won, but in the winning the lives of millions of brave and gallant men were sacrificed upon the altar of justice. It now devolves upon us to prove by our acts that the lives of those men — our own beloved sons — were not spent in vain. I think I reflect the sentiments of the people of this state when I say that for the tremendous price which was paid for the winning of this war there can be but one adequate compensation — an everlasting peace. We should not rest content until every reasonable guaranty has been made that the end of this war will mean the end of war for all time to come. In this war Nebraska had a part. How important that part was has been well indicated to you by my worthy predecessor, Governor Neville, and it is with a feeling of just pride that the hearts of the people of this commonwealth are set atune to these matchless achievements. Now that the conflict at arms has ceased and the signing of the treaty of peace seems near, it be- </seg>
            <seg id="p004">INAUGURAL ADDRESS 4 comes our duty as patriotic American citizens to address our - selves to the problems of the readjustment period with the same unselfish zeal that marked our efforts during the fighting days. Needed Legislation. As legislators and executives, we today find ourselves con - fronted with problems that are different from those that were presented for solution in normal times. The activities incident to the war have aroused within the people a consciousness of justice and duty that will no longer tolerate the excesses, the wastes and the inequalities that have crept into the body politic. We have arrived at the dawn of a new day when the stars of gold that mark our service nags stand forth as beacons to a living world, beckoning us on and urging us to go forth and fol - low the example of those who were willing to make the supreme sacrifice in order that the principles of justice might prevail. Surrounded by the sympathies which I believe permeate the hearts of all loyal, patriotic men, we should find it easy to see the way and time our acts to meet the impulses of an expectant world. And these metaphors which define our consciousness of duty should find definite expression in the formulation of prac - tical plans through which the hopes of the people will find realization. Nor would I have you think that I deem it necessary to do the radical, or unusual, thing in order that you may measure up to the opportunity that is presented now. The pendulum of events usually swings from one extreme to another and now that we have conquered autocracy we shall be fortunate if we do not find ourselves grasping at the extreme outward swing of the pendulum, which means bolshevism. Our republican form of government has repeatedly proven its ability to cope with the military prowess of any foe, and it devolves upon us to prove that it can adjust itself and function successfully under the </seg>
            <seg id="p005">GOVERNOR S. R. McKELVIE 5 most unusual conditions that have ever confronted the world in times of peace. It is a problem in political economy in which there is but one answer : SERVICE. The Party Platform The membership of a legislature reflects the attitude of the voters upon timely political questions and issues. You were elected as the sponsors of well defined programs which were set forth in the platforms of the parties with which you were af - filiated. The platform of the Republican party was approved M is indicated by the overwhelming majority of Republican mem - bers of your honorable body. Thus is your duty clearly defined. In the recommendations that shall follow I have contem - plated the redemption of every promise that was made to the people in the Republican platform. A Civil Administrative Code I call to your attention the fact that there is great need for a change in the plan by which the civil affairs of the state gov - ernment shall be administered. Circumscribed by the restric - tions of an antiquated fundamental law, we have sought to meet the constantly increasing needs of administration through the creation of boards, commissions and additional offices. This has resulted in a system of government that reeks with divided responsibility, loose ends and over-lapping functions. This condition may be overcome through the application of a cabinet form of civil government, which centralizes responsi - bility and eliminates the Urge number of useless boards, com - missions and unnecessary offices. It is fashioned after our Na - tional administration, in which the various duties of law en - forcement and control are grouped under common heads </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 INAUGURAL ADDRESS known as "Departments". These departments are presided over by heads who are known as "Secretaries", to be appointed by the Chief Executive, and confirmed by the Senate. In order that this plan of administrative government may be evolved in this state, a bill will be introduced to be known as the "Civil Administrative Code". This bill will contain pro - vision for the following departments: Finance, Agriculture, Labor, Trade and Commerce, Public Works, and Public Wel - fare. Under these heads will be grouped the several branches of administrative government not now confined to the constitu - tional executive offices. This plan of government definitely locates responsibility and greatly simplifies and facilitates the handling of public business. That it is practical is shown in its universal applica - tion to private business; and it is further confirmed by the experiences of our National administration in the conduct of the war. So long as we labored along with war boards, our progress in getting into the war was slow and unsatisfactory, but as soon as the President was given authority to appoint respon - sible heads of the various departments of war activity, a sur - prising and gratifying improvement was noted. There may be some apparent reasons why this plan should not be adopted, for instance: (1) that the subject may well be deferred until the meeting of the constitutional convention; (2) that it is too revolutionary to be instituted during the read - justment period; (3) that it will create too many appointive offices; (4) that it promises to lay the foundation for building political machines; and, (5) that it will be more expensive to maintain. Such reasons are only apparent: (1) If the plan is practical, why wait for the constitutional convention to initiate it f That would mean a delay of at least two years. But decisive of this question is the fact that the </seg>
            <seg id="p007">GOVERNOR S. R. McKELVIE 7 proposed plan is particularly and peculiarly constructive legis - lation ; is confined to the proper functions of the Legislature ; aud would in no wise encroach upon the functions of a constitutional convention. If the exercise of legislative functions is to await the action of the forthcoming constitutional convention, there is little for this Legislature to do but adjourn. (2) The adoption of this plan simply means the application of business methods to the administration of public affairs. Surely that is not revolutionary. It promises efficiency and there never was a time when efficiency, the elimination of waste of time and money, was more needed than now. (3) An effective check upon the principal appointments is provided through the confirmation of the Senate. Furthermore, with the increased responsibility of the more important positions, men of greater ability can be secured, and changes will be less frequent because the public will be so interested that greater pressure will be brought to bear for the retention of faithful employees. Furthermore, the code bill shall contain a provision prohibit - ing nepotism, and each employee working under it will be re - quired to serve a full eight-hour day, with the further provision that all offices shall be open for the transaction of business throughout the full working day. (4) There is nothing in experience, or in fact, to indi - cate that this plan will enable the building of &amp; political ma - chine. In truth, the one who thinks it is possible to build an enduring machine in this state misjudges the temper of the people. Service, unadulterated and free from improper in - fluences, is the only thing that will guarantee the political life of men or parties. And I venture that among those who express the gravest fears regarding the machine-building possibilities of this plan will be found many who are enjoying those privileges under the present plan. </seg>
            <seg id="p008">INAUGURAL ADDRESS 8 (5) One of the well-proven theories of business practice is that "Efficiency is economy". In other words, economy is ef - fected if the results are in proportion to the amount of the expenditure. Though it costs, under the present system, over $140,000.00 per year to maintain our boards and commissions, I am not prepared to say that it will not cost as much to maintain the proposed plan of administration ; but I am prepared to say that the results will be far greater in proportion to the cost than has been produced under the old plan. I do not believe the people object to spending their money when they feel they are getting full value in the servic rendered. This, I consider, is the most important piece of constructive legislation that will come before your honorable body during this session and I commend it to you for your serious and favorable action. Executive Budget The adoption of an executive budget for the administration of the state revenue is an important need of the times. This will enable the estimating of the state's expenses upon a syste - matic and scientific basis. It should consist of an appropria - tion bill tentatively prepared by the Governor and submitted at the opening of the Legislature. This plan is in operation in many states of the Union and is approved as a necessary feature in the economy of state government. Constitutional Convention The constitution of Nebraska provides (Article XV, Sec - tion 2) : "When three-fifths of the members elected to each branch of the Legislature shall deem it necessary to call a conventoin to revise, amend or change this constitution, they shall recommend to the electors to vote at the next election of members of the Legislature for or against a convention, </seg>
            <seg id="p009">GOVERNOR S. R. McKELVIE 9 and if a majority voting at said election vote for a conven - tion, the Legislature shall at its next session provide by law for calling the same. The convention shall consist of as many members as the House of Representatives, who shall be chosen in the same manner, and shall meet within three months after their election for the purpose aforesaid." The action thus prescribed was taken in the last regular session of the Legislature and the calling of the convention was approved by the electors at the last election. It therefore de - volves upon this Legislature to provide for the calling of such a convention. I recommend that this convention be called at the earliest convenient date so that its recommendations may be submitted to the people for their action at the next general election. National Prohibition The Congress has submitted to the several states for their action an amendment to the National Constitution providing for National prohibition. I recommend that this be approved by your honorable body. Equal Suffrage The subject of equal suffrage is receiving attention, both in our state and in the Xational Congress. I recommend that all possible means be used to hasten the approval of favorable leg - islation upon this important subject, and I further recommend that such members of the Congress from Nebraska as have not yet voted affirmatively upon the question be memoralized by your honorable body to do so at the earliest possible date. The Foreign Language Question Experiences during the war indicated to us some of the mistakes of the past with reference to the foreign language </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 INAUGURAL ADDRESS question. Most important of these was our failure to make the schools the medium through which to build a genuine Americanism. We realize now how difficult it is to crystallize a genuinely National sentiment and foster a National spirit when there are those among us who do not have a proper under - standing or appreciation of the principles which underlie our form of government, and are not able to join in the study or application of these principles through the use of a common language. It is desirable that we should undertake now a plan of educational instruction which will have in view the ultimate universal use of the English language in our state and nation. This is not a thing that can be accomplished at once, and to attempt such a process of action would only be to work undue hardship upon many, and face the possible defeat of the de - sired end. I believe that all instruction in public and private schools, with the exception of foreign languages as such, should be conducted in the English language. Religious freedom should not be abridged, but the churches should also be used as a medium through which the use of the English language may be aided and encouraged. The common use of any foreign language should be discouraged. The great majority of the people are sensitively opposed to the common use of any other than the English language in this country, but in bringing this about I commend to you the tolerant methods which were advocated in the report of the Americanization Committee of the State Council of Defense in the following paragraph: "After all, our aim is to Americanize our people — that is, to imbue them with a love and reverence for our coun - try, its institutions and ideals. All history teaches that those sentiments cannot be inspired by harsh and op - pressive methods, by an unsympathetic, suspicious or hos- </seg>
            <seg id="p011">GOVERNOR S. R. McKELVIE 11 tile attitude, but by dealing justly and with intelligent regard for human sensibilities. The latter has been our policy in the past, and the thousands of sons of foreign - born parents who fought and died under our flag in a foreign land for human liberty are a vindication of that policy." Education Vocational education has a practical turn. It meets the needs of the large majority of pupils who must go out into the world before they reach the University. Federal appropriations under the Smith-Hughes Act, offset by adequate state appropria - tions and local support, should make possible thorough courses in agriculture and other vocational subjects as rapidly as schools of the state are ready to meet prescribed requirements. Also, greater emphasis should be placed upon physical training as a part of the course in all schools. Some provision should be made for the education of illit - erates. Significant of the need for this last recommendation is the fact that according to the last Federal census, Nebraska has 18,009 illiterates. In 1900, Nebraska stood first in the scale of literacy, but she now stands second, and in native-born white literates, she stands fourteenth. It seems important to me that all elementary schools, both public and private, as well as the teachers therein, should be subject to the same requirements as to regulation and inspec - tion by the State Department of Public Instruction. This should include prescription regarding the essential subjects to be embodied in the curriculum of elementary schools. An Agricultural Program The following recommendations with reference to an agri - cultural program was formulated after I received suggestions </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 INAUGURAL ADDRESS trom and held a conference with the representatives of all of the fanners' organizations of state-wide importance in the state: Within the civil administrative code, a Department of Agriculture should be created. This department shall have ■upervision of the duties of the Live Stock Sanitary Board; the Conservation and Welfare Commission; the Game and Fish Commission ; the gathering, compiling and publication of agri - cultural statistics and reports ; and at least one new section to be devoted to farm markets and marketing. The creation of a department so organized will leave all educational, experimental and research work to the departments of education, particularly the State University ; agricultural fairs and expositions and meetings incident thereto will be left to the state and county agricultural societies and farm bureaus; and the subjects of law enforcement and control that pertain to agriculture will be collected and the work co-ordinated within the State Department of Agriculture. (a) Distribution of Farm Products A more economical and efficient system for the distribution of agricultural products is highly important. The solution of this problem seems to be offered in a more complete co-opera - tion among producers. Great strides have already been made in this direction and the movement should be encouraged by the removal of all barriers so that it may be carried to the terminal markets and to the live stock and grain exchanges where co-operative effort may have an even advantage with all other forms of distribution. The organization of co-operative societies should be aided «nd encouraged through the division of farm markets and marketing in the State Department of Agriculture, and the principle of one vote for each stockholder, as well as the dis - tribution of benefits upon a basis of patronage, should be encouraged. </seg>
            <seg id="p013">GOVERNOR S. R. McKELVIE 13 (b) Inspection Within the subject of distribution, the matter of inspection deserves attention. This applies especially to the grading of grain and vegetables and the testing of butter fat. A more careful testing and inspection of the larger scales of all kinds should be effected. Provision should be made for inspecting heavy oils as well as light, or combustion, oils. (c) Law Enforcement and Control A measure should be enacted that will assist agencies of distribution in collecting claims of loss and damage against the railroads. Encouragement, and additional funds if nec - essary, should be given to a more effective enforcement of the anti-discrimination law. (d) Diseases of Farm Animals The enormousness of the loss of farm animals from con - tagious and communicable diseases and plagues is such that this subject needs prompt and vigorous attention. The most in - sidious and dangerous of all these diseases is tuberculosis. The Federal Government has appropriated a liberal sum for in - spection, testing and indemnification in the control of tuber - culosis and the states are called upon to co-operate with both inspection and money. I believe this should be done. The control of hog cholera has been effected through the use of serum and virus. On account of the arbitrary action of concerns engaged in the making of these products, it was deemed necessary to reopen the state plant for the manufac - ture of anti-hog-cholera serum and virus. This is now being conducted under the supervision of the Board of Regents of the State University. University officials have repeatedly said that they do not deem the manufacturing business a legitimate function of' the University. </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 INAUGURAL ADDRESS First, I recommend that every effort be made to insure to the farmers unrestricted privileges of purchase and use of anti - hog-cholera serum and virus from all companies by a more ef - fective enforcement of the laws that deal with combinations in restraint of trade, or by the enactment of laws which will be effective if the present ones are inadequate. Second, if proper service to our live stock interests cannot be secured except by the operation of a state-owned plant, I recommend that this plant be administered within the proposed State Department of Agriculture, and that sufficient funds be appropriated to build and operate an up-to-date plant so located that it can furnish serums and vaccines at reasonable prices. A host of remedies that are reputed by the manufacturers to be cures for the various ills of live stock have been placed upon the market and are being sold throughout the state with very limited restriction. Additional legislation and better en - forcement of the law are needed to cope with this situation. Nebraska is growing very rapidly as a sheep and wool producing state. This industry is being menaced by dogs and wolves. Legislation should be enacted that will enable the more effective handling of this subject. This suggests the wisdom of a dog license law similar to those in force in other states and it may be wise to re-enact the law providing a bounty on wolves. (e) County Farm Bureaus The system of farm bureaus and county agents which was authorized by the state in co-operation with the Federal Gov - ernment has grown steadily. There are now fifty such organiza - tions and agents operating in the state. Legislation is needed that will facilitate and extend the work of the County Family Farm Bureau so that it may include extension work in agricul - ture and home economics as carried out through the employ - ment of county agricultural agents, home demonstration agents, </seg>
            <seg id="p015">GOVERNOR S. R. McKBLVIE 15 boys' and girls' club leaders, agricultural specialists and all types of extension meetings carried on in the county. (f) Co-operative Credit Societies The high price that the farmer has been obliged to pay for money has long been a barrier against agricultural development and progress. Some relief from this condition has eome through the Federal Land Bank, but this has been limited to the owners or purchasers of land. There is need for cheaper money for the non-land-owning farmer who is industrious and honest, and whose security for loans is confined to chattels. In foreign lands and in some states in our own country, laws have been enacted which provide for the organization of co-operative credit societies. These societies enable communities or small groups of farmers to join their elements of credit for the benefit of those who need it. Thus is the honest, industrious farmer of small means given the advantage of larger credit and lower priced money. I rec - ommend such legislation for Nebraska. (g) Rural Schools The decline of the rural school has become a matter of great concern to all who have observed this condition. It must be checked and the rural school must be placed upon a basis of equal service with the balance of our educational system. The consolidation of districts seems to offer the solution to this question and should be encouraged in every practical way. Some plan should be evolved for an equitable readjustment of the boundaries of rural school districts throughout the state, where - in both taxable property and number of pupils will make possi - ble the establishment of schools commensurate with the needs of rural communities. Provision should also be made for estab - lishing rural high schools, and we should provide some method of producing teachers who are rural-minded, with a sympathy and love for agriculture and rural life. </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 INAUGURAL ADDRESS Adequate aid should be provided for weak school districts, and every child under sixteen years of age should be required to attend an accredited school eight months in the year, or until he shall have passed the eighth grade. (By "accredited" I mean a school in which the qualifications of the instructors and the course of instruction shall have been approved by the State Department of Public Instruction.) (h) Landlord and Tenant Laws Fifty per cent of the farms in Nebraska are now operated by tenants. This means that unless something is done to stabilize our system of tenantry a very rapid decline may be ex - pected in the productive capacity of the land, and social condi - tions in the country will recede to a very low ebb. Some kind of legislation should be evolved that will forestall the further development of such a menacing situation. The holding of land for purely speculative purposes is re - tarding the agricultural development of our state. The owner - ghip of land should contemplate home-building and maximum production. I believe that the injury that comes from land speculation may be abated through the application of a gradu - ated tax upon the land. The tax should fall most heavily upon those who are non-resident, or hold the land for speculative purposes, and lightest upon those who till the land they own. Revenue is not being produced in proportion to the value and productivity of the state school lands. Measures should be provided that will place these lands upon a basis of revenue production equal with the lands of similar character throughout the state. Game Reserves The supply of wild game birds in the state, especially those not of a migratory nature, is rapidly being depleted. I be- (i) Land Taxation </seg>
            <seg id="p017">GOVERNOR 8. R. McKELVIE 17 lieve this condition can be overcome by declaring each school section in the state a game reserve upon which no shooting would be permitted. The reserves could be designated by signs that would warn hunters against an unintentional violation of the law. If this were done, it might then be practical to attempt the breeding of some kinds of game birds that are not now native of the state. Trade and Commerce Within a definition of trade and commerce are found the businesses which touch the material and social welfare of all of the people of the state. It is well, therefore, to assist in the application and observance of fair trade practices that will aid in the efficient and economical conduct of commercial business. Manufacturing The value of Nebraska's manufactured products for the year just closed was about $250,000,000.00. This sounds like a large amount, but it is really small, especially when it is considered that a very large portion of that amount was represented in the products of the meat packing industry alone. The economy of manufacture near the seat of production of raw materials is at once apparent, and for this reason particularly there is splendid economic basis for the development of manufacturing enterprises in Nebraska. We should keep this fact in mind and take reasonable action to encourage this industry. Public Improvements I am in receipt of a letter from the Federal Department of Labor, urging upon our state the importance of beginning at the earliest convenient date such projects for public improve - ment as seem necessary. This recommendation is made at this particular time because of the great need of employment for the surplus of labor that will be made available through the </seg>
            <seg id="p018">18 INAUGURAL ADDRESS demobilization of the nation's military forces. In this state we are confronted with the need for an early prosecution of a comprehensive plan for the construction of good roads, and there are certain public buildings which should be built soon. To begin this work now would be in keeping with the National policy for absorbing the labor surplus. A Good Roads Program Experiences of the war period have indicated more clearly than ever before the great need for a system of rural highways that will facilitate and economize marketing of farm products. The time is not so very far distant when the burden of trans - porting the products of the farm to the market points will fall upon the rural highways. The truck and other motor-propelled vehicles are here to stay. We must have a system of permanent roads which will ulti - mately reach from the dooryard of every farm to the market. It is impossible, of course, to build such a system of roads at once, but with the thought in mind that the rural highway is of primary value for marketing, the building of roads should begin at the market points and radiate therefrom along the lines that will serve the largest number of farmers. Nebraska is pledged, by the action of the last Legislature, to the principle of co-operation with the Federal Government in the raising of funds and administration of construction and maintenance of rural highways. A tax of sixty-five one - hundredths of a mill was appropriated by the last Legislature to meet Nebraska's quota of the Federal road fund and a tax of one mill will be needed to meet our next quota from that fund. It is quite probable that Congress will appropriate an additional $100,000,000.00 per year for road building to become available for distribution among the states at a very early date. Nebraska 's quota of this amount will be $2,250,000.00 per annum. </seg>
            <seg id="p019">GOVERNOR S. R. McKELVIE 19 I think the state should avail itself of this money but I do not believe it should be done through the levying of an additional property tax. I would recommend a tax upon motor-driven vehicles. This tax would be in addition to the present property tax upon such vehicles and should be based upon the weight or carrying capacity, instead of the horse power of the vehicle. A tax of $10.00 on vehicles weighing less than 2,000 lbs., with graduated increases based upon additional weight, or carrying capacity, would raise $2,000,000.00 annually. Two things are of primary importance in connection with road building. After the road has been brought to proper grade with adequate drainage provided, the construction should be of a permanent character and the road must then be properly maintained. The definition of permanent depends upon local conditions. In many sections of the state, the character of the soil is such that in itself, or with the addition of a limited amount of sand or gravel, a road that is properly maintained is permanent for all practical purposes of marketing and travel ; and there are also roads which, because of the topography of the land, the character of the soil and the volume of hauling that must be accommodated, cannot be made permanent without beinp hard surfaced. I believe that projects for hard surface roads should be initiated by the property owners within such proposed districts. Convict Labor Nebraska has large supplies of certain valuable road build - ing materials such as sand, gravel and clay for making brick. These deposits should be obtained by the state and placed at the disposal of the road building public. In this connection, I believe it is entirely practical to employ the convicts of the State Penitentiary for work in these fields. </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 INAUGURAL ADDRESS A New Capitol The building of a new capitol is a matter that cannot be much longer deferred. Not only is the present capitol a dis - credit to the state, but it is inadequate to house the state gov - ernment and is actually unsafe for occupancy. Moreover, in its present unsafe and unsanitary condition, it subjects to imminent loss from fire and weather the very valuable books and records contained in the library of the Supreme Court. The construction of a new building probably would have been authorized long ago had it not been that Legislatures are very timid about authorizing so large an expenditure of money. I believe it is time to approach this question in a courageous and businesslike manner, and provide the ways and means for beginning the construction of a new capitol at the earliest convenient moment. If this project were undertaken now, the capitol could be dedicated to the memory of the gallant soldiers and sailors who enlisted their services during this war. Reclaiming Unproductive Lands The Department of Interior of the Federal administration is urging a program of reclamation of waste and unproductive lands. The purposes of this program are two-fold: first, to afford homes for returned soldiers; and, second, to provide employment for the labor surplus resultant upon the demobiliza - tion of the military forces. There are perhaps a million acres in Nebraska which would properly fall under classification in such a program, and I believe it is wholly wise to avail ourselves of the co-operation of the Federal Government in developing such projects. Soldiers' and Sailors' Homes I am afraid that the condition of our Soldiers' and Sailors' Homes is not what it should be. If the necessary comforts in </seg>
            <seg id="p021">GOVERNOR S. R. McKELVIE 21 these homes is less than the best that can be had, then my fears are well founded. Heretofore these homes have bee.i main - tained for the veterans of our past wars. Through the lapse of years the number of such ones is rapidly growing less. I am wondering if the entire number cannot be better cared for at one institution so that the other institution may be available for use by those who served in the Spanish-American and the World Wars. Furthermore, the subject of sympathetic care and at - tention to the needs of all the state's dependents should be a matter of more than passing interest. State Parks It would be difficult to estimate the amount of money that goes out of Nebraska to tourist points in other states, and yet Nebraska has many places of natural beauty which, if they were developed and advertised, would not only keep many of our people at home during the vacation season but would at - tract thousands of people from other states. Something ought to be done, while there is yet time, to protect and develop these points of beauty and interest within our state. Labor In addition to the suggestions outlined above for the em - ployment of surplus labor and the full co-operation of the State Department of Labor in aiding to solve the problems of finding employment for returned soldiers, I recommend improvements in our present Employers' Liability and Workmen's Compensa - tion Act and the plan for administering the same. Relief for the injured workman should be speedy as well as sure. The operation of the law can be facilitated by hearing all disputed cases before an impartial tribunal devoted entirely to hearing such cases and from which appeal could be made, if possible, directly to the Supreme Court. </seg>
            <seg id="p022">22 INAUGURAL ADDRESS The law is now administered by the Department of Labor and I am informed that many contested cases are appealed to the District Court. This means delayed relief for the applicant and heaps unnecessary burdens upon the already overworked courts in Lancaster and Douglas Counties. So long as the law is administered in any department that may be looked upon as prejudiced in its decisions, this will be the inevitable result. Military Until peace shall have been determined and the military policy of the Federal Government denned, it will be difficult to formulate a state military policy that will be entirely in con - sonance with the National policy. Pending the time when these conditions shall have been brought about, I feel that the state should hold itself in readiness to meet any immediate demands that may be expected of it. Such property and equipment as belongs to the state for the use of the National Guard should be maintained and pre - served, and it may be practical to reconstruct the State Militia. If this is done, it should be with the thought in mind that it will not be used except against a military foe. I do not approve the use of the military organization to quell civil disturbances or riots. In recognition of the considerable expense at which the Home Guards were organized and equipped and the service which they rendered at a time when they were greatly needed, I believe that organization should be privileged to continue, but without any authority to act except as they may be called upon by the Governor. State Police Even in peaceful Nebraska, there is need for a police or - ganization that may be employed for service in handling riots, disturbances and violations of the law that are unusual or beyond </seg>
            <seg id="p023">GOVERNOR S. R. McKELVIE 23 local control. Some states maintain a constabulary, or state police, that is used for the purpose herein denned and I believe it is practical for Nebraska to consider such an organization. In Memory of Our Soldiers I think we all realize that there is no honor which we can confer and no monument which we can erect that will adequately sumbolize the service that was rendered in this war by the soldiers and sailors of Nebraska. But this should not check our zeal in an effort to do the thing that will be most fitting upon this occasion. I therefore recommend that a memorial in the form of a gold star, suitably engraved, be presented by the state to each family whose son made the supreme sacrifice in this war. To all who survived, I would have issued an engraved certificate of service. Furthermore, the history of Nebraska's part in the World War should be written by competent authorities and preserved in the archives of the State Historical Society. This history might be distributed among the people at the cost of publication. A Final Word In closing, I desire to congratulate the members of your hon - orable body upon the unusual opportunity that is afforded you to be of service to your state at this time. There is every reason why the acts of the Thirty-seventh Session of the Nebraska Legislature should stand out prominently in history as of most far-reaching importance to the commonwealth. It is placed in your hands to render unusual service in justifying the great sacrifices that were made in the winning of the war. I know you will prove true to the trust that is reposed in you.
