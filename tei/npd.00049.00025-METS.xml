            <seg id="p003">DAIRY BARN AND MILK HOUSE ARRANGEMENT J. H. FKAXnSES AND W. B. NEVENS The dairy cow, of all farm animals, is our most efficient machine for converting farm grown feeds into concentrated, high-priced food products. She is thin in flesh and naturally more susceptible to cold than most other classes of farm stock. If she is compelled to fortify herself against cold, snow, sleet and rain, she must, of course, convert a greater proportion of her feed into heat with which to keep up body temperature, and as a result she becomes less efficient for milk production. Therefore, from an economic point of view, as well as from the standpoint of animal comfort, it is highly desirable that adequate barn or shed facilities be provided for the dairy herd. Thru mistaken ideas of many writers some farmers have developed the idea that to keep cows healthy and comfortable and to produce sanitary milk it is absolutely necessary to have expensive barns. As a matter of fact, many of the dairy barns where sanitation is the primary object are quite inexpensive. On the other hand, if the barn is conveniently arranged and made to embody the most accepted sanitary features it is very essential that attention be given to plans and specifications of the barn that is to house the dairy herd to best advantage. Every detail of the new barn should be carefully worked out before actual construction begins. The barn should be planned so that additions can be made to it with a minimum of expense, and without marring the symmetry and beauty of the structure as a whole. Not only should present needs be met, but growth and expansion of the herd in the future must be taken into consideration before the dairyman can intelligently determine the size and type of barn best suited to his business. The present scarcity and high price of labor make it all the more important that mistakes in arrangement, which necessi - tate countless unnecessary steps and which require work to be done at a disadvantage day by day, year in and year out, be avoided as far as possible in the planning and equipping of the dairy barn. Mistakes are often made m locating the silo, in placing of doors, in determining proper dimensions of gutters, stalls and of platforms. Details such as these should have very careful attention so that the finished structure may be as </seg>

Dairy work must be done twice a day and every day in the year. Therefore, neglect in providing modern equipment means FIG. 1— A MODERN' DAIRY BARN The main building houses milch cows, and the wing at the right contains stall? - for test cows and pens for calves. The large milk house at the left is located about twenty feet from the barn. much extra work and additional labor expense. Dairy cows consume large amounts of feed, such as hay, silage and grain, and unless care is taken to arrange for the saving of labor in the feeding of cows and calves, the process will require an uiv duly large amount of time. The work of milking and cleaning the barn are matters occupying much of the barn man's time and any scheme of arrangement or equipment that will lessen this phase of the work will amply justify itself from a financial point of view alone, to say nothing about the satisfaction of having done it in the most convenient manner. LOCATION AND DRAINAGE OF BARN AND YARDS The dairy barn should, whenever possible, be built on a high spot which has good slope, can easily be drained and is or can be sheltered from prevailing cold winds. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">Dairy Barn and Milk Hoi se Arhanckmknt 5 If wholesome and sanitary milk and cream are to be pro - duced the farmer should realize that the cows should be kept out of the mud as much as possible. Conditions in and around the barn can in many cases be greatly improved by draining and grading.. Draining is not of itself sufficient as the tramp - ing of the cattle soon "puddles" the surface, thus practically preventing the water from reaching the tile below. The barn yard should have good slope such as will insure good surface drainage and should have a good top layer of gravel or cinders, or better still, if the expense is not too great, a layer of con - crete. In many places this may involve a great deal of work, but even if it cannot all be done in one year, arrangements should be made by which at least part of it is done every year. SELECT SUITABLE LOCATION In choosing the site for the dairy barn, good natural drain - age is of prime importance. When the barn is located in a low spot then- is a tendency for the floor of the stable, which Se - nsually constructed of concrete, to bt&gt; damp on account of the FIG. 2— A WELL-PLANNED AND SUBSTANTIAL BARN, SILO AND MILK HOUSE In this type of barn the feed supply is very close at hand.

The floors of such barns tend to be colder in winter than those which are well drained. The natural slope should be such that there is no chance for surface water to flow into the barn. chance Since sunlight is of great value in the dairy barn, the most desirable direction for the barn to extend is north and south, FIG. 3— INTERIOR OF A WELL LIGHTED STABLE which will afford opportunity for admission of the maximum amount of light to the stable. The relation of the other farm buildings will, in a large measure, determine the location of the dairy barn. The latter should be near enough the other buildings to afford convenience in performing the farm operations, but ample space should be provided for yards for cows, young stock and bull; also for driveways for unloading feed, hauling away manure, etc. When possible, the barn should provide a windbreak for one or more, preferably the north and west, sides of the cow yard. If the dairy barn is to be added to a group of buildings already constructed, some of the latter may sometimes be utilized as windbreaks also. If the young stock is to be housed in a separate wing of the barn, which is a desirable arrangement, this wing may be attached to the east side of the cow barn, the arrangement thus affording shelter for the north and west sides of the exercising yard. </seg>
            <seg id="p007">Dairy Barn and Milk House Arraxcjemext 7 The location of the milk house and silo must be given con - sideration in planning the barn. Under most conditions it is necessary to locate the milk house near the well so that water may readily be provided for the cooling tank. Where there is sufficient slope to carry the water in underground pipes or where a pressure water system is used this necessity is obviated. Under all conditions, however, the milk house should be con - venient to the milking stable. If desirable to connect the milk house to the barn, it should be separated from the stable by a passage, four or more feet in length, having a door at each end, in order to prevent the entrance of barn odors. For a similar reason the milk house should not be near the silo. These struc - tures may well be located at opposite sides of the barn. CHOOSE THE TYPE OF BARN BEST SUITED TO YOUR SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS The particular type of barn to be chosen is determined chiefly by local conditions and personal preference. For the production of milk of especially high grade, one story stables with storage barns connected at one end are common. While this plan may entail slightly more labor in carrying feed to FIG. 4— METHOD OF INSTALLATION AND OPERATION OF VENTILATOR FLUES The circulation of air is such that the fresh air enters near the cows' heads and the foul air is removed at a point near the gutters.

A type of con - struction requiring the minimum amount of labor in moving feed is the two atory type of barn with feed storage above the stable, as illustrated in figure 2. FIG. 5— METHOD OF CONSTRUCTION OF INLET FLUE WHERE COWS FACE THE CENTER OF THE BARN The drawing illustrates flues from opposite sides of the barn opening into the stable at the same point. (Courtesy Hunt, Helm, Ferris and Company.) There is no objection from a sanitary standpoint to having feed stored above the cows provided there is a tight ceiling in the stable to prevent dust and dirt from sifting thru from above. In a region having a mild climate all roughage may be fed in an open shed in which the cows run loose, and the cows kept in a separate milking stable during milking hours only. </seg>

In such buildings there must be a dead air space in the walls of the stable to prevent condensation of moisture which is sure to occur on solid masonry walls. The appearance FIG. 11— INTERIOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA DAIRY BARN This shows how the concrete walk is indented in order to prevent cows from slipping. This device has proved quite satisfactory. of the finished building usually receives sufficient attention in the erection of a dwelling house, but is often overlooked in the case of the dairy barn. There is no reason why the outside appearance, as well as the interior arrangement, should not be considered when planning the barn, as it costs but little, if any, more to have the barn present a good architectural appearance. The day when every farmer planned his own barn is past.* The type of barn best fitted to meet particular requirements will depend to some extent upon the amount of feed which is to be stored. In some cases much of the hay is stored in a comparatively inexpensive hay barn or in stacks, and when straw is used for bedding it is drawn directly from the stack. •Plans may be obtained from the Agricultural Engineering Department, University of Nebraska, at a price just covering the cost of the blueprint paper. </seg>
            <seg id="p015">Dairy Barn and Milk House Arrangement 15 In this case but little mow space is required. Under most con - ditions ample storage space will greatly facilitate caring for the herd especially during stormy weather, and will prevent waste of feed and bedding by exposure to the weather, the following tables show the amount of storage space required for dry feed and bedding per cow and also size of silo for herds of various sizes.

Then find the capacity of the silo for the space which has been emptied and subtract this from the first. The difference is the amount of silage remaining in the silo.

As previously stated the maximum amount of light is admitted to a rectangular barn when it stands in a north and south direc - tion provided windows are evenly distributed on all sides of the barn. For most efficient lighting the windows should be placed vertically in the wall and as high as possible. On ac - count of the danger of breakage they should not extend nearer to the floor than a distance of four feet. A rough, dark surface reflects but little light. If the stable ceiling and walls are smooth and light in color the efficiency of the windows is greatly increased. Whitewash and cold water paint are com - paratively cheap coverings for inside work which may l&gt;e used to secure this effect. VENTILATION IS NECESSARY FOR HEALTH One of the features often overlooked but of great im - portance in keeping animals in good health is a proper system of ventilation. In well-built barns it is possible to keep the stable at a comfortable temperature and yet provide the animals with a constant and ample supply of fresh air without direct drafts blowing upon them. The plan of removing the foul air thru outtake flues opening near the stable floor and admitting fresh air thru flues opening at the ceiling, known as the King system, has proved genorallv satisfpctorv. Under this system fresh air is admitted thru a large number of small flues distributed as equally as possible in the walls of the stable. The flues should be three or more feet in length to prevent air flowing outward. The method of operation of the fresh air inlets is illustrated in figure 4. Where the cows face the center of the barn the flues extend from the side walls between the ceiling of the stable and floor of the haymow, open - ing at the center of the stable. The width of the flues is usually the extent of the space between two adjacent floor joists. When the stable is arranged so that cows face the walls of the barn, the flues open on the inside of the wall near the ceiling, thus admitting the fresh air in front of the cows. It is well to have the outside opening of the flues protected by a grating or screen wire to prevent birds and trash from entering. The foul air outtakes are much fewer in number than the inlet flues but have a total cross sectional area equal to that of the inlet flues. These flues should have as few bends and turns as possible, be smooth on the inside and extend above the ridge of the barn. Figure 7 illustrates the proper method of con - struction of the outtake flues. Galvanized iron pipes do not </seg>

Whenever possible it is best to have the foul air flues located near the gutters.

Thus an outtake flue two feet square and inlet flues having an equal area should, under average conditions, provide sufficient ventilation for a stable for 20 cows. It is advisable to provide an abundance of flue space and to equip the openings with slides or registers so that the rate of circulation can be reduced in extremely cold or windv weather. THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE STABLE IS VERY IMPORTANT JFhe proper arrangement of the stable is the point deserving the most careful consideration when planning the dairy barn. The superstructure of a dairy barn might be indentical with that of a horse barn or cattle barn and still meet all require - ments, but upon the first floor arrangements depend the success or failure of the structure from the standpoint of being suitable for the economical production of clean milk. GENERAL ARRANGEMENT Convenience demands that the cows should generally be arranged in two rows lengthwise of the stable. This requires a barn 34 to 38 feet in width. Whether the two rows of cows face each other or whether they face the walls of the barn is a matter to be determined under individual conditions, altho the latter arrangement is especially advantageous where milking machines are used and in large herds where it is desirable to drive a wagon or manure spreader thru the barn for cleaning. 8IZE OF STALLS When the stall is of proper length and width and is ac - companied bv a wide and deep gutter but a small amount of bedding and labor is involved in keeping the cows clean. The length of the stall platform should vary to suit the cows of a particular breed. The requirements for cows of the various breeds are shown in figure 9. The platform length may be varied in different stalls to suit both small and large cows of the same breed. For example, in the case of stalls for Jerseys, the platform may be 4 feet 8 inches long at one end of the stable and have a regular increase up to 5 feet 2 inches at the other end. If the platforms of the stalls in both rows are built in this way the shortest stalls of each row should be at opposite ends of the barn.

            <seg id="p023">Dairy Barn and Milk House Arrangement 23 the stall and in preventing the cows from slipping when reaching for feed. The gutter should be large enough to contain all the manure for a period of 24 hours without being filled so that the cows become soiled in lying down. This usually requires a gutter having a width of 18 to 20 inches and a depth of 8 to 10 inches below the level of the stall floor.

The width of individual stalls is usually three and one-half feet, tho large cows of the Holstein breed may require stalls four feet in width. Partitions between the stalls are very de - sirable, since they prevent one cow from causing injuries by stepping upon the udder or teats of another cow which is lying down. The partitions also prevent cows moving about during </seg>

Under this plan the feed alley floor is 18 inches or more higher than the stall floor. A common defect in the ' construction of mangers is that there is not sufficient depth nor width to prevent the cows from constantly throwing feed out of the mangers. In reaching for this feed, cows often injure their knees. With the larger sized stalls, larger mangers are also recommended. FLOORS The most satisfactory material for the construction of the stable floor is concrete, since this is durable, economical and may be easily cleaned. Concrete is a fairly good conductor of heat and moisture and some precautions should be taken to keep the stall floor dry and warm. If built on low wet ground, a layer of cinders or gravel should be used as a foundation for the stall floors. At a somewhat greater cost than for con - crete, cork bricks or creosoted wood blocks, which are manu - factured especially for this purpose, may be used for the stalls. These materials are non-conductors and are quite durable. The surface of all concrete walks over which the cows pass should be left rough to prevent slipping. The surface may also 1k» indented or grooved in a regular pattern as illustrated in figure 11. CEILINGS The height of ceilings differs somewhat according to indi - vidual preferences or needs and the severity of the climate. The material used for the ceiling should be smooth and well matched so that there will be no place for dust and cobwebs to collect. The old-fashioned loft floor gives a chance for dust, cobwebs and dirt to collect on the barn as well as on hay that invariably hangs down thru the cracks, making it impossible to secure sanitary conditions. When a tight ceiling is used, there is no chance for dust to fall thru even when work is done in the loft. BARN EQUIPMENT Barn work may be greatly facilitated and much labor saved by the use of modern barn equipment. The swinging stanchion, besides being convenient to use. gives the cow great freedom of movement and yet keeps her in proper alignment with the gutter. Steel mangers so constructed that they may be easily and quickly lifted for cleaning are on the market, as well as steel partitions for concrete mangers. Manger partitions are </seg>
