            <seg id="p014">11 PRESIDENT'S AI&gt;I»I To the Officers and Member* t&gt;f the \&lt;t&gt;raska Slate Board of Agriculture, Greeting: Again we meet in annual session, and in reviewing the past year we have many reasons for being thankful and encouraged to better efforts. The rapid advance and permanent character of the work in upbuilding the agricultural interests of thi&gt; state during 19U7, by the State Board will leave its imprint for years to come. The recent financial flurry caused deep concern m New York, and generally throughout the east. Uip supposed financial Gibraltar of North America, and our banks had millons of deposits with the eastern banks that they could not return; but it was not necessary for the New York banks to return the millions of our farmers" money, for we had plenty of resources left in Nebraska to fully feed, care for and conduct all of the necessary financial tran- &gt;f our prosperous commonwealth. With the enormous live stock interests, with millions of bushels of sur - plus corn, wheat and oats, and millions of tons of hay selling, as a rule at satisfactory prices, we surely hav this land of sunshine and prosperity reason to rejoice that we live in THE NEBRASKA STATE FAIR. I The exhibits in every department nagement to the utmost to furnish were complete and it taxed the space for many lines of exhibits, year and additional improvements (The improvements during the past ow under construction will in a large measure remedy the lack of space the coming season. The following improvements added largely to the beauty of the grounds and comfort of the visitors: Painting all buildings on the fair ground tThe new fish building, where afort and safety, as viewing tin through the building is a new many thousands viewed the fish in fish from the outside instead of pass - leparture in fish buildings. swine barns, moving the same and y assisted in caring for this yery im- Grading the location for the erecting seven new barns material portant branch of exhibits. Removing the old speed barn remodeling the same, has added much to the appearance of the grounds and affords the speed department much better accommodations, which were appreciated. In addition to the above, water mains with fire plugs were laid to the speed barns, thus furnishing them the necessary protection. Sewers were dug connecting with the city sewerage, thereby insuring sanitary conditions. It required the expenditure of $33,000 to secure the improve - ments named, and while the improvements are great and much has been accomplished in a very short time, we must make more and better efforts </seg>
            <seg id="p015">12 the coming season, &amp;nd we will, no doubt, advance and improve more rapidly, for we are progressing as a state, and our fair grounds will keep pace with the enterprise of the citizens of Nebraska. The Board is under special obligations to C. H. Rudge and H. L. Cook for their untiring effort in overseeing the details of the work of con - struction. They devoted many weeks of valuable time urging and en - couraging the work, in order to have all in order and ready on the opening day. The last legislature appropriated $20,000 for a new cattle barn and the foundation and part of the walls are already built and will, when complete, add much to the comfort of the exhibitors and also assist the Superintendent in his labors. This building will be one of the largest buildings of its kind in the west, 174 by 255 feet with a capacity of over six hundred head of cattle. It is but a fitting tribute to the breeder of fine cattle that they should have fine shelter during the fair week, as the live stock interest is the largest interest in Nebraska. RECOMMENDATIONS. 1st. Complete information bureau, where visitors can get prompt and reliable information. 2d. A large bulletin board announcing the departure and arrival of ENew addition to grand stand, as the present stand is entirely too for present needs. 4th. New Agricultural Hall. 5th. Suitable building for educational exhibit. 6th. Better accommodations for the forage department. I would urge that all the improvements outlined above be secured as soon as funds are available for this purpose. SECRETARY S OFFICE rfhrough your wise action the Secretary is now compelled to maintain office in Lincoln, which is located in the state house and is always open to the public, requiring the entire time of the secretary, while in former years the secretary resided at his home and could attend to his personal as well as his official duties. The expense and work has thus been increased by reason of being located in the city of Lincoln, and the ■alary has not been increased to meet this extra outlay. I would there - fore recommend some substantial increase in the salary of the secretary. I would also recommend that the Board of Managers confer with the Traction and Citizens' Street Railway companies with a view to having the roads enter the fair grounds at some convenient point, instead of compelling our patrons to walk into the grounds as under the present Brer mindful of the good work of the superintendents and others </seg>
            <seg id="p016">13 success of the fair the past year was due to the kindness of the exhibi - tors and painstaking efforts of the officers toward the patrons, which nan caused a feeling of good will toward the State Board- of Agriculture. In returning into your hands the office of President with which you have honored me, I retire with a feeling of good will to all connected with the Board, and I assure you I will ever appreciate the kindness of the Board of Managers, Secretary and every member of the Board, for their assistance to me in the discharge of my official duties, and my hope and desire is that you will give my successor the same loyal support that has \teen accorded me I thank you. PETER YOUNGERS President Youngers: We will now listen to the report of the Secre- Mr. Mellor: I have here a letter from the secretary of the Commer - cial Club which I would like to read to the people present. (Reads as follows:) LlNml.N CuMMKRCIAI. Cl.lK. Lnoou, Mm, January 21. 19rt8. .1// W It- Mellor. secretary. Board of Agriculture. City Dhar Sir: The Lincoln Commercial Club desires to extend a most cordial welcome to all delegates to the meetings of Organized Agriculture held in Lincoln during the current week, and to extend to each and every one the full privileges of the club rooms while they are in the city. I think we can safely say that every member of the Commercial Club has taken great interest in meetings of Organized Agriculture, and that you will find the club as anxious in the future as it has been in the past to co-operate with the officers of your organization to make these meetings of more importance each succeeding year. The officers of the club invite suggestions from delegates and offi - cers of your association as to how their services can be made more efficient. We are all vitally interested in the development of our agri - cultural lines, and the interest manifested by the people throughout the state is In our opinion the best guarantee to the officers of the meetings of Organized Agriculture that their efforts are appreciated, and that im - mense good has already come out of these important meetings is reflected from almost every farm in the best state in the Union, Nebraska. With all best wishes for the most successful meeting yet held, and trusting that we will have the pleasure of entertaining you again next year, I am cordially yours. </seg>
            <seg id="p017">14 KKI'OKT OF SECRETARY To the Officers anil Mem hers of the Nebraska stale Board of Agriculture Greeting: Nebraska, as an agricultural .state, is commanding the attention of the markets of the world to a greater degree with each succeeding year. A new state which successfully holds the position in the front rank of the agricultural column is deserving of the constantly increasing favor - able consideration by the comparisons with which we are favored. Only two or three states of the Union can now show greater quantities of pro - duction in any of the leading staple crops grown in this latitude, than braska. The year 1907. however, has not been a banner year in crop produc- Ei owing to unseasonable rainfall in the eastern, and lack of rainfall the western and central parts of our state, but this condition being eral over the entire agricultural portion of the central west, has caused a general crop reduction with resultant high prices. As usual, corn has been our predominant crop and although the 1907 P&gt; is fully 25 per cent less in number of bushels than that of 1906, still commercial value is greater. The yield for 1907 as gathered by our state statistician as to our principal crops are: Corn 169.732,885 bushels Wheat 46,207,658 bushels OaU 53,622.262 bushels Rye 1,407,699 bushels Barley 2,246,166 bushels Potatoes 6,262.220 bushels Hay 4,011.648 tons Alfalfa 1,450,759 tons Kt is a matter of some interest to many of us tb know which counties uee the greatest quantities of our principal crops, and by a careful ysis we find the banner counties for 1907 are as follows: tCorn — Cass, Otoe, Saunders, Gage, and Lancaster, with an aggregate Id of 26,272.036 bushels, or more than one-seventh of the entire re - ted yield. t Wheat — Clay, Hamilton, Fillmore, York and Adams with 8,942,961 helB or more than one-sixth the crop of the state. I Oats — Antelope, Cedar, Madison, Boone and Knox raised 8,448.955 hels or about one-sixth of all produced. LRye — Deuel, Holt, Cheyenne, Custer and Frontier whose yield was .656 bushels or one-fourth of the rye raised in Nebraska. Barley — Frontier, Hitchcock, Red Willow, Dundy and Hayes raised •78,753 bushels or more than two-fifths of the entire production. </seg>
            <seg id="p018">15 Potatoes — Douglas. Box Butte, Sheridan, Scott's Bluff and Cherry. 1.806.657 bushels or two-sevenths of the crop. Hay— Holt. Cherry. Dodge, Saunders and Richardson 697,629 tons being one-sixth of the production. Alfalfa— Buffalo. Dawson. Cusler, Webster and Nuckolls 366.319 tons or one-fourth of the production. From a study of these facts we find that I he centers for the various crops were well distributed over the state. Corn, being especially prom - inent from its yield in the southeast corner of the state: wheat in the southern-central: oats in the northeastern; rye in the central western; barley in the southwestern: potatoes, outside of the market gardeners near Omaha, in the northwestern: hay along the Missouri and Platte rivers and alfalfa in the central. Resides these centers for the standard crops, Nebraska is credited with having the greatest production and shipment of vine seeds from Waterloo that there is from any one station in the central west, and also that one-eighth of the commercial pop-corn used in the United States comes from North Loup. Nebraska is credited by the late I'nited States government report as having raised in the year 1907 more than one-twelfth of all the corn, one - tenth of all the winter wheat and one-fifteenth of all oats raised in the Inited States. r"rom deductions made we find that Nebraska has about one-fifteenth of entire wealth-producing, agricultural power of this nation, therefore any wonder that the farmers of our state treated the passing financial panic as of such light importance that scarcely a single country bank in Nebraska failed to pay cash on every check presented, from its deposits of $178,000,000. We hear of certain sections of the country which have not developed "on account of the ravages of the war of '61 to '«"&gt;." When we hear such assertions, we at once come to the conclusion that the basic principles of wealth producing from old Mother Earth is lacking in that particular locality. This, by comparison, also brings to our mind the wonderful de - velopment of Nebraska in the same period of time. In this state our farmers have produced more than one hundred million dollars worth of the two or three principal products each year for the past ten years, with a like amount additional from their live stock. Does not this fact convince us that the development of Nebraska from a wilderness in 1860 — called at that time a part of the Great American Desert — to one of the four leading wealth producing states of the union, is caused by the extreme fertility of our soil, the healthfulness of our climate, coupled with an educated, industrious citizenship who are not content to follow, but who are contending for an advantageous position in the very front rank. </seg>
            <seg id="p019">16 SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURE The interest taken by all the people of our state in the development of agricultural education at the I'niversity School of Agriculture, has been very marked. Students have come in increased numbers, so that this year for the first time the attendance at the school has exceeded the 5*0 mark. This growth in numbers and in interest comes from the fact that the instruction offered has a most intimate relation to the daily life of the boy after he leaves the institution and goes back to the farm, giv - ing him not only the ability to increase the productiveness of his land, but also to enrich in many ways the life which he is living on the farm. This year, also, for the first time, a department of home economics has been established in the school and a class of twenty-three young women are in attendance. Considering the fact that the building to house this department is not completed, and that on this account very little was said about the work to be offered, the attendance is most encouraging and shows that farmers' girls will be anxious to avail themselves of this op - portunity for the practical education in' home making, now to be offered under most favorable circumstances. The last legislature appropriated $100.1100 for new buildings and im - provements to supply the needs of the agricultural school. The women's building is now practically completed. The new heating plant is finished and the pavilion for judging grain and live stock will be completed in a few months. This gives largely increased facilities for the work of the Khool. but there is evidence that these buildings will all be utilized to the llest extent as soon as they are completed and equipped. The success of the farm at the International at Chicago this year as in the past, has done credit to the state In a show of nearly a thousand fat steers, the state farm showed, in Flynt of Meadow Brook, a pure-bred Angus the first prize yearling Angus steer and the champion yearling of the show. It also won other prizes, as follows: third prize on two-year - old Angus steer, third on Angus herd of three steers with four special 'prizes offered by the Angus Association, also second on two-year-old Shorthorn steer with two association specials, also fifth on two-year-old Hereford steer and fifth on herd of three steers, with one Hereford special, also third on two-year-old Galloway steer, fourth on yearling Galloway s.eer, third on calf and third on three steers in herd; also third in Shorthorn special on two-year-old grade steer, third and fourth in senior yearling grades and fifth in junior yearlings, third in Hereford al on grade calves In the carcass competition second and fifth prizes were awarded on yearling steers. Two Armour scholarships of $250 each were also awarded to the station on account of the prizes won in open competition making a total of $1,110 won in prizes and scholarships. It will thus he seen that the men in charge of these departments of our state farm are able to compete with the most experienced of practical </seg>
            <seg id="p020">17 Eaers in the production of finished beef, aa judged by the standards of tical cattle men. The work of the experiment station in calling attention to economic methods in cattle feeding, through the use of alfalfa has been of im - measurable value to the state. The experiments in developments of new strains of turkey-red wheat with higher yielding power and better milling qualities than that in common use. promises much to the wheat grower of the future. The five years work in cooperation with farmers in differ - ent corn regions of the state has given us a more accurate and valuable standard for selection of varieties than we have ever before had. The average yield in the eastern section of the state for the best two varieties under experiment has been fifty-four bushels per acre, while the average yield of all corn in the same counties was but thirty-six bushels; an average increase of eighteen bushels per acre for all the eastern coin This is good evidence to show that if the best varieties were used and the average standard brought up to that of the best farmers in the neigh - borhood, an increase of about fifteen to twenty bushels of corn per acre would probably result. The work of the dairy department in testing the value of silage for dairy cows will certainly result in building many silos in the eastern section of the state, as this work has shown the cost of Eter production can be reduced about twenty per cent in large dairy ds by the use of the silo. The work of the western station, located at North Platte, has shown that under good methods of farming great areas of land which have been devoted to grazing can be made profitable farming lands. Winter wheat has been grown successfully each year, the average yield being greater under good methods than the average yield of wheat on the high-priced land in the eastern section of the state. Pe land which produced this wheat was purchased by the state In for $5 per acre. Macaroni wheat, barley, and other spring grains flourished and have given moderate and sometimes abundant yields Cane, as a forage plant, has produced large crops. Pork has been grown upon alfalfa pastures and native grown grains at a profit, and all the conditions point to the development of a profitable farming region, where proper care is used in the selection of land, the use of good varieties, and of good methods of tiilage. The information thus far gained would sug - gest that live stock will always be the leading industry of this section, but that a combination of crop prduction and stock raising will greatly multiply the profits secured from the land. The work of the farmers' institute, under an efficient corps of instruc - tors, is doing much to dissemiaate the best agricultural knowledge among the people, so that improved methods may come into more general use. One hundred seventy-five meetings are scheduled for the coming institute season, reaching a large number of farmers in every section of the state. The men who are responsible for the agricultural progress of the state. </seg>
            <seg id="p021">18 growth is taking place; That the facilities for investigation of agricultural problems are so generously supported, and that the interest in agricultural education has become so universal. The money which has been expended in these public ways for the improvement of our agriculture has been repaid a hundred fold and the impeius which has been given to general education, to better methods of production, and the development of all our agriculture resources. THE STATE FAIR To this association some of the principal events of the year have been the killing of the bill for one eighth mill levy for state fair buildings ami substitution therefor of a bill for 175.000 for a machinery hall. This, when referred to the house committee, was amended to read '$50,000 for a cattle barn." which passed the house and went to the senate, where the committee cut the amount to $2u,nnn which was ultimately passed with - out a dissenting vote, and concurred in by the house. This barn is now in • reel ion. The siz ■ is 174 by 2."ir&gt; feet and it will hold, when completed. SM head of cattle. The thirteen swine barns formerly located on the east side of our grounds have been removed to the extreme west and. together with seven new barns, are located upon the filled ground west of the Burlington intake. The old speed sheds have been moved from the south end of the race track over to the north side, and remodeled into commodious, modern speed barns. By bringing the dirt from north of the Rock Island switch, about ten acres of the low land west of Administration Building and Burlington intake, has been changed, by the fill of from one to seven feet of earth, into one of the most de - sirable tracts on the grounds and now furnishes us a location for the future live stock exhibit, and the coming live stock pavilion. A new fish building of an original desgn has been erected, and toilet rooms for ladies to two and one half times the original capacity and one for men have been added to the Public Comfort Building. These improvements will be touched ui&gt;on more fully in the report of the President and Board of LIVE STOCK The live stock Industry in Nebraska is of a value fully equal to all the products combined, therefore it is easily the one most important exhibit at our annual fair. In the past year great advancement has been made in the various departments of live stock and we confidently expect that the 190S fair will mark the beginning of an era in which Nebraska will be recognized as one of the places in the west for the exhibition of herds of fine stock. At the l!ic&gt;7 state fair the entries were as follows: orses. Ill cattle. IJM9 swine, with l.S.jl actually on the grounds, and ZMq Bn $**"*[). AORICU/n'RAI. HALL.

The exhibit was in keeping wi,h the u.u.1 excellent ability in which this department is ever conducted and reflects great credit on the membership of the Horticultural Society which is doing much for the betterment and happiness of Mr farmers POULTRY poultry exhibit, with its 1,25;! entries, completely filling the large Wing, was expressive of the wisdom of the committee in limiting the exhibit of professional showmen so that more amateur fanciers might participate in the awards.

TEXTI1 K AND PINE ARTS It is really a deed of heroism and in the mercantile, textile and art d exhibits in the accommodations now pride on the part of the exhibitors partments to trust their excellent provided. When we consider the many rare, and valuable displays made, an.l the liability of loss we can - not fail to express our admiration for the loyalty of our exhibitors in pro - viding us each year with most meritorious exhibits in each of these de - partments. We fear no contradiction when we say that each of these departments maintained the steady advance shown with each succeeding DAIRY This important industry is represented principally by the one splendid annual exhibit of our leading creamery company, together with a line of separators showing the advantages claimed by each exhibitor At the last fair liberal premiums were offered for a dairy test for Shorthorn cows, but owing to the high standard demanded together with strange conditions caused by the removal of the milch cows from their usual surroundings, it proved a failure. At the last meeting of the Shorthorn Breeders Association held at Chicago in Decem!&gt;er. we understand that the standard of test was lowered so as to overcome these conditions to a certain degree; therefore we hope to have a successful test at our coming </seg>
            <seg id="p023">20 EDICATIONAL. The stranger who visits our annual exhibit in the educational depart - ment may easily realize why Nebraska is at the head of all the states in the union in the smallest percentage of illiteracy. The exhibit shows the skillful care of accomplished hands in its arrangement for display and it is hoped that the handicap of crowded quarters may be overcome during the coming year, liy the arrangement of some special building for this ut department. APIARY The practical demonstration made with bees by one of our energetic ■ itors was instructive and entertaining to our patrons and waa a feature of the Bee and Honey exhibit which served to draw added ini - thereto This is a most important lesson to teach our farmers as large profits may Ik- reaped from a small investment and little labor. MACHINERY. "More 'red' machinery than I ever saw in one spot in my life," was the way one farmer described this splendid exhibit made by 12C manufacturers and firms. This display was fully one-fifth greater than at any fair ■ ifore held here in Nebraska. During the year the removal of the swine barns to the new location permitted the enlargement of the machinery grounds so as to cover about two acres more territory than in 190fi. The showing made in this department is fully realized by this state board and we wish to here express our appreciation of the labor performed by our exhibitors in this department in their efforts to make K particular exhibit a model of its kind under the handicap of no per - ent buildings in which to show. TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES During the past year the transportation facilities to the fair grounds have been increased by the addition of the Citizens' Railway Company's Seventeenth street car line so that with the excellent service of the shuttle trains of the Burlington, the Lincoln Traction Company and the Citizens' lines the transportation problem was the most satisfactory that the state fair lias ever known. NIGHT ENTERTAINMENTS. With increased transportation facilties comes the opportunity for night attractions, which are leading features of other state fairs and could be made very attractive with running races, althletic events, vaudeville, band and operatic concerts and grand fireworks exhibitions. This departure fid necessitate some sort of a lighting plant with a capacity for the e buildings, race track and concessionaires, but as the Nebraska state is fast approaching exposition proportions, it is proper that matters Its advancement shall l&gt;e considered. </seg>
            <seg id="p024">21 ATTRACTIONS. We have made an initial bow ia the securing of two large attractions at the 1907 state fair; the air-ship, which owing to prevailing winds, was somewhat disappointing from the fact that flights were only accomplished at, or near, the sunset hour when the great majority of our patrons had left the grounds. The other special attraction was the Liberati New York Grand Opera and Concert Band which can truly be said was an unqualified success and gave delightful music especially gratifying to music lovers. Our own First Regiment Band divided honors with Liberati and to them no higher compliment can be paid than the repetition of the statement made by a number of the members of Liberati's band when they said "that it was the best country band they had heard." For ad - ditional meritorious attractions we hope, as soon as practical, that two theatre buildings and a music hall may be erected so we can give our patrons value received for money expended in the show line, which seems impossible under existing conditions. SPEED We believe there is a closer degree of harmonious friendehip between the horseman and this board than has been known for years. During the past year it has been our effort to do, not only that which is done by every other speed association, but to "go them one better" in re - turning one-half the entry fee to horses finishing outside of the money, with free stall rent to actual starters. This liberal policy resulted in the filling of fifteen harness races on dates regularly set for the closing of .entries, which gave us three harness races for each day. This is a wel - come departure from the experience of former years, and when we take into consideration that our dates conflict with the grand circuit meeting at Minnesota each year, it is truly a wonderful accomplishment to suc - ceed in securing 201 entries of harness horses for a single meeting. The great need in this department is for more grand stand facilities. It is almost hopeless for us to consider the erection of a steel grand stand similar to those used by other large state fairs, without legislative ap - propriations; therefore it may be a number of years before Nebraska state fair patrons have such accommodations. The following is the financial statement in the Speed Department for the year 1907: RECEIPTS. Entry fees $3,825 00 Suspension collections 290 40 Stall rent 4 00 Grand stand concessions 460 00 Amphitheatre tickets 6,645 SO </seg>

With our fair assuming greater proportions each year, we find the work in all the departments increasing. This has been very noticeable in the secretary's office, from which during the year, has issued more than 20,000 pieces of mail and 1,461 warrants. The handling of the ■peed, concessions, machinery, press and advertising departments from this office, in addition to the ordinary duties such as were handled before the removal of the office to Lincoln, has increased the work materially. The great amount of relocation and improvement on the grounds has caused an unusual amount of extra labor on the part of the resident members of the Board, and incidentally added to the work necessary to be performed by the office. The accumulation of 17,000 volumes of old reports have been turned back to us by the State Histori- cal Society and we found among them were remaining as high as 2 700 </seg>

            <seg id="p071">68 the Board of Managers. REPORT OF HOARD OF MANAGERS. To the Officers and Members of the Nebraska State Board of Agricultur Qreeting: The past year has been one that has required more time and thought of your Board of Managers than any previous year and this is fully explained by the amount of changes and improvements that it seemed wise for us to make. It required several meetings of your Board and many trips to the ground to decide to reclaim or rebuild the land west and north of the B. &amp; M. tracks and in making- this land accessible and useful it took a large amount of moneys and we trust you will approve of the expense incurred. You must all appreciate that our grounds are small and in order to accommodate the large exhibits and crowds that annually attend the fair, that sooner or later every foot of ground will necessarily have to lie used. P'n the appropriation was made by the legislature to build the new »rn we hoped that it could be done in time for the 1907 fair, but propriation was not available until July 1 and the time was too ) enable the Board of Public Lands and Buildings to construct the However, the barn is now well under way and will be completed early in the spring, and with this new barn we must have a live stock pavilion, of a capacity of sufficient size to accommodate our exhibitors. This must be built by an appropriation from the state and the time to commence the campaign for the pavilion is this year, and not wait until the legislature meets. The building now used is inadequate for the pur - it was intended, as a live stock pavilion, but can be used for many other exhibits. One of the largest demands from the patrons who attended the fair is that we provide a more commodious grand stand at the rac.e track, and we think they have good grounds and are justified in making this request, and I trust in the near future we will be enabled to give them some relief. LYour Board in the past year have made permanent improvements, in ount approximately $.',.{. (mmi. nearly double the amount incurred any previous year since the state has owned the grounds. One of the largest Bf exi&gt;ense was the filling up and grading of about ten acres of that required from one to seven feet of earth to bring it up to the ■y grade, and we are not quite through with the grading. In the ir future it will be necessary to fill up about two more acres of that will be very valuable to us. K moved thirteen swine barns from the east side of the grounds side, and put cement piers under same; also built seven new ; making a total of twenty barns. </seg>

            <seg id="p080">&lt; 77 One may have little knowledge and be worth much to the world. We no longer measure men by what they know, but by what they can do of work that needs to be done. I Knowledge, then, to be valuable must relate itself to the doing of ful things. Mere breadth in education is no more important than depth. It is the product of the two, expressed in units of useful activity, that gives the true measure of manhood. Our students must learn to take the step from knowing to doing if the community is to realize on its educational investment. IFra Elbertus says there are some nion who know so much that it s over and they stand in the slop. There should be no slop about it. What a man knows should be di - ;ested and assimilated and should re-appear as strength to do something that needs to be done LGetting knowledge for use is praiseworthy; but when it becomes an in itself, it is to be condemned, (letting knowledge for its own sake but little better than setting money for its own sal Greediness for intellectual wealth," says Charles Dudley Warm- ircely more praiseworthy than greediness for material wealth I To how much learning — to how much money — to how much of any of good things of this world is a man entitled? According to Carlyle's "Pig Philosophy," he is entitled to as much as he can get out of the general swine's trough without being rapped too hard on the head for it. According to the better human philosophy — I might almost say, di - vine philosophy — one is entitled to all he caji get honestly and use effect ivfly. No more. He is entitled to no more; he should have no more. Inapplicable knowledge," says Hegel, "is a cumbrous load; only that wledge which subserves the ends of life becomes a working power " what are ends of life from the standpoint of the intelligent erican citizen? I answer, contribution to human well-being; the general uplift of the race. Nothing short of this, nothing beyond this, support of the schools. r justify general taxation for the Who, then, are the well-educated people of our time and country? I uplift; those who do useful things, that he may be properly educated? rwer, those who contribute to the What shall a boy learn in order I answer, all that he possibly can learn that will develop and increase his desire and his power to do useful things — nothing more, nothing less. The power without the desire is no better than the desire without the lower. Hence every ideal should involve the getting and using of power in the doing of something that needs to be done. Better no power at all than power with wrong desire. Moreover, time spent in power-getting that ought to be spent in power- </seg>

Again I ask, who are the educated? But I am not alone in asking and atlempting to answer this question. Says Kev. \V. A. Bartlett: tThe cook in the kitchen who can make better bread than the one pays her wages, is to that extent better educated than* her mistress may greatly adorn a literary society. Pive no objection to a woman's knowing Browning. But I would i- consider, too, how well she is equipped to furnish digestibly food to a hard working husband in case the cook leaves or in case of a small salary. be sure the life is more than 1 the aliiHty lo make a dress, i o iliiv or use a tool, and do these things our educational estimate." meat and the body than raiment. ■ an engine or grip car, to create a well, should take far higher rank Says a distinguished American w ;ire of himself in all conditions riter: -The man who is fitted to in which he may be placed, is, in Rfjr important sense, an educated man. The savage who understands habits of animals, who is a good hunter and flsher, is a man of ation, taking into consideration his circumstances. The graduate university who cannot take care of himself— no matter how much my have studied — is not an educated man." The greater part of the contribution a man makes (o human well being, he makes through his vocation. Hence more and more education must relate itself to vocation. Listen to the testimony of some of the great educators on this point: I Dr. E J. James of the University of Illinois: "In a word, the Jiversity which most fully performs its function for the American will stand simply, plainly, unequivocally, and uncompromisingly ining for vocation; not training for leisure nor training for ship except as training for scholarship is a necessary incidental ■oper training for vocation or may be a vocation in itself."

President Roosevelt also says: "To train boys and girls in merely literary accomplishments to the total exclusion of in - dustrial, manual, and technical training tends to unfit them for indus - trial work: and in real life most work is industrial." I often hear it said. "Kvery boy and girl in America is entitled to a liberal education." hut what is a literal education? Let Nicholas Mai lay Butler answer: "The desipmation liberal has com" to be claimed as the sole prerogative of a very Barrow and technical course of study that was invented for a very narrow and technical purpose, and that has been imperfectly liberalized in the intervening centuries " L Another bold s-pirit has said, "No man is liberally educated who has learned to make a living," tl often hear it said that early specialization results in narro« this true? Lot Dr. John Dewey reply: "It is our present education ch is highly socialized, one-sided, and narrow. It is an education linated almost entirely by the mediaeval conception of learning." How narrow bow broad, how deep ought one's education to be? I answer. Rach should have that culture and that information and that training which will enable him to contribute in largest measure to the general good. For it is as sure as the law of gravitation that he who can and does contribute most sets most out of life for himself. But in preparing one's self for useful activity the injunction of Emerson mav well be kept In mind: "The one prudence in life is concentration: the one evil is dissipation: and i» makes no difference whether our dissipa- ing to their vocational desires."

If they fit up enough animals to fill five pens, which is a very moderate demand, and ther. it turns up that we have to prorate these pens in order to let everybody show, we will probably cut out some of the best stuff for the exhibit in this show. If you prorate one man you have to prorate another. You cannot draw the line. The only thing you can do is to cut down the large exhibitors, and some of the very best animals that show come from the class that occupy nine pens, and they justly deserve it. Not only is this true in one breed but in all breeds. I recall one herd of Berkshires that came here, and this particular herd never got below tihinl place in any place they exhibited, and if your had prorated that man he would probably have left one of the very best RKI'OK 1 OF A N N 1 A I . M KK i «*{ a an mat we ha\e to do now is to discuss and dispose of the ques- tions left over. Mr. Hendershot: It is all classified and if any one wants to take up the classes they can find them. President Youngers: As 1 understand ir, there were two items that were left until today. tMr. Lewelling: One item that was left over was the question of s and honey. I was not clear as to i he amounts or as to the changes tie in Lot I. It shows K in the catalogue. It seems to me thai the premium was cut dowa and we owshi to raise it. if anything. Mr. Bassett: We have raised it tMr. Lewelling: I have no objection to that. My understanding was t it was cut down. Mr. Ollis: In regard to Class A. I wan, to move that the clause (reading from copy), "any one exhibitor will not I.e allowed more than eighteen stalls,' etc., b&lt;&gt; accepted. Motion was carried. Mr Pritchard: In Lot 9, Class C. page 29, I move that the word nine" be stricken out, and that the matter i* left with the executive board or the board of managers, and if thev are oi.io t.&gt; r,,r n ioh ™_. </seg>

Pr. Leonard: I do not think they could with less than nine pen; Mr. Russell what he thinks of this matter. Mr Rit.ssell: We talked that matter over a number of times, and ;innot fill the class and take any decent care of the hogs with less than nine pens. I hope this board won't cut this thing down, because I ha\e always lived in hopes that we would have 3.011(1 hogs on these fair grounds, and I have been making the state fair with my hogs every I have talked with a number of other men about coming to the aska state fair, and they say they cannot come because they cannot he pens they need. The time is coming when they can get pens, and of the best breeders in Iowa come with a full herd all the way around, and if we get them to come here we will have to have the accom - modations. They come to Iowa with a full herd and they could not split that up and com* to the Nebraska state fair. I hope this won't be changed. I don't think you can get breeders in the hog department to fit up hogs if you prorate the pens and shut them off. I am not saying what I would do or would not do. You cannot say, you don't know what animals would l*&gt; good animals to fit. This year you might be good on a line of ased boars and next year it might be sows. Mr. Pritchard: Let me explain this motion of mine. I don't want to cut anybody out. That is the identical idea that I offered. In remowng these words 'nine pens," I want everybody here. The ques - tion is. have you the funds to build the pens? Now as to the other point. You make your entries February 1, or any other time liefore the fair that you want to. Every man that has a herd in the of N.braska cannot have the herd fitted at that time, but still he would like to know that he can get the pens. This matter is left at the discretion of the board of managers, and if they find that they cannot furnish the pens for part of the entries they will then act accordingly. You have 714 pens. This thing worked a hardship) Last ye«r we had applications for 1,213 pens, with 714 pens to fill them with. It did work a hardship on a great many who would have brought their stuff here. If you will permit me to digress I will cite an instance. In 1902 or 19"4 at the Iowa state fair Winn ft Mastin brought In the most magnificent show hogs that I ever saw. They came into one class, sows one year old. Is it justice to the other breeders, when a man wants to brine in a carload or two of hogs, to build the pens for that man </seg>
            <seg id="p088">85 and shut out half the other breeders, as you did last year? No, it is not right, and we want every man who fits animals to be able to show them. My motion is to leave it with the discretion of the board, and if they furnish the pens tor all the entries, all right, but in case they tdo it, and h;ive no money to do it with, not only in the hog ent, but in every department, then I say limit the amount of ■ Hervey: It seems to me that this proposition involves two con - one a matter of display and exhibition and the other a matter of education. We have twc f ]&gt;eople. We have one class whom ley are the very men who will be &gt;ns when the time comes for receiv - be the first fellows In, because they one year to another they are con - in shape, and exhibition is a part lass of people we want to encourage we shall call expert exhibitors. Tr at the head of that list of applioatio ing applications. Those fellows will lows wil are professional exhibitors. From tinually showing. They are always of their industry. There is another ( if we want to carry on the educational feature. We want to encourage the fellows who buy stuff from the big breeders and establish a new herd. We want to gi\e those fellows an opportunity in this state fair. They will be at the tail end of this list for applications, and are cut off year after year under the present conditions. It is to the interest of the state fair, and the state of Nebraska, and the live stock interests in general that we provide a means for taking care of those fellows. They are the men that we have to look after, and they are the meD that need our assistance. These other fellows take care of themselves, whether they have the exhibit in Iowa, Kansas or Missouri or wherever they have to go. We are building up the industry here for the advantage of the state of Nebraska. That is what the state fair is for, and as long as we can make it for educational interests and carry on our work for the improvement of beginners we are serving the purpose for which #e are organized. [Applause.] President Youngers: In that case the proper thing to do would be t build more pens. tMr. McLeod: Last year I could not bring my hogs here because the s were all filled, but when I got here I found they were not al&gt; taken. If I understand rightly, they rejected any amount of bids for pens because they were taken. This is something this motion would have prevented if it had taken effect last year. As the president Bays, if we have not enough pens, why we ought to build more, and accom - modate everybody if possible. Accept all these bids that come in for pens and then afterwards, if for some cause or other they cannot exhibit, probably at the end we would find that we had plenty without building. We may have to build a few, but believe the idea is a good one. E. Cook: Along the line that the gentleman was talking: I be - that ordinarily we have pens enough to accommodate all the show that may come to the state fair, but in years of prosperity, when </seg>
            <seg id="p089">86 S plications, and if we find we have not pens enough to accommodate em, build temporary pens, but there will be many years that the cholera and other things will come in and cut down the show, and then our pens will be sufficient to carry all the exhibit, but there is nothing that encourages the state fair management and makes the department favorable in the eyes of e\ery one that comes as much as to have it running to overliow, and we can go and rent lumber and accommodate the overflow in these years that it is necessary to do so. I think this year you will find that we ha\e ample space. If we go hedging about and discouraging many from asking for pens, and come up some years with about three barns full, &gt;ou can see what a frost it would be. [&lt;et 'idy come and we will make room for them. LApplause.J Mr Leonard: 1 would like to make an explanation as to why there some empty pens at the last bUr, There were fifteen empty ones, and the parties that those pens were assigned to never notified me that they would not come to the fair, and as Umj had until 8 o'clock Monday morning to put the exhibit in place, 1 could not use the pens until that time. The state board has the money for those pens. 1 have : heard from those parties that applied from the time 1 got their letters until now, and have not yet. If the gentleman can formulate some plan to add to his suggestion that would compel a man to come and occupy the pens or notify the superintendent if he could not do so I think it would be along the line to fill those pens. Mr McArdle: I cannot see where this motion would work a hardship on any man. It has not yet been explained to me where by cutting out the word nine and placing it to the discretion of the board of directors would work a hardship. I would vote against it if it would, as 1 do not want to work a hardship on any one. I believe this fair is an education, and without the men who have been making the exhibit time after time it would be a pretty poor show, but cannot see where this motion would work a hardship. The motion was seconded and carried. IMr. Hendershot: 1 would suggest that entries for hogs should close irty days prior to the fair, in order to give the board of managers chance to provide for the hogs in case we have a big exhibit and it 11 be necessary to build temporary pens. The entries should be made a specified time so the management would know what to expect d what to do. I Secretary Mellor: I move that the entries of the swine department close ly 1st. Seconded by Mr. Hendershot. President Youngers: Gentlemen, you have heard the motion. Are you ready for the question? Mr. Hervpy: I do not favor that at all.

It looks very strange to me, gentlemen, that the president of this association whom we elect here can preside at this annual meeting and have a voice in case of an emergency. but when it comes to the hoard of managers, he calls them to order and he "kinder" keeps onier. hut when it comes to any questions, the board of managers simply say to the president. "What do you say about this thing?" he has no voice whatever except through the courtesy of the board. If you happen to get some mean fellow on that board and get into a scrap, orr president and secretary who understand all the internal work of this affair, who have practically built it up and made it. it seems to me that if somebody would simply say to them "What have you to say about it?" it li a pretty poor state of affairs, and I would make a suggestion to this effect that the president shall preside at the meetings of this association and of the hoard of managers, and that he shall be a member of both of those, not as it is now where he simply presides without having a voice, but that he shall be a member of the lioard. and the same courtesy le extended to the secretary. I simply express the sentiment I feel in regard to this matter, or will make it a motion that the president and secretary be named actual members of the I oard of managers.

In the past we have had some ■aperlntendenta who have not been a I eiietit to the financial interests of this board We have had nearly as much money collected proportionately in other years as we had this year, but we have never had a proportionate percentage from this department. In ■|Wlrlm of the contracts issued, I doubt if it is advisable to permit the ■ i so many during the coming year. I think it would be to the l.cst interests of the department to allow a certain number of eon - "iis in certain classes. 1 was going to take the matter up in this ing. hul under these recommendations thought possibly it was not my duty to speak of it. If the board, in their wisdom, sees fit to order the appointing of a superintendent of concessions. 1 hope he may limit the numl.er even though not securing so great an amount of money, but rather catering to the satisfaction of the concessionaire as well as the ,,eople tVlr. fiassett: As the criticism comes up I appreciate those facts. The i was. that the secretary's office being here in Lincoln, he could conduct correspondence. 1 believe he will bear me out in the statement that heaviest work will come two weeks before the fair and during the fair. Secretary Mellor: There were 151 contracts written before the 27th of August, and 2til contracts written altogether. Mr. Eiassett: 1 am willing to strike out the "assistant superintendent" and let the secretary conduct the business. Mr Haws: If we adopt the recommendations of the committee in regard to charging the cost in some other department, why it would still increase the importance of the concession department.

We on't get a crnt of not only that, we furnish the people and we furnish the opportunity, we advertise and we furnish them free admis sion to the grot-nils and we furnish police supervision, etc., then why in the name of common sense should they not contribute? Let me illustrate ti .Injustice along that line. A friend of mine called my attention to the it fact tl'at he paid $50 for a tent in which to exhibit hand separators. He learned afterwards that the man adjoining him did not pay anything at 11. He was selling bu They were both manufactured articles and nderstand how it could be so. It was true, and it appeared that the reason for this was that between the two tents was the line of concessions and a street Why should a man who exhibits dairy ma chiner.y we will say or something of that kind and another man in the mething ame class of I usiness -manufa 1 articles — not pay anything. .Vr. Rudge: Would the other man not have to pay if he were within the concession grouni Member: I admit that, but it ought all to be concession ground. A n-a'i who comes on our ground and is benefited should contribute nl anon to this matter of $50. The ground along- ■cifaty Mellor: In side the Mercantile Hall is marked oft* for concessions and we sell it $2 the foot. This man wanted twenty-five feet. I said at the time, "Do machinery ground or on the concession?" I showed him the ground and he said he would pay $50 for the concession ground Come people made objections, but I did not know that he (fbjeeted. as he lid it of his own free will. It is the same man the gentleman has referred in He did not want to go where the free ground was. nn'l fix it that </seg>
            
            <seg id="p095">92 separators, who object to going on the free ground. They claim they don't get the class of people they want to get. They want to get around the dairy business, and they ooghl to pay for that and are willing to pay for it. The machinery men ought to pay a little. Of course we must consider that these men come here at a great expense. It is enormous, and while it is true that we furnish the opport unities, you take the machinery off your grounds and you have a great big vacant spot. They furnish all the accommodations except the grounds. In B and C you can divide the barns at a nominal rental and you can take in a nice lot of money and they will be glad to pay it. I am in favor of doing what is to the best interests of the society, but I don't want this made a rule binding upon the board of managers to force it. I don't like it. BKudge: In regard to making the ground all concessional ground. it is taking a step in the right direction. For several years I have favor of charging for space around Mercantile Hall, dairy building try buildings where goods placed on exhibition are for sale, and I think that the same can be arranged for at a minimum price to start in with on the machinery grounds. For instance, if a man has the first corner there it is worth more than way down at the other end, bu lieve the price should be minimum and not make it large enough to cut those people out, but give them a pro rata price according to location President Youngers: If there is no objection to this as read it will be adopted. ■ Cook: What would you do with the men who already have per buildings? ■iludge: I think the mm who have permanent buildings have a five ise. A man who has a five-year lease would be exempt from any rent as long as that lease was in force. ■Cook: It seems to me that after our patrons had looked at the id the other exhibits, there comes a space in the day when many of them have to l&gt;e entertained. Some of them go to the ra°e track. Many of them go about the machinery and are entertained there and stay tliere. Hundreds of them are entertaind in this way and we ought to realize that tlii'sc men come here at a great expense and put up that machinery and make the wheels go around. Thoy furnish part of the entertainment for the visitors upon our ground. When the time comes that we can put up the machinery hall as the superintendent has said, then they will gracefully and willingly pay. lmt when we ask them to go under the canopy of heaven and take their chances on wind and storm, we ought to be fair with them, as they furnish a lot of the entertainment. You take away the machinery out of the center of the grounds, and we would feel very much as the fellow did who did not have his dinner. Mr. Hervey: I move the adoption of that recommendation.

Mr. Ollis, I will read from our 1906 report at page 22V, in the article entitled "A Short History of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture." in which, at the top of the under members elected 18M4, will be found among the present mem - only the names of Mr. S. C. Basset t and Mr. L Morse, both of whom first elected at that meeting and are now our oldest members. In Mr. C'has Mann was elected and in 1SH7 Mr Elijah Fllley. Mr. Peter Youngers and myself, the oldest members now holding official positions. i. our duties on this board of managers in 1M0, Mr. Bassett then being ient, which was the first year you held a fair on your return from Omaha lo Lincoln. There is inclination to criticise this board as being a "perpetual body," but I am sure that if a person inclined to that ; will carefully study the history of our membership they will arrive at a conclusion that such an idea is erroneous, for the change in mem - 1 ip is quite marked, and a member must be considered as efficient and useful to this i nard to sustain long membership. I am glad this ques - tion has 1 &lt; m 1 rought up, as I am sure- that a full understanding of the facts will only result toward the welfare of the State Board of Agriculture.

To the Prescient and Board of Manayvr* ,,f the State Board of Ayriculture: This being my first year as superintendent of Agricultural Hall I have taken pains to observe closely the wishes of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture and the Board of Managers in my department, and 1 find that the members of the Board spared no i v.r.v thing that would add to the f exhibitors. pains and lost no opportunity to do leasuie and the satisfaction of the its was somewhat less than in some previous years, yet it was th ral opinion of both exhibitors and visitors, that notwithstanding an tin ■asonalile year the exhibits were of a higher grade, were more artistically ihown, and attracted more attention and aroused more interest than ever efore. It is my opinion that the exhibits were more expert in col- xhibits and obtained better effects than in any previous year of the fair. The fact that a large majority if the same exhibitors will be hi harge of county exhibits next year r«S an unusually high character A al Hall hi ii" into three districts for the judging of the county exhil n ray opinion the very best system that has been adoptej by the Board and I heartily recommend it be con- tinued. The only suggestion 1 would make, based on the exhibits of l»07 would be possibly the throwing of Ke d Willow and Frontier counties into the western district instead of the entral; my belief being that their resources and exhibits more nearly approach in character those of the other counties in the western district The system of scoring the county collective exhibits, known as the Ream score card, which was adopted definitely during the past year by the Loard. worked to the general satisfaction of practically all of the exhibitors. The only objection that came to my attention under this system was in some cases where the exhibitors showed less varieties, but larger amounts of products. For instance, a county with a limited amount of material, but answering all the requirements of the score card in num - bers of varieties can, under the present system, score higher than a county showing larger quantity of products, but less varieties. I do not mean to recommend that a county should score highest on quantity alone, but that some method should be found by which an exhibitor who has spent much time and money to produce a large and attractive exhibit, should receive some suitable credit on the score card for his efforts. As I was also superintendent of Class F, I take the liberty of also herewith submitting a few recommendations and suggestions pertaining to changes in the published premium list for this class, as follows: While the number of coimiy exhiL men in charge of the various county lecting anil installing their respective from the material they had to display to the display (o be made In Agrictiltur The newly adopted plan of dividin </seg>

The culinary department was not as well represented this year as in previous years, but was exceedingly nice. The exhibits in the fruit department were not as larne as last year, but were excellent in quality. I think one cause for this was the high price and scarcity of fruit. Another ■ ii given by many of the ladies who have been exhibitors in past years is that the premiums are so small that it does not pay them to exhibit. I have been an exhibitor in this department for years in the past and know from experience what the cost and work of getting up an exhibit is. 1 also have a few recommendations which in my, judgment will make this department much better another year. I will suggest that you give higher premiums in this department. premium one dollar, ieaaad premium seventy-five cents, and third premium fifty cents.

The spiritualization of country life is dependent upon the attitude of the people, the interest they take in the improvement of existing conditions and in their activity in seeking the best there is or the that may be secured for the community, for the home and for the individual. The activity of our young l&gt;eople in its simple, earnest way has done more toward creating a proper degree of respect for industrial efficiency. and has helped more to dignify thf maker than have text-looks, lectur ailing of the farmer and the home schools and other more dignified rns which vet feel the need of a more effective means of reaching home. These organizations have proven a most effective means of bringing schools of agriculture, home economics and manual training into the home where every member becomes a pupil who learns to know and to do by doing. Our agricultural and home economic schools are too few, too distant, too little known, too stationary, to bring more than a very small percentage of our young people through their doors. We must, in a measure, bring these schools into the home if we would reach the great mass of the people. Our young people are the entering wedge. Our organizations provide the motive force. With continued encourage - ment and assistance we hope to more firmly establish the principle that measures which lead the boy and the girl to a keener interest in the home, to a better appreciation of home life, and to the cultivation of a greater degree of individual efficiency as a factor in the home and in the community life — these are educative in the highest sense and rep - resent a necessary part in the proper development of the civic, moral and industrial life of the state. The rapid growth in membership and the greater territory of opera - tion opened has made necessary a change in the management of our work. From the direct state management of the first year we have evoluted to the indirect and more effective plan of making the county the unit of management. Under this plan the detail work of the state organization is reduced and a greater number of homes are reached. The county superintendent of schools is made the county manager and all the work is directed through his office. The county meetings and contests bring a much larger proportionate attendance of young people and of their parents than does the state meeting. At one of our county meetings last year, more than 1.000 boys and girls were in attendance at the afternoon meeting. Our plan now provides for a county contest and convention with an appropriate program, at which the young people of the county exhibit some results of their work. The exhibits receiving highest scoring are 10 the state contest. The state contest and state meeting for dele- </seg>

The enthusiasm that is begotten by association with our fellows supplies largely the motive power for the operation that we carry on. The trend of the times is upward and onward, and nowhere is this more evidenced than in agricultural pursuits: and I think, without lion, it is largely due to the interest manifested by intelligent and thinl-ing people in i's development. The economic side of it doubtless iiad i!s infliUBces, yet. 1 believe, far above it all for permanent influence have been those things which have appealed to and worked through the higher part of us. What we have received in the years gone by at these allied gatherings nd the hearty reception and welcome that you have given us today makes I" appetites doubly keen for the feast of good things and flow of soul it we shall be permitted to enjoy this week. That we, ourselves. I&gt;e tune to all the harmony around us is something we desire, for we have i oar homes with a purpose, and that purpose is not merely to get for ■selves, but to give of ourselves, for we know that by so doing we shall home loaded down with good things. Some time ago, in talking with aged father, we were speaking of bygone days and old-time associa - tions. He was in a very reminiscent mood. and. like all old people, he takes great delight in rehearsing the days of long ago. Speaking of one of his boyhood companions and of the delightful times that they used to have in the fields and lanes of the haunts of his boyhood, he spoke of bow they used to love the birds and flowers and of one of the things that his boyhood friend took great pleasure in doing. The boy's father was a great lover of roses and had a most beautiful assortment In his gardens. The lad used to take the buds from these trees, put them in his pocket, and. as they walked up and down the lanes, would take out his budding knife and insert a bud here and there in the wild briars that grew in the hedgerow. These growing and blooming in after years af - forded great pleasure and amusement for those who, like themselves, were fond of the rural haunts and country joys. As I listened to the old man. I thought what a lesson to us all: if we would only fill the pockets of oar own personality with good things and, as we journey around, no • r how rugged, sharp, or thorny our fellows are. if. with skilful hand and thoughtful mind, we seek to insert that which is useful and beneficial, what fragrance of spirit and what a wonderful change we should see in our associates and their surroundin Evolution has worked wonderful changes through the passings yearn, and you. at this institution, have accomplished great things in the develop - ment of plant and animal life Rut the most striking thing that we have seen evolved during the past decade has been the blossoming out of a scientific agriculturist from the common every day hayseed. </seg>
            <seg id="p136">133 It may be that the different elements in our nature are a little dis - cordant at times, and to have opportunities such as these afford us with - out doubt add to our ability, and, when we return to our farms, we shall drink deeper and oftener of the real pleasures of our surroundings and thus become better equipped and strengthened for our work: and, if our ability to absorb and imbibe, even in a small measure, the beautiful spirit of Mrs. Browning, who gave us these inspiring and suggestive lines, we shall come back rejuvenated in spirit as our annual gatherings come Mr. Chancellor, we have left our country homes in response to the cordial invitation to feast with you here at this institution, which i« yours and ours. Judging from our past experiences, we know that we shall return from these meetings with a feeling of satisfaction and an inspiration for a better and more aggressive work. We also wish to assure you that we have not come empty banded to visit you. for we bring from many farm homes of this state a hearty word of congratulation for what you have accomplished and which we are sure is merely a small part of what you would like to see done in the interests of the farming communities of our state. We also desire to say that most heartily do we join hands with you in the splendid work that lies lefore us and which means so much for the betterment of Nebraska. r'he influence of that which has been done at this institution reaches over an ever-increasing area, and the thinking men and women who on the farms scattered up and down our fair state realize full well that, if we are to come to our complete inheritance, it will have to be accomplished through the education of the tK&gt;ys and girls who are to return to these country homes. I am well assured that every member of this association echoes this sentiment. ■wish you success in your work and we pledge you our be»t effort it in so laudable an enterprise. "The little cares that fretted me. I lost them yesterday Among the fields, above the sea. Among the winds at play. Among the lowing of the herds. The rustling of the trees. Among the singing of the birds, The humming of the bees. The foolish fears of what might happen — I past them all away Among the clover-scented grass, Among the new mown hay, Among the husking of the corn. Where drowsy popies nod.

We would meet on the fair grounds somewhere, get acquainted and plan for a united action for the developing of what was then a very rough, unpleasing hog to the eye. But he had many features that were wanted at that time, and we took him in the rough as it were, and went to work. At the state fairs of Iowa and Nebraska, in 1907, you had the results of these years of labor, not only in the smoothing up and round - ing out of the hog, but the number of breeders have grown until we know hut very little about them. Some of the old landmarks are still to be seen, others their memory is still fresh in our minds, but they have fallen by the way. I have ul limes come before you with a few scattered thoughts of what I thought might be good for our careful consideration. I have sometimes scored a little deep, but have hewn to the line. There are several matters I might touch at this time, but as I am going to step down and out I will leave it foi those that lollow me. KThis is the last time I ever expect to stand before you as your presi - it. On account of my age and health, I am obliged to close out my herd that I have spent years in getting together. While I have made many warm friends, I have tried to avoid making enemies. To the first I know I have succeeded, to the latter I think I can say the same. It is true we have not always agreed; we are not always in position to look at matters in the same way. We live in a very different age and under different conditions from what some of us have lived. The time has been that we lived more for one another than we do today. The motio today is, "In all things get what you can, get it by fair means if possible, but get it." Our tendency is to lose sight of the other fellow and live too much for self. Kwish to leave with you as I leave your ranks this advice, that &gt;ou i each other by working together; in union there is strength; don't de up into classes; do not make yourself believe that any one strain of hogs will do to tie to. for you will find it very different. Some of the best hogs have been bred by men that are hardly known among the breeders, and a line of breeding that is unknown. In closing, I wish to thank you for the many honors you hav con i upon me since our organization. May you who continue find ths» work and breeders as agreeable as I Lave. </seg>
            <seg id="p140">137 ALFALFA GROWING. BY O. IITIX, ALMA Having been requested by the secretary of the State Board of Agri - culture to write an article on alfalfa for the 1908 report. I confess I hardly know what is expected of me. When discussing any farm subject, that is to apply to all parts of the state, with its great variety of soil and climatic conditions, difference in rainfall, etc.. It is no easy matter. I presume it is no longer necessary to argue the question with the Nebraska farmer, as to the feeding value of alfalfa, for its merits in this regard are admitted by all. Neither will it be necessary to use any argu - ment with the up-to-date farmer in convincing him of the value of this crop in helping to maintain the fertility of the soil. Both of these questions have been so thoroughly settled in the school of actual experi - ence that no argument of mine will make the proof stronger. The only Kit ion then to be settled is. how can we in the easiest and surest way e in possession of this valuable plant. OOOD SEED First in importance. I think, is the procuring of good home grown teed. I do not hesitate to say that more farmers have been discouraged r deterred from growing alfalfa from having sown seed grown in Utah. New Mexico, or some place too far south, and where it was grown under irrigation. This seed looks much finer than the home grown and will grow all right, but the first winter will kill a large per cent of it. Then, if the experiment is being tried in a section where alfalfa is little fiwn. the man is ready to blame it to his soil, or climatic conditions. anything but the real cause, which was seed unacclimated. TIME TO SOW Ehe time of seeding will depend on the part of the state you live in. i the center of the state, west. I would advise spring seeding as a (ten - proposition, and in the eastern half fall seeding. If spring seeding is desired, then I should prefer that the land should have been in corn the previous ypar, and well tended. Then commence in the spring as soon as the ground is in condition to work well, and thoroughly disc the land, lapping the disc one-half. Then as often as it rains and packs the ground, or if the weeds start, either harrow, or disc again. Keep up this cultivation until the first to fifteenth of June. You will by this means have sprouted and destroyed a large part of the weed seed, con - served the moisture, and gotten the land in fine physical condition to Eive the sped. Now sow twenty pounds per acre broadcast, roughly harrow, and you will have no more trouble to get a stand Ifalfa. than of wheat or oats. If fall seeding is desired, then the land should be shown to small grain the year you intend to seed to alfalfa. When cutting the grain </seg>
            <seg id="p141">138 -honlfi follow Hip ha it h the disc, as this will conserve the moisture, and put the land in shape to plow later on. I do not think it 1'est to plow very deep, but thoroughly turn and pulverize the soil. This pan be done lest by using an extra horse and let him walk on the plowing. Walking this on ea^-h furrow, and harrowing immediately as it Kps after turning over, anil while y ape for seeding Now do BO plenty of moisture. Wait until yo des'iihed for spring seeding. Do nol the weeds should come in the spring to clip them off. Great care should K[) it too close to the ground, takiBl young, and has no buds formed on ht top dressing of well rotterl stnbk yet moist, puts the ground in good in a hurry to seed unless you have you get a rain and then sow as not sow much later than August.

O.VI'AKl t There never was a time when the possibilities of profitable horse eding by the farmers of the west were greater than at the present The supply of desirable horses is not now equal to the demand and owing to the rapid development of the country it must be years before there is a surplus. To a very great extent the New England and Atlantic states do not rear horses, depending on the west for their supply As an instance of this, last year the state of Maine imported over four million dollars' worth of horses. The breeding of horses on the range is also being seriously reduced on account of the encroachment of set - tlers on the open range. And it is also a recognized fact that the farm - bred and reared horse commands a higher price than those bred on the range. These and other conditions make it apparent that horse users must look more and mor_&gt; to the farms for their supply. It has also yet to be proven that on high-priced land horses can be bred and reared in large numlifrs other farm lines they can be made mares of draft type will do the work will sell at a good profit at any tinn farmer who depends on the year's r annual outlay to leave the breeding as a specialty, but combined with exceedingly profitable. Breeding on a farm and produce foals that It is a safe proposition for the turn from his farm to meet his of fancy light or trotting ■ to others and confine himself to the handling of some breed of draft horse that will during development pay his way in work and find a steady market whenever offered for sale. The country is full of trotting stock that, too slow to bring good money on the track and too light co do profitable work on the land, are not wanted even at a low price, whereas a good, well-fitted horse of good weight always finds ready sale at paying figures. The farmer should have a clear idea in his mind as to what he wants. In breeding he too often acts as though he thought by changing stallions he can from the same mare breed a trotter, a carriage or draft colt. Tnere is no greater mistake which can be made, and from such mating we have the nondescript brute we too often see. I First, as to the mare. Too often broken-down, unsound mares and res of a poor quality are bred from. Far better would it be not to ed at all than to breed from dams of this kind. The mare should be of fair size and good quality — a good individual and sound. Let her be low and thick, possessed of good bone and feet and as much weight as possible. She will perhaps be of no particular breed, the result of injudicious crossing of grade stallions on grade mares. Start </seg>

Applied to the horse it does not mean breed characteristics, but to the utmost degree to live, to do, and to wear.

Again I repeat, use the best stallion that can be obtained. Get all the size possible, but never sacrifice quality for size. Perhaps the worst and most disappointing horse to use is one that has only his weight to recommend him. He must have good feet. The old proverb, "No' foot, no horse." Is absolutely corrpct.

            <seg id="p152">149 ECONOMICAL RATIONS IN BEEF 1'RODUTIoV BY U. K. SMI 111 The determination of methods by which beef production can be made more profitable is one of the important problems now under investigation at the Nebraska Experiment Station. During recent years the attractive prices offered tor corn by the markets of the world have led many stockmen of the state to discontinue their cattle feeding operations and 10 sell the crop direct to elevator companies for shipment. Others have turned their attention to pork and mutton production. That beef values have not kept pace with those of corn in the upward trend of recent years is not denied. Nor can it be said that the market quotations for corn - fed beef have been as attractive as the prices offered for finished pork and mutton during the past few years. Nevertheless, cattle feeding htt its place, and the industry will be regarded with increasing favor as we learn to more fully appreciate the importance of cattle in their relation to the economic management 01 our land. On practically every farm in the state where grain crops have been grown and sold direct to the elevator for a succession of years the soil is much below the productive capacity of adjoining farms where crop rotation and stock feeding have been practiced. Pork production, good so far as it goes in turning back to the land fertilizing material taken from the soil and profitable as it has been during these years of high prices, should not be carried on to the entire exclusion of all other forms of meat production. The occasional destruction of an entire herd of swine by the ravages of cholera is a matter to be considered, but as an argument for a greater diversity of live stock on the farm it does not carry the weight of the one great argument, viz , the economical conversion of a larger part of the vast quantity of roughage grown on every farm as byproducts to grain into some marketable commodity. Cattle and sheep feeding not only make possible the utilization of such material, but these ruminants, requiring much bulk as they do, also encourage the growth of more clover and alfalfa in the crop rotation, thus preserving the fertility of the land. Cattle are not only able to consume bulky material in quantity, but they are also able to take It in its ciude form, less costly, therefore, than if labor is expended in its preparation. Eing the 'years of low-priced corn, cattle feeding was profitable almost any system of feeding, but conditions having changed, s must be varied to meet the new situation. Beef has always luxury, and we can hardly expect Its rise in value to be com- •Bull. 100, Agr. Exp. Station of Nebr. Vol. XX, Art I. </seg>

When it becomes excessively high in price the consumers use less meat and more of other foods which, though less palatable, are much cheaper and can serve as substitutes. In beef production, as in other forms of industry, competition forces us to adopt more economical methods, ami it is left for the farmer to make beef more cheaply rather than to dis - continue the feeding of cattle because of higher priced grain. Ilf cattle feeding, aside from its beneficial effect in maintaining or oring soil fertility, is still :i profitable industry in states farther east — as it is when properly conducted — the farmers of Nebraska are situated to make it doubly so by virtue of the natural conditions winch favor the industry here. viz.. lower priced corn than any other state in the Union, the possibilities of alfalfa and clover culture, notably the former, favor - able markets and shipping facilities, and a climate of relatively low Imidity in winter, which permits outdoor feeding. It would be un - isonable to expect cattle to return every year without fail prices for ■n above what might have beep, received at the elevator. The insta - ity of the average stock market would hardly permit it. But followed ir after year with careful buying and the exercise of skill in the Liiaiiement of cattle, particularly with reference to the selection and » of foods, fair profits are to be depended upon. Nebraska, relatively speaking, is a newly settled state, the eastern half being occupied by farmers who have been giving most of their attention to the growing and selling of grain. It is not at all surprising, therefore, to find that as the need of stock on the farm is felt mistakes will be made and what might have been profits are really losses. That the Experiment Station might be brought in closer touch with actual conditions as they exist in this state, the writer in the early spring of 190:; visited a large number of feed lots to learn what rations were in common use In this investigation it was found that by far the largest number were fattening steers on corn and prairie hav. though some were making use of straw, cane or millet as a substitute for Eirie hay. In the more central and western portions of the state corn I alfalfa were being fed, while a number in the Missouri river coun - were feeding clover. The use of oil-meal and cotton-seed-meal i confined to a few men who feed on an extensive scale and who luy practically all their grain. From the observations made it would be conservative to say that unbalanced rations were being fed on two-thirds of the farms visited. That our farmers might have a prac - tical demonstration of the greater possibilities of a system of cattle feeding which is more nearly in harmony with nature's laws with respect to the character of the food as opposed to a system which ignores entirely the animal's physiological requirements, the series of experi - ments herein described were conducted under conditions precisely as they may be found on many farms in the state. </seg>
            <seg id="p154">151 PLAN OF EXPERIMENTS The steers selected for all experiments were grown under range con- ditions, having had no grain previous to their purchase. They were chosen for uniformity in age. quality and size as nearly as it was possible to secure it. When the division into lots of ten steers each was made previous to the experimental feeding, an effort was put forth to make the several lots representative of the entire herd so that no one lot would have the advantage of another in weight, quality, condition or age. This would make the several lots of a single winter's experiment comparable, but not the lots fed one winter with those fed another winter. In other words, the reader is not to compare the feed record of 1&lt;*04-'05 with the feed record of 19n5-'ftfi or any other year. Grade Hereford yearlinps from Cherry county. Nebraska, were fed in 19O3-'O4: Grade Shorthorn two-year-olds from North Park, Colorado, in 19O4-'O5: Grade Shorthorn and Hereford two-year-olds from Rock county.

The yards were small, but of sufficient size to permit of some exorcise. All cattle were triven water morning and night and salt was kept before them at all times. Each lot was fed for a preliminary period of approximately three weeks before the records of the experiment were begun in order that all steers might know how to eat grain and furthermore have time to gradually adapt themselves to their respective rations The initial weights of the dif- ferent lots as tahulated are an average of four weighings made on suc- cessive days just before watering in th» morning.

Alfalfa in itself contains more protein than the average fattening animal requires, an excess sufficient to compensate for that lacking in corn, the two together, therefore, making a balanced ration for fattening cattle. Prairie hay, like corn, lacks protein and when fed singly or together they do not supply enough of that nutrient to meet physiological requirements. This is best shown by examining the following chart, the black lines representing the digestible protein (lean formers) of each food and the while thp digestible carbohydrates (starches, etc.) and vege - table oils both of the latter producing animal fat and body heat What • approximately a well-balanced ration for the average two-year-old steer indicated by the line having the nutritive ratio 1:7, by which is meant one pound of protein to seven pounds of carbohydrates and fats.

In fact, we are not sure but that 1. 7.3 is just as suitable as 1:7 for an average two-year-old steer.

Steers crowded tor the largest possible consumption of grain can also be induced to eat a little more corn with alfalfa than with prairie hay. In determining the cost of producing 100 pounds of gain, alfalfa and prairie hay were figured at $6 each per ton for the three years. Corn was 33 cents per bushel in 1903, 39 cents in 19U4, and 35 cents in IMS, it is unfair to make comparative values of a roughage like alfalfa, whirl* balances well with corn alone, and one like prairie hay which does not, but when thus fed as in these three experiments, the alfalfa returned values ranging from $10.80 to $15.70 per ton as compared with prairie hay at t&lt;&gt; The experiments show, however, that we cannot afford to feed prairie hay at $0 per ton even if we include in the profits all pork made fiom droppings, us was done in these computations; at least we cannot afford to do so if corn alone makes up the grain ration. Referring to the net profits per bead as given in the table it is of interest to know that the net advance of selling over cost price for the twenty-four »■ periods was $1.30 per hundred on the corn and prairie hay steers in 19o3 and $0.78 in 19o4, while the advance on the alfalfa steers waa $1.65 per hundred in 1903 and $1 in 1904 The larger advance received for the alfalfa steers was no doubt due to the higher finish made by thos&lt; It is apparent that good profits can be made by feeding corn and alfalfa even though the selling price of the cattle does not greutiy exceed the cost price. In these experiments the feeding of alfalfa at $6 per ton with corn made this grain bring, when converted into beef, 51 cents per bushel in 1903, 44 cents in 1904, and U0 cents in 1905. It would take a larger advance than our markets usually afford to make corn and prairie hay profitable at the prices for corn and cattle which have prevailed during the past few years. i was not fed in this series of experiments, but because it is similar to alfalfa in composition, though somewhat lower in protein, it would not be unreasonable to expect good gains on eon and clover: and experiments made in other states show favorable results for this com - bination of foods. With any other form of roughness with the exception of cowpea hay, which is also a legume, we would hardly expect satisfac - tory gains unless some protein concentrate is fed with corn. THE ISE OF CORN-STOVEK WITH CORN AND ALFALFA From the experiments already described it is apparent that a ration of corn and alfalfa is capable of producing large and profitable gains, enough so to make corn bring more in the form of beef than as a cash crop.

A ration consisting of corn und alfalfa is often too laxathe, especially wth the later cuttings of alfalfa. In the first experiment it is very probable that the stover lessened the tendency to scour, while in the second experiment the pres - ence of husk and cob served the same purpose. There may have been also some advantage in having stover with alfalfa for variety. In this connection it may be said that prairie hay will answer these purposes, but prairie hay ordinarily costs as much as alfalfa, so there is but little adantage in using it. In both the experiments tabulated above, the use of corn-stover at $2.50 per ton as half the roughness reduced the cost of gains — in the first 40 cents per hundred, and in the second 48 cents. The stover proved to be actually worth $3.55 per ton with snapped corn and $4.1f&gt; per ton with shelled corn, worth :19 cents per bushel, as com - pared with alfalfa fed alone at $&lt;i per ion. Nebraska produced last year, in round numbers, eight million tons of corn-stover. If one-fourth of this amount could have been converted into beef, bringing but $2.50 per ton as fed from the shock instead of 50 cents in the stalk fields, four millions of dollars could have been added to our earnings, and no losses from cornstalk disease would have come from feeding the stalks thus harvested. ■_&gt;4 we« 12 weeks. experiments.

Had the average cost of the linseed-meal been *45 or more per ton for the three years, there would have been no advantage in using it. PROTEIN CONCENTRATES COMPARED Having shown the importance of using with corn and prairie hay a small quantity of some protein concentrate, in this case linseed-meal, we next compare three protein foods commonly sold in Nebraska, viz., wheat bran, linseed-meal and cottonseed-meal. Gluten feed, a by-product in the manufacture of starch, glucose, etc., from corn, would have been included in these tests If the cost of freight from eastern factories were not si;"h ar to make the price of this food prohibitive for stock feeding purposes hrre. Just as soon as starch and glucose are manufactured in quantity in this section, gluten feed will no doubt become a formid - able competitor of the protein foods mentioned. Owing to the lower protein content of wheat bran, this food was made 22 per cent of the grain ration, whereas linseed-meal and cottonseed-meal were each made in per cent of the grain ration. It will be noted in the table to follow that the basic part of each ration in the first pxperiment was corn and ptairie hay. while in the second it was corn and corn-stover. </seg>

Several steers in the bran lot became more or less rheumatic or stiff. This was also observed both winters, but it was more pronounced in the second trial. No doubt these difficulties were partly responsible for the unsatisfactory gains on corn and bran, as no other lots were similarly affected. The bran put on the market today is apparently less valuable than formerly, no doubt because of its high crude fibre content due to modern methods of milling, which effect a more complete extraction of the valuable portions of the wheat kernel. While cottonseed-meal Is slightly higher in protein than linseed-meal, the latter gave the larger gains in both these experiments, though the difference was not great.

From these figures It is apparent that alfalfa possesses a high value as a source of protein. The experiments furthermore suggest that a relatively small quantity of this hay will supply sufficient protein t insure good gains on two-year-old steers, and that this can be pro - ed on the farm much cheaper than it can be purchased on the market the form of linseed-meal or some other protein concentrate.

In the third comparison, without a protein food, the stover returned a value of but $2.77 compared with prairie hay at $6, which smaller value is perhaps attributable to the lower protein content of stover. As already stated, not more than 60 per cent of the stover charged to the steers fed in theee experiments was consumed, the remainder consisting of refuse butts which had to be thrown out for bedding. The stover actually consumed would seem to possess a feeding value quite the equal of prairie hay. Inas - much as corn-stover contains only 60 per cent dry matter, while prairie hay is approximately 90 per cent, it would seem conservative to say also that the dry matter of the entire cornstalk with ear detached, cut immediately after the corn ripens and properly cured in shock, is equal to the dry matter of prairie hay ■ RELATIVE ECONOMY OP A HEAVY AND LIGHT RATION OP CORN. rie experiments so far conducted and reported in these pages Indl - that beef can be produced most economically in Nebraska by the &gt;f corn, alfalfa, and corn-stover. It would seem proper to next determine, if possible, what proportion of corn to such roughness Is most economical. Corn has ruled high in price during the part few years, while roughness of all kinds has remained relatively low In value nntil the last year, when hay has been abnormally high because the dry weather which prevailed throughout the country during the early part of the summer caused a shortage in this crop, the effect of which will no doubt be but temporary. The cost of hauling and ship - ping hay and other bulky feed is such as to make It seem probable that the price of roughness on our Nebraska farms, many of them situated some distance from stations, will not advance with corn In the future. Beef cattle in the west are ordinarily fed all the grain they will con - sume, very commonly by the use of self-feeders, having before them what rough feed Is needed to satisfy the craving for bulk. The latter is often of very Inferior quality, perhaps a stack of wheat straw, and a very limited quantity is consumed. That a good quality of roughness can be made to take the place of a part of the corn is shown by the following single experiment conducted the past winter: </seg>

Judging from the results of the above pvnorimont ng from the results of the above experiment it is probable that the most economical proportion of grain to hay under P conditions will be found somewhere between a half feed and eed of grain. Nothing definite, however, will be known until veral tests are made in which different quantities of grain are THE 19O6-'O7 EXPERIMENTS.

This would have been true also if the corn had cost 50 cents per bushel instead of 35 cents, figuring the alfalfa at $8. This experiment empha- sizes further the value of alfalfa as a beef producer, and it opens a new and important field for future investigation. The record made by the light fed cattle was no accident, as another lot in a corn fodder experiment made very nearly as large gains on the same grain ration. No conclusions, however, are to be drawn until after further tests along this line are made. As a sinsle experiment it suggests the possibility of producing beef most economically on what approaches a full grain feed when corn is low in price and alfalfa high. When corn is high </seg>

They were in what would be considered good grass flesh when purchased, and no doubt would have sold at top values for feeder steers had they been sent to marked. These steers cost $4 per hundred at the ranch and were weighed after having been yanied twenty four hours without feed and water. The steers were shipped during the time of the severe October snowstorm and the shrinkage was very heavy. This shrinkage with the freight across the state and the expense of three weeks' preliminary feeding made the steers cost net November 14. on the initial weights of the experiment, 4.58 cents per hundred as given in the Financial Statement to follow. All steers were yarded at the Experiment Station October 2G, 190fi. and given a liberal feed of hay and but little grain. Owing to the fact that they had never been fed grain it was necessary to sprinkle corn - meal over the hay in order to get them started. They immediately acquired a fondness for corn-meal and a few days later for shelled and •^napped corn, the feed being increased from one pound of meal per the first day to four pounds of shelkd and snapped corn per day by the end of the first week. November 2. By November 14. when the records of the experiment wore begun, the steers in lots 2 and 3 were each receiving 7.8 pounds of snapped corn in the morning and 6 pounds of the mixture of shelled corn and linseed- or cottonseed-meal at night, the equivalent of 12 pounds of grain per day. Owing to the bulky character of bran, which formed about one-fourth of that ration, lot 1 was purposely given a little larger feed of grain to make the quantity of corn correspond more nearly to that fed lots 2 and 3. which received linseed- and cottonseed-meal, forming but in per cent of the daily grain ration. On December 12 Ihe ten steers in lot 1 received 14fi pounds of snapped corn in the morning and S4 pounds of shelled corn and 55 Eof bran at night. The ten in lot 2 received 14f&gt; pounds snapped the morning and S9 pounds shelled corn and 22 pounds of meal at night. Lot 3 received the same ration except that cot - meal was substituted for linseed-meal. On that date, therefore, each steer in lots 2 and 3 was receiving the equivalent of 19.8 pounds of shelled corn and 2.2 pounds of the linseed- or cottonseed-meal, while each steer in lot 1 received the equivalent of 19.3 pounds of shelled corn and 5.5 pounds of bran. Lot 4 was fed the same quantity as lots 2 and 3, the grain being corn alone. These four lots were given all the grain they would consume during the last three months of the experi - ment, an average of about 25 pounds to each steer per day. Lots 5 and 6 were never increased beyond 14 pounds of corn per day. They con - sumed much more roughness, however, as their record indicates. The results of one experiment with these steers in which wheat bran, linseed-meal and cottonseed-meal were compared are published </seg>

The steers in lot 6, the financial statement of which follows, were also fed six months on the same quantity of grain supplied lot 5.

The part usually consumed, viz., the leaves anj upper portion of stalk, is quite the equal of prairie hay pound for pound. P.

From a commercial point of view the results of this entire series experiments go to show that cattle feeding can be made profitable when discretion is used in the selection of foods for the ration. On the average farm in Nebraska where grain and hay command figures below Lincoln prices and where cattle are undisturbed by frequent weighings which experimental feeding necessitates, the profits can be made much greater than those reported in this bulletin. Good feeding will make our corn bring more as beef than when sold direct to the elevator companies even tho the selling price of finished cattle is not far in advance of cost price as was true in many of the these experiments. The importance of manure and the growing of alfalfa and clover as agencies contributing to the maintenance and increase of laud fertility argue further for this mole of selling a larger part of our annual corn crop.

            <seg id="p184">181 HIE SELECTION AND CARE OF BKOOD SOWS. BY E. W. HUNT E primary purpose of this paper is to offer a few helpful suggestions verage farmer in the state of Nebraska who is raising hogs exclu - ir the market. At the outset permit me to lay down some general as governing the economic production of pork. It should be the aim of every farmer to get the greatest product at the least expense. Here is where most Nebraska farmers will have to introduce a change in their method of doing business. Hitherto they have been occupied prin - cipally in getting the great product without paying particular attention to the expense to which they have gone in getting that product. It is not too much to say that the average farmer in Nebraska has no definite ade - quate notion of the expense to which he has been put in raising his stock. Competition has become so keen, the price of land and of farm products has advanced to such a figure, that in the future it will be necessary for the farmer to keep as close watch of the expense attending production as E receipts when bis product is placed on the market. And it is with of helping the farmer to get the greatest product at the least ; that these suggestions are offered. It costs less to put a good hog on the market than it does to put a scrub of equal weight there. A good hog is one that uses its food to increase its weight, assimilates it perfectly, and lays on flesh rapidly. A scrub is a hog which, for various reasons, does not possess this capacity. Obviously, then, the good hog is a greater money maker than the scrub. The greatest profit in raising pork comes from forcing pigs to an early market at a weight not to exceed 225 pounds. If one has a hog that weighs 225 pounds and he wishes to add a hundred pounds to its weight, that last hundred pounds will cost him nearly double what any other hun - dred pounds in the hog has cost him. There is this additional reason for forcing spring pigs to an early market — that, with corn and other food products at the price which they now command in the market, the farmer cannot afford to feed the elements, to feed the weather, and so should strive by all means to get his pigs upon the market before the severe winter weather sets in. For this forcing to an early market plenty of clover or alfalfa pasture is indispensable. If I could not have plenty of such pasture I should go out of the hog business. It was said to me once when I made this statement: "We raised hogs in Nebraska before either alfalfa or clover were heard of, and I guess we can do it again." Yes, but it is one thing to raise hogs on land worth $1.25 an acre and corn worth nine cents a bushel, and an entirely different thing to raise hogs on land worth from $75 to $100 an acre and with corn worth fifty cents </seg>
            <seg id="p185">182 NEBRASKA STATE HOARD OF AUKK'I is possible to put hops on the market at three cents per pound and still derive a profit from the transaction. Of course, in case clover or alfalfa are impossible, the hog raiser must, by some means, procure their equiva - lent in food stuffs. But I fear that it will not be possible to do this profitably, with food stuffs at their present high market price. Bis a law of Nature that like produces like — not always, but gen - ■: and it is because farmers are beginning to appreciate this fact, :o know the relative certainty with which this law operates, that are beginning to be careful in the selection of their seed corn, and to only the lest, ptampest. heaviest, best matured corn for seed, though some of us still select oi:r seed corn in the nla-fashionej way, at the corn crib with a scoop shovel. It is because farmers are beginning that like produces like that they are beginning to be careful in the i&lt;it» of their si ed potatoes, and the wisest of them select only the most marketable potatoes for seed, though of course a great many are still planting little potatoes as used to be the general custom, cnizing that like produces like, the dairy farmer will not keep for a milch cow the heifer calf of a cow that does not pay for her keep. He will select only the heifer ca!v»s of such cows as return him great profit, an.l send the rest of them to market. The wisdom of this course of action, having l.wn demonstrated through a series of years, is beginning to le appreciated hy most of the farmers of this state. All that 1 ask is that every breeder of hogs shall make the selection of his breeding stock so as to take advantage of the operation of this law. What the farmer should do should be to fix steadily in mind that type of hog which he wishes to raise, to keep it dearly in mind, and hold it constantly and i!y there. The man who changes his notion of the desired type year, will never get anywhere with his breeding. Haxing fixed in mind the type of hog which he wishes to raise, this idea of the type will ■ii him in the selection of his breeding stock, or at least should so govern him. For reasons which 1 will state more fully later on, 1 believe that every brood sow. while she is caring for her farrow, should have a separate pen. This will enable a farmer to make the proper selection. The average farmer, when he selects his hroo.l sows, waits until the approach of the breeding season and then selects from his general herd the thriftiest, growthiest, most vigorous gilts that he can find. The man who does this knows nothing of the maternal ancestry of the hog so selected. This one particular growthy gilt may be the one sizable pig in a litter of scrubs produced by a scrub sow, and in breeding her the chances are that her offspring will revert to the scrub type from which she sprung. At the state farm there is a shorthorn cow, celebrated throughout the state, by the name of Florence. She is of a distinct dairy type, and yet comes from a long line of breeding of pure beef type. They have at - tempted, through her calves, to intensify the dairy characteristics, but </seg>
            <seg id="p186">183 THE SELECTION ANI&gt; PARK OF BROOD SOWS Florence is what might be called a freak in breeding, because the law that like produces like occasionally fails, and Florence is an instance of such failure. The big. growthy. vigorous gilt that you select from your her,! may be another failure. More than this, in selecting the biggest. growthiest. most vigorous gilts for man so selecting selects sows from a small litter of two or three can do the sow that has a large litter, that better advantage, and in breeding th ■reeding, the chalices are that the small litter, because a sow with a io much better by them than can her pigs in the fall will show to m there is danger of perpetuating the breeding of small litter sows. 1 think the best time to select brood sows is before they are four weeks old. When the pigs approach that age. let the owner get over into the pen with the sow and ask himself, with reference to her. four questions: First, is she of the right shape. Is she built in such a way as to pro.Juce for me the kind of pigs that I want to raise? The side, the back, the loin, the hams, are the expen sivp and desirable cuts in pork, and the hog that excels in these particu - lars Is usually the most economical feeder to be found. I want my brood sow to have a liberal arch to her back, because this arch, sooner or later, will have to sustain the weight of a large litter of pigs, and unless it is strong it will become, first, flat, and later, swayback, indicating a weakness in the back, which I Jo not want to characterize my herd of hogs I want her under line to run out straight between the hind legs, and her flank instead of being cut high, to be cut low, so as to give great depth between the loins and the flank, because here is the part of the bo,ly where she must develop and nourish a large litter of pigs, and there should be plenty of room for this purpose. When a straight stick is applied to the side of a hog it should touch all along. There should be no place, for instance, behind the shoulders where a person might place his hand between the stick and the body. The rea - son of this is that the hog should have a large heart and lung girth, because here are the vital organs where the sow must vitalize arid purify i ho Hood, not only for herself, but for the young that she is developing, and there should le plenty of room for the exercise of these vital organs. Whenever you see a hog stand with its hin.1 legs thrust forward under it, it is a sure sign of weakness in the pastern joint and in the pastern ligaments, and. as the hog gets older and its weight increases, it will begin to walk more and more upon the heel as the pastern becomes weaker and weaker. I want the hind legs of my brood sows to stand squarely unJer them, and the sow herself to stand upon the tips of her toes. This is sure proof of strength in the limbs, and a sow must be strong in the legs because she must take plenty of exercise in order to develop a healthy, growthy litter of pigs, and a sow that is weak in the legs will not exercise any more than a man will take long walks for his health when the bottoms of his feet are covered with callouses and corns. For the same reason the fore legs should stand squarely under the hog and the hog should walk on the tips of the toes. It is not necessary to </seg>
            <seg id="p187">184 any man may follow out as best he can. II want the hog's head to look as though the hog knew something, and though it had some force, some power in it, and this would imply •t ears, a large open eye, plenty of breadth between the eyes, and a ral dish to the face. Now if the sow that he is examining answers to these requirements the best of any hog that he owns, that is one point to be considered. F second question he should ask. and it is one the answer to which d almost as important as the first, is. has she the right disposi- When I get into the pen does she receive me with a friendly grunt, or does she begin to argue and rage, and her hair to stand up along her back, and does she begin to run around the pen in all directions trampling on her pigs and perhaps picking up one in her mouth? Experience has taught me that it usually costs more to put the pigs of one of these hysterical sows upon the market than they are worth. The sow that I select for a brood sow must be of a calm, phlegmatic temperament. She must be careful of her pigs. It has cost me money to bring those pigs into the world, arl.l I cannot afford to have them killed by an ignorant, careless mother. If one of her pigs is in trouble and squealing, instead of lying still and allowing it to die, as some sows do, my brood sow must get up and investigate and find out what is the matter. When she approaches her nest to lie down, she must be very careful to root her pigs out of the way and lie down carefully in such a way as not to hurt any of them. This matter of disposition is just as E"i a question of selection ia breeding as any other characteristic in a and I believe that any breeder, by paying careful attention to it, can is herd entirely of these nervous, irritable, unprofitable sows. Pie third question to be asked is, does she farrow a large enough ? I do not believe that it pays to keep a brood sow that farrows two or three pigs at a litter. The fourth question, dors she feed her litter well? There is a great .lifference in sows, some of them give an abundance of milk in which there is practically no nourishment, others .nourish their pigs adequately. As I am attempting to force her pigs to an early market, the sow must aid me in this, and provide adequate nourishment for her young. The pigs by this time are about four weeks old, and any breeder may judge from the looks of his pigs whether their nourishment is adequate. If their hair lies smooth and they are glossy and fat, if after feeding they lie down and go to sleep and sleep so soundly that you think they are dead, it is sure proof that they are being adequately nourished. But if their hair stands up. is rough in appearance and has no gloss, an.l the twhen she walks across a field has three or four pigs hanging to her, the rest squealing for food, and if her litter are tugging away at from morning to night, it is sure proof that they are not being ade- </seg>

Now whenever a sow answers all of these four questions affirmatively, if she has the right shape, the right disposition, the right size litter, and feeds them properly, put a mark on the ear of every one of her sow pigs, and they are the brood sows for the next year. In this way go through the entire herd. It takes only a short time — very little time and no trouble, to mark the brood sows for the ensuing season. When breeding time comes all that is necessary is to cut out the sow pigs that have a mark on their ears, for brood sows, anJ while you may not be able to say of any particular pig that it comes from any particular sow, you can say of every pig that has a mark in its ear, that this pig comes from a sow that had the right shape, had the right disposition, had the right sized litter, "a-nJ 'fed them 'right." By "following thfs~method of rtion through a series of years, any farmer can breed any kind of a he desires to raise. I it a few words with reference to the selection of the male which lead the herd. By all means see the hog before buying. Become nted with the characteristics of your own brood sows, and then a male which, when bred to those brood sows, will be likely to :e the kind of hog you want to raise. Too many farmers in the buy their breeding stock by pedigree, without carefully selecting them. I had rather have a good hog without a pedigree, than to have the pedigree without a good hog. All that a pedigree is worth to me and I believe all that it is worth to anyone, is simply to prove that the points of excellence in the pedigreed animal are the result of a long line of breeding, and are therefore likely to be permanent, and to be repro - duced in the get. Any breeder of pure bred hogs is lucky if, out of a dozen pigs, he can get one that can answer closely enough to the score card to make a show animal of him, and this is evidence that something beside pedigree is needed for the man who would be a successful breeder. Study tht characteristics of your brood sows and select a boar that will correct their defects in their pigs. If the sows are inclined to be a little flat along the back, select a I oar with a liberal arch to his back, and the pigs will show the improvement. If the sows are a little leggy, have too much daylight under, them, select a l&gt;oar that is moderately close to the ground. If the sows are light in the hams, or are coarse, broad, and high in the shoulder, select a boar of the opposite type. Always select a boar with special reference to the type of sows that you have. When you find such ati one, and it will pay you well to spend time and money to find him, if he has a good pedigree, so much the better, for then he will probably mark his pigs as you want them marked. There are several points to be considered with regard to the proper care of the brood sow. In the first place, she should have adequate pro- </seg>
            <seg id="p189">186 warm and dry in order to thrive. For these reasons 1 do not like a board floor in the farrowing pen because draughts of cold air get under the door and chill an.l otherwise weaken the pigs. 1 am also opposed to a cement floor in the farrowing pen, because the moisture and vapor from the hogs condense on this cement floor and keep it moist and cold. The best floor for a farrowing pen that I know anything about is made of dirt, built up six inches above the surrounding ground, over the top of which woven wire netting, with a mesh not larger than two inches, is tightly drawn. A few shovels of dirt are thrown on top of this wire netting to bed it firmly and over this is put the litter for bedding. Here we have a floor which will always be dry, which is winj proof, and which the hogs cannot root up. The walls of the shed should be made practi - cally wind and moisture proof. It is estimated that sixty per cent of the that are farrowed in the state, about straw piles, or in old piles of roughage, or wherever it is possible for the sow to make a farrowing nest. This sixty per cent, if saved, would build adequate shelter for all the brood sows in the state. It is had economy, it is waste, not to provide such shelter. lu the next place, the food of the brood sow requires special attention. You are asking her to Jevelop tor you a large litter of thrifty, muscular, I « » 1 1 &gt; pigs, and she must have food out of which she can make muscle and bone. If this is not furnished her, so strong is her spirit of ratty that she will rob her own body to get it. You cannot make gold out of paper, and you must not expect a sow to make muscle and bone out of fat, it cannot be done. The farmer who expects to make money in raising hogs, an.l who adheres to the old notion that corn is the only natural food for a hog, must inevitably fail. In ten pounds of corn there is only one pound of muscle and bone forming food, and nine pounds of fat forming food, and this is not sufficient muscle anJ bone forming food to enable the sow to do her work profitably and well. Brood mows should be fed all that they will eat of alfalfa hay, with only a limite.l corn ration, enough to supply them with animal heat and make animal energy. The principal part of their food should be muscle and bone forming food, and alfalfa, in this state, is the cheapest and best food for that purpose. In my experience I find, however, that the hog's stomach being small, she cannot hold sufficient alfalfa hay to provide an adequate protein ration, and accordingly I have found it an advan - tage to supplement the alfalfa with an added protein ration. Every farmer on studying that requirement must determine for himself which is the most economical food to buy; it may be shorts, it may be oil - meal, or it may be tankage. But if tankage is used, I think the average farmer would get better results by feeding no more than five pounds of tankage to every one hundred pounds of corn fed, in addition to all the alfalfa hay that the brood sow can eat.

P farrowing time comes, each sow should he isolated in her in - quarters two or three days before the actual time for the farrow - •s on her. At this time she is likely to be nervous and excitable, or three days will get her accustomed to her new quarters so may rest there at ease. When farrowing time comes, my advice •dinary farmer is to leave the sow alone. There is such a dif - n the length of time required for farrowing by the sows, some and some fast, that I ,lo not think that any farmer should interfere to assist the sow unless such interference is absolutely neces - sary to save the sow's life, and then it should be gone about very gently and very slowly, because an ignorant, careless operator is liable to inflict lasting injuries on the delicate organs. But if the sow has been properly fed up to the farrowing time. I do not think that anyone need apprehend any trouble with the farrowing. Since I began feeding in this way I have haJ to pay as little attention to my brood sows in farrowing as to my hens in laying. I let them alone and have had absolutely no trouble whatever. After the farrowing is completed the handling of the sow should be conducted with a view solely to having the milk, when it comes in full flow, come slowly and easily, without any complications whatever. The now at that time is weak and nervous and is susceptible to almost any kind of a shock. If she is expose ,1 to the inclemency of the weather, if a cold wind is permitted to strike her. or if after the farrowing you are careless enough to give her a drink of cold water or cold slop, you may give her a shock which will produce a chill and consequent congestion. In the morning you go out to the pen and you fin.1 the little fellows all bunched up in one corner shivering and trying to keep warm, and in the other corner you will find the sow lying flat upon her udder, sick. She is in pain, the shock of the cold water or the cold blast of air has produce.) a congestion of the udder, and the milk has stopped, and the row is in misery. When the pigs finally come to nurse they will have to drink this fevered milk, and a pig that has drunk fevered milk never gets over it. He shows it as long as he lives. I advise, as soon as the nw shows that she wants anything, that she be given a drink of warm water, and nothing else for the first twenty-four hours. For th« secend twenty-four hours I give her warm water an.l just a little dry corn. My purpose is to control and retard lactation until the time arrives for the full flow of milk, and the best way to govern this is through the feed, and warm water and dry corn are not lactating foods. The third day she has warm water an,i dry corn again, and if you have been careful and judicious in your feeding of corn, on the fourth day you will go out </seg>

From this time until weaning time the sow should be fed solely for the purpose of milk production. ■ You want her to force her litter of pigs to as rapid healthy growth as possible. It is not your purpose to fatten the sow. Her sole business now is to furnish adequate nourishment to her young:, and you begin to feed her solely for milk production, succu - lent rations, slop, muscle and bone forming; foods, with only a modicum of corn. You should gradually increase your food as the pigs are able to stand it, but the sow should not be put upon full- feed until the pigs are about four weeks old. This is where the necessity for individual pens for the sows becomes apparent. In one pen you may have a sow that will take all the food that you can give her and still will not over - feed her pigs. In the pen adjoining her. you may have a sow fed on half the ration that will still overfeed her pigs, because she is a very liberal milker. The sig^ns of overfeeding in pigs are two, thumps and scours. You go out In the morning and you find the pigs thumping, some of them. The reason is this: they have taken into their little stomachs more food than they can digest, and the undigested balance lies there and ferments and develops large quantities of gas. The stomach becomes distende.l with this gas. and presses against the heart, which is closely contiguous, and interferes with the heart action so that the heart has to pump blood over the little body against the pressure of this inflated stomach, and you can see it thump in its efforts properly to perform its work. When I ffnd such a condition of affairs I open the door and let the sow out away from the pigs, and she does not see the pigs again until their little stomachs have become fully emptied. In the meantime she is put upon a ration of water and dry corn to retard milk flow. If the sow while carrying the pigs was fed largely on a fat form - ing diet, the muscular tissues of the pigs are liable to be loose, flabby, weak, and unable to endure much strain. The heart muscles of such pigs are liable to be tnflltrated with fat, or to undergo a fatty degeneration. When such pigs begin to thump, the muscular fibers are liable to give way. producing hypertrophy of the heart. Such a pig is a hopeless case and might better be killed. But when a sow has been properly nour - ished, little danger is to be apprehended from thumps, if the right action is promptly taken. I have never lost a pig from thumps. Sometimes shotes when first put upon a full corn ration begin to thump. If such are promptly isolate.1, and all food and most of the water is kept from them, they will usually quickly recover without suffering any serious set - back. The same treatment I observe when I see signs of scours. Scours are nearly always caused by some form of Indigestion from overfeeding. When the sow is finally admitted back to her farrow her milk flow has been retarded, the little fellows' digestive tract has been cleare.l, and </seg>

The best food for this purpose is milk in which has been mixed a little shorts. ThU will relieve the sow of a part of the drain on her system In the nourish - ment of the pip?, and will assist in the growth of the pigs. It is best to wean the pigs when they are two months old. but wean them slowly. By this time they have been, or should have been, running four weeks on alfalfa pasture with their mothers. Some morning when they start for the pasture, let the sows find the gate closed, but with a creep under it to permit the pigs to go out. Outside let the little pigs find a trough full of nourishing, appetizing food, and they will fill themselves up on it and then start, as usual, for the alfalfa pasture. The sows are retained in a dry lot. an.l their ration suddenly changed to an exclusive dry corn and water diet, which has a tendency to check the flow of milk. After a while you will hear that peculiar gnint which you hare so often heard from the sow. and the little pigs will hear it : and they know what it means, and they will come tumbling over one another, squealing for their breakfast — the old sow wants to be milked. They push under the creep, the sow throws herself upon her side, and the little fellows commence business, hut they have to give it up in about two minutes. They are already full from the trough and from the alfalfa, and have to suspend operations owing to the lack of capacity. If this plan is followed, in a week or ten days the sow will have dried completely up. and the pigs will have been weaned without either of them knowing that any change has taken place. In the old fashioned way, the pigs, who were used to nursing a half dozen times a day, were taken su.ldenly away from the sows, very suddenly depriving them of the milk which had been their principal article of diet, producing a digestive shock from which they are slow to recover. The sows, who have been in full flow of milk, are deprived of the means of relieving themselves, and for hours suffer unutterable agony from milk pressure. The breeder is fortunate who does not have serious complications with the ud.iers of sows that are so treated. The more humane, and the more profitable way. is the way that I have above suggested, and I nope that every breeder In the state will try it and satisfy himself as to its economy and Its humanity. Efter the pigs are weaned they may he fe.l a limited corn ration with ■ alfalfa, for a few weeks, and then If corn Is short they may be left •ely to the alfalfa pasture. I believe, however, tliat It Is good omy to feed a limited corn ration to the pigs that are running on alfalfa, but sometimes farmers do not have the corn, and so I say It is possible to get along without it. </seg>

Many farmers fin.I it more profitable to market their sows .on as they can be made ready for market, and to depend entirely on their gills for brood sows for the following season. By so doing they 'he expense of feed till the next breeding season, and this is no small item, as age,! sows require and consume a liberal ration. It is freely admitted that mature sows generally farrow more pigs and better pigs, other things liping equal, than gilts. Whether the improvement in the farrow is sufficient to counterbalance the extra expense of feed, every breeder must determine for himself. Much will depend on the care that the gilts receive.

Many hogs die from lung diseases superinduced from breathing too much dust. Keep free from worms in the digestive tract. Many hogs suffer from diseases superinduced by the irritation of intestinal parasites. It is said that an ounce of prevention is usually worth a pound of cure, and a farmer cannot take too much care in balancing his ration properly tor his bogs, and in keeping them clean, and surrounding them with the very mitary precautions. Some people seem to have the notion that filth Is natural and health - ful for a hog. and that tbev thrive best under unclean oonditfonss. On the contrarv. no animal will show greater or quicker improvement aris - ing from cleanliness than the hog.

Those who have had practical experience with the tiig mellow fellows need not lie prompted, but the breeders of the east who have for trs ridden in Die rut of the smaller fancy kind, would learn what how it came to be. Its originating is but the outcome of evolution of type that has been in progress in Nebraska and Kansas for seven These states peculiarly have demanded a different type of hog than was in existence to grow and fatten upon their diversified foodstuff: Kvenls in agricultural livestock and history transpire rapidly in the west It is not the habit of westerners to travel beaten paths. They are men ut' .meat and almost unlimited undertakings, ofttimes one man operating areas practically equal to that of a county in eastern slates, as one farm producing wheat, corn, cattle, horses and hogs, and profit is the imp.. and if a certain thing doesn't pay they wont raise it; they mood grow to know the I.est seed wheat, the most productive corn, and the most profitable type of horses, catile and hogs. It is their business to do so; success attends if they practice it and failure if they don't, so this question of type has become practically the most important of all. The great west is lull of hogs, and has been for years — good ones, too, market toppers, anywhere. But we are progressive, we wanted better and adapted to our uses and environments. It was not for one man to say what the future ty]&gt;e of hog should be, nor for a few men to make or create it, but many men and many minds, with the pressure of nature, of food-stuffs and of markets behind them, worked away at the evolution of type Farmers demanded of the breeders something different, something more profitable, something fitted especially to grow and fatten on western farms. How well they have succeeded is well known. Nebraska and Kansas stand close to the top in numbers of hogs, and produce more hogs for market t proportion to numbers of brood sows than any other states. They nish the market toppers and the meats for the best bran. invented by packers for bacons, hams, etc.; and, incidentally, the hog raisers of the great west have made more and quicker money than anbo.ly else on the globe, in the same business.

With a lifetime of experience we believe the future will be of more uniformity, and a much better and more rapid producer of better mt-ats and dollars of value than the best of ours today. All along through our life - time we have noted the many happenings that have transpired in the hog making history — some things to the good, and some things to the bad; but in the end, mostly to the advancement of the breeds. We have found that no one man or set of men can establish or fasten a certain type or I upon any section, the laws of fitness and profitableness eventually win and it seen:s that today we are but standing upon the edge of a new era in this hog business. The hog men of the near future will look ba«k and wonder how we "old fossils" made money with the hogs we ha.i, and the way we fed and marketed them. So out here in the land where farm - ing pays the highest per cent on the investment, with land values going up almost to the blue sky, and labor scarce and high, we are and have compelled by our experience of the past and the needs of the present and future to produce the most profitable type, and the many years of experimenting and breeding have filled our breeding pens with it. and we are not only filling the demands of our close neighbors, but even unto the "effete east." It was -not a single night's pi)&gt;e dream and the awakening proclamation of the morning of the finding of a many thousand dollar king or queen or of a Moses in the bull-rushes. Our business has been more of a manual nature an.l not from the "picturesque" or "literary" point, and our appreciation goes further for a good individual right liefore our eyes, than for the mechanical illusions so profusely set to song and verse by tongue and ink. by those who are working the "hot mir" methods overtime.

Sometimes the self conceit and pride of seeing their own names and faces appearing often in public print ami places has more allurement to some people than does the business they are engaged in. and in this day everybody seems to be looking for the short way or cut to make money and the hog business has this affliction.

They do not seem content to get money slow or to build up the reputations of their herd or selves in common with other breeders, hut put in working all plausible schemes to enhance and boost the values of the certain individual hogs owned by them, and enter into all sorts of com - binations to bring atiout sales and to secure results on sales that place a price on their stuff, mostly ninety per cent fictitious and ten per cent real, and. if they are successful, good talkers and advertising managers, they pent-rally succeed in getting enough cash out of the chain of d?als and transactions to repay them for the efforts expended. This class of breeders in the main are in the end. more detrimental to a breed than the cheap breeder who sells $10.nfl hogs or the farmers who swap pigs an - nually. They, figuratively speaking, are as flies, attracted by the smell of food-stuffs on the dinner table: "Here is something sweet, something nice, these men are eating. Let us get into it and have some, too," and to the "old line" breeders they are just as welcome. K. if we want to raise hogs for mere fancy and pleasure alone, an.l as a greater demand for "parlor stand ornaments." and "pretty ," and sweet names, and if the business got so fashionable that demanded it, of course we would have to adopt the score card, as revised by the Illinois State Swine Breeders, which raised the points of ears, eyes, neck, jowl, coat and cut down the points of hams, sides, backs, loins, ribs, etc. Now. it seems it's the looks of the hog that goes with them, not how he is built. So society back east must surely de - light in pickle&gt;1 snouts, toasted ears, canned eyes, and min^e meat, and have placed a ban on hams, bacon, tenderloins, etc. Now. rest assured, had we the demands for a type of a hog that produces such meats, we western fellows would have it abundantly in the highest state of per - fection. But we have a demand directly to the contrary, and it's for th*. general utility kind — the hog of general usefulness and a cutter of lots of high priced meats.

Now. did you ever, fellow breeder, receive an order for the smallest. prettiest, sweetest little-boned pig you ever raised? No! It's generally for size. bone, gravity, etc. It's generally known, it's imi&gt;ossil&gt;le to get bushels into peck measures, an.l you cannot substitute an image for the real thing. And again, to change the type of a herd it takes time. Tis not "Presto, change!" as many of our breeders would fain have us to I?. No, Mr. Eastern lireeder. just the changing of printers' type change the hogs in a day. You will have to breed it. get some blood ay by it.

There is one thing sure, it's for the survival of the fittest, and that the farmer, the i&gt;ork producer, the consumer and the packer seem to be behind the general utility hog movement, and it's mostly the ones who would "help save our ship," that favor the "boom-fancy, little type." We l'oland-C hina men are not alone in this type question and we are also criticised by others. Hear what Mr. N. H. Gentry, who is probably the greatest breeder of the Berkshires in the world says in regard to the I'oland-Ohinas. "Why some of the Poland-China breeders are led away by the 'fa.is and fancies' is hard to understand. I refer to the pretty, little dimpling type, some of them having a middle not longer than one's hand, after the ham and shoulder are cut off. In fad. 1 am a firm believer in the long, even hog; and again 1 repeat, 1 believe that the middle of a hog from top to Iwttom is the most valuable part of the hog. I believe enough breeders and judges have yielded to this fad' idea as to lower the average quality of the breed." Now. gentlemen, how does it sound to yon? If Gentry is wrong, God pity the rest of us. There is also too much stress placed on pedigree anil not individuality </seg>
            <seg id="p200">197 fJ &gt; •• penigree is secondary to individuality, and when it ? to extremes for pedigree it spells "ruination" to the breed. The of sires and dams produre bark numbers, and even if they are sired Tom Corwin. Chief Tecumseh II. Chief Perfection II. or any great sire, does not insure excellence or that they are worth hundreds or thousands of dollars. Lots of these are only fit for the market. As to the many thousand dollared hogs some have been worth it, and there is fme to come that will be, but there is only a handful of hogs that am &gt;rth it in a man's life time, and it would take a committee some time fill out a list of a .lozen in number, starting from the first recorded, that could safely belong to the $5,000 class, while to read a few papers and catalogues it would seem that we had suddenly arrived at the 'Zenith of perfection," and that it is impossible to produce a hog any more (if he has not a pe.iigree) worth less than a thousand or so. This is too happy to be true, and when you awaken from your dream you will find that the men who operate the business on these plans are generally wise enough to gather 'hay while the sun shines." and are safely in the dry when the down-pour comes. If they don't they know the "boomerang" will get them, and how well they fear it. It is very noticeable now by the calls to "stand by the guns; pay at least one-fourth cash, hold this thing up, boys till I can cash in. Now I bought of you fellows, please come buy of me, etc." The breakers are just ahead. There seems to be two ways of watering hog stock— one for the hogs wants; the other for the wants of the owner; either way will work all right, if it is 100 per cent pure, for a hog won't burst on good water, and the hog business won't burst on a cash basis. So, generally speak - ing, the western hog men do not view the future with fear and trembling, as have several of our "fancier breeders," many of whom have been seem - ingly created over night and lauded by pages of pictures and master - pieces of literary efforts as peers and pastmasters in their line. There seems to be one thing that we Nebraska hogmen have not mastered, ts the "high financiering." We have plodded in the same old way— buying and selling for cash; so when the call is made for the Jollar we know it doesn't mean us, and when it is begged that the purchasers should at least pay twenty-five per cent in cash, surely we don't want it that way - out here. Please. Mr. Fancy Hogman, let us western fellows keep up old customs of paying around 100 per cent cash or its equivalent, we know sure we Jon't get $5.non, $K.ooo, $7,000 or $8,000 for single hogs that but what we do get goes "quite a way" and keeps us well content. In this day and age there seemingly are lots of games and grafts, and some - times men get the game and graft and sometimes it gets him. and as we note the recent panic on Wall street, we should judge the latter happened, all because some fellow wanted to see the color of the real money for once, in their many-million-dollared, water-stocked, catch - the-sucker transactions.

            <seg id="p202">U18IN - AM) THEIR U8S8 199 DISINFECTANTS AND THEIR USES. BY FRED W. ARMOIR. E While the title of my subject is broad enough to permit of a great 1 of theorizing and scientific deduction, you need not fear that a long and learned lecture is about to be inflicted upon you. I shall, er the contrary, confine my remarks to a plain and concise statement of .acts regarding the necessity of good health and individual comfort of our domestic animals, if they are to return a fair profit for the feed and care bestowed upon them, and how efficiently a reliable disinfectant can aid in securing these conditions. Let me say, in the beginning, that the evolution in the live stock industry which is constantly going on, changing the scattered herds anj flocks raging over a wide area, once a feature of this western country, into the systematic and concentrated methods which must always be a feature of intensive agriculture, have made the spread of infectious anj contagious diseases not only more common, but more disastrous to the owner of live stock. It is a condition which is not only natural to all animals and fowls, but also to mankind. The farmer with his nearest neighbor half a mile away, is not subjected to the dangers from infec - tious and contagious diseases that are a constant menace to the millions of people cooped up in the tenement houses of New York, Chicago, and other overgrown cities of the old and new world. Disease germs, vermin and parasitic insects increase in numbers according to the supply of food offered for their development. The fruit and grain grower, as well as the farmer who raises live stock, have found that this law of nature seriously affects their business, if means are not taken to counteract its influence. The necessities of civilized man, and especially his requirements for food and clothing, have gradu - ally developed systems of prevention and remedial agents to eliminate as far as possible the ravages and heavy losses caused by such diseases and insect pests, which would otherwise threaten the world with famine. Nature itself lends its aid in preventing the spread of disease; but, as usual, it is coupled with the demand that each individual shall exert himself to make the most of her offered assistance. There are no more potent influences in the maintenance of sound, vigorous health in our flocks and herds than pure air, sunshine and pure water. They are the great health preservers that are common to every land, and so cheap that they are not valued as they should be. Hence we find herds of dairy cows housed in damp, dirty stables, in which neither light nor sunshine can And their way, and the supply of fresh air is not one half what it should be. Such stables are the breeding places of disease germs </seg>
            <seg id="p203">200 and insect pests, and when a contagions or infectious disease breaks out as a result of these conditions, the careful owner is liable to suffer from the unwise and lazy methods of his neighbor. The germ of hog cholera will attack the herd which has been properly cared for as well as the Ei that lias been neglected, but the latter is always the starting point the disease, and therefore a constant danger to every herd in the ghborhood. Now, here is where an effective disinfectant becomes invaluable. It is a destroyer of disease germs in the soil, in the stables and pens, as well as on the bodies of the animals attacked, before they have had time to do much damage. In conjunction with proper conditions for maintaining the health and vigor of live stock, a proper and timely use of a disinfectant, which will also destroy vermin of all kinds, is the only means which affords the owner of live stock immunity from severe t. The owner of a flock or herd should never forget that eternal vigilance is the price he must pay for escaping such losses. Prevention is always cheaper and safer than remedial measures, as no matter how effective such remedies may prove there must be some loss before the disease can be banished from the farm. In other words, it is better to : the cost of disinfection than to meet the loss of several animals, and to pay (he cost of disinfection and remedies as well. As there are a great number of disinfectants, and •near-disinfectants.' on the market, it is well to consider what are the most essential charac teristics of a true disinfectant. t First is its effectiveness in the destruction of disease germs and the ification of the air in unsanitary pens and buildings. While doing &lt; work effectively it should also destroy all vermin infesting the mals anj premises to which it is applied. Second, its effectiveness should not come through its poisonous qualities, for that would mean constant danger to all living things on the farm. Third, it should neither be inflammable nor explosive, for that would add greatly to the Janger from fire in farm buildings. Fourth, its cost should be light, and the methods of mixing and appli - cation as simple as possible to prevent mistakes. Judged by these essentials there is no doubt but that the coal-tar dis - infectants, in 'their standardized form, are the safest and most reliable. Take Zenoleum, for instance, the oldest and best known of the coal-tar disinfectants, and it can not only be used as a disinfectant, but also to destroy vermin of all kinds, whether in the form of the mites that cause mange on hogs and cattle, scab on sheep, and such pests as lice and ticks on cattle, sheep, hogs and poultry, but it can be used as a remedy for internal parasites with absolute safety in the strength advise.) It is permitted to be used in the official dipping of sheep affected with scab bv the I'nited States Department of Agriculture, as &amp; </seg>
            <seg id="p204">201 standard preparation. For this particular purpose coal-tar prepara have a value over all other .lips from the fact that they neither dis - color the fleece, nor weaken its fibre. On the contrary, they add to its lustre and promote its growth. Of course there are a number of coil-tar dips on the market, and all of them do not possess all of the essentials Kve described. I can only advise careful tests, and to remember that eap article may in the en,l prove a most costly disappointment And now a few words on what I consider would be useful appliances on every farm on which live stock is kept, and I will close. There should be airy and comfortable quarters for all kinds of live stock suited to their requirements. Next should come a yard with a building in which animals showing symptoms of disease should be quarantined. It is a necessity, and will become more so In the future with the s spread of such diseases. Where permanent pastures of alfalfa are the rule, hv haiin? separate fields and changing the class of stock grazing on each fiel.l everv se-ison. the danger of the soil becoming infested with disease germs is greatly - lessened. Oerms that produce disease in one class of s*o"k seldom attack another, and they .lie out for want of the proper i-nn.'itions to enable them to increase and multiply. The germs of hog cholera do not attack cattle, sheep or horses, neither do sheep or cattle ticks attack »&gt;ne&lt;« or horses. A system of stock rotation in pastures will be fn»n-1 r effective measure against the spread of infectious and contqc-iniw eases, and it can be carried on with but little expense to the Then the farmer or breeder with a large herd of swine should ivoid the danger of having them seek filthy wallows in the hot summer divs to cool themselves. These wallows sooner or later become infested with the germs of various diseases, and every hog that uses them is exnosed to their attacks. Fill them up and in their place build a wallow of piinks large enough to accommodate half a dozen hogs at a time, fill it with clean water to a .lepth of twelve or fourteen inches, add a quirt or two of Zenoleum About once a week, or oftener if necessary, r&lt;-nr&lt;\v the water and the disinfectant. The hogs will then do their own dinning, and the germs and mites, with the ever present lice, will be driven out and destroyed with little trouble or cost. The hog. from its nature must have an opportunity to cool its body during hot weather, and owners should take advantage of this characteristic to have them do their own disinfecting. Since Prof. Shepherd, of the South Dakota Agricultural College, proclaimed the efficacy of "piggie's bath-tub." it has been • by many farmers with excellent results. A band snrayer is an essential part of the outfit of every farm where live stock is kept, as its use in spraying buildings, yards, etc., with a disinfectant makes it a valuable assistant in keeping the premises free </seg>

Perhaps there is no industry that is so badly underestimated, both in its volume and in its importance as the poultry industry. Statistics show that there were $11,250,000 worth of poultry products produced in the stale of Nebraska in the year IMC EdJ as to its importance to the human family, it is only necessary to that almost every man, woman and child in the United States is tly interested in and dependent upon either poultry or its product (eggs) as producers or consumers. Almost every human being con - sumes poultry or eggs, or foods that contain eggs. The child at the mother's breast is nourished from the food of the mother, of which eggs or poultry usually forms an important part. It has but one rival, If any, as a food, and that is milk. The greater part of the poultry and eggs consumed in the United States is produced upon the farms, and this in siite of the dislike of the average farmer for the poultry that his good wife insists on keeping. She realizes their value and the very important part poultry plays as a means of supplying the material for the food she has to prepare daily. He gives the hen but little thought except when she roosts upon the plow handle or other farm machinery or gets into the horse-trough, because he has provided neither shelter or food for her and she is compelled to "rustle." Then he makes war upon her and has a standing quarrel with her, and the patient wife has a hard time to keep up the number and quality of the flock. He eats the good food his wife prepares without thought or appreciation and will carry a basket of eggs to town and trade them for family supplies, if there is anything coming after he gets what tobacco he wants. We are glad to notice, however, that there is a rapidly growing Interest m poultry even by the farmers. The efforts of the wife are being assisted by the farmer; poultry houses and yards and feed are being provided and the result is a great Increase In both quantity and quality. Poultry is really one of the best resources of the farm. The healthful- Mas and purity of the food it affords the family cannot be excelled. But it is not my purpose in this short article to dwell upon the great volume or importance of poultry, but rather to speak of some practical features that are often overlooked in the care and management of the flock. Perhaps there is no business common to the farm that requires a knowledge of and attention to so many little details as does poultry. We are working with nature, and our work in the poultry yard will rnterfere </seg>
            <seg id="p207">204 assist iiaturi- just in proportion to our ignorance or knowledge of nature's laws. Ignorance an. I neglect means failure or at best, poor results, wbile knowledge anil careful attention insure success. It is not so much the ase of effort as it is the intelligent properly directed effort that is ■ .1. There are very many items of the necessary knowledge we must possess. before we are certain of good results, and ignorance of or a failure to comply with nature's demands in any one of these items may defeat the best efforts of the otherwise well educated poultry raiser. i(j illustrate: Proper temperature for the little chick is a very essential feature from the time incubation begins until the chick is three or four months old. A little chick that has once been thoroughly chilled before four weeks old is worthless. It may live along and make a feeble effort towards development, but will never repay its cost of keep. Thus one may know what eggs to select for setting, and just how to incu - bate them, and know just how and when to feed; but one night's neglect or failure to keep the brooder at the proper temperature will defeat all the preceding good efforts and care. It is a business that requires both knowledge and thoughtfulness, and for that reason it is one of the best res of farm life especially for the boys and girls, whose active youn? minds need occupation and education in pure channels in contact with nature anJ nature's laws, and in acquiring habits of thrift and care. The first thing to be determined, is how shall we get the little chick - shall it be by natural or artificial incubation? Artificial incubation is niing very common and is usually successful in the hands of any one who will follow the directions of the manufacturer and has in their mental make-up a little turn for watchfulness and vigilance — and one who ■Me to forget or neglect the essential details had best leave this I ranch of the business to the old hen, who is endowed with "eternal vigilance," and knows just when and how. But whether we use the hen or the incubator it is a good plan to set several hens at one time and candle out the eggs under them and rob enough of them to replace the bad eggs that are found under the rest, and start those we rob anew. Or, if we are using the incubator rob the hens to replace the bad eggs, so we may have a full hatch in the incubator. If one cannot provide a good brooder room so temperatures can be controlled in bad weather, and a sufficient number of hens can be set at the same time the incubator is filled, it will be found quite practical to give all the chicks to the hens. Any of the American breeds can care for Kirty chicks (other breeds according to size) if in good quarters, thus lieving one of the care of the flock in the brooder. Ewe assume the care of the young chick when hatched, we should what the old hen knows and apply the knowledge. The first ten will pretty nearly determine what per cent of the hatch will reach "ity. The writer has lost 9(1 per cent as a beginner, and has matured r cent after years at e and study. </seg>
            <seg id="p208">205 The greatest mortality results from improper feeding. The first thing to be given is grit — clean sand is good enough. Never give foot first. The chick has no means of digesting it, and bowel trouble will result. No food should be given under 4S hours and 48 longer will not be detrimental The last act of nature in incubation is to inclose the yolk of the egg within the abdomen of the little chick to be absorbed as food for its maintenance and development for the first week or It days. If food is given in sufficient quantity to supply the chick before the yolk is con - sumed the digestive energy will be bestowed on the fooj given and the yolk will be neglected and it will spoil and cause bowel trouble that is incurable. The writer provides a small yard in front of the brooder. t which is placed some kinJ of light litter; clean chaff, or sawdust is od, and sprinkle just enough of dry fine food (millet seed or the corn - cad left from breakfast, well dried in the oven and crumbed up fine, or something of like nature) in the litter to induce scratching, but not enough to form any part of a ration. The exercise of scratching helps 10 develop strength and growth.

Be careful to wet the top of the head while dipping, otherwise the worst of all lice, the head lice, will escape. If other poultry is adde.l to the flock it should be dipped before it mingles with the flock or enters the premises. It is very different with mites, they leave the hen in the early morning and remain in the roost or house, hid away out of reach of any spray that may be applied for their immediate destruction. Fumigation will not reach them. After many experiments the Iowa Experiment Station has given us the most practical method yet discovered, viz., thoroly spray every part of the roof or ceiling, walls, floor and perches, with kerosene emulsion, which leaves a sticky coating which holds Mr. Mite in its fatal grasp whenever he tries to crawl forth for his nightly feast. This coating will gradually dry and harden so the insect can crawl over it with ease and safety. Then it will be necessary to repeat the spraying. It is a battle royal and must be kept up during the warm months and begun in early spring </seg>

They were hauled on an ox wagon, in ion of hollow log.

We had bees of our own, and we ha.i been led to think that meant unlimited honey. Possibly ,00 much honey ha 1 lK&gt;en taker, from them before we got them, or the man selected weak colonies or the spring was unfavorable. Anyway, we never saw any bees in one of those hives.

About this time the wife sug - gested that she would need the kneiding board next morning, and 1 ile iiled that if wp were to keep bees it would pay to get a modern hive, and transfer them.

It was late when I ■ipd home, but those hers were transferred to the new hive that night. intern light. They made about fifty pounds of surplus honey that summer. In July we stopped another swarm, and they made more than twenty pounds of honey in the super. We have kept bees, and had all the honey we could possibly use at all times, ever since. Aside from the honey they make, there are many reasons why I think farmer should keep bees. In the pollenization of many plants and fruits, they do a work so useful, and so necessary, that in many cases we may safely say "no lieps, no fruit." I would keep bees on this ;nt alone, if they never made a drop of honey. Ey are cheerful, hopetul, and in.lustrious. They keep their homes lean and sanitary, and spend no time scolding, sulking, gossip - leafing What a worthy and powerful incentive their example be to each and all of us. To our women folks, especially: for its, as well as beeologists, tell us that all the worker bees are Solomon may have been the wisest man. and he certainly had excep - tional opportunities for stu.lying the greatest problem of the ages — women he showed a lamentable lack of judgment when he set up the ant as an example. Ants are always gadding aimlessly and fussily about. An ant will pick up a piece of feather, glass or butterfly wing, within a f.'w Inches of. and in plain sight of. home. She will carry it about for hours, over sti O s anil stones, up otie side of a tall weed and .lown the other, to the top of every grass blade within reach, and finally drop the ss thing, when her mind, or the fashion, changes; only to take np another burden equally useless. tThe bee displays no such foolishness, an.l has no |&gt;erverted tastes.

Kie farmer can well afford to keep bees for the example they set. afford to keep them for the pleasure, the fascination, and the ge that an intimate study of their lives and habits will give him. Hut. if none of theEe appeal, he can certainly afford to keep them for the honey they produce. It is sai.l that in the United States we consume over eighty pounds of sugar per capita annually, and this in addition to the molasses and honey we use. Much of this sugar might well be re - placed by honey, which is pleasanter to take, more wholesome for most persons, and may be had for little trouble or expense.

A number of successful apiaries are located on the roof, in some of our largest cities. So it is not necessary to own a farm, or live in the country, to keep bees. And it need not be expensive. There is probably no place in Nebraska where a swarm of bees, two dovetailed hives completed, a smoker and a bee veil, may now be had for ten .lollars, or less — the price of a small calf or two small shoats — the price of one cheap cigar a day for six months. The extra hive is for the first new swarm, so that for this price you obtain two colonies of bees, with up-to-date hives and fixtures. You will be pretty sure (o get inter - ested in thorn, grow enthusiastic, and want more. With this start, and good i are. you may reasonably expect to double your number of colonies each year. This alone, is a hundred per cent increase. The honey anj the pleasure are extra. The amount of pleasure varies somewhat, and so does the quantity of l.oney. Ordinarily bees, like domestic animals, are profitable in proportion to the intelligent care given them, but the cmre r&lt; quired by tees is very much less for a given return. In my own case the bees do not rank second or even tenth, among the in histrlca of the farm, and are shamefully neglected, yet I am sure they pay letter, in proportion to the attention they receive, than any other industry on the farm. In the spring, and at various times during the summer as I happen to he in the mood. I put on supers. In the fall I tal e them off. Usually leave them on so long that the bees have carried some of the honey lelow to till up empty brood comb, but that simply me ins we get less honey, never have to feed the bees and they do not sta ve .luring the winter. The entire time given a dozen colonies is probably less than 1 alf a day per year. We save much time, and get more honey, by using shallow extracting supers, instead of the ordinary sections. We do not extract, but sell chunk honey, iti two-qii;irt tin palls. Occasionally a colony gives no surplus, while others give as much as six'y or seventy pounds. We eat a great deal of honey, give away con- t table, and usually have honey to sell. And it is practically all clear t. too.

National, slate, district and county bee-keepers' associations are rapidly organizing on every hand. Merchants, doctors, mitiisters, lawyers, farmers, professors of our literary institutes and even our most highly refined ladies are being charmed by the pleasure and profits of handling .he honey-bee. The bee-keeping of to.tay is not done in the same manner it was fifty - ago, no more than our grain is harvested in the same manner now that it was then. Honey is demanded now by the ton instead of by the ounce, and can lie had at almost any of our leading groceries instead of only at our drug-stores, as is was less than a quarter of a century ago: anj the beauty of it all is, every farmer of ordinary intelligence may. with some study, enjoy the profits and pleasures of that untiring little worker, the honey-bee. El bee-hive is an emblem of industry and economy, and when we p acquainted with its government there are many things that seem marvelous, and many things are found that the deepest scientific eh has as yet been unable to fathom. PI il between thirty and forty years ago the opportunities for stuJy - e working of a colony of bees in a hive were rather limited. But ut the above date the Rev. L. L. Langstroth, now living at Oxford, but very feeble, invented ihe movable frame hive, for which inven - tion he is highly esteemed and reverenced as the father of modern apicul - ture. His invention consists in furnishing frames or sashes which are about three-eights of an inch smaller all around than the insije of the hive, and inducing the bees to build their combs in them. And the Euracy and precision with which they do their work almost leads us believe that they have learned to use the plumb-line, straight-edge and I The standard Langstroth hive of eight frames is the one most used in.

Eie queens are capable of laying five or six thousand eggs in twenty - • hours, but a queen that lays two thousand eggs per day for four or months in the year is a very good one. The honey gatherers are all female liees, but do not reproduce their kind only in casps of emergency, and then their offspring is believed to be useless. R drone is the male bee, and is present in the hive only a part of r. A young queen will hatch or become a full grown bee in days from the laying of the eggs, a worker bee in twenty-one 1 a drone in twenty-four days. I Beeswax is produced by the bees eating honey, and secreting pure wax or rather under the segments of their abdomen, and it has by experi - ment been proven I eyond a doubt that the consumption of about fifteen |K&gt;iimls of honey is required to proJuee one pound of wax or honey-comb. Therefore, for a great many years it has been very evident that if the honey could only be gotten out of the comb without destroying the receptacle in the old way, when our mothers crushed it in their hands and pressed the liquid through a cloth, it would be a great saving, as then the comb could le returned for the bees to fill the second, or even more times. Major von Hruschka. an Austrian, who was keeping bees in Italy, one day supplied the long-felt want by giving his little boy too much honey to eat. After the boy had satisfied his appetite he placed the re - maining piece of comb in a little tin pail an.l tying a string to the pail began swinging the pail around and around in regular hoy style by hold - ing the other end of the string in his hand. Soon the close-observing German noticed that the side of the comb farthest from the boy's hand was emptied of its contents and turning the comb over the boy was bidden to whirl it again, when it was plain to be seen that centrifugal force emptied the other side of the comb in the same way that drops of water leave a grindstone, or the mud flies off a wagon wheel. How simple and near and yet how difficult and far away was all this. Pbout the year 1857 another German in the fatherland began the use hat is known as comb foundation, but not meeting with success, foundation business slumbered for nearly twenty years, when Mr. Frederick Weiss, an aged German in New York, began its use He after - wards having moved to Chicago died in the Cook county poor-house. Foundation is made by dipping a polished hoard down edgewise into Trclt&lt;"i wax. which, when cool, is remove.! from the board like sheets of paper and then passed through a machine similar to a clothes wringer, which stamps indentations on each side of it for the base of the cell, when the bees will readily accept it and build the cells.

TRKSTKR This, Mr. President, is no doubt the paramount question in bee-keeping, and I know you will excuse me when I say that it is just as difficult to give the above subject justice in this short essay, as it would be to give all the details in the management of a small farm in an essay of the same length: and really I hardly know where to bruin in ordrr to inter - est m v listeners most, but as "dillv-riallvini; around never acmroplishes </seg>
            <seg id="p220">217 anything," I will dive into my subject and touch a few important points You all remember that in a former essay I told you that it took twenty - one days from the lime a queen laid an egg until a worker be« hatched or was a full grown bee: it is also about five dan fmm th&lt;&gt; ti-.o i. ;„ also about five days from the time it i fully matured or hatched until it is old enough to go to the field The life of a worker bee is from forty to fifty days at the time in the year when they have the most labor to perform, which is of course in the summer, while in the winter they will live six or eight months It appears that they are .similar to a machine, the more they exercise the sooner they are used up, or worn out. Now you see from what 1 have said that you cannot have the same bee all summer to work for you. KOn the other hand, honey is not to be found in Hie flowers at all times the warm months, and here in Nebraska the flower itself is rather difficult to find in the forepart of the summer, and excepting in the eastern counties of the state our honey flow does not really begin until about August I, and it then is principally from heartsease or smartweed, as it is called by some pemM. It is now easy for any of us to understand why it would be foolishness for a beekeeper to have a hive full of bees in in May here In Nebraska with which he of honey. A farmer would use just in May to help cut his oats in August Le boarded, and in case of the expected to gather the August crop as much judgment in hiring men for in both cases Uie laborers must would be dead, while the oats har - with him to say the least. Now, vester— well you would be disgusted then, how are we going to solve thi: problem? How can we have our hives full of just when we want them? If you will only be patient I will tell you how In the first place every apiarist should know just at what times in the seasons to look for honev flow « r mmu . i 1 to look for honey flow, or more properly speaking, he should know at what time the flowers will come in bloom, that are accustomed to secreting the most honey, and about twenty-six days before that time he mi their level best at egg laying to it that his queens are just doing LWell. you say, how are you going to make a queen lay eggs whether wants to or not? Why you must play a kind of a -snide game- on the old lady and make her want to lay. It can be done by feeding almost any sweet substance if there is no honey How. It is a well known fact that when a honey flow begins the queen will begin to lay eg^j. She seems to reason instinctively that as there is a harvest to be gathered more laborers are wanted, and when the honey flow cea ema to s.iy there is nothing to do now and we want no more boarders to eat up our hard earned stores, and ceases to deposit eggs at once. Therefore here in our our state examine your combs closely about July 1. or rather June 25. and if the tiny eggs are not plentiful in the bottom of the cells you should proceed at once to feed for stimulative purposes, when the queen will at once proceed as [ have slated.

Now we are ready to have the honey. gathered and what are we going to do with It? The bees will not put it in juss and cork it up for us. neither will they store it in bottles or barrels. Honey comb we cannot give them because we cannot make it, and it would be foolishness in my estimation to allow one-half of the bees to stay at home to secrete wax and build comb, while honey was going to waste in the fields, and so far we have been unable to induce them to build comb except during a honey flow. But 1 will tell you what is the next best thing we can do, to fur - nishing comb, and that is to furnish plenty of comb foundation. And I almost see you shaking your heads in doubt when I say that in twenty four hours after foundation has been given I havt- seen it drawn nearly out into a perfect comb and partially filled with honey. And now being tr harvest time, you should |&gt;eep into your hives often to just get an i how fast they are filling up with honey, and when they are nearly full take some of the ripest or oldest looking honey away, leaving plenty of room for them to store in, for if they get the hive entirely filled they may slacken their energy.

If you will allow me to deviate from the nbjeet, I will say that it Is an easy matter for an expert apiarist to tell when his bees are finding honey. They come out of the entrance of the hive with a "hop, skip and jump" and away they go. in calm weather, with almost the speed of a bullet; when the wind is Joing its best they seem to be all the more deter - mined; they will tack to the right and left, then up and down, hut, "don t you forget it," they will get there on a bee line if it takes all day and until after sundown. I have heard bees come home heaily laden with honey so late in the evening that it was too dark to see them. I think I can safely say that each one hundred and sixty a res of land that is under cultivation in eastern Nebraska would support forty colonies of bees and if that was the case there would not be so many beautiful flowers "born to bud and bloom and die unseen, and waste their fragrance on the desert air," neither would the millions of dollars worth of pure and healthful sweets be permitted to evapora'c in the Jazzling sunlight while a health-destroying glucose was being used in its stead. </seg>

His young son insist* d upon knowing why he declined and his father carefully explained that the call was not strong enough. A few evenings later this same son was proceeding to "raise Cain" in his father's v while the good pastor was laboring over the preparation of his next Sabbath's discourse. Finnally in exasperation his father offered him a dime if he would betake himself to some other part of the house. The boy hesitated, pondered a moment, then shook his head decisively. "Nope." he replied. "Can't do it. Call isn't strong enough." Now. ladies and gentlemen — yes. gentlemen, for I find that the gentlemen are as deeply interested in this problem as the ladies — I hope by this article to make a very strong call to you. So strong that every one of you will feel the need of availing yourselves of at least some of the inexpensive con - veniences which I shall suggest. E-iated on good authority that the average housewife takes over miles of unnecessary steps every day in the performance of the ordi - household duties. The problem confronting us is how to arrange our work so as to mini mize the amount of labor required in its performance. I'nder the tonic of Home Conveniences I wish to discuss certain prac - tical devices for the saving of labor, and many advantages to be gained thereby will appear. I wish to discuss this under three heads: First, the operator, or the housewife. id. the field of operations, or the house Third, the means of operations, or labor-saving convenience! In discussing the first head — the housewife as the operator — I am reminded of the lady who purchased a new F.ewing machine. She studied her instruction hook very carefully and came to the conclusion that she didn't know how to run the machine, so she sent for the agent. He ar - rived upon the scene and said: "Well, madam, what seems to be the trouble?" "Well." she replied, "this instruction book says to turn the wheel rrd the operator, and I've looked and looked and I just can't find the itor." Prhe housewife is the operator of the machinery of the household and rry complicated machinery it is, and how essential that she should be ! to so turn the wheels as to operate it with the least possible friction, order to do this it is necessary that she should have a sound body, steady nerves, well trained faculties, and flexible muscles. And in orier to have these it is necessary that the body should be taken care of. Moat of the friction in household machinery is due to overwork, or ill health brought on by exposure.

Bthis can be greatly simplified. In the first place.

Then starting with one wheel carry your line out around the other wheel and back to the starting point, firmly fastening the ends together. Then all that Marv will have to do is to stand on the porch and pin on her clothes, drawing the line towards her as she needs it. When the clothes are dry she removes them in the same Et and never sets foot into mud or snow. Of course, this device just as much again clothes-line as the old method — but then clothes - ire cheap. K housewife should have a good high ironing boar.l: then when down to do the mending after the ironing is done she will not 'd that she will want to sit on the small of her back. It is a good plan to have a high stool to sit upon while ironing, pre - paring vegetables, etc. Then, if you want an expensive luxury that is decidedly cheap, get a gasoline iron. This may sound like a contradictory statement, but allow me to explain. This iron Is expensive, costing from to $5. It is provided with a tank, holding one-half pint of gasoline, which is enough to do an ordinary ironing. With gasoline at fifteen - per gallon, the cost of one ironing is less than one cent, thus making about fifty cents per year. But double that to be certain the estimate is not too low, and call it $1. The estimated average cost of fuel for .loing an ordinary ironing is thirty cents per week, making over $15 per year. I carry the comparison farther? One can readily see that this iron will save the equivalent of its cost in fuel in a very short time fo say nothing of the comfort and convenience gained by its use. Mary can sit on her high stool and do her entire ironing without tak - ing a single step, and can have her iron at any temperature she mav lesire simply by turning a thumb-screw. Now. John, don't you consider this worth while? When you come in to dinner Mary will greet you with a smile and not with a frown, and h complainings of weariness.

It is really astonishing how many trips the average housewife makes to the cellar; and if she tips the beam at from 175 to 200 avoirdupois these trips are laborious indeed. At certain seasons, the waiter is especially helpful. In summer it will take butter, cream, etc., to the cellar for you, and it is almost indispen sable in the fall when you are putting up fruit and vegetables. It will gladly brig up a load of empty jars, and when you have filled them will cheerfully take them back, and you have onljfeto .lescend the stairs empty handed and put them away. I have known of these dumb-waiters being put in at an expense of $5. and the maximum cost of putting one in an old house ought not to exceed $8 or $10.

Almost every farm has its windmill to supply water to the barn, the yards, and elsewhere. Why not utilize this same windmill in supplying water to the house? (ientlemen, did it ever occur to you that the housewife uses more water every day than is required for all the stock on the average farm? Let us gee. She washes the dishes three times a day; she washes the clothes, windows, floors, porches, walks, churn, milk vessels, separator, vegetables - and the children's faces, to say nothing of the cooking ami many other things for which water is required — and all of this water must b* (nrried in. I 'ho carries this water? Why of course John does — not. John has to that windmill because he cannot carry all the water necessary for th« , but he never thinks of how much water Mary must use every day. gentlemen, 1 don't want to say anything unpleasant, or make you mfortable, for we women, too, are just as thoughtless about thesa matters, so I am not going to scold you any more. But listen. You can put a five-gallon tank in your kitchen with a pipe from the windmill to carry the water in, and an overflow pipe to carry the surplus back to the barn, and lay these pipes underground deep enough to prevent freezing, all for $5. In this way you can have a constant supply of fresh water in E kitchen, and all the good wife will have to do is to turn the faucet. you cannot afford this you can at least have a barrel at the house and It full every morning.

            <seg id="p232">229 CORN MACHINERY. BT L. W. CHASE. With the advent of high-priced lands and the scarcity of farm help there are two problems of vital Importance before the farmer today; they are: more Intensive farming and the~abillty to do more work with less help. In both cases the question lies with the machinery for the farmer to use To accomplish results from intensive farming, implements must be such that thj best of tilth is produced. To care for the large farms with less help requires that more ground must be covered at one time by one man, that is, two-row machinery, combined plows, harrows and drills, and like implements must be used. LThe farmer who now has extensive corn fields must, when possible, art to two-row machinery and in some instances even the three-row machine miu' be used. In the operation of two-row machinery there is just twice the work for the operator to look after as in the one-row, consequently the man who attempts to handle such machines must not be a "catch-as-catchcan" farmer, but he must be educated to his work, and even then he must have all conditions the best in order to produce as good results as when he used the single-row implements. In the most simple of two-row, shovel cultivators there are seven levers to be handled and, in some cultivators, this number runs as high as ten and eleven. There are instances when all of these should be operated within the same few seconds. This, of course, is impossible; consequently, there are times when either a weed must be left, or corn covered or pulled out. To make the use of the two-row machines as simple as possible the ground must, first, be as free from weeds as possible; second, it must be well tilled before planting; third, the rows must be straight and with a uniform distance between each; fourth, if the corn Is checked, the checking must be perfect; and. fifth, a steady and well - trained team must be used. It is impossible to get within from fifteen to thirty inches as close to the fence at the end of the rows with a two-row cultivator as with a one-row, the distance varying with the number of horses used. For the first cultivation of listed corn there can be nothing better than the two- or three-row sled or solid-wheel cultivator with a disk to work the earth. Since to obtain the maximum yield of corn per acre the proper planting of the corn is as important as the proper cultivation, and since there is not time for the discussion of both subjects, the remainder of this paper will be devoted to corn planters and sorters or graders. ■ modern corn-planter is made up of five principal parts, the rear wheels, check head and front frame, furrow openers and dropping The rear frame is carried by the axle between the covering </seg>
            <seg id="p233">230 wheels, its usual duty being to connect the front frame with the wheels and also to carry the driver. The wheels of the planter fulfil two functions; one is to support the planter and the other is to cover the corn. As to height, there are two general classes of wheels, known as high and low. The former has a height of about thirty-eight inches and the latter about thirty-two inches. For those who list and then drill their corn with a drill planter, the high wheels are preferable, while for those who top plant it is optional as to which they use. Each of the above classes of wheels can have for form of tire the flat as seen by Fig. 1, or the concave, Fig. 2, or the open, as in Fig) 3. or the wheel may be made up of two parts and be known as a double wheel (Fig. 4). Eflat wheel was the first type to be used on corn-planters. It the purpose at the time but, by considering Fig. 1 It will be that the flat wheel leaves practically a level trench with a Fig. 4. Double wheel smooth surface. The center of this trench being softer, due to the fact that the soil has just previously been stirred by the furrow opener, the water will gather at this point and soon wash down through, getting at the kernels of corn. Again, the planter wheel having packed the dirt Ei where the corn has been dropped and having left the surface of ground perfectly smooth gives us the best condition of soil for 3 rat ion By noticing the lower part of Fig. 2. it will be observed that the concave wheel leaves the ground beneath in the same hard condition with a smooth surface that the flat wheel did but, at each Bide of the wheel track, but at each side of the wheel track the ground is lower than in the middle, consequently, as the water gathers in the wheel </seg>
            <seg id="p234">231 a great deal of water, it will not reach .the hill of corn. In many cases, this simple method of throwing water from the center of the wheel track to the outside saves replanting a great deal of corn. The open wheel is probably the wheel which is used more than any other type. It has the effect of packing the dirt around the corn; also, it leaves a small trench at each side of the middle of the row and yet does not leave a smooth surface from which the moisture will evaporate. The dust will fall in over the tread of each part of the open wheel and make what is known as a dust mulch; what is more, there is more of the gathering effect in the open type of wheel than in the closed type, and for this reason it is more sure of covering corn. The double wheel has all the points of the open wheel and is generally so constructed that the angle of the slope of the wheel is changeable and, for this reason, the double wheel can be given more or less gather as the case demands. For a tricycle lister this is an important function. The double wheel pulls harder than any other type of wheel and, in addition, has two bearings to be cared for; for the latter reason it Is not as popular with the public as the open type. Outside of the dropping devices, probably the furrow openers are as important as anything on the planter. There are five general types of openers now in use. They are the hoe, the curved and stub runner, also the single and double disk. The hoe was the first type to be used and has long since become obsolete on corn planters The curved runner was and is yet probably as serviceable as any. Its draft is probably lighter and it can be used in more varied classes of soil. Its greatest objection is the fact that in trashy ground it will run over the trash and generally it so happens that the hill is dropped Just where the trash comes, consequently, there is no dirt to cover the corn. For the man who desires to get over a great deal of ground in a short time, the curved runner is more satisfactory than any other. The stub runner has a greater penetrative effect than the curved; It also noses through the trash, thus leaving the corn in the ground. However, the trash will occasionally gather in front of the shank and require the operator to gel off and remove it. This is not a bad feature to anyone except the man who prefers losing a few hills of corn to getting off and cleaning his machine. The stub runner cannot be used in stony and stumpy ground. The single disk probably has greater penetrative effect than any other of the five classes of runners given, but it also pulls the hardest. As a rule it will cut through trash, thus hindering neither the operation nor the operator of the planter. This style of runner, however, requires a very much heavier support than either of the previous named styles, due to the fact that a disk has a tendency to draw itself to one side or the other and thus cause a planter to wind. Od high-wheel planters this point is quite objectionable, but on low- </seg>
            <seg id="p235">232 NEBBA8KA BTATI BoaKH or AUUCULTUB1 USf U QU1 Ifi CXlCnSlVCiy iA II tl face Di S IO 0€ £1 VlDg \ Cry gOOCl StillSIclCLlOIl. It does not have quite the penetrative effect that the single-disk does. However, corn should not be planted in ground where any of the openers spoken of have difficulty in going in. Some men have criticised the double disk by saying that it allows the dry dirt to fall backupon the corn instead of the fresh earth. The writer cannot verify this statement, however. The Illinois Experiment Station has done a great deal of work in determining which is the best depth to plant corn. Their observations have indicated that about one and one-half inch is the proper depth. In a locality where there is always plenty of moisture, no doubt this depth is sufficient. However, there are places where the corn should be planted deeper to obtain the best results. The proper depths can be determined only by the men who are in certain localities, and when the proper depth is decided upon those who plant the corn should adhere strictly to the rule. If the corn does the best when planted two Inches deep, it does not do quite as well when planted one and one-half or two and one-half, and it is no harder work to put in at just the proper depth than to have it vary one-half inch either way. There is now put on planters a device known as a depth gauge. This is merely a shoe, which prevents the runner from going more than a certain depth into the ground. It is v.Ty good, but there are other devices which appeal much more strongly to the writer for the same purposes, and at the same time they have their features which are commendable. These latter devices are known as furrow openers or furrow-opener extensions. It is simply a sheet of steel bent in a form similar to the common mold-board, one for each side of the furrow opener. When a runner strikes a place where it penetrates the ground four or five inches, these extensions plow the dirt away from the runner in such a way that they always leave the corn just at the proper depth, regardless of the fact that the runner may start as if it were going into the ground four or five inches. What is more, they turn over four or five inches of the soil on each side of the runner, and by so doing kill one crop of small weeda Be - sides these furrow-opener extensions, there is also a device known as covers, which is very satisfactory on ground which is inclined to be rutty. They rake the dirt in over the corn and also cut off a strip of weeds along the sides of the row. The timing of the corn-planter is an important part of the operation. To produce good results by timing, we mean that the planter shank is so adjusted that the hill is always dropped almost directly beneath the bead on the check wire. A man may go to the pains of setting a line across each end of his corn field, and then each time set his check wire stake on this line so that he will apparently have his corn in check, but if his planter is not properly timed the checking can be off as much as five inches. Also, by changing from a high team with short breast straps and not adjusting the planter, the corn can be thrown out </seg>
            <seg id="p236">233 device on the rear end of the pole, such that It Is easy to keep the planter properly timed. Other planters have to be timed simply by lengthening or shortening the breast straps. A new planter should be timed before going to the field. When it has been properly adjusted, the height of the end of the tongue from the ground should be measured and marked upon the tongue. A good plan is to cut the figures into the planter tongue with a knife or dot them in with a nail, then every time a different team ts put on the planter the breast straps may be so adjusted that the end of the tongue is the proper height from the ground. Pie dropping device is. without doubt, the most important feature rn planters. The early dropping devices were automatic. That is. were so made that the wheels dropped the corn. However, machine - dropped corn was very seldom checked in those times, and when check- Ing was attempted it was done in a very uneven manner. When people commenced checking their corn more extensively, planters were con - structed so that a second person rode on the front frame and dropped the corn by means of a lever which worked the seed plates. Tn such cases the fields were always marked cross ways before the planter was started. The next device and the one which is used at the present time was the check wire. By the use of the check wire the second person on the planter Is done away with: the trouble of marking the field Is also dispensed with. and. if proper «care is taken, the corn it much better checked with this device than with the old-time method The dropping device of the lister is simply a plate which revolves in the bottom of the seed box and is propelled by a chain running from the main wheels of the lister or from a sperial wheel placed for that purpose. This plate is so constructed that only one kernel can get into each cell and the distance apart of the kernels is regulated either by the speed of rotation of (ho plate or the distance apart of the cells in the plate. When the corn leaves the cell it falls directly down through a nearly vertical spout to the opening made by the subsoiler in the ?Tound. Since some of the kernels of corn may strike one, two. three, four or even five or six times on the side of this spout as they fall down through it without striking the sides of the spout, the corn is not dropped at a uniform distance apart. That is. one kernel will be retarded in passing through the spout, while the r.ext one will pass through without stopping. The result is these two kernels of corn will be closer together in the ground than the previous two. Planters are made in a similar manner, but there are devices which cause the hills to be dropped at a uniform distance apart. These devices are valves in the spout or shank of the planter. In nearly all modern planters there are two valves and sometimes three. The first valve is generally near the top of the shank: this valve receives the corn from the plate, and when the check head is thrown the valve is opened and the hill falls to the next valve, which is generally at the lower end of the shank.

Hy having this lower valve in the shank the corn can drop directly upon the ground without passing through the long passage. By so doing each hill is left a certain dis - tance apart providing the team works at a uniform pace. If the team should be working too fast, the planter will carry the corn a short distance after it leaves the valve before it strikes the ground; for this reason there are some valves so constructed that they tend to throw the corn backward when the team is working too fast. The valve action Fig. 8. — Round-hole plate for full hill drop. of planters is important in that it regulates the distance apart of the hills and also it prevents two hills from being dropped at once. This is one of the most difficult operations of the valve, and few planters are so well constructed but that when a team goes slowly enough two hills will drop at once, and then the next time no hill be dropped. This will o-cur only when the planter strikes some obstruction, such- as a tclod or stone, and jerks on the team, causing it to slow down, will occur if the check head is being thrown just at the instant im stops at the end. The operation of the drop is the vital part of corn-planters. Corn cultivation has reached such a stage that it is found that the greatest </seg>

The first corn planters had the cells or holes in the plates of a size which would admit of enough and only enough kernels to make a hill, and if the number of kernels in each hill was to be varied a plate with either larger or smaller cells was used In the planter, as the case called for This style of dropping mechanism was known as the full-hill drop. That is the full hill waa accomplished by having the hill of corn gather in one cell of the plate. Fig. 9. — Edge-selection plate with intermit - tent plate movement Fig. 10. — Round-hole plate with intermittent plate movement and accumulative hill. Fig. 8, and the plate then moved only far enough to permit this cell to pass over the opening to the planter shank. The present-day planters do not use this method because of size, instead of about three kernels four or five small ones could get in in the next hill there would be only the fact that when corn varied in getting into each cell in the plate, the same cell at once, and possibly one or two large ones. The result was that the corn was not evenly distributed among the hills. Nearly all modern planters now use what is known as the accumulative hill. These planters are so constructed that the number of cells corresponding to the number of kernels desired in each hill will be exposed to the valve long enough for the hill of corn to accumulate. For instance. If a hill of three kernels is desired, the plate will have a kernel of corn in each cell, then the plate will move so that three cells pass over the opening, thus permitting three kernels of corn to drop into the valve and make the hill. As previously stated, this is known as the accumu - lative drop. There are two different plate movements for the accumu - lative drop, also two different classes of plates. The two plate movement* are known as intermittent and continual rotation and the two claaaea of cells are known as round hole, flat plate and edge selection. </seg>
            <seg id="p239">236 Fig. 9 is one type of edge selection plate used in a planter with the intermit lent movement. Fig. 10 is a type of round-hole plate used in the same class of planter. Eird to the course of dropping of the above named methods, at am not prepared to say which would be the best. The edge - type seems to be by far the more popular among the dealers t, but recent tests made with all of the above mentioned sys - tems have not shown a decidedly great difference in favor of the edge - selection types. This probably was because of the fact that the tests were not carried on extensively enough to produce results such as might have been expected, and for that reason I do not deem it beat to make a statement concerning the best dropping mechanisms. There is no doubt but that a much more accurate drop can be ob - tained by carefully sorting or grading the corn. Formerly the sorter's attention was to the size and shape of the kernels, expecting that the corn be butted and tipped, and in a great many cases men did not even expect to take this pains with their seed. With the advent of more scientific methods, with corn and corn planting, corn sorters have become of quite frequent use. It is quite essential that the corn be graded or sorted in some manner when edge-selection planters are used, and from recent tests, I believe that it is fully as essential, if not more so, with the old-style planter with full-hill drop. Edge-selection plates are very apt to crack or grind the corn if the corn does not fit the cells perfectly. That is, if the corn is irregular in size and two kernels will endeavor to fall into the same cell, one or the other will be broken and often both are ground up. When the cell is too small for the corn, the corn does not drop into each cell, consequently there is not a full hill gathered. Some operators have experienced the fact that when the planter box has become about two-thirds empty, the corn will no longer drop out. This shows quite clearly that the plate in itself has been a corn sorter and sorted out the small grains from the large ones; also it shows that the corn should have been sorted before being put into the planter, since, when the box is becoming about one-third empty, it will be of quite frequent occurrence to have only one or two grains in a hill when there should have been three. k There are corn sorters on the market which claim to sort the corn two or three different grades. These sorters generally separate as to the thickness of grain only. Then there are other sorters on the market which claim to son the corn both as to thickness and length. Some seed corn experts say that careful hand selection is as good as any sorter. The method upon which they advise working is that in selecting seed corn about three barrels be close at hand, when butting and tipping corn notice the size of kernels on each ear, then throw those ears which have small kernels into one barrel; large kernels into COKN SORTERS AND CORN SORTING. </seg>

Tests were made to determine whether the machine-graded corn or the hand-graded was best. The following is the report of one series of tests, four different styles of planters being used. Because of the fact that this was only one set of tests, the results cannot be used as tests of planters and neither can they be relied upon too much as tests of machine-graded and hand-graded 5 •o Number of hills having 3 kernels jut hill 2' ■ 150 14 131 4 150 1 25 102 22 41. 150 10 37 91 4 * Plate was not in properly ami teat did not count Corn No. 4 was butted and tipped but ungraded.

It will also be noticed that the hand-graded corn produced 65 per cent accuracy and the machine graded 66 per cent accuracy.

            <seg id="p242">239 FARM MACHINERY. BY L. W. CHASE. ■One of the requirements for a steady, healthy growth of any people or nation Is a bountiful supply of food. The earth ran be made to produce in abundance only when the soil is tilled and plants suitable for food are cultivated. As long as the people of the earth roamed about obtaining their subsistence by hunting and fishing, conditions were not favorable for a rapid increase in population or an advance in civilization. Tribes or nations constantly encroached upon each other's right and were continually at war. History shows that when any nation, isolated so as to be protected from the attacks of other nations, devoted itself to agricultural pursuits, its government at once became more stable and life and property more secure. Protected in this way. a great nation, shut oft from the rest of the world by natural means, and located in a fertile country, arose along the banks of the Nile long before any other nation reached prominence. The Gauls became mighty be - rause they devoted themselves to agriculture and obtained in this way a more reliable supply of food. Pliny, the elder, in his writings tells of thp flekls of Gaul and described some of the tools used. It has been ated that there never were more than 400,000 Indians in North America, and they were often in want of food. Compare this number with tiie present population. The tribal that flourished and increased in num - bers were those who had fields of grain and a definite source of food.* "2. Change from Hand to Machine Methods. — When people began to turn their attention to farming they began to devise tools to aid them in their work. Various kinds of hoes, crude plows, sickles and scythes were invented, but were practically all hand tools. Work with these was necessarily very laborious and slow. The hours of labor in con - sequence were very long, and the social position of the tiller of the soil rlow. He was in every sense of the term 'the man with the hoe.' became prematurely old and bent; his lot was anything but enviable. "For more than 3,000 years the farmers of Europe, and in this coun - try until after the Revolutionary war. used the same crude tools and primitive methods as were employed by the Egyptians and the Israelites. In fact, it has been, relatively speaking, only a few years since the change from hand to machine methods took place. In the Twelfth Census Report the following statement is made: 'The year 1850 practi - cally marks the close of the period in which the only farm implements and machinery, other than the wagon cart and cotton gin. were those which, for want of a better designation, may be called implements of hand production.' </seg>
            <seg id="p243">240 NEBRASKA STATE BOARD (IK AfJRHll.TIRK "McMaster, in his 'History of the People of the United States,' says: 'The Massachusetts farmer who witnessed the Revolution plowed his land with the wooden bull plow, sowed his grain broadcast, and when it was ripe cut it with a scythe and threshed it out on his barn floor with a flail. 1 He writes further that the poor whites of Virginia in 1790 lived in log huts 'with the chinks stuffed with clay; the walls had no plaster, the windows had no glass, the furniture was such as they themselves had made. Their grain was threshed by driving horses over it in the open field. When they ground it they used a rude pestle and mortar, or placed it in a hollow of a stone and beat it with another.' "3. Effects of the Change. — At any rate, a great change has taken place, and all in a little over a half century. This great change from the sim - plest of tools to the modern, almost perfect implements, has produced a marked effect upon the life of the farmer. He is no longer 'the man with the hoe,' but a man well trained intellectually. "4. Physical and Mental Changes. — It is not difficult to realize that a great change for the better has taken place in the physical and mental nature of the farmer. It is vastly easier for a man to sit on a modern harvester, watch the machine and drive the team than it is to work all day with bended back, shuffling along, running a cradle. How much easier it is to handle the modern crop, though much larger, with the modern threshing machine, where the bundles are simply thrown into the feeder, than to spend the entire winter beating the grain out witB a flail. The farmer can now do his work and still have time to plan his business and to think of improvements. "6. Length of the Working Day. — One of the marked effects of the change to modern machinery methods has been a shortening of the length of the working day. When the work was done by hand methods, the day during the busy season was from early morn till late at night. Often as much as sixteen hours a day were spent in the fields. Now field work seldom exceeds ten hours a day. E Increase in Wage*. — According to McMastpr,* in 1794, 'in the states of Pennsylvania' the wages of the common laborer were not to $3 per month, and 'in Vermont good men were employed for £1* per year.' Even as late as 1849 the wages, according to several author - ities, did not exceed $120 a year. Under present conditions the farm laborer is able to demand two, three and even five times as much. In countries where hand methods are still practiced wages are very low. Men are required to work all day from early morning till late at night for a few cents. In some of the Asiatic countries it is said that men work from four in the morning until nine at night for 14 cents. Women receive only 9 or 10 cents and children 7 or 8 cents. "7. The Labor of Women. — Woman, so history relates, was the first •McMaster: "History of the People of the United States," vol. II p. 179. </seg>
            <seg id="p244">241 crops. She was required to help more or less with the farm work as long as the hand methods remained. Machinery has relieved her of nearly all field work. Not only this, but many of the former household duties have been taken away. Spinning and weaving, soap-making and candle-making, although formerly household duties, are now turned over to the factory. Butter and cheese making are gradually becoming the Eof the factory rather than that of the home. Sewing ma-hines, ig machines, cream separators, and numerous other inventions have to aid the housewife with her work. Knentage of Population on Farms. — During the change from hand ne methods there was a great decrease in the percentage of e of the United States living upon the farms. It has been esti - mated that in 1800, 97 per cent of the people were to be found upon the farms. By 1849 this proportion had decreased to 90 per cent, and ac - cording to the Twelfth Census Report it was only 35.7 per cent. "9. Increase in Production. — Notwithstanding this decrease in the per cent of the people upon the farms, there has been, since the introduction of machinery, a great increase in production per capita. In 1800 it ia estimated that 5.50 bushels of wheat were produced per capita; in 1850, according to the Division of Statistics of the Department of Agriculture, production had decreased to 4.43 bushels. This was before the effect of harvesting machinery had begun to be felt. People were leaving the farms and the production of wheat per capita was falling off. The limit with hand methods had been reached. Economists were alarmed lest a time should come when the production would not supply the needs of the people. Through the aid of machinery the production increased to 9.16 bushels per capita in 1880, 7.48 bushels in 1890, and 8.66 bushels in 1900. Perhaps this also shows that the maximum production of wheat per capita with present machinery has been reached The production of corn has also increased, but the increase is not so marked. The pro - fction of corn per capita in 1850 was 25.53 bushels; in 1900 it was 4 bushels. I). Cost of Production. — Although the cost of farm labor has doubled bled, the cost of production has decreased. According to the Thir - i Annual Report of the Department of Labor, the amount of labor pil to produce a bushel of wheat by hand was 3 hours and 3 min - and now it is only 9 minutes and 58 seconds. The cost of produc - tion, as compiled by Quaintance,* was 20 cents by hand (1829-30) and 10 cents by machinery (1895-96). It is also stated in the Year Book of b Department of Agriculture for 1899 that it formerly required 11 s of man labor to cut and cure one ton of hay. Now the same work [■omplished in 1 hour and 39 minutes. The cost of the required labor • The Influence of Farm Machinery on Production and Labor. Pub - lications of the American Economic Association, vol. V, No. 4. </seg>
            <seg id="p245">242 has decreased from tti cents to IHV* cents a ton. Not only is it true that machinery has revolutionized the work of making hay, but nearly every phase of farm work has been essentially changed. "11. Quality of Products. — Machinery has also improved the quality of farm products Corn and other grains are planted at very nearly the proper time, owing to the fact that machinery methods are so much quicker. By hand methods the crop did not have time to mature. It was necessary to begin the harvest before the grain was ripe, and hence it was shrunken. The grain is obtained now cleaner and purer. It would be difficult at the present time to sell, for bread purposes, grain which had been threshed by the treading of animals over it. tl2. Summary. — Great changes can be accounted for by the introduc - of machine methods for hand methods. For all people this has been beneficial. It has caused the rise of our great nation on the western hemisphere. To no class, however, has this change been more beneficial than to the farm worker himself. J. R. Dodge summarized the benefits &lt;lerivpr| by Hip farm worker when he wrote: 'As to the influence of machinery on farm labor, all intelligent, expert observation declares it beneficial. It has relieved the laborer of much drudgery; made his work and his hours of service shorter; stimulated his mental faculties; given an equilibrium of effort to mind and body; made the laborer a more efficient worker, a broader man and a better citizen.'* E Conditions in America have been very favorable for the develop - t of machinery. We have never had an abundance of farm labor. American inventor has surpassed all other in his ability to devise hines. By this machinery the farmer receives good compensation for his services and is able to compete on foreign markets with cheap" labor of other countries." Kie author of the above has said, social development on the farm e hand in hand with the development of farm machinery, and. i the development from 1850 to 1885 was great, there have been as great if not greater changes in the past twenty years. The tendency of the first improvement in farm implements was to do by power what men had been doing by hand; i. p., machines were devised to mow and rake the hay and to harvest and thresh the grain. Now, the desire of the inventors is to increase the work which one man can do in one operation, as to cultivate two rows of corn at once; load the manure into the wagon and spread it on the fields: unload the corn and put It into the cribs, etc. The financial benefit to the farmer by the use of this modern machinery is great, but this cannot be said to be more than half the benefit derived, for now the farmer's hours in the field are shorter and the work is comparatively light. He no longer has to hobble through the soft ground following the smoothing harrow until he is so tired that the evening meal is not enjoyed and the first hours of slumber •American Farm Labor in Rept. Ind. Com. (1901), vol. XI, p 111 </seg>
            <seg id="p246">243 fortahly over the field on his harrow cart and when evening time comes go whistling homeward. The supper is then eaten in a happy, jovial manner and the evening is spent reading or planning the work for the morrow. This is the case not only with the smoothing harrow, but it is also true of all classes of machinery. § Among the various types of machines which have made the moat ancement toward easing and reducing the labors of the farmer within past twenty years, the following may be considered: i Machinery: inure spreaders, arrow carts, •ro-row cultivators &gt;rn harvesters. &gt;rn picker huskers italo machinery, ay loaders. Farmstead Equipment Barn equipment. Wagon dumps. Elevators. Water systems. Heavy Machinery Kreshing machinery rn shellers. Feed cutter Steam plow Gasoline engine FIELD MACHINERY Manure .Spreaders.— Fertilizer distributors where power was utilized to do the work were first introduced about ISM, From then until the present day improvements have been made until we now have the modern mam: re spreader, a tra'hine which not only lessens the labor of man much, but one vhich excels man in the quality of the work done. A man spreading manure by hand will always throw out chunks just as they were thrown into the wagon. These chunks then fire-fang and are of only about one-half the value to the land which they should be. By the use of the spreader, the manure is not only torn into fine par - ticles, but it is evenly distributed on the ground. It Is hard to give the real value of a manure spreader to the average farm, but it Is safe to say that every one hundred twenty-five loads of manure hauled out with it will pay the first cost. Many men refrain from the use of a spreader because of the heavy draft. Under no conditions should such an excuse bar a man from the use of so valuable a machine. However </seg>
            <seg id="p247">244 r irst — The average spreader holds two tons of nianurp, which makes Second — If the sills of the spreader are parallel with the ground, the load must be drawn toward the cylinder, hence we have a team moving two tons and a heavy wagon over the soft ground, while, at the same time, this team moves the two tons over the sills of the spreader, making a load of four tons, exclusive of the machine itself. Third — The cylinder has to grind the load up; that is, pulverize It. Fourth — The cylinder must raise the load up and throw it out rfth — The load, as it passes back to the cylinder rubs between the boards and adds friction. having the front end of the apron and sills of the spreader higher n the rear end the load is fed to the cylinder on a down grade, thus reducing the draft slightly. By having the rear end of the side boards slightly fartther apart than the front end, the friction between the ma - nure and the side boards will be reduced as soon as the load starts toward the cylinder. However, by such an arrangement, the efficiency of the spreader is reduced. The same results can be obtained by throwing the manure into the center of the spreader and only permitting a small amount of loose stuff to reach the side boards. This, again, in the same manner is referred to above, deprives the spreader of some of its greatest benefits, that is, it does not pulverize the manure as well as it should and neither does it spread it on the ground uniformly. By gazing over a field where a man has loaded his machine In the above manner it will be observed that the manure seems to be spread in rows. Much better results will be obtained from a spreader if the load is evenly distributed over the spreader apron and well tramped down, and the feed set to carry the load very slowly, than to have the load thrown in loosely and the feed set to run fast. By having the cylinder of the spreader set low so that the manure is simply rolled out and not raised as it is thrown out is another method of reducing the draft. However, ii will be seen at once that the manure is not likely to be as well pulverized as when the cylinder is well up. In considering the return apron versus the endless apron, there is not a great deal to be said. As a rule, the frame should be heavier and better braced for the endless apron than for the return apron In either case, however, It is im - portant that the frame be so constructed that it will not twist and bind on the apron. Just a slight twist in the frame will cause the apron to bind enough to increase the draft fifty per cent. The fifth wheel is an important feature of the manure spreader. Theoretically, it should be a ball and socket joint. By having such a joint there is no tendency whatever for the frame to twist. A joint of this type, though, is almost impossible to make so that it will not give trouble. A large fifth wheel if! the strongest, but it in turn causes the frame to twist on uneven ground. Most manufacturers are now using a fifth wheel about fourteen Inches in diameter. </seg>
            <seg id="p248">245 spreader is simply a wagon box set upon a set of wagon gears, the spreading device being driven in a manner similar to .that of an end - gate seeder. Such spreaders are to be recommended to the man With such a small farm that he feels that he is not warranted in purchasing gf machine. On large farms the spreader should always be ready ?diate use and it is much more economical to use it every day, ere would be the necessity of having a special wagon gear for -box spreader and then the first cost would be nearly as much jf a complete machine. Harrow Carts. — Harrowing is probably the most tiresome of all field labor. It is one of those weary, uninteresting tasks on the farm which have had a tendency to drive so many boys from the farm to the city, and no wonder. The work is dusty, disinteresting, requires no skill and makes a man feel that the world is all against him whenever he has to do it. Wherever possible, there should be an attempt to make such a task pleasant, especially if the boy has to do it, even at the cost of additional horse power. With a careful boy driving, a pony can often be ridden behind the harrow and thus transfer the tiresome. dusty walking from man to beast. This practice, however, is a trifle dangerous, since the pony can easily step into the harrow. Likewise there is danger of the horses becoming tangled if the boy rides one of the team. The harrow cart is the simplest and easiest method, and i in- expenditure of ihe t&lt;n or fifteen dollars which it requires to purchase one should not be regretted. Even if it is impossible to buy one, a few minutes only will be required to make one from a pair of cultivator wheels or even the cultivator itself may be dismantled so that there are only the wheels, frame and seat left, which may be used for a cart. Fico-Uow Cultivators. — A large per cent of our city friends believe farming is simply a grind of unskilled labor and that any one farm. This is far from the truth. It requires experienced men to select and carefully handle the live stock, also to make a success of grain raising, and now more than ever it requires experts to handle farm machinery properly. Everything possible should be done to keep the farmer from getting tired. No man who is physically exhausted can have the best control of his mental resources, and to operate our modern farm machinery efficiently requires both skill and experience. This is probably more true in regard to the two-row cultivator than any other machine. Some men say they can do better work with a two-row culti - vator than with a single-row. Such a statement cannot be true, although they can probably do as good work with it as with the one-row, providing the following conditions are complied with: If the corn is listed, care must be exerted in the listing that the rows are straight and of a uni - form distance apart. A good method to follow is to throw up the ridges with a lister, then follow with a two-row drill. Under no conditions </seg>
            <seg id="p249">246 cultivate his corn to kill the weeds. Cultivate the corn to benefit the corn and while so doing kill the weeds. If the corn is checked, care must be exerted in driving the planter straight and then more care must be used in getting the corn in check. If the corn is not in perfect check it is impossible to guide the cultivator so that it will be doing its best work. The gangs of shovels will cut the corners as they travel from one hill to another in a zigzag path, hence, if the shovels are set to do perfect work on straight rows they will not do as good work on crooked ones. No matter how skilled the operator is, one shovel will pass too close to the hill, while the corresponding shovel in the opposite gang will be too far from the hill. In operating a two-row cultivator it is essential that a steady team be used, that is, one which will need no attention whatever. In selecting the implement, notice that all levers are handy; that the guides are such that the gangs will respond quickly and through a good distance, The machine should be simple, yet have enough to it so that each set of gangs can be operated independently. Corn Harvesters. — The present day corn harvester has become so pop - ular in so short a time that It is nearly forgotten that twenty-five years ago all corn was rut by hand and only about twenty years ago it took two men a good, long day to cut and set up six acres with a sled corn cutter. Now one man alone will cut nine acres with ease, and in a long day he will cut ten or more acres. In 1890, D. M. Osborn t&gt; Co. introduced a corn harvester to the public. This was about seventeen years ago, and now nearly every half section of land in the corn belt has one. LCorn Pickers and Hunkers. — It can safely be said that there has ■er been as much money spent in endeavoring to develop any other farm implement as has been spent in an endeavor to get a practical corn picker. Although thousands and thousands of dollars have been spent it is only within the last two years that a machine has been produced which was in the least effectual. For the past two years machines have been in use in the central states with a fairly good degree of success. Last year a few machines were tried in this state with partial success. If the machine can be used in the field at just the right time; that is. when the corn is all standing and the stalks are not too brittle, it seems to be a complete success. The farmer can now raise much more corn than he can gather and instead of being limited in the number of acres he can tend, he is limited by the amount he can harvest. When the corn picker-husker becomes a success, and it undoubtedly will be a success in the near future, the hardest and severest work remaining to the farmer will be eliminated. Potatoe Machinery. Since the advent of harvesters, there has probably been no machine which has relieved the specialty farmer of the disa - greeable work more than the Introduction of our modern potato machin - ery. In the past one man has been required to furrow out the ground to receive the seed potatoes, six or seven follow with sacks or baskets on their arms dropping the tubers and finally another man to follow </seg>
            <seg id="p250">247 tall of this work in the same length of time, and the chances are that th four horses will do all of this work in the same length of time. It will he done better. By the use of the two-row planter, one man with four horses will nearly double the work in the same length of time. There are three systems of drops in potato planters now in general i'se. They are: a set of revolving spikes which are so designed that the spikes pass up through the hopper of seed potatoes and, as they pass through, each spike spears a cutting and carries it over to the dropping spout, where it is removed by a small arm and allowed to fall into the ground. The second device is to have a system of small buckets on an endless chain pass up through the potatoes and each bucket receive a piece of the seed. These seed pieces are then carried to the dropping spout and dropped into the ground. The distance apart thai the seeds are placed in the ground is regulated by the speed of the buckets or the distance they are from each other on the chain. The third device is a system of valves working in a drum in such a manner that as they pass through the potatoes one piece is selected from the rest and enclosed in a pocket until it reaches the dropping spout, where it is released and allowed to fall into the ground. The two former methods have become standards for dropping potatoes, while the latter is yet new to this country and as yet only in its experimental Successful potato diggers are most efficient as well as economical machines for the potato grower. Digging potatoes with the hoe or fork was the only means of getting all of the tubers, but it was slow and very hard work. Plowing them out with the common stirring plow or litter was much faster, but a large per cent of the potatoes were left in the ground. Even with the plow and lister it was a slow and ■me process to so ovp r ' hp furrows and the ground to get all of the potatoes possible. Although there are yet some improvements to make to the potato digger, it is even now both a time and labor saver. As with the potato planter, there are three general plans in use for tthe potatoes. One method, which is cheap and to be recom - only to the man who raises a few acres of potatoes, is the use chine which resembles the lister, except that the moldboard is removed and a set of rods put in its place, the share plows under the potatoes raising them with the dirt up onto the rods. These rods which are kept in continual vibration, permit the dirt to fall through, but hold the potatoes so that they fall on the top of the ground. The second type of machine, and one which is much more expensive, is known as an elevior prader. A blade goes beneath the potatoes and dirt, raising them onto an endless wire apron. As the mixture passes up the apron the dirt falls through while the potatoes pass up onto a set of rods which separate them from the trash. A third type, which </seg>

This device, although more expensive than the second method mentioned, has an advantage over it in that the potatoes are not elevated so high, con - sequently not so much energy is lost. Ffay Loaders. — The real value of hay loaders in large fields is under - oated. This is especially true in handling alfalfa. By the use of hay loader and hay fork the whole crop of hay can be put into the barn without touching it with the hand fork. Alfalfa, to be well cured and not burnt, should be as far as possible cured in the windrow. By the use of the side delivery rake it can be allowed to partly cure in the swath, then be thrown into a light windrow where the air can circulate through it, drying it quite uniformly without parching the leaves so that they will fall off perceptibly. The less alfalfa hay can be handled after it is cured the better. To load it with the fork it has to be bunched, then pitched onto the wagon. To load it with the hay loader it can be taken direct from the swath to the wagon. Not only is it better to handle alfalfa with a hay loader but It is cheaper. Assuming that it costs the same to prepare the hay for loading by hand that it does with the loader, the following figures will give a fair comparison of the expense of putting the hay into the wagon by the two methods. On an average, it takes two men about fifty minutes to put on a load of hay by hand. This means one man's time for one hour and forty minutes, or one and two-thirds hours. For one hundred tons this would mean one hundred and sixty-six hours, which, at twenty cents per hour, would be thirty-three dollars and twenty cents. In hay which will make only one ton per acre a man and boy will put on a load with a loader in twenty minutes or less, generally less. This is the equivalent of one man's time for thirty minutes for one ton; for one hundred tons it amounts to three thousand minutes or fifty hours At twenty cents per hour this will amount to ten dollars, or a saving of twenty-three dollars and twenty cents on one hundred tons. A man who has one hundred acres of alfalfa should pay for a loader in one year with ease. There are two general types of hay loaders. They are the rake loaders and the cylinder loaders. Inasmuch as the rake loaders have a beating motion, they tend to knock the leaves from the stems of alfalfa, while the cylinder loaders with cleated apron carriers scarcely disturb the hay as ;t is taken from the windrow to the load. FARMSTEAD EQUIPMENT. Born Equipment. — To the farmer who puts all of his hay in the barn the modern hay fork with car and track has been a boon. In the old barns a mammoth driveway was required and always two men in the mow and, as the hay became higher so that the pitchers could not throw it back, the third man was was required, and even then with t Vi p mow About full the h&amp; v w&amp;s of tpn thrown unon &amp; spaffol d ftorl from </seg>

Compare such conditions with the present, where never more than two men are required in the mow, one on the load and one to drive the fork team. Never, for more than half of the lime is there need of more than one man in the mow, and often the mow can be half filled without having any one to throw the bay around. Not only is the number ot men now lessened, but the amount of heavy work done by each man is reduced to a minimum; also the time required for unloading has been reduced several hundred per cent. A few figures can well be used to illustrate the actual saving by the present methods. Assuming that on an average only two men be required in the mow where there is no hay fork, then the work being done is two men in the mow for thirty minutes and one on the load for the same length of time or one man's time for one and one - half hours. If one hundred tons are put into the mow, one hundred times one and one-half, which equals one hundred and fifty hours, have been spent in caring for tbe hay. This at twenty cents per hour equals thirty dollars. By means of the hay fork the same three men could have done the same work in about six minutes and it would have been only good exercise for them. Three men for six minutes equals one man for eighteen minutes and for one hundred tons equals eighteen times one hundred, which equals eighteen hundred minutes or thirty hours. This at twenty cents per hour comes to six dollars, and makes • saving of twenty-four dollars in cost of labor besides making the labor much easier. Wagon Dumps and Elevators. — The ease with which the farmer has unloaded his corn when he has hauled it to the elevator has long ap - pealed to him as a method which he would like to utilize on his farm. The implement manufacturer has answered this appeal by putting at the disposal of the farmer the wagon dump and elevator. There is not much to say pertaining to the wagon dump and elevator from a mechan - ical standpoint. They are simple, easy to care for and a great labor saver, just at the time when man is the weariest. The important point to be considered in regard to them is their installation. First. They should be installed where they will fill the entire crib without being moved. Second. They should be so. devised that the seed corn may be selected from the crib corn as it passes to the crib. This might not seem essential, but to the seed corn grower it is important and to the average farmer who has large corn fields it will save lots of time. A good way to have the elevator installed, so that seed corn can be selected as the corn passes to the crib, is to have the corn delivered to a conveyer which is located near the comb of a double crib. Have a bin to receive the seed corn near the end of the crib beside the dump. Then the man who is unloading his corn can stand in the comb of the crib beside the conveyor and opposite the seed corn bin and select the ■oAii pflrs &amp;s t \\f v com p &amp;lonc &amp;Dd si low t h t* crib corn to rninn &amp;lon sr to </seg>

Water si/stems. — H took the contractor thousands of years to learn thai every time the hod carrier went to the top of a five-story building and returned he had wasted one-half horse power. Should it take the in farmer with his high degree of Intelligence as much longer iu learn that every time he carries a paii of water one hundred feet and returns that he has wasted over one-tenth horse power? Of course ire tank in the cellar is far more satisfactory than any other M for distribution on the farm. By the use of such a system a Lot water boiler can be connected to the range; a bath tub can be in - stalled on the second floor, hydrants may be placed in the yard, pres - !&gt;&lt;■ had for flushing the milk-house floors, also the horse and Malls as well as the feeding floors for the hogs. What is more, a fairly efficient tire protection may be had. To make water handy around the jards it is not essential that a pressure tank be used, although a system with it can be much more complete If the stock tank Is on an elevation and the well is in a hollow, hydrants may be connected along the pipe from the well to the tank so that water can be drawn off at the various yards, calf lots. hog lots. etc. With such a system, oik tank acts as stand pipe and storage tank. If the pipe leading fiom the well to the stock tank does not lead through the lots, pipes i&gt;-d off from the tank to the various points where water is ainl otherwise would have to be carried HKAVY MACHINERY The greatest advancements which have been made to reduce labor in the use of heavy machinery have been made in the cornshellers, threshing machines, huskens and shredders, steam plows and gasoline engines. The advancements in all of the above machines excepting the last have been along the line of reducing the number of men needed to perform pertain tasks rather than to lighten their individual exertion. By the use of the extended conveyor on a cornsheller, two men can with ease keep a four - hole sheller supplied with corn from morning irntil night. Also, if the crib is pro|ierly designed, the sheller does not need to be moved until all of the corn in the crib has been run through. In placing the crib. It is also desirable to set it so that the corn can be run into the granary or grain bin direct from the sheller spout. By having the above sug - gestions carefully worked out and put into use. the labor of three men can be saved during the time the shelling is being done. iking Miu -hitter p.- The cost per bushel for threshing has not been reduced to the farmer within the past few years, but the amount of extra help needed while threshing has been very greatly reduced and thus a great saving made to the farmer.

At the straw stack end of the sepa - rator there is a still greater saving of men, since it formerly took four men to care for the straw, now it takes only one and he is generally b separator man. Hence, where it used to require fourteen men to a separator running, it now requires only seven or eight, being luction of from 43 to 53 per cent. •Steam Plows. — To the farmer who has great fields of wheat to plow, harrow and also to drill, the steam plow has become quite a time saver. Not only does it reduce the time required for preparing the seed bed. but it also reduces the cost nearly fifty per cent. Where fuel is cheap and water handy, the cos' of plowing by steam should not be over 75 cents per acre. Where the conditions are not so favorable, this often runs up to $1.25 per acre, but it should never exceed $1.50. If the fields are large enough, harrows and drills may be attached behind the plow Kf sumI t:ed prepared and the seed placed in the ground at one on. Where coal and water are high, gasoline traction engines ten be used in place of the steam traction at a very good ad Kne Engines. — The gasoline engine has become a very popular for the farmer, in some cases it has become too popular, that rs have purchased them more out of curiosity than as a neces - sary machine and now they have them on their hands without any special place for them. Again, there are a great many farmers who should have them but do not. It is by no means the least of the virtues of the gasoline engine that its presence makes farm life more attractive to the boys and thus helps to keep them on the farm. There seems to be an inborn spirit in human beings and especially in those of the male sex to have an ever-present desire for handling wheels or something which moves. Let a man be placed in a great museum where curiosities from all countries are gathered, and he will wander about gazing at the novelties and reading the legends for hours without even a thought of touching anything, but let him approach a wheel and there seems to be no rower in existence which can keep him from trying the wheel to tee if it will turn. It is the same way with a machine which will propel itself — there is something entrancing about it. something which gives the boy who has an opportunity to work with it new life. Let the boy have an engine and so many hours every week to himself with it and in the course of a few years, if he has any mechanical genius at all, he will have done enough work about the farm with it to pay the first cost and. what is more, the boy will have learned to have confidence in himnelf. He will learn that it does not take a skilled mechanic to hang shafting, that an emery wheel stand can be made on the farm as well as in the factory, that if the farm buildings are properly arranged the gaaoline engine can be made to do on stormy days what the job shelter and grist mill men do when the work is rushing, and many other things </seg>
            <seg id="p255">252 which to him hare seemed to be works that can only be done after I There are two general types of gasoline engines, the two-cycle and four-cycle. The two-cycle engine has one impulse to each revolution of the fly-wheels, while the four-cycle has only one impulse to each two revolutions of the flywheels. The cycle of a gasoline engine does not mean a revolution of the flywheels, but does mean the actions fthe gases within the cylinder until a repetition takes place. That is, the four-cycle engine one stroke of the piston is required to draw the charge, another stroke compresses it, while the third stroke, which is the only working stroke of the engine, allows the gas to burn and expand, and then the fourth stroke clears the cylinder of all burnt gases, making it ready for the next stroke, which is the suction stroke again. Thus it will be noticed there are four strokes of the piston to one cycle of operations of the gas. Since there is only one working stroke of the engine out of four strokes, the flywheels have to be suffi - ciently large to store energy received from this stroke to carry them on the remaining three strokes. The two-cycle engine requires only two strokes of the piston to complete the cycle, but the actions of the gas in this style of engine are such that more skill is required to handle it. Since the two-cycle engine receives one impulse for each revolution, the fly -wheels can lie much lighter, also the size of the cylinder smaller. Gasoline engines do not have as steady motion as steam engines, for the steam engines receive one impulse every stroke of the piston or two impulses for each revolution of the fly-wheels. Because of the fact that it takes from one-half to three-fourths hours to steam up and start a steam engine, while it only takes from one-half to three-fourths minutes to start a gasoline engine, the latter is vastly preferable to the former for general farm use. Many farmers are making the mistake of installing too small an engine. A small engine cannot be used for enough pur - poses. If the engine is to be used only for churning, separating milk and pumping water for the house and stock, a one and one-half horse power or two horse i&gt;owpr is sufficiently large, but these uses should be only about one-half of the purposes for which an engine can be advantageously used. Use the engine for grinding feed, husking and shredding the corn, shelling, cleaning seed, running an emery wheel, Ei besides these there are many more. Where shelling, feed grinding i such work are to be done with the same engine that pumps the ter and runs the milk separator, a six horse power is to be recom - mended. Of course, an engine of that horse power is too small to run a four-hole sheller, but it will run a three-hole sheller, also a grinder which has a capacity of fifty bushels per hour. For. shelling with a four-hole sheller, doing commercial work, it is advisable to use a ten - horse engine, although an eight-horse will do the work if the corn is in good condition. For commercial threshing nothing less than a twenty - five or thirty horse power engine should be used. </seg>

Arrange the kitchen so that everything will be handy and don't be afraid of getting it too small unless it is to be used as a living room. In regard to the kitchen, in such cases the size should be regulated by the number in the family. VS herever possible, the kitchen should be on the west side of the house so that during the hot summer mornings it can be jiade much cooler and pleasanter place for the wife to do her work. Ar - range handy places lor the utensils with plenty of cupboards and cabinet room. Where a farmer can afford it, a water system can be installed and it need not necessaril) he very expensive. Put up a supply lank either out - side the house, or in, and connect it up with piping to the windmill or gasoline engine and connect an overflow pipe with the watering tank in barn lot.

I'or building a barn, have the mow in the right proportion to the numlier of head of stock the barn will accommodate: that is, do not make a great hay mow that will hold more hay than will be consumed by the that can lie staliled in or adjoining the barn. A large mow is all right if one intends telling hay and uses the mow to stock it, but to haul hay and put it into a barn and then haul It out and throw it around to slock is a waste of time.

It is Impossible for a farmer to tell how profitably his farming operations are carried on without scales. One of the greatest leaks, or we might say the most wasteful opera - tion, carried on by the average Nebraska farmer is the neglect given the implements of the farm. From the best of authority it is said that fully 75 per cent of the fanning tools used in Nebraska rot and rust out for the want of proper care and protection. A great saving can be made by the Nebraska farmer, who has no tool-house, If he will erect one of suf - ficient size to hold the tools used upon the farm and see to it that the tools are cleaned and oiled and put away in good shape so they will tie ready for business the next time wanted for use. </seg>

This subject, il seems to me, is one of the moat Important discussed before the farmers' institutes, because all phases of agriculture are pri - marily dependent on the soil. The soil is the fundamental factor in crop production. If a man goes to buy a farm the tirst question he asks is, "What kind of a soil has this farm?" Yet so many followers of agricul - ture in Nebraska and the midddle west, knowing that nature gave us a soil cecond to none in fertility in its virgin state, seem to be laboring under the impression that it is inexhaustible and can be cropped continuously year after year to corn, wheat and oats and will never wear out. It has been said that the American people are the greatest sail robbers in the world. They call themselves developers of the country. Hereto - fore the custom has been to settle on a piece of land, clear the timber off and burn it up, if it be in a timbered country, impoverish the soil by, skimming it until it fails to respond then move on west and start over again. But there is now no more west to go to, practically all of the good land has been taken and it is up to the Nebraska farmer to take, care of the land so as to not only retain the virgin fertility, but even add E stern Nebraska there are many farms that today will not produce in half what they produced when first broken. They have been continually to corn, and the crop marketed through the elevator. The corn-stalks have been burned up instead of being allowed to rot and mix with the soil, thereby putting back some of the fertility that was taken out by the growing crop, and very often the manure that Is produced has been hauled and dumped into the creek to get it out of the way, many thinking manure detrimental to the land. And this idea arises from the fact that very often manure is not applied in the right way. Many farms in Nebraska are going the same route that the now deserted farms of New England, New York, Virginia and some other sec - tions of the east have gone. In the New England states and Virginia there are thousands of farms abandoned because the soil will no longer produce crops to pay for the labor and expense expended. It is estimated that there are 12,000 of such farms in the state of New York. And at E time* many of these farms were just as productive as Nebraska farms today. Many farmers in the central states and practically all farmers in the east are required to spend several dollars per acre annually for com - mercial fertilizers to make the land produce paying crops. We will be BY &gt; . (&gt;. MABHUAIX, U.NCUL.N. </seg>
            <seg id="p262">259 We must stop taking from the soil year after year and pot nothing back. It will become exhausted just the same as a bank account will become exhausted by checking on it unless a deposit is made occasionally. We must market our corn in the form of live stock instead of selling to the elevator. By this method all of the grain and roughage is consumed on the farm, and if the manure is taken care of and returned to the land we return to the soil between 90 and 95 per cent of the fertility taken from it by the growing crop. The other 5 to 10 per cent can more than be made up for by a proper rotation with legumes and grasses. The legume having the faculty of taking the free nitrogen of the air and plac - ing it in the soil through the bacteria nodules on Its roots will keep the nitrogen supply replenished and if we were compelled to buy It on the open market in the form of nitrates it would be very expensive. The manure and rotting roots form humus which makes the soil spongy and capable of holding more water and also helps to dissolve and make avail - able other elements necessary to plant growth by the decomposition. There are other elements that are necessary to plant growth such as potash and phosphorus, but our soil chemists tell us that most of our Nebraska soils have an abundance of these elements and that if we keep plenty of humus and nitrogen in our soils that it will probably be a good many years before we will have to buy commercial fertilizers. And when we can supply these without anv outlay of money and at the same time make the leguminous crops pay as large a return as any other crop we can grow, why should we have worn out land? We must not only retain what fertility we now have, but we must make our land more productive for in fifty years, according to the pres - ent rate of increase in population we will be a nation of 200.000,000 peo - ple and these people will have to be fed and clothed from the same acres </seg>

( Substance of an address delivered before the Franklin County Farmers' Institute and other farmers' institutes in Nebraska during the season of 1908.) It may seem strange, in a comparatively new state, with a compara - tively untouched soil, that one should be called upon to speak on methods for conserving and increasing the fertility of the soil. But let me Justify myself a little. New England Is thickly dotted with abandoned farms, farms that have been abandoned because under the old methods of cul - tivation it did not pay to cultivate them any more. I believe that if a hundred years ago someone had gone to New England and talked upon conserving and increasing the fertility of the soil, and the New England farmers had listened to his words, New England farms would today be productive and profitable. Those beautiful eastern slopes of the Blue Ridge mountains in Virginia, that used to produce the finest tobacco in the world, are today good for nothing except scenery. If someone had gone to Virginia seventy-five years ago and discussed this subject there, and the Virginia planters had heeded his words, Virginia would still be growing the imcomparable tobacco of the olden time. Kentucky, where they are burning tobacco warehouses and harrying the tobacco growers, is already suffering from impoverishment of the soil. If they had learned how to preserve their fertility they would have something else to do today than to burn warehouses. There are thousands of acres fn cen - tral Illinois that used to produce the most remarkable corn in the coun - try, where today corn cannot be successfully grown. Here in Nebraska. we are already seeing indications of an approaching exhaustion of the soil. In the eastern glaciated portion of the state, where the land is rolling, and the glacier has heaped up hills and cut out valleys, the most fertile part of the soil, by our crude agricultural methods has been either exhausted or washed into the Missouri river. Orer the great loess plains, that cover the central portion of the state, plains that were originally Incomparable in their fertility, making them the garden spot of the world, the same methods are producing the same results. It is high time that we began to study methods for conserving the soil. The wealth etion. the prosperity of any state, depends upon the prosperity of re. and there can be no such thing as agricultural prosperity with erished soil. In this connection I wish to call your attention to a remarkable article by Mr. Samuel W. Allerton of Illinois which appeared in the Satur </seg>
            <seg id="p264">261 day Evening Post for January 4th of this year. I wish that every person within the sound of my voice might read that article. The significance of the impoverishment of the soil has so impressed itself upon Mr. Aller - ton's mind that he has determined to devote the remainer of his life arousing public sentiment in America, with a view of preventing further soil exhaustion. Mr. Allerton is a successful farmer of several thousand acres in northern Illinois, therefore may be supposed to know what he is talking about. He begins his article by saying in substance, that the gravest economic question before the American public today Is not the question of the tariff, nor of an elastic currency, nor of the control of cor - porations, nor any of the other matters that are so freely discussed in newspaper editorials and political platforms of the day. He says that the gravest economic question that confronts the American public today is concerned with the wholesale robbery of the soil. In order to make this clear to you without being too technical, allow me to call your attention to a few facts. The principal chemical elements of fertility that exist in the soil are nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash. The average crop takes from the soil of an acre from thirty-live to seventy - five pounds of nitrogen, about twenty pounds of phosphoric acid, and from thirty-five to sixty pounds of potash. Here In Nebraska these elements are worth commercially as follows: Nitrogen, between 18 and 20 cents per pound: phosphoric add. between 15 and 18 cents per pound, and potash between 7 and 10 cents per pound. How long can any fanner draw, year by year, this amount from his soil and have sufficient left to grow a profitable crop? You have each of you an account In some bank. How long can you keep checking against that account without making an occasional deposit, and not have the banker turn down your checks? I hope none of you have passed through this humiliating experience. Nature holds for every farmer the most won - derful deposit for producing wealth, and you have been drawing on this deposit years without number, without making any additional deposits. How long do you imagine that this process can continue without having nature turn down your checks? I believe that It Is possible continually to crop this land, and at the same time to increase both its productlre - ri and Its fertility, and I wish to put before you as briefly as possl - the method by which I think that this may be done. At the outset, allow me to call your attention to one of the moat remarkable facts in the economy of nature. Mature animals make only a limited use of plant food. The part of your growing crop that animals consume Is that part that is produced by the sun and Is drawn from the air. The part that the plant draws from the soil Is practically useless as animal food. Nitrogen is not an animal food. The animal uses comparatively minute amounts of nitrogen, but it forms no part of the staple food of animals. Phosphoric acid Is not an animal food, neither is potash. If the growing crop should be fed in its' entirety to live stock upon the farm, the mature animals would return in their excretions </seg>
            <seg id="p265">262 NKKRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE nlnety-flve per cent of what the crop took from the soil. Growing animals ■would return somewhat less. If this should be carefully preserved and returned to the soil, the soil would receive ninety-five per cent of what the crop took from it. This brings me to the discussion of the use of farm manures, and right here I wish to utter a note of warning. I know that the large majority of the farmers of Nebraska are prejudiced against the use of farm manure, and I will state frankly that I have seen as much land rired by the use of farm manures as I have seen benefited. The bene - depends entirely upon the manner in which they are used. I wish you to take me exactly as I say, and then I will hold myself responsible for any mistakes that may occur in following my advice. But unless this is done, I cannot guarantee that in every instance farmers will receive the benefit that they hope to receive. In the first place, the value of farm manure depends entirely upon the thoroughness with which it is incorporated with the soil. By Incor - porated. I mean thoroughly mixed, one grain of soil, one grain of manure, etc. The ideal way to apply it, if it were not so expensive as to be pro - hibitory, would be to grind it as fine as flour, then it might be readily mixed with the soil. The next best thing is a manure spreader, but not every farmer can afford one of these, and has to use the old-fashioned arm-strong spreader. I wish to suggest a device that will put the me - chaniral manure spreader and the arm-strong spreader on the same basis, and that is the old-fashioned brush drag, that in the early days was the only harrow the pioneer had to use upon the new virgin soil of Nebraska. Take a stick of timber fourteen feet long, cut some mortises in it, and in these mortises fasten the limbs of trees with the brush all on. Then above these limbs place, what I regard as the indispensable part of every farm tool, a good seat, so that the weight of the driver may hold the brush to their work. Go over the land on which manure has been spread by either of the two methods mentioned above, and this brush drag will pulverize it and grind it up, and put it in condition for thoroughly mixing with the soil. This tool may be made by anybody at comparatively little expense, and it is my opinion that it will double the immediate value of any application of manure. In the next place, our Rhas a limited capacity to digest and assimilate, so to speak, the man - which is applied to it. If a heavier coat of manure is given to the soil than it can handle, it will result in damage to the soil, drying it up, burning it, as the farmers used to say. So the only way safely to apply manure, is to apply it in small quantities, and apply it often. In discussing manure, I discriminate between two different hinds. By stable manure, I mean the dropping of animals unmixed with rough - age. If there is roughage mixed with manure, it may be lightly shaken out with the fork so as to leave stable manure, consisting solely of the excrements of the animals. This stable manure should be applied to the ftoi 1 As fi/VkTi flu ff 1 \ c xn a H f* T t in t*i 0V1 in ti \ t rds^^yy a t\ H If \ t to iHvah q n </seg>

A neighbor of mine says that if you apply this stable maure as soon as it is made, as a top dressing for the soil, the fertility will evaporate. Non - sense. Nothing evaporates except the water that Is in it. You cannot evaporate nitrogen any more than you can evaporate clay. You cannot evaporate phosphoric acid any more than you can evaporate salt. You cannot evaporate potash any more than you can evaporate wood. What happens when it is spread upon the soil is, this stable manure loses its water, which will be replenished by the first shower. By so applying it and preventing its being lit aped up and given an opportunity for fer - mentation, you manage to sa\e the elements of fertility that are con - tained in it. By barnyard manure, I mean the waste roughage of the place that has been thoroughly decomposed, separated into its original elements by decay. Before going further with this matter, I wish to ask a few questions, and I want to ask you to be perfectly candid with me. I promise you to be perfectly candid with you, and as an evidence of my candor 1 will admit, at the outset, that 1 do not always tell the truth myself. When it comes to shooting prairie chickens or catching fish, anything that 1 may say on either of these subjects should be taken with a train of allowance, but when it comes to a matter of t vital importance as agriculture, 1 promise you to tell the- truth, and you to do the same with me. Emany of you burn your straw piles? Come, honest Injun, now, id, tell the truth — some of you do I see. A great many of yon do so. I want to live to' see the time when it will be a pen - y offense to burn a straw pile in the state of Nebraska. How many of you leave your straw piles to rot down where they are, which is almost as bad as burning them? How many of you move your stables or your corrals to get away from the manure heap? How many of you haul your manure into buffalo wallows or sloughs to get rid of it? I tell you that your hope and your salvation, as agriculturalists, lies in the despised, neglected manure heap. Let me suggest a way for making the most of it that you can. Not long ago I met a farmer from Nova Scotia, one of those shrewd old fellows that always shuts one eye when he is saying anything that he thinks is particularly shrewd. I asked him, "What is the principal crop that you raise in Nova Scotia?" He thought a long while, and then shut his eye so hard that I feared he might never be able to get the lids apart again, and answered, "Well, I think the principal crop raised is a good crop of manure. I keep a few cattle, and hogs, and sheep, to help make it, and when the crop is made I sell the cattle, the hogs and the sheep, and apply the manure to the soil." </seg>
            <seg id="p267">264 NKBRASKA STATE BOAB1) OF AOKIO1 l.Tl KK should make it as much of an object to raise, every year, the biggest possible crop of manure, as to raise a big crop of corn or wheat, or any other grain. Let me suggest a way in which you may do this, and utilize all the waste roughage of the farm. First grade, with plough and • ■i if mcwmj, about the barn lot in such a way that no water under any circumstances, wash across it. If the barn-lot is upon a slope, build a dyke across the lower end to prevent loss by leaching. Put eave-troughs up to prevent the roof water from washing the decom - posing mass. Then all the moisture that it gets it will get from the skies. Bed down the barn-lot with eighteen inches deep of straw or other waste roughage. Every night turn your cattle in upon it and let them tramp it and lie upon it. It will catch, absorb, and hold all their excrements, with the fertility which they contain. When it is tramped out fiat, put on another eighteen inches, and bo on throughout the winter, until in this way you have utilized all the waste roughage on the place. B Nebraska there are thousands upon thousands of acres of corn hat practically go to waste every year. 1 think I can show, before trough, that it will pay anyone to gather these dead, dry corn - haul them to the barn-lot and have them converted into manure animals. All this work will be done during the winter months le farmer has \ery little else to do. When spring comes he will have from two to four feet deep of thoroughly rotted, thoroughly decom - posed manure, over his barn-lot. This manure has a money value of more than three dollars to the ton. 1 know a farmer who has recently hauled out sixty loads of manure thoroughly rotted. This is worth, at the least calculation, $180.00. The entire work of hauling straw to the barn-lot, and of hauling out manure, would not amount to more than 80 hours of labor for one man. This would make $2.25 an hour wages for the man doing it. I think that any farmer in Nebraska can afford to cut up his old corn-stalks and haul them to the barnyard, if he is paid $2.25 an hour for doing it. I say that this manure should be thoroughly decomposed, because until thoroughly decomposed and rotted, the elements of fertility that that are in it are not available as plant food. The nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash, that is contained in this thoroughly rotted decomposed barn-lot manure, becomes available only when the process of decomposition has passed to its last stages. Now I would not undertake to say that this is a dry country. Every real estate agent would mob me if I said so, and every farmer who has land to sell would feel hostile to me. But I think you will all admit there are times when there is quite a little spell here in Nebraska be - tween showers. Roughage that is not thoroughly rotted and decomposed, besides lying inert in the soil and of no use as plant food, will rob the soil of needed moisture l&gt;ecause this moisture will be needed to com- Ethe process of decomposition. So that it is always unwise, for this &gt; alone, to plow under roughage that is not thoroughly rotted. </seg>

Fn shall this manure be applied? You can apply It any time to ■ound. Corn is a gross feeder, and a good coat of thoroughly manure will never work disaster In the cornfield, provided it is thoroughly incorporated with the soil. In some parts of the state It is not wise to manure the soil heavily where the succeeding crop Is Intended to be small grain, because then the straw graws so rank that the grain lodges before it fills, and consequently does not make a full crop. It Is also disastrous to attempt to raise root crops on freshly manured soli. An exception might possibly be made in the case of mangel wurzels. I know of no place where you can get such immediate and such large returns from an application of manure, as. you can when It Is applied as a top dressing for alfalfa You can get almost as great returns when it is applied as a top dressing for pasture. I am going to tell you a pretty big story of the effect of top dressing manure on pasture, but I pledge you that every word of it is true. During the month of January I was in an institute in the city of Blair. Nebraska, and while there I heard such wonderful stories of the success attending the operation of a small dairy farm that borders the city on the south - east that I hired a livery team and went out to see it. George Haller. until last spring, had been for twenty years a clerk In a drug store. He then bought a farm of 31 '4 acres, paying $7000.00 for it. bordering the city of Blair on the southeast. Twelve and one-half acres of this farm are given up to alfalfa, one-half acre Is devoted to garden and building spot. The remainder, eighteen and one-half acres, is pasture, tame grass pasture. This has bf-en regularly top dressed for a number of years. This pasture, during the last summer, carried twenty-seven head of cattle, three horses, five calves, twenty-five head of hogs, twelve geese and one hundred chickens all the time, and he had to mow It in August. You say you are from Missouri and will have to be shown. Well, go to Blair and Oorge Haller will show you as he showed me. When I told this storv to Professor Haecker of the state farm, he said to me.. "Pro - fessor, you may tell any institute in the state that I am doing practically the same thing with the pasture at the state farm, but I mow my pas - ture twice every season because when kept short it furnishes more feed than when allowed to grow up rank and high." Put manure on stubble, and plow it under. If you haven't any other place to put your manure, put it on your pasture, and It will doubly repay all the labor and time expended upon It. By thus feeding upon your own farm the grain that you raise, and returning the excrements of the. animals that feed upon the grain, together with all the waste roughage of the place, to the soil, you are returning to the soil fully ninety-fire per cent of what the crops took from the soil. Any man who hauls his grain to an elevator, is hauling the best part of his farm to the elevator. </seg>
            <seg id="p269">266 NERRASKA STATE ROARI" OF VliUllTl.TlBK Whenever you sell off from your farm one ton of timothy hay, you sell four dollars worth of fertility. Whenever you sell a ton of clover hay off the farm, you are selling $7.55 worth of fertility. Whenever you sell a ton of wheat off the farm, you are selling $8.49 worth of fertility. Whenever you sell a ton of corn off the farm, you are selling $6.75 worth of fertility. If a farmer reckons, as he should, the fertility of his soil as a part of his assets, how many of you can say that you are making; money? Of how many may it not be true that you are exchanging, at a loss, the fertility of your soil for money? I believe that it would cost the majority of the farmers in Nebraska more to buy in the open market the elements of fertility that the average crop takeR from the soil than they receive for the crop when sold. They are simply using up their capital, selling it for less than it is worth. Hitherto the farmers of Nebraska have been exchanging the fertility of th«&gt;ir soil for money. The time has come when they must exchange the labor of their brains and K muscles for monev. and must adopt every expedient, not only to e fertility of their soil intact, but to increase It with each sne - crop. BTie use of manure has added advantages besides restoring to the soil fertility which the crop took from it. It changes, or helps to change, granular structure of the soil, putting it in a condition more favor - for plant growth. It also gives to the soil a spongy texture which enables it to tike and to hold Increased quantities of water. If you take common loess soil and evaporate it to drvness, and take one hundred rounds of it. this one hundred pounds of dry loess soil, if water is applied to it slowlv as the rain would annlv it. will hold from fortv-seven to forty - nine pounds of wa'er without leaking. One hundred pounds of thoroughly dried, decomposed vegetable matter will hold, under the same conditions, one hundred and fortv-three pounds of water without leaking. You can see at a glance that a mixture of the decomposed vegetable matter with the, loess soil would vastly increase its capacity for holding water. A Ham tnkes all its food in solution, and that It is a verv weak solution d pvident from the fact that it takes three hundred tons of water to produce one ton of Hrv matter in dent corn. It is evident, then, unless there is sufficient water in the soil to dissolve the plant food, that the nlnnt will starve for lack of nutrition, and this is what really happens when we s^v that our corn is firing. It is starving, there is not suf - ficient water in the soil to dissolve the plant food and make it available for plant use. By the use of manure, giving to the soil a spongy charac - ter which enables it to hold water, the farmer can prevent washing, or the running of free water upon the surface of the soil. Nitrogen, which is. as I have said, the most expensive, the most necessary and the most elusive of the chemical elements of fertility, is as soluble as either salt or sugar. The minute water begins to run upon the soil. It carries with it the dissolved nitrates, and away goes your nitrogen. So that manure properly applied and mixed with the Boll, is a means not only of receiving </seg>

I wish to propose an experiment for each one of you. Every one of you should be an experimenter on his own farm. Most of your agri - cultural problems you will have to work out for yourselves on your own places, under your own peculiar conditions of soil, moisture, and climate, by patient, careful, accruate experimentation. In agricultural, as well as in spiritural matters, you will have to "work out your own salvation, with fear and trembling." The experiment I propose is this. Take a small quantity of clean river sand. Wash it till there is nothing but sand left. Dry it to absolute dryness, and weigh it. You will then know just how much sand you have. Then mix with it an equal quantity of thoroughly rotted manure, and expose it for a year to the natural rain - fall. Then wash, dry and weigh as before, and you will be astonished at the amount of sand that the acids in the manure, assisted by tha dilute nitric acid in the rainfall, have broken down, and converted Into soil. Some valleys in this state are a sandy loam. Others are a loamy sand. Then there are the sand-hills, which are nothing but sand. The proper use of well-rotted manure will help to break down the sand into soil, will enable it to rpreive more water, and hold it longer, and in those parts of the state where neither a deed nor a mortgage will hold real - estate, it will help to prevent the sand from drifting. People who have too much sand should sit up and take notice. I have stated that in feeding the entire crop to stock and returning their excrements to the soil, the farmer is returning to the soil 95 per cent of what the crop took from it. I wish now to call your attention to a method by which the farmer may not only supply the missing 5 per cent of fertility, but in addition to this may materially increase the fer - tility of the soil. I want to talk about the fertilizing value of clover. I would talk about alfalfa, for that is as good, if not better for fertility than clover. But you might as well try to make the average man love his mother-in - law as to try to persuade him to plow up a good stand of alfalfa. There are few places in Nebraska where clover may not be grown successfully, and it is difficult for me to understand why more of it is not grown. Perhaps the fact is due to the high price of seed. Perhaps it is also due to the farmers lacking the knowledge of what clover may do for the soil, or what financial benefits are to be gained from growing, it ' Let me tell you a story, the experience of a man with whom I am well acquainted, of the use of clover as a fertilizer. This man's farm stands practically on edge. Through the center of the farm runs a small stream, and on either side of the hills rise abruptly and the line fence is near the top of the hill. The great problem of this farmer has been to prevent washing. It is an old, worn-out farm. The farmer could MB - make sufficient barnyard manure to supply all its needs, and there was a </seg>
            <seg id="p271">268 NEBRASKA &gt; I ATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE strip of a few acres on the brow of one of the hills that sadly needed fertilizing. It is this red, yellow, barren kind of dirt that make* a man mad just to look at it. Clover seed was worth $8 a bushel, and he figured it out that if he pot fifteen pounds to the acre it would cost him $2 an acre to fertilize it with clover. It seemed a good deal of an expense, and the experiment seemed hazardous, but at last he made up his mind to try it, and he seeded it to clover, with oats as a nurse crop. His only thought was to fertilize the soil, and he had no thought and no hope of getting any money return from the clover. The next year he cut one ton of clover hay to the acre from the piece, and this was worth $6 a ton. He cut the second growth for seed. It was a good year for clover seed, and he got three bushels of clover seed to the acre, which he sold, on the farm, at eight dollars a bushel, thus making him a rash return of thirty dollars to the acre, where he had not expected a cent, and that beats anything in Nebraska except alfalfa. He was so pleased with this experiment, that the next year he seeded another piece to clover. The following season he cut one ton of clover hay to the acre, and this, that year, was worth $8 a ton. It was a poor year for clover seed, and in his second crop he got only two bushels of seed to the acre. This he sold for $10 a bushel, making him a cash return for his second seeding of clover, of $28 to the acre, which beats anything in Nebraska except alfalfa. What he did, any farmer in Nebraska may do. Clover is one of the most profitable crops that you can grow from a money standpoint, and it increases the fertility of the soil. This farmer put a plow into that red, yellow dirt and turned over the clover sod, and was surprised to find that it was not read or yellow any more, it was black. He had added to the fertility of the soil, I will not undertake to say how much. From this any farmer may see that by feeding his crop upon the land and returning to the soil the part of the crop that the animal does not use, and then follow - ing with a crop of clover, and continuing this system all about his farm, he may increase the productiveness and the fertility of the farm at the same time. More than this, by shipping to the market the finished product, instead of the raw food-stuffs, he would save, on an average, 10 per cent in freight. Any industry will flourish in Nebraska when assured of a 10 per cent profit And now just a word about weeds. Weeds are the savages of the soil. They exhaust its fertility, they drain it of its moisture. Our domestic grains have been improved from what they were originally In the wild state, and in proportion as we have improved them, we have weakened their power to resist. I imagine that the original corn which had a husk for each kernel, might perhaps have been able to hold its own with cockleburs and sunflowers. But as we have refined it, we have robbed it of its aggressiveness, and so with all our other cereals that have been improved from a wild state, until it has become as necessary to protect </seg>
            <seg id="p272">269 from a gang of cowboys. We must get rid of our weeds If we are to save our soil. The first requisite to getting rid of them is to stop sow - ing them. I know you think you do not sow weed seed, but every farmer who sows grain just as it comes from the threshing machine, sows weed seed. If you do not believe it, buy a good fanning mill, and find out for yourself. I know a man who said that it was nonsense, — "Yes, sir, oats as they come from the machine are clean," but when the test of the fanning milling was put to them, a two bushel sack of oats yielded two-thirds of a milk pan full of weed seed which the farmer was sowing. The first requisite, then, is a good fanning mill. Never sow any small grain until it has been thoroughly freed from weed seed. After the weed seed has been taken out, put your seed through the mill again, blowing hard as you can, so as to blow out all the light grain, and plant only the heaviest and plumpest. It is good sense to select the heaviest and best corn for seed. Is it not equally as good sense to select the heaviest and best oats or barley for seed? When the crop has been removed from the soil, the stubble will grow up to weeds from the seed that is already in the soil. Watch them, and as they come into blossom, go over the stubble with a mowing machine, running close to the ground, and that will fix the weeds for that season. 1 would say plow them under, or. disc them under, if I could be certain that every farmer would do it thoroughly, and do it at the right time, but a mowing machine is cer - tain, and so I recommend the mowing machine. Follow this plan all about the farm, treating every field upon the farm in the same way, and you will get rid of most of your weeds. Of course there will be bad years, wet years when weeds will seem to come spontaneously, but with ordinary care and comparatively no expense you may free yourselves from this drain upon the fertility of the soil. All I have said with reference to conserving and Increasing the fer - tility of the soil has been based upon the notion that the farmer, by so doing, would make more money for himself from the soil. I have appealed simply and solely to his selfish needs, his acquisitiveness, to bring this about. But there are other and higher considerations which I wish to bring to your mind. A recent sociological writer has said that the prime object of life should be so to live that the next generation may be better than its immediate predecessor, better equipped, with greater powers, keener insight, better advantages. I should like you to take this view of it too. A neighbor of mine, to whom I had often talked upon this question of soil regeneration, met me upon the street one morning and said, ''Professor, I have made up my mind that I will not leave worn - out land to my children." I wish every one of you would take the same high resolve. No man lives to himself alone, each man owes a duty to the future, to succeeding generations, to his children, and to his children's children. Each man owes a duty to his country, and that duty has rela - tion, not only to the present, but to the future. This is a consideration </seg>

            <seg id="p274">271 SOIL TILLAGE. BT ALVIN KEYSEB. We hear a good rleal now about soil tillage. Our land is worth more now than formerly. It must produce more to pay interest on the in - creased value. Tillage, more tillage and better tillage will help to do it. Any tillage operation which will not directly or indirectly help to increase production or profit had better be left undone. Tillage commences with the preparation of the seed-bed and includes all the operations of plowing, disking, harrowing and cultivating up to the time the crop is matured and ready for the harvest. When ths virgin prairie with its fertility, stored up thru the ages, full of humus and organic matter, was first broken up only a small amount of work was necessary in the preparation of a seed-bed. Long cultivation has altered this condition. With the decay of organic matter and the loss of humus the soil compacts more readily than formerly. The large store of virgin, available food materials has been removed by crops or washed away by rains. One of the tillage problems of the present is how to incorporate organic matter again to form humus by its decay, and thus kder available sufficient quantities of food materials to produce abun - t crops. P;ry stock-raiser knows that the pig. calf or colt, which is stunted start by insufficient food or poor shelter usually remains a rnnt Bt of its days. Plants, as animals, altho they develop in a some - different day. behave in the same manner. The crop stunted at the beginning usually remains a runt crop to the end of Its days. And a runt harvest is garnered instead of a full grown, healthy normal harvest that results from a properly started, properly maintained crop. Plants thrive when the soil environment is congenial, as animals thrive when their environment is favorable. Plants love a deep, mellow, well fined, compact seed bed. Such a seed bed cannot be obtained by leaving the land bare and untouched in the spring until seeding time. The freezes and thaws of winter have loosened and mellowed the soil, put it in excel - lent tilth. This tilth and the proper amount of moisture can be main - tained by early surface tillage or plowing. If the soil is allowed to bake. it loses its life and tilth and frequently these cannot be restored until another winter has brought its mellowing frosts. Early and timely tlll - fckeep the soil In its mellow condition, thus preserving the tilth and ing the soil moisture from being dissipated into the air. Perhaps one of the most important things accomplished by tillage is the saving of soil moisture. It may seem like folly to argue conserra - tion of soil water In a spring like 1908 when everyone is praying for the rain to let up. But the rain will cease after a while, it always does, and </seg>

The loss will proceed more rapidly because the conditions are right. If the surface is not tilled the soil will soon be drier than If no rains had come. The amount of water a common sol] may hold and the amount required by growing crops is not usually comprehended. One Inch of water over an acre amounts to over 8fi2.2 barrels. The normal rainfall in eastern Nebraska is over 30 inches annually, while In the extreme western part of the state the average is under IS Inches. Thus, with a rainfall of 30 inches. ea"h acre would receive 25,86fi barrels of water. Each foot in depth of the average soil is capable of holding about four inches of water, enual to nearly 3.449 barrels per acre. Sandy soils would hold somewhat less, clav soils somewhat more. Thus the soil to the depth of six feet will hold about 24 inches of rainfall, equal to 2O.fi9&lt;&gt; barrels per acre. If we had a tank large enough to hold this water It would be 100 fep» high and almost 30 feet in diameter. Thus It Is appar - ent that the soil Is an immense reservoir. Usually about two-thirds of the annual rainfall comes during the growing period, fifteen Inches of water well conserved so that the crop can make use of it. will produce a thirty-bushel crop of wheat of "fty-bushel crop of corn. But a compact moist soil with an unprotected, uncultivated surface may lose an Inch of water in twenty-four hours If drying winds are blowing, the evapora - tion mav even exceed this amount. Tf the soil surface Is protected by a mulch of loose, drv soil, produced by tillage, an inch of water might require ten or more davs for its evaporation from the soil. The water thus saved will go far toward making a crop. Arnold Martin, the twentv-acre farmer of Pawnee county, reports that it 1&lt;&gt;03 he followed two kinds of cultivation on adjoining plats of corn. On one cultivation was stopped Jnlv 3. the other was tilled once a week with a one horse, fine shovel cultivator until August fi. During this period of four weeks no rain fell. The drouth was broken August fi. The unculti - vated corn turned yellow and showed plainly the effects of drouth. A cri'st formed on the surface of the soil, deep cracks appeared from which moist lire escaped which should have gone into the corn crop. Half of the uncultivated plat was irrieated and the Irrieation was repeated as frequently as the surface dried. The results are more expressive than language. The corn cultivated continuously until August fi made ninetv - two bushels of corn per acre the irrigated plat made sixtv-three bushels, and the plat neither irrieated nor cultivated after July 3 made twenty - kIt bushels per acre. Farmers in many parts of the state have had similar good results from good tillage. The incorporation of a large amount of humus with the soil Increases itg water ho'ding capacltv. One hundred pounds of sand will hold from M to 25 pounds of water: 100 pounds of clay will hold from B0 to fiO pounds of water, while 100 pounds of humus will hold about 145 pounds of water. A soil well stocked with humus acts alive under the plow, while a soil which has been long under cultivation without manure or </seg>
            <seg id="p276">273 rotation acts dead. The difference is largely a difference In humus Oreen manures, plowing tinder a preen crop, will restore humus. Restoring humus has a value entirely separate from adding fertility which has l&gt;een removed. That it has a fertilizer value is not questioned. But its tillage value rather than its fertilizer value is emphasized here. Its power to mellow land and bring it into good "heart." Place assists in rendering the materials of plant food available, hemical changes produced in the soil, the bacteria which assist in rinK food materials reouire air for their best action. When the turn's yellow in the wet spring, one of the results of Insufficient aeration is shown. The air Is shut out of the soil by water.

Aeration is most Hkelv to be insufficient In the snrine. con - sequently tillage should be deeper and more frequent earlv In the growing season, and mav be. under ordinary conditions decreased In depth and freouencv as the season progresses. In all tillage aside from preparing the seed it must be remembered that the tilled or stirred soil is at the surface where food materials are elaborated most rapldlv and is the richest on the farm. Tf tillage stirs this laver deeper than Is necessarv to conserve water and elaborate food materials, there is lust that much removed from tbe feeding area of the crop roots where food mater'a's are most abundant.

            <seg id="p277">274 NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK ACRUt I.TIRK not mere theory as many fanners in eastern Nebraska, who have broken up grass land, clover or alfalfa and put into other crops, have found. A Gage county farmer reports ninety bushels of corn on clover sod as compared with thirty-seven bushels per acre on old corn ground. Both crops were grown in the same field on the same farm by the same man. Part of the increased yield is surely due to the food materials added, but not all. It is uniformly noticed that for a few years land which was in clover or alfalfa washes less than old grain fields, that the tilth Is better and cultivation can be done for less cost. That tillage which res use of nature instead of fighting her is usually most successful profitable. Perhaps there are no tillage operations so important or which will return larger dividends than that tillage given before the crop Is seeded. With small grain and with the pasture and meadow crops the greater part of the tillage must be given prior to seeding owing to the nature of the crop. The experiment station has shown and advocated for some time the advisability of early fall plowing for winter grain and early spring tillage for spring grains. It is common practice in Nebraska to how wheat after oats or wheat. Following the lessons shown so plainly, farmers in general try to plow in July, harrowing after the plow to preserve tilth and conserve moisture. This is virtually a partial summer tillage. The adoption of the practice has been to increase the average yield per acre of winter wheat in Nebraska. If the practice were more generally and faithfully followed there is no reason why the average yield of winter wheat in Nebraska should not be at least one-half larger than at present. Early plowing and harrowing at once, preferably the same half day. not only maintains tilth, conserves moisture, but it also gives time for the elaboration of plant food materials. Good tillage has enabled the winter wheat region to be extended westward for a considerable dis - tance. Further improvement in tillage methods, the adoption of sum - mer tillage in some of its forms, its intelligent use will extend the tilled area still further into the semi-arid region. There was a time when it was said that tame grasses and clover could not be grown in Nebraska west of the Missouri river counties. Kven alfalfa fell under the ban and peo - ple said it could not be grown because it was so hard and uncertain to start that it would prove unprofitable owing to the high cost of seed. The exn-rjment station took up the problem and worked out the best time for seeding and how the seed bed had best be prepared. Many farmers learned the essential facts by hard and expensive experience. They learned that deep and thoro fitting some little time in advance of seeding was necessary for success. In the drier seasons and drier regions of the state, summer tillage almost absolutely assures success in getting a good stand of either alfalfa or the grasses or clovers. Summer tillage or partial summer tillage puts the land in good tilth, conserves the moisture already in the soil, makes the soil more receptive of rainfall and permits the </seg>
            <seg id="p278">275 Farm. It was desired to fall seed to alfalfa a piece of land growing an oat crop. The land was double disked the same week of the harvest and plowed in July, harrowing the same half day as plowed. Copious rains fell during the harvest, but no more rain fell until August 28. Be - tween that date and September 3, 3 inches of rain fell. Moisture deter - minations were made September 4 on this field and others. The rain was found to have penetrated four to six inches in pasture sod a few rods distance: six to eight inches In wheat stubble, separated from the oat land by a twenty-foot alley; eight inches in a corn-field across an alley on the other side: on a nearby piece of land, plowed when dry, the pene - tration was four inches, while in the oat stubble which had been tilled early the rain penetrated until the moisture from above met the moist - ure from below. And the soil was found to be thoroly moist down to a «l ih of six feet. Another field treated similarly, but on ano'her part the farm gave the same result. Alfalfa was seeded on the oat land the iddle of August and altho no rain had fallen since early in July a per - fect stand was obtained. Tillage is the simplest and cheapest means at hand for increasing production. It should be looked to first on this account. When all that may be accomplished by tillage has been done, we should look further and study the problems of fertility of manuring and rotations. </seg>

Kiake a comprehensive report on this subject would involve the dis - of a large portion of what are known as "fungi." In order to make report I will deal with just a few of the principal diseases. Pulypurus vaporarius This is a rather common wound parasite in Europe. When the spores find lodgement in the lies or posts they germinate and infect the wood with a snowy white mycelium and red or brown streaking of the sub - stance, in lines radiating from the crack in which the spores germ - inated. This is very damaging to ties, especally if they have not been seasoned. Pvlyporut pomlerosus A common disease affecting the Bull Pine. It is a large PolyporuM of the Fumes type, usually growing singly, sometimes two or three together. El) is covered, after the first year, with a hard, brittle, dull substance, cracks as it grows old, and looks sandy or crystalline. It does not h damage if the wood is kept in a dry condition. There are about six or eight of the fungi known popularly as toad- Is, technically as Hymenumyretes, which do a great deal of damage to posts and ties. According to Hartig, these timber-destroying fungi i an lie detected from the markings and discolorations they produce in the wood: those due to Hyilnum iliversidens. Thelephora per&amp;ix, Polyporus suliihureux. Polyporux iyniariu*. Polyporus dryadeus, and Stereum hir - tutum being all different, and in some cases so characteristic that the merest glance suffices to diagnose the disease. Puiystn tus venieolor. This is a common pore fungus. The "shelves" are thin and leathery and conspicuously zoned above. The zones are of different colors, varying from a light tan color to very dark brown or black, and are frequently 'y in appearance. The pores are on the under surface and are very small. Whenever this fungus has attacked a tie it is a good indication that it is in a rapid state of decay. It is usually a saprophyte, although it lives on the heartwood of the Catalpa as a parasite. let ahietina. Bis one of the exceedingly common timber rots of soft woods, iting body is either a fiat prostrate one or may become a low shelf, dom large and does not usually exceed a few inches in diameter, rased surface is covered with gills which often radiate from the n the prostrate forms.

The gills are rather thick. Lentinus lepideus. A very familiar gill fungus which inhabits almost all kinds of soft needle leaved tree timbers. It is, as far as is known at present, a sapro - phyte. The fruiting body is a stalked form with a central stem and is very tough and fleshy. The cap is two to three inches or more across and is at first pale yellow. Later black scales develop on the upper sur - face. The flesh of the cap is white. The gills are slightly wavy, running down the stem for a short distance and the margins are irregularly toothed, a character which distinguishes this fungus and its close rela - tives from the other gill fungi. The gills are white, tinged with yellow. The stem is one inch or more in length and usually tapers toward the r, is hard, pale in color and has scales similar to those of the cap. fruiting bodies grow in clusters. Mrrultus lacrymans This fungus is one of the most destructive of timber rots, both on account of its action and its frequent occurrence. When the mycelium has permeated a wood tissue it leaves the latter as a spongy mass of brownish material. When this decayed portion becomes dry it shrinks, causing cracks which form at right angles to each other, commonly form - ing squares. R fruiting bodies are flat and prostrate and never form "shelves." they are white, then reddish and later turn dark yellow brown int of the numerous spores produced on the surface. The fruit - es are often five or six inches in diameter. Agaricus melleus. This is the "shoe-string fungus" rot, one of the common fall mush - rooms. They are usually found in dense clusters, the lower of which are covered with the fallen spore-powder from the upper fruiting bodies. The whole fruiting body, except the gills, is more or less honey colored. The mushroom cap is lined on the under surface with plates or gills which radiate out from the stem and bear the spores. These are white and may often be found covering sticks and leaves under the fruiting bodies. The honey-colored upper surface of the latter is covered with flne, fibrillar scales of a dark color. These scales may also be found on the young stem. When old the whole fruiting body may become entirely E'he reason that this fungus bears such a name is because of the shoe - lg like strands of the mycelium from which the fruiting bodies inate. It is this mycelium which lives saprophyttcally upon props, It does great damage to mining props. </seg>
            <seg id="p281">278 NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE are conditions which are necessary for the growth and development of wood-destroying fungi. There are at least four conditions In which the tie or post must be in before it can become affected: (1) Presence of water; (2) air; (3) organic food material, and (4) a certain amount of heat. The wood fibers and the organic substances found in the living cells of the sap wood, such as albuminous substances, starch, sugar, and oils form the food supply necessary to start the growth of the fungus threads. A further requirement is oxygen, and no growth will take place under water or in the ground at depths of two feet or more, the depth vary - ing with the character of the soil. The best examples of this necessity for oxygen can be found in the way in which fence posts and telegraph and telephone poles decay at points just at or just below the surface of t ground, where there is a balance between the supply of air and of er. In order to reduce the danger from the attacks of fungi and other dangers, much of the timber is seasoned. Seasoning is ordinarily under stood to mean drying. Seasoning implies other changes besides the evaporation of water. One of the differences between seasoned and un - seasoned wood, It is thought, consists in changes in the albuminous sub - stances in the wood fiber, and possibly also in tannins, resins, and other incrusting substances. Seasoned wood fiber is very much more per - meable, both for liquids and gases, than the living unseasoned fiber. The drying out may result in considerable shrinkage, which may make bwood fiber more porous. It is also possible that there are oxidizing ences at work within these substances, which result in their dls There are many advantages of seasoned wood over unseasoned, a few of which I will relate. Season timber lasts much longer than unsea - soned timber. Seasoned timber has less percentage of water in it, thereby the danger of attack from fungi is lessened. The seasoned tim - ber is treated much more easily and seasoning after treatment prevents the rapid leaching out of salts introduced to preserve the timber. After the wood is seasoned, the treatment falls into several classes, ording to the manner in which the preservative is applied. The treatment often depends upon the amount of wood to be treated When there are but few pieces, the preservative is often applied to the outside of the wood, either with a brush or by dipping it Into the pre - servative. In the case of posts, they are merely dipped Into the tank or else the preservative is applied with a brush. It is often only necessary to treat the post at the point where it is near the surface of the ground. In the case of ties, they are either dipped into the preservative or else It is forced into the ties by pressure. It Is for this reason that ties are well seasoned before treating. The following substances have been used with considerable success in the treatment of posts and ties: </seg>
            <seg id="p282">279 i Creosote. — May be forced into the timber by pressure or the timber ;bt just be dipped into the creosote. Zinc chlorid. — This is the cheapest process and is used quite widely. The only trouble with it is that it leaches out of the wood very quickly. Zinc chlorid and tar oil. — The treatment of porous timber with zinc chlorid. followed by a treatment of three pounds of tar oil, is recom - mended as a process which will give good results. Spiriting. — Consists merely in the immersing of the ties in this sub - stance for twenty-four hours or longer as is necessary. Beaumont oil— The ties are soaked in this liquid for twenty-four hours or longer. enc-tannin. — This consists in three different processes or treatments: 'lear chloride of zinc, 4 per cent strong; (2) a solution of glue, 2 per strong; (3) a solution of tannin, 2 per cent strong; each treatment g about twelve hours. Re posts, when preserved, are charred or treated when absolutely i such substances as carbolineum. spiriting, or tar oil. They can soaked in corrosive sublimate, or hot tar may be applied to them. </seg>
            <seg id="p283">280 NEBRASKA PTATK ROARI&gt; OF AGRirT'LTrRE DISEASES OF FIVE COMMON PLANTS. BT A. H. MIIJJCR, KET5NARO, NEB. A plant is said to be diseased when it shows any deviation from the ordinary or average condition or behavior, relative to appearance, growth, color of bark or foliage, fruit fulness, time of dropping leaves, or length of life. The cause of the disease may be attributed, ordinarily, either to a funeiis. to a parasitic-filamentous plant, or to an insert: however, the pathological condition is not always due to these alone, but to the un - favorable habitat in which the plant lives. Highly cultivated plants, such as the apple beet. corn, grape, and potato, the diseases of which will be discussed in this paper, have been brought so far from their original conditions, and developed so finelv that they can no longer withstand the •Macks of their enemies with their former sturdiness. and must come under the protection of the horticulturist or agriculturist. DISEASES COMMON TO THE APPLE M&gt; Brown Rot ( WotiVia frurtipena') usually appears in the spring on the leaves as thin, velvety, olive-brown patches. When the spores of the attacking fungus are matured thev are scattered by the wind, birds, or rain, and fall upon new leaves or young trait On the fruit the first ap - pearance of the disease is indicated bv brownish scattered patches on the skin: soon small tufts composed of spores appear. These tufts are usually arranged in irregular circles around a central starting point as the disease extends. Fruit attacked does not rot but lies in a mummified condition. (21 Apple Scab (Fuxirla'lium ileniiritirvm) attacks both the leaves and the fruit in an injurious manner. The disease appears first on the leaves nnder the form of small, roundish, dark spots mostly on the upper surface. These patches increase in size and run into each other, forming lare-e. irreinilar-shaned. blackish blotches: freoiienfly the leaves are KOn the fruit the fungus appears as a brownish scaly mass and the growth of the fruit in that particular spot. The apple in this and distorted condition Is unfit for market. Rl Bitter Rot or Anthracnose (Qloeofporium frutigenum) attacks lilt and affects it for both eating and keeping purposes. The dis appears first as snots, later it develops into dark brown, sunken ps of various sizes. To the taste the apple affected Is very bitter DISEASES COMMON TO THE BEET (1&gt; T.eaf Spot (Cerrosjtora brtirnla) is not espectaltv harmful except </seg>
            <seg id="p284">281 dry, pallid blotches on the leaves. ■Scab (Ootpora scabies) on the beet resembles the potato scab, and appears on the root as roughened, corky patches, rather dark iu color. When first dug up a grayish, delicate mould is present on the patches, hut this soou disappears. As a rule the disease does not ma - terially affect the vitality of the plant, but gives the root an unwholesome appearance. DISEASES COMMON TO CORN (1) Smut (Ustilagu zeae) is one of the most common and widespread -es that the farmers are compelled to combat. Scarcely a field la free from its attack, sweet corn being more subject to the attack of the fungus than common field corn, because of its tenderness. Spores of the fungus fall upon some part of the plant, on either the young ear, tassel or stem, and germinate, forming, as growth continues, large, grayish, soft, watery masses. In the fall when the corn matures, these masses turn to a dark color and when entirely dry the outer cover bursts, liberating a quantity of dark brown or blackish spores. Mould (Fusarium) is characterized by its grayish color and pecu - liar odor. The fungus attacks the corn either while it is yet in the field or after it is in the crib, moisture being a prime requisite for its develop - ment. Corn affected by the disease, while not dangerous to stock, has no Kale on the market. DISEASES COMMON TO THE GRAPE. PAnthracnose (iSphaceloma ampelium) is a prevalent disease on the Whwi the fruit is nearly grown the fungus appears as white as it ripens it has the appearance of having been seared by a hot The chief damage is the reduction in size and appearance for market; the taste, however, is not affected. (2) Black Rot (Guignardia buluclhi) is one of the most destructive and widespread diseases with which the viticulturists in the United States have to cope. As a rule, the fungus attacks the young shoots and leaves first, the disease appearing under the form of small brownish patches. A little later the small blackish or brownish spots appear at different points on the surface of the fruit, which very soon becomes black, shriveled and hard, but as a rule does not drop off. (3) Grape mildew (Plasmopara viticola) attacks the foliage, young shoots, tendrils, flowers and young fruit of the vine. The disease usually appears first on the upper surface of the leaves in the form of pale greenish or yellowish spots. These spots increase in number and size, and change to a brown color as the tissue dies: finally the leaf become* brittle and falls off. Even if the fruit is not attacked, the falling off of the foliage prevents its proper development. </seg>

THE CHINCH-BUG (Bli*su» leui-opterui Say). During the period here considered there have been strong indica - tions of a revival of chinch-bug activities in several of our counties along the southern border of the state. Following the outbreak in 1900, which continued during the next year and died out in 1902, the succession of wet years so reduced the numbers of this pest that no reports of considerable damage were received for the next three years. But about the third week in June of 1906 reports of damage by chinch-bugs came In from southern Webster and Franklin counties, and sporadic complaints and requests for inoculated bugs were received until early in September. The damage during 190G was very small and mostly on corn. Early in July of 1907 reports were again received from the same counties indicat - ing more severe damage than in the preceding year, and these were soon followed by complaints from the adjacent counties of Nuckolls and Thayer. The bugs were working in oats and wheat and going into the corn, and in several localities the damage was considerable. This spring (1908) reports were received as early as April 22 from Furnas county, and within a week were followed by complaints of severe injury to wheat in Frontier, Webster and Nuckolls counties. Whether or not the threatened outbreak materializes depends upon the character of the season of 1908; if the summer is continuously wet the bugs will probably be checked, but if a season of drought or intermittent rainfall prevails a </seg>

Tbe whole of the United Slates east of the Hooky Mountains, except iht- tip of the Floridan penninsula, is occupied by this insect, which gains its livelihood by sucking the sap from cultivated corn, wheat, oats, barley, rye, timothy, sorghum, millet, rice and broom corn, as well as from a number of native grasses which probably formed its original food plants. There are two broods annually in this state. The bugs hibernate as adults among the roots of grass tufts and beneath piles ;ives or rubbish along hedgerows and edges of wooded tracts, or milar protected nooks. They remain torpid during the cold weather, but with tbe arrival of the warm days of spring they crawl forth from their winter quarters and begin flying about, mating and searching (or a suitable locality in which to deposit their eggs.

The caterpillar itself is a distinctly striped cut-worm about an inch and a half in length, the sides having two greenish yellow stripes enclosing a black one, and the back greenish black with a broken white median stripe. The moth to which it gives rise is yellowish brown with a distinct white spot in the center of each fore wing, and measures about an inch and a half in expanse of wings. To stop an army of these worms when on the march deep furrows are plowed, and the side of the furrows away from the worms is made perpendicular by the use of a spade. Every fifteen feet post holes are dug in the bottom of the furrows. The caterpillars travel up and down the furrow seeking to pass on, until finally they lodge in a post-hole, where the accumulated worms may be killed with kerosene, exactly as in the furrow barrier used against migrating chinch-bugs. The burning of old grass and stubble in the spring will destroy many of these pests in all stages of development. But ordinarily the army-worm is kept well in check by its natural enemies, which include insect parasites, parasitic diseases and predaceous insects and vertebrates which devour them in enormous numbers.

Reports of cutworm injury were received during 1906 and 1907 from numerous localities in eastern Nebraska. The attack was princi - pally upon corn, wheat, alfalfa, potato and tomato plants. The different M of cutworms found in the state, and there are probably a hundred or more distinct kinds, have different habits and life-histories so that the remedies which might apply in dealing with one would not with another.

In the spring these eggs hatch and the larvae attack the roots of the young corn, continuing to feed upon them during the early summer. The roots and stalk are penetrated by the larvae, which form minute longitudinal burrows near the surface of the roots and cause them to decay at the ends. These larvae are half an inch long, about as thick as a pin and white in color, and may be found within their burrows by splitting the affected roots. Late in June and early in July the first larvae mature and pupate, and toward the middle of July the beetles appear and continue emerging for. a month or more. The beetles feed upon the soft parts of various plants, — corn, cucumber, squash, pumpkin, bean, clover, and various composites, such as sunflower, goldenrod and thistle, and for the most part die before winter. kThe remedy for both of our corn-root worms is simply a rotation crops. As the eggs are laid among the roots of the corn in the fall, if the field be planted to some other crop the next year the young larvae on hatching will find no food plant and starve, for in its larval stage the northern corn-root worm feeds only on corn, so far as is knowa WHITE GRUBS (Lachnosterna sp K'omplaints of white grubs injuring blue-grass lawns were very uent during both 1906 and 1907, and injury to corn and young alfalfa was also reported. The roots are devoured, which results in the weakening and final killing of the infested plants. One correspondent from Hartington, Cedar county, reported large patches of his lawn, one 12x75 feet, to be completely destroyed; another from Norfolk, Madison county, had two-thirds of his lawn destroyed; while from Fullerton, Nance county, two reports testified that most of the lawns in the town were badly affected and many ruined, one of the corresponden&lt;9''Baving found fifteen grubs under a square foot of sod in his lawn.

White grubs are the larvae of the large, shining, dark brown or black beetles commonly known as "May-beetles" or sometimes as "June-bugs," which appear in such large numbers during the months referred to, and make themselves conspicuous by flying into lighted rooms and buzzing and bumping about confusedly. These beetles fly only at night, and then feed upon the foliage of many kinds of trees and bushes, often doing much harm by defoliating them. During the day they re - main quiet.

These insects are the victims of many natural enemies, both as larvae and adult beetles. Birds, mammals, predaceous insects, parasitic flies and wasps and fungous diseases all attack them severely, still they manage to multiply unduly and menace our crops and lawns. For grubs in corn and small grain the avoidance of evidently infested grasslands for the new crop, rotation with a comparatively immune crop such as clover, and, whenever it is possible, a fall plowing to expose the grubs and beetles to their natural enemies and the elements is advised.

While this insect is found over the whole of the state, as a pest It is not to be compared in southeastern Nebraska with the central and western portions of the state. The lack of extensive sandy areas in the southeastern counties restricts the insect in the item of suitable breeding grounds, and it is consequently not very abundant, but has been reported as more or less injurious east of Thayer and Stanton RIn the sandhill counties where it has a continuous breeding tpproximating one-fifth of the state, and especially in the area by Holt, Brown, Rock, Cherry, Thomas and Custer counties, it bly the worst insect pest to be contended with. There the jme in swarms that fill the air and almost cover the trees upon ey settle to feed, taking everything by storm. In much of the entioned region the roses and many of the fruits have been ly taken for the past three seasons. Frequent reports are sent in of young ducks and chickens being killed by eating these insects, one of our correspondents having lost ten young ducks in this manner. Fighting the rose-chafer is a very difficult and uncertain process. In most insects we find the larval or pupal stages give us some avenue of attack, but here the breeding area is so vast and the abundance of the insects so great that we can hope for nothing along this line. The only feasible course it to defend our crops as best we can when the beetles come, and even here we can &lt;lo but little. Spraying seems to be ineffective, for while arsenites will kill the beetle they act so slowly that the trees are stripped before the beetles die, and already fresh beetles are at hand to replace the dead ones. It may require a couple of days of feeding on poisoned leaves to kill a rose-chafer, and during that period a half dozen may have emerged to take its place. Contact poisons such as kerosene and pyrethrum are nullified because of the wing covers which fit closely over the breathing pores, and protect them from the entrance of foreign matter. Our correspondents have tried arsenites, kerosene, carbolic dips, and pyrethrum and all agree that the effort was practically wasted. Dr. J. B. Smith has tried experimentally a large number of substances as sprays for this insect, including Bordeaux mixture and other copper compounds, pyrethrum, kerosene, lime, tobacco dust and decoctions, digitalis, cyanide of potassium, hellebore and many others, and all proved wholly unsatisfactory. 1 In localities where the rose-chafer comes in only moderate numbers and the orchard or garden is small, the liberal planting of spiraeas or early roses, often serves to attract the beetles from the more valuable fruits and vegetables; but in most afflicted regions, as certainly in this state, the numbers of the pest are too overwhelming for such measures to be of practical value. Various mechanical devices on the plan of a large funnel opening into a receptacle containing kerosene, into which the beetles may be jarred from the bushes and trees and killed, have been 1 Bulletin of the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, No. 82, pp. 1 9-33. </seg>

Yet jarring, in conjunction with arsenical spray, preferably arsenate of lead, is the only remedy which can at present be recom - mended, i i MM .AM Ee fact that the stay of the rose-chafer is limited to a few weeks, June 1 to July lo, is about the only consoling feature in its life - y, and can sometimes be practically applied by the selection of varieties of fruits that the time of blooming may avoid the greater er of beetles. WHEAT INSECTS The insects found infesting wheat during 1905-06 have already been treated of at length in another place.' It might be mentioned here, however, that the Hessian fly during 1906 was scarce all over the region in which it had occurred so abundantly during the previous year. The wheat-stem maggot and frit flies were still troublesome during 1906, as was also the wheat straw-worm. The latter insect was particularly nu - merous in Butler and Red Willow counties. The stalk-borer did little or no harm during 1906, and none of these insects inflicted serious damage ting 1907, the wheat being particularly free from insect pests during t year. THE CLOVER-HAY WORM (Hypsopygia costalis Fabricius). Farmers in this state are frequently annoyed to find, upon opening staiks of alfalfa or clover, that the hay in the bottom of the stack from two to four feet above the ground is filled with small, dark brown caterpillars the workings of which have spolied the hay for feeding purposes. It is cut up into chaff and fine dust, and usually is so filled and matted together with the silky white webs spun by the worms that it has a moldy appearance, while little black pellets of excrement, resembling coarse grains of powder, are abundantly mixed throughout the mass. Cattle will not eat the hay in this condition, and it is believed by many that it would prove injurious to them if they did. Not only are these worms found in open air stacks, but equally commonly in hay stored in barns and mows, so that taken altogether the clover-hay worm annually destroys many tons of hay in Nebraska. The insect is found both in Europe and America, and the general apposition is that it is a native of the former continent which early became introduced into this country. It now occurs over the greater part of the eastern United States and southern Canada and is especially destructive in the middle western states. It has been present in aska for many years, but only more recently, since the great 1 Bruner and Swenk, Bulletin of the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station. No. 96 (1907). </seg>

The worms are the larvae of a very pretty little moth which may be found in the evening 3r on cloudy days flying about the haystacks, or in the daytime on the walls of Lams in which hay is stored.

Moths continue to appear through most of June and the females oviposit either directly upon the hay in the crevices of the stack, or in the heads of the uncut plants in the field from which they are carried to the stack or mow.

The pur: ■ »-■'■•' ot this brief report is to assist those who desire to check an far as possible this continual drain upon their resources. Kaut-lice ( Atihi liilae) are so familiar to everyone because of the fail that almost every cultivated plant is infested by them, that very little inscription is necessary. They are all quite small in size, the lai£ K species measuring less than one-fourth of an inch in length and of the others teing very much smaller. They are more or leas ■haped and in color are usually some shade of green, although there are several species that are almost entirely black. Nearly all develop win; ed foims at certain times of the year, concerning which more will I later. members of this family have a very interesting and unique life :..s ory. There are two kinds of females, the commoner kind being which not only give birth to their young alive by a sort of internal biKiuing process (viviparous), but do so without mating with the opposite sex: and the true sexual form which lays eggs (oviparous), before doing which it must mate. These latter, which are wingless, are normally developed only in the autumn along with the males, in order that eggs may be deposited which will carry the species through the win ■ r. The former kind may be again subdivided into those without ■ and those with wings, the purpose of the latter being to spread the a* and to protect it against extermination by drought or other unra\oraHe lo'al conditions. The life-histories of these Insects, while sin.il r n a general way, present many variations among the different species. In general, as said before, the insects pass the winter in the egg state, hatching in the spring, the first generation being stem-mothers </seg>
            <seg id="p311">308 which give birth to living young. these young maturing and also giving birth to young, occasionally developing winged forms. In the autumn the true females lay the eggs from which the stem-mothers hatch in the spring. Many have what is known as an alternation of food plant, t. e.. they feed upon one plant during part of their existence, and during the remaining portion upon a totally different kind, as for example the hop aphis which feeds upon the hop until it dries up in midsummer, when it migrates to plum trees where it feeds the remainder of the season and lays its psk*. Several species s]&gt;end part of their life beneath the surface of the ground and the remaining portion above, as the grape phylloxera or wooly apple aphis. Others exist within galls !oi&gt;ed upon |&gt;ortions of the plant which they infest.

[From Chittendcn and Marlatt, Bureau of Entomology and others is their exceedingly rapid method of reproduction, enabling them under favorable conditions to increase to numbers entirely out of proportion to their food plants. This is accounted for not so much by the number of young produced by each individual as by the rapidity with which the young mature and begin to produce young in turn. A single female produces as high as eight young per day, these young all being females which themselves begin to produce young in five to ten days. Huxley has calculated that the progeny of a single aphid if allowed to increase unmolested would in ten generations weigh more than the whole population of China, and some species have at least thirteen generations per year. Such a calamity as this, however, is averte.l by the natural enemies of these insects, which are of many kinds. The most important of these are the true internal parasites, resembling </seg>
            <seg id="p312">REPORT Of 309 tiny wasps, which lay their eggs upon the lice, these eggs soon hatching and forming grubs which live within the aphid. These parasites, even when mature, are extremely minute in size, but do an increditble amount of good. Among the predaceous enemies of plant-lice the common ladybirds probably are most efficient, while the larvae of Syrphid flies and the lacewings have keen appetites for these insects and destroy a great many. Occasionally through some abnormal condition of the weather or some other agency these parasites fail to develop in sufficient number, and when this is true, as was the case with the "green bug," a more or less severe infectior ur Aphids are peculiar for the so called 'honey-dew" which they secrete from the posterior end of the body this fluid being very attractive to many other insects because of its sa harine nature. Chief among these attracted insects are ants, which render themselves very obnoxious by their careful attendance upon these lice, in some instances caring for their eggs throughout the winter and placing the young, when they hatch, upon the proper food plant in order that they may obtain a good supply of honey-dew. In fact the best remedy for eertain root-infesting aphids has been found to be the destruction of anthills in the fields. Plant-lice belong to a group of insects having a sucking beak by means of which they obtain their nourishment, piercing the surface of the leaves and tender twigs and drawing up the juice from beneath In this way they differ from the biting insects, which have a pair of jaws an&lt;l get their food by devouring the tender parts of the plant. This fact is of great importance when we desire to use artificial remedies against insects. While the latter kind can be killed by the use of stomach poisons such as Paris green or arsenate of lead, it is obvious that these poisons would have no effect upon For destroying this type of insect we most important of which are fumigati with insecticides which kill by cont clog their breathing pores and thus secticides have been recommended in sucking insects like the plant-lice. ! must resort to other methods, the ing with various gases and spraying act, that is, something which will suffocate them.

THE SPRING GRAIN APHIS OR "GREEN BUG" (Toxoptera graminum Rondani). R insect was the occasion of a great deal of alarm among the of Nebraska during the spring and early summer of 1907, ad they known something of its character and habits, could have gely avoided. While we must not lose sight of the fact that of dollars damage was done by this insect in the states to the us, here in the north it was nothing more serious than a great opportunity for those who manipulated the grain market to bull the price of wheat, and hence was really money in the pockets of our farmers who had grain to sell, although it is possible that the inevitable reaction which followed more than offset this appreciation in price. Early in the spring of 1907, when this insect was doing so much damage in the south, and was receiving so much notice by the newspapers throughout the entire country, farmers began to send in various kinds of insects found in the wheat fields, the accompanying letters reflecting the anxiety the writers felt for the future of their wheat crop. However, the Entomologist was always able to put them at ease in this regard, as the communications were almost invariably accompanied by some common local wheat aphis, or any other insect which was found upon wheat and which was of a green color.

            <seg id="p315">312 Having satisfied himself thai the insect had not as yet reached Nebraska, and having allayed somewhat the fears of the local grain men, the writer returned to headquarters. About a month later, however, another tour of inspection along the southern border of the state revealed the fact that "green bug" had at last reached us. but not in great numbers. It found by the writer to be present from near Bloomington east to Pawnee City and north to Lincoln. The lice in these localities were quite extensively parasitised by the Lysiphlebus. a very small wasp-like insect, so that very little apprehension was felt for the crop of small grain. The "green bug" is an imported species from Europe, and was first found in abundance in the United States during the year 1884. It is extremely erratic in its nature, there always being several years between the outbreaks. Inclusive of the one just passd, there have been three disastrous invasions of this insect in the United States, the first one occurring in 1890, affecting Texas. Missouri, and portions of Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee. The second infestation happened in and was less in extent than the preceding, although equally severe. During the season of 1907 this insect probably eclipsed any of its former records in amount of injury. Professor Wash burn estimates that Okla - homa alone lost $10,000,000. tThe explanation of the change in this insect from almost harmless nbers to equal rank in destructiveness with some of our most serious ts. lies in the reduction of parasitism due to abnormal climatic conditions. It will be remembered that following a rather mild winter a late cold spring set in. which while not cold enough to check the increase and spread of the "green bug" caused the little parasites to remain dormant during this part of the season. According to Professor Webster this aphis will breed freely at temperatures ranging as low as 32° F., while the Lysiphlebus. its parasite, is dormant at any temperature below 5*°, thus giving a stretch of 24° wherein the "green bug" can breed unmolested. The well known prolificacy of the insects in the family to which this one belongs was sufficient to place the aphis beyond all normal bounds when during a greater portion of the winter and spring in the states to the south of us the temperature ranged between the two minima mentioned above. Of course it is not likely that the "green bug" bred in Nebraska during the winter, but as the weather began to warm up somewhat and the wheat to the south became more aged and less palatable, winged forms were developed in great numbers. These winged females, on getting into the air. were borne long dis - tances by the wind, but finally alighted and at once began giving birth to living young. It was just after a continuous high wind from the south that the aphis was first noticed upon grain in this state. Not long after, however, the weather began to approach more nearly normal conditions, thus Riving the little parasite an opportunity to bring the °" UI uu»nri uiiipir-ir i win mm </seg>

In Nebraska the writer has rlie life-history of this insect i not differ essentially from that other members of the family Aphididae. The males and egg-lay - ing females appear in the fall of the year, and the eggs are deposited upon the wheat. In Nebraska the species is probably carried over winter by this method alone, but farther south the viviparous fe - males (those- bearing young alive) are active during the entire winter and produce young in some num - bers throughout the season. Dur - ing the spring, if the weather is dry or there are too many lice sub - sisting upon the grain, causing it to become less thrifty, winged fe - males are developed which, as sug - gested heretofore, get up into the air and are borne long distances by the wind to infest other grain fields, which it does not take long to do on account of their rapid mode of June this insect leaves the grain they abandon in the fall, again taki Fig 16.

This egg soon hatches and the larva develops within the body of the plant-louse. At about the time the larva is ready to emerge ia the form of a mature wasp the aphis becomes greatly swollen and turns to a dark brown color. In emerging this parasite makes a circular cut in the body-wall of the louse. All this requires a period of about ten days, when the new parasite is ready to deposit eggs in the bodies of other lice. The great amount of good accomplished by this tiny creature can be appreciated only by those who have gone into the field and observed the business-like way in which it goes at its work and the large percentage of the lice it destroys. </seg>

This insect is present in ;\&lt;ka in some numbers every year, and while it is a more or leas ly and continuous drain on the small grain crop, it is not likely that it will ever become so dangerous a pest as the "green bug" is in the south. The southern tier of counties from Harlan to Pawnee and north I to the Platto river embraces the region where the wheat was most infested. In some fields these insects were very numerous, but generally they were quite extensively parasitized by Lysiphlebus and fed upon by the convergent ladybird, which was very abundant in the flekls. being seen everywhere running up and down the wheat stalks in quest of the lice. During the year 1879 1 this insect was recorded from Illinois under the name Riphonopttora avenar. Sursenuently it has spread westward to North Dakota and cast to the Atlantic, and is also common in the north and south It 's a native of Europe as its common name implies. e English grain nnhis resembles the ''green bug" but may be uished from that insect as stated in the discussion preceding, the following species it may usually be distinguished by having Ird branch of the discoidal vein longer, the legs are not so n in color, the apices of the femora and tibiae being dark, and by dark spots on the abdominal segments. The life-history of this insect is but imperfectly known, hut it is not liVely that it differs materially from that of other grain lice. The windless females probably survive the winter here in Nebraska, as the writer bas found them early in the spring during very cold weather, working beneath the surface of the ground near the roots of the wheat plant. Like the 'green bug" this leaves the small grain when it be - comes rmtiTp and migrates to the related wild grasses where it remains until the fa&lt;] wheat comes up. when it returns to that plant. Besides Clng upon wheat, oats, barley, rye and corn, it has been found upon timothy, millet and various wild grasses.

The life-history of the European grain aphis is one about which ;ire not agreed, some claiming that part of its life cycle la spent upon the apple and their opponents maintaining that the apple form is an entirely different species. This problem will doubtless be solved in the near future, and will bear considerable weight in the control of the insect upon either wheat or apple. According to Mr. ;inde of the U. S. Bureau of Entomology, it has been found upon (Terent plants. 9 grains and related wild grasses. S trees and 4 weeds or herbs, it being a rather general feeder for an aphid. In appearancv this insect is very similar to the English grain aphis and the "green bug," but may be distinguished from them as indicated in the preceding pages. Observers say that it is destroyed by a great many predaceous and parasitic insects, although none of these have as yet been reared from this species in our insectary.

Kearney it was especially numerous, the writer having examined many fields in that vicinity on April 17. 18. and 19, as mentioned on a preceding page. Some plants in these fields supported as high as forty lice, although the field as a whole was not noticeably damaged, and usually a much smaller number were found upon the plants.

So far the winged form is unknown to the writer. It further differs from the above-ground aphids previously treated by the absence of the honey-tubes or nectaries. Nourishment is obtained by sucking the juices from the root and under - ground portions of the wheat and other plants, where the louse is prob - ably placed by the ants just referred to. So far as is known to the writer, the life-story of this insect has never been worked out. It has bean found upon the roots of corn, blue-grass and shepherd's purse. I believe it has not heretofore been found infesting wheat, but this and the following species probably will never become sufficiently harmful to make it necessary to take up remedial measures against them. The other plant-louse found infesting the roots of wheat I have tentatively identified as a species of Oeoira. Superficially it resembles the former in shape, but is of a white color, and has several microscop - ical characters by which it may be distinguished from that species In </seg>

Professor Forbes, the leading authority on corn insects, says that this pest is of equal rank with the chinch bug and army worm in its destructiveness because of its wide distribution and steady and continuous attack. It no doubt occurs to some extent throughout the entire corn belt, having been recorded Cm Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Minnesota, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey I Delaware, besides this state. The corn root aphis is a small, oval insect of a bluish green color, and with prominent nectaries, which stand erect or lean slightly back - ward. In this species we find both the winged and wingless forms. They obtain their living by sucking the juices from the roots of the corn, So far only the wingless oviparous female has been found in Nebraska. ,e This latter insect was observed only at Aurora, during October 1907, and upon volunteer wheat scattered through the sowed grain. It wm» quite abundant here and caused the wheat to change to a sickly yellowish green color. THE CORN ROOT APHIS (Aphis maidiradicis Forbes).

When spring opens up and the smartweed begins to grow the little ants pick i pg lice wMch have hatched and place them upon the roots of plant, where they livf until the corn starts to grow, when they are usually transferred to the corn roots. Here they remain, occasionally developing winged forms which come above the ground and fly to other fields, the pest being spread in this manner. In the fall the living females are developed, both of which live under the surface of the ground. The eggs laid by these females are cared for by ih» ants »hi"h taVe them deep into the earth during cold weather. Many methods of combating this insect have been tried, almost all of which have some value, although It would be difficult to say which would be the best when used alone. As the young insects rely almost entirely i-non the ants to place them upon the roots of the corn it would seem that to destroy the ant nests together with their occupants would tend to in che^k.

It is ho?\ ac-ompHshed by deep plowing and harrowing tftoumi late In tt-p foil after the corn Is out and before the •d Ir frozen too hard, or early in the spring. This method will break up the nests and expose the lice to the cold air which is fatal to them. Inasmuch as the young )i"e subsist upon the roots of smartweed and foxtail grass until the cori comes l'p. It is good practice to keep the «-nrn and surrounding fl"lds clear from these plants, thereby starving the aphis. This method will be materially agumented If the planting of the corn be deiaved as long as possible.

In the attempted control of this insect many experiments have been tried by treating the seed corn with some repellant which would keep nts and li"r awav from the roots, and a few of these have been attended with some degree of success in other states. Professor Forbes inolR bas carried on some extensive experiments along this line during the past two years. The renellants he used were as follows: Kero- fn* onnfvl to a callon of seed corn, stirred In just before planting: oil of lemon, a 10% solution in alcohol; carbolic acid or </seg>

SWE.NK Among the numerous insects injurious to common domesticated ani - mals in this state, therel.y rendering themselves obnoxious to the stock raiser, the several species of bot-flies rank among those of first impor - tance. These insects form a compact little family of less than a hundred si e ies. the OestrUk.e in the order Diptera, and are medium to large, heavy Dodied, hairy flies, especially characterized by the aborted mouth parts which are practically incapable of taking in food. The larvae live parasitically within the lodies of mammals, and very rarely, birds also. These are thick, fleshy, and in most cases very spiny grubs, apparently eleven-segmented when mati:re. and undergo two moults while within the 1 ody of the host, thus having at least three distinct larval tages. On leaving the animal they intil the adult is readv to emeree pupate within or upon the ground ready to emerg The method of attack is varied and three divisions have been sug- ghly separating them in o groups based on this character; ary canal, usually the stomach and bot-flies, the cephalic which attack attric which live in the alimen num. such as the various hors&lt; the najal and pharyngeal cavities, such as the sheep Lot-fly and the deer bot-flies, and the cutaneous which live in sacs which they form just beneath the skin, such as the ox warble", reindeer bot-fly and the squirrel, rabbit and rat hot-flies. As a rule, also, different genera of bot-flies |arasit*ze normally certain closely related groups of mammals, either a single spe.'ies. genus, family or order. Thus GastronhHux alfopta thn family or order. Thus Gastrophi'.us affects tho horse, Hypodet ma the ox and buffalo. Oestrus the sheep, Oedemagena the reindeer and its congeners. Ceahenomvia the rie^r and Cutfrehm tho igeners vmyia the deer and Cuterebra the various forms of rodents. While these different groups and genera have in the main similar life histories, there are peculiarities with every species, so here are individually considered in a brief and concise man - ner the essential facts regarding the appearance, life histories, injuries and methods of fighting these interesting though harassing creatures.

Of all the bot-flies affe;-tins domeslic animals in this country the ox rl le is the most iiiji-rious ar&lt;l causes the greatest losses to the farmer. Therefore, being the most important species, it will be considered first.

It is interesting to know. then, that the warbles found in the backs of rattle in this country are all, so far as we now know, the larvae of a single species of bot-fly, the Hypuilerma lineata of Villers. an insert usually known to farmers as the 'warble fly." the "cattle bot-fly" or the "heel fly." the animals affected being said to be "warbled" or "grubby." The insect occurs throughout the United States wherever cattle are raised, and is common in Europe also, occuring there with a larger and differently colored species of similar habits. Hypoderma bovis DeGeer. which latter species may yet lie found in America. Aside from infest - ing domestic cattle, in early days lineata was present among the herds of native bison or buffalo, but whether it was an original parasite of this domesticated animals is a question labilities lie with the latter alterna- species or one introduced from tt yet undetermined, although the pro! tive. At any rate it was always rare on the bison, even when abundant on the cattle. Whether it is indigenous to Europe or America or both is another unsettled prol lem. the evidence for a complete demonstration of either theory being lacking In appearance the ox warble fly is dark and fuzzy, about one-half an inch long or slightly more, with the top of the head and thorax, middle of abdomen and !egs clothed with blackish hair, relieved on the base of the abdomen, sides of thorax, and face with whitish pubescence, and hav - ing the abdomen tipped wi'h orange.

Many farmers mistake the large black gad-fly. Tabanus atratus. an insect slightly over an inch long, jet black, with smoky wings, for the author of the warbles, but this impression is entirely erroneous. The pres - ence of this insect upon the cattle's backs in summer is entirely for the purpose of sucking the animal's blood, an act which it is easily enabled to accomplish by use of its strong lance-like mouth parts, thereby inflicting a painful wound. This fly is a close relative of the well known "Greenhead," which Is endowed with similar tormenting propensities. and the larval stages of loth of these gad-flies are spent in the water isoft mud of lowlands. Hence to seriously consider this insect as con - ted with the warble injury would be ridiculous. Owing to the persistent and often emphatic complaints coming from our farmers and sto~k raisers, detailing losses from injured hides, shortened milk supply, difficulties in fattening, a general emaciated con - dition of the badly infested cattle and not infrequently the death of calves, all due to the ravagrs of the warble fly. it was deemed advisable to take up the matter for consideration in this report. Accordingly, in order to determine as accurately as possible the general estimate of the harm this insect is really doing in Nebraska, the losses it is occasioning, and the remedies, if any. which were leing nse&lt;1 against it, numerous copies of a circular were sent out to prominent cattlemen and stock growers over the state. 1 riefly outlining tbe known habits and history of t insect, and asking questions which were hoped to bring out such inal observations as had been made. These questions were as follows: 1. Is the Ox Warble present in your locality, and if so. to what extent? 2. How long since it was first known to occur there? 3 When do the grubs first appear on the cattle's hacks? 4 When do they drop out? 5. In marketing animals, how nni"h, if any. do the dealers dock on ac-ount of the presence of the grub? 6. Does the presence of warbles interfere vith fattening, and if so. to what extent? 7. Are these grubs equally common on range and farm animals? 8 When do the flies first make their appearance? 9. On what part of the fnima! do they lay their eggs? 10.

            <seg id="p334">331 replies to this circular may he briefly summed up thus: tl. The Ox Warble is present over the entire state, and while east - rdly it seems to be only fairly common, in western Nebraska it Is abundant and of recent years has been decidedly on the increase. On the majority of ranches from 50 per cent to 75 per cent of the cattle are affected. 2. It has been present as long as cattle have been raised in the state, appearing with the first settlements; within the memory of many old settlers it has been prevalent among our cattle for the last forty years or more. 3. The first gruls appear as early as September, when a few very small ones are discernible upon close Inspection, more appearing during October, November and December, and all reaching very obvious size by New Year's Day, from whhh time on they are conspicuous. fi. The first ones begin to drop out about the 10th of March, the bulk them leave the animal during April and May, and practically ail have dropped out by the 10th of June As a rule, there is no dockage on animals poor in flesh because of cent to 10 per cent of the value is warble attack, Lut sometimes 5 per docked for this cause: warbled hide class, which is equivalent to a dock s, however, are always rated second age of one-third. 16. Where only a few grubs are pr too slight for consideration, but psent the interference with fattening badly infested animals fatten only with great difficulty or not at all. require 10 per cent more feed, and are usually about a month behind uninfested individuals, an inter - ference in all of perhaps 25 per cent to 35 per cent. 7 Where the two are equally accessible to the flies, farm and range attle seem to be equally infested, but westwardly the range cattle seem to have much the worst of it The first flies appear about the first of April, others coming out ing May, June and July, reaching the maximum of abundance early the season. The value of the answers to this questions were greatly lessened by the common confusion of Tabanus atratus with the real cul - prit; Ihese answers of course invaribly gave the season as July and August. 9. The eggs are deposited on the lower portions of the limbs, usually the hind legs about the hoofs. L10. The cattle are everywhere afraid of the flies and try to escape m them by running or seeking water, where the fly will not follow. 11. Very few cattlemen have any definite notion of the modus oper - andi of the grubs in reaching their location in the animal's back. All those mistaking the Tabanus for the warble fly of course clung to the old Idea of direct placement on or under the skin of the back. 12.

The only remedies generally practiced are the squeezing out of the grubs or killing them by putting some substance, such as turpen - tine. carbolate;i oil. axle grease, etc., into their breathing holes in the animal's back. ipping. Icing practiced in the fall and early spring before the hing holes are well formed, is considered usually ineffectual against warbles.

They are then ■oth except for minute, short, black, spiny hooks around the small breathing holes at the posterior end of the body. By the use of iwever. the larva slowly pierces the skin and brings the anal breathing pores to the air. When this is accomplished a moult is undergone and we get what is called the third larval stage of the insect, in whi-h the body is finely spined on the ventral side and the breath - ing pores are much enlarged. The activity of the spiny larva at this stage causes an irritation and a resultant gathing of serum upon which the creature feeds and grows rapidly. This causes the greenish yellow, runniug surface to the skin and the adjacent tissues known familiarly as "licked beef." Anoiher moult and the fourth and final larval stage is assumed, provided with its abundance of spines and its thick heavy bo&lt;ly. Hy this time the New Year has come in, and the grubs have developed good-sized lumps which can readily be felt by running the hand along the animal's back. Each one is now encysted in a little sac and sulsists ui&gt;on an abundant accumulation of serum and pus. When growth has proceeded so far that the grubs are matured, having become an inch or more long and nearly one-half as wide, they work their way out of the breathing holes and drop to the earth, which they enter to the depth of one or two inches. This egress begins early in March and con - tinues for about three months, as the larvae of various ages mature. They are at first grayish in color, but rapidly darken, contract, and harden, finally turning dark brown or blackish, thus forming the puparium. In three to six weeks the puparium is broken off at the anterior end and the adult bot-fly emerges.

For this purpose train oil or fish oil mixed with carbolic acid may be sprayed, or axle grease may be smeared over the parts, these applications to be repeated at frequent inter - vals from April to August. The second and more practicable method is to apply to the warbles once or twice during the winter and early spring some oil which will close the breathing holes of the grub and thus suffocate it. For this purpose the substances just mentioned as repellants may be used, or else kerosene or turpentine. The grub is killed immediately, and the «und soon closes and heals so that the hide is uninjured, and the animal ing relieved from the constant irritation gains in flesh or in milk pro - ction.

THE HORSE BOT-FLIES (Oastrnphilus spp. ) »\v e have in this country three distinct species of bot-fly infesting the se. all belonging to the genus Gastrophilim.

During the warmer portions of the day they buzz about among the horses in the pastures or follow them along the country roads, seeking to deposit their eggs upon the animal, or else they lie in wait upon some tall thistle or sunflower for the approach of a victim. The eggs are laid upon the hairs of the horse, and are glued there by a y liouid which dries and holds them on so securely that they can moved "nly with difficulty. In oviposition. the female hovers with the abdomen hent under and its tip extending far forward, then sud - denly darts to the animal. atta"hes the egg and retreats, to repeat the operation in a few moments. The various species select different por - tions of the body for this purpose; rqui lays its eggs anywhere upon the hairs of the forelegs and shoulders that the horse may be able to reach and lifk, while rwsalis and haemorrhoidali.i always deposit theirs upon the chin and about the nostrils and mouth. The presence of the bot-fly S engaged apparently gives the horse much annoyance, and often c. lut usually futile efforts are made to destroy or escape the pest, su'-h consternation is purely instinctive is shown by the fact that its rudimentary mouth inrts and soft, blunt ovipositor the fly is in-arable of inflicting any pain. These eggs are about one-twentieth of an inch Ions, cylindrical, finely ringed, the attached end ra'her pointed and the free end thicker and ending in »n oblirrelv trvncate cap. The eggs of harmorrhoidalis are . distinguishable by their dusky color, those of rqui and nasalis being whitish, but even these can te distinguished, for the eggs of equi are nt'ached to the hair only alout one-half of their length and the cap is larger and more oblique than in the eggs of nasalis which are attached nearly their entire length. Each female deposits easily four or five hun - i:srs during her life. ■his that moisture is necessary for the successful hatching of these eges. and the great hulk of those out of reach of the animal's tongue probably fail to develop larvae.

The injury done by the bots is in this stage, and while ordinarily they do tut little harm, their presence in numbers often is the cause of vrry disagreeable conditions for the horse. They irritate the membranous lining, retard glandular activity, subsist upon exudations from the sores they create and upon the stomach contents, and inter - fere with the passage of food into the intestines. While these conditions rarely cause death they afford the animal much annoyance, and when several hundred are in the stomach at the same time, as sometimes occurs, they may become serious. The larvae of equi prefer to locate on the left side of the stomach, those of na»alis usually both there and in the duo - denum near the pylorus, but haemorrhiiMalis usually locates upon the right side of the stomach proper. This latter species often attaches itself in the throat about the pharynx when very young, and is then the cause of a distressing cough. After spending several months in the alimentary canal of the host the larvae loosen their hold and pass out with the Excrement to the ground. In the case of haemorrhoidahs. however, they re-attach themselves to the walls of the rectum and remain there for a time before leaving the animal, meanwhile changing color from reddish to dusky.

Their life history as known in Europe is essentially quite similar to I hat of the sheep bot-fly which we have just considered. The female in the early fall deposits living larvae in or about the nose of the victim, which immediately work their way backwards into the nasal cavity, ng by their irritations a catarrh-like flow of the mucus upon which they subsist and slowly develop. About mid-winter they moult and the young larvae of the second stage leave the nasal cavity for the throat, where they occur with and ultimately transform into the larvae in the third stage, from which they differ mostly by being smaller, more slender and less spinous. They locate in the throat, upon the palate, in the eustachian nil es and al out the base of the tongue, forming sores upon the secretions of which they complete development, when they leave the animal by passing out through the nose and mouth. Upon reaching I he earth they pupate within a day or two in some dark, pro - tected spot, the adults emerging in three to six weeks. Quite frequently, in cases of severe infestation, the grubs cause the death of the unfortu - r animals, which are then said by hunters to have died from "grub in head." //in is known in North America only in the larval stage, the adults never having been reared or even captyred as far as we have a matter of record.

The same authors also record (ibid.. Ill, p. 161) the taking of larvae of this genus from the throat of hogs in West Virginia. Both of these latter instances must be regarded as exceptional. E^-demagena tarandi is a bot-fly which infests the reindeer (Rangifer nicux) and probably other related species of native Caribou in the 1 regions of North America. It has been repeatedly recorded from Alaska. The fly closely resembles the species of Hypoderma in appear - te and probably has a precisely similar life history. The adults fly July and August. Alout twenty-two species of the genus Cuterebra are known from North America, and at least three species, abdominalis Swenk. fasciata Swenk, and ryanella Jones, have been found in Nebraska. These are very large flies, about the size of a bumble bee, and habitually parasitize various rodents such as the squirrels (Sciurus), spermophiles (Citellu*), rabbits {Lepui) and woodrats (Xeotoma). They have frequently been reported affecting the domestic cat, having been found on the belly, back, neck and about the eyes of the animal, and have even been found affect - ing a certain species of turtle. Their life histories are obscure, and the harm they do economically Is probably very small indeed. </seg>

MAY 20, 1908 The speakers at this conference were Professors Condra, Caldwell, S'.out, PhMlips, Bengtson, and Gov. George L. Sheldon, with Dean Charles E. Bessey presiding. The principal object of the meeting was to make known reliable information in regard to the Missouri river, concerning which there is widespread interest and in some instances a tendency to magnify the future possibilities of the river. This paper is an account of the conference. It gives some of the thoughts that were emphasized at the symposium, reciting the facts as they were given by those who have investigated the respective phases of the theme. The subject. Geographic Conditions in the Missouri River Basin. ~ was discussed by Prof. G. E. Condra. Professor Bessey said, while In - troducing the first speaker and subject: "That a river is more than water flowing between visible banks. It includes the slopes over which or through which a sheet of water passes slowly or rapidly to a central stream. This drainage is essential to the open river." GEOGRAPHIC CONDITIONS IN THE MISSOURI RIVER BASIN II Y I, K. KIMiKA Professor of Geography and Economic Geology, University of Nebraska. Mk. C iairman. Lames and Gknti kmkv I will try to outline some of the factors which control the Missouri river. Dean Bessey, the father of science in Nebraska, has given us a good definition of a river. A great river is not the same in its various parts or courses. It is conditioned by many things, such as structure, topography, subsoil, rainfall, temper - ature and evaporation. The rate and volume of flow; the quality of water, whether turbid or clear: the source and direction of a stream: its quiet and rapid waters, low and high stages, these and other condi - tions are not accidents; they are readily accounted for by those who study the environments of rivers. The drainage basin of the Missouri has an area of about 492.000 square miles, including all of Nebraska and much of Kansas, Iowa. South Da - kota. North Dakota. Montana. Wyoming and Colorado. The principal tributaries from south to north are the Kansas, Platte. Niobrara, Chey- </seg>

The trunk stream, known as the Missouri river proper, is formed in southwestern Montana I y the union of the Jefferson. Madison and Gallatin rivers. This is known as the head of the Missouri; however, we should recognize the fait that the head waters of the river lie in all of its tributaries along the east front of the Rocky Mountains and even out on the plains, the sources leiiiL' in many streams and at many places. The largest afflu - ents join the main river on the right, i. e., coming from the west over of the (Ireat Plains, which slant dovn from an elevation of feet along the east border of the Rocky Mountain region to an elevation of about 1.210 feet at the mouth of the Niobrara feet at the mouth of the Platte; 725 feet at the mouth of the Kansas and nearly 400 feet at the junction of the Missouri with tht- Miisisslppi I r.inasre in the mountain courses conies down from elevations of feet and higher at places. Let me give an outline of certain conditions !n the basin. r al strut ture — There are many kinds of rocks in the basin, hxirt and resistant, others soft and easily eroded. The bed rock In the table lands and plains, consisting of clays, shales, kuH M and limestones, is plainly stratified, the leds lying in a nearly horizontal position. At most places the bed rock here is covert : ul soil. The line between the high plains and the mountains is marked by strata which dip out under the table lands. Going into the mountains one sees rocks and structures entirely unlike those just described. They are the granites and metamorphic rocks. In brief, it may be stated that each principal tributary flows over several geological formations and that the nature of the streams is controlled somewhat by the ■ure of these formations. Waterfalls, rapids, quiet courses and the sire, form and depth of valleys are explained in part by structure. Topography and Subsoil. — The Missouri river basin contains mountains, cut by deep canyons; high table lands, smooth and eroded bad land regions, covering several thousand square miles; sand hill areas, occupying more than 20.000 square miles; loess plains, smooth and dissected, fully 50,000 square miles; a large extent of the glacial plains; and wide areas where close-textured, Cretaceous clays lie near the sur - face. The run-off is not the same on any two of the above named ;i The rainfall of the sand hills pearly all goes to underground drainage and issues as springs which give permanent streams. The clayey sub - soils and rough topographies give quick runoff, followed by dry stream beds. This condition is best illustrated in the bad lands of South Dakota. Montana. Wyoming and Nebraska. The loess of southern Ne - braska and northern Kansas will catch and hold a heavy rainfall, at least until it becomes thoroughly moistened, after which its run-off is large, causing floods. Rainfall and Evaporation. — The mean annual rainfall decreases from </seg>

The snow - fall is greatest in the mountains and least in the southern part of the basin. The maximum rainfall on the plains is in the spring and early part of summer. Evaporation is thought to be greatest in the southern part of the basin, especially on the high plains, where the relative humidity is low. Named from west to east, the Missouri drainage oc - cupies, according to some authors, sub-humid, arid, sub-humid and humid belts. The Plat'.e river and the Missouri river proper flow across each of r belts and are very noticeably affected by the climatic conditions in belt. Eyrested Areas. — These are confined to the mountains and usually to 1 parts of the valleys which lie in the sub-humid and humid belts, region of low rainfall is, as a rule, one of little or no tree growth. I of the mountain ranges are covered on their sides with thick forest; others contain either thin stands or bare slopes. The run-off, for several reasons, is most permanent where there is a forest covering. It is in this connection, i. e.. in the making of the Platte and the Missouri more regular in flow, that Nebraskans should favor forestation wherever it is feasible. There is strong evidence to show that a large amount of the Kssouri river basin was forested before the time of the advent of the lian and white man into the region. Pt Mountain Tributaries. — These head in the snow fields and forested and receive an abundance of water in the springtime They are and rapid, due to steep gradients. In many places the run-off of streams continues throughout the year. The streams are used for power in the mountains and for irrigation on the plains. Some of these rivers are strong enough to find their way to the Missouri during the summer months: others dwindle under the dry air, exposing their sandy beds, only the underflow continuing down-valley. P notified Hirers.— The Platte is the world's best example of a stream as a heavier load of silt and sand than it can carry. It breaks large bowlders in the mountains; rolls them along its channel, loosening the small pieces. The pebbles and fine grains are carried eastward, especially at flood stages. \Vhen the river decreases in volume from one cause or another the load is dropped at least for a time, adding to Ihe river's thick lied of sand. These processes make a broad flood plain and cause the river to become wide and shallow, therefore irnsuited for navigation. The Missouri is moderately loaded with clay and silt, brought to it mostly by the Yellowstone river and the bad-land streams, making the water turbid. Missouri River* — The head-water streams, known as the Three Forks, are each about 90 or 100 feet wide at their junction in Montana.

The rapids cease a few miles above Fort Benton and there the navigable Missouri begins. From Fort Benton to the junction of Hell creek, a distance of 281.8 miles, the valley is narrow, with practically no flood plain; the walls are steep and high. From Hell creek to the mouth of the Yellowstone river the valley has an average width of from two to four miles, a broad flood plain, and well-deveioped meanders begin at the mouth of Hell creek.

From Fort Buford, North Dakota, to Bismarck, the river falls from an altitude of 1,859.85 .feet to 1,634.36 feet in a distance of 307.3 miles, which is an average of 0.73 foot per mile. The valley width varies from one to four miles, generally being about one and one-half to two miles. The channel is obstructed by numerous bars and islands; meanders are well developed, and cut banks are numerous but not of much significance. From Bismarck, North Dakota, to Chamberlain. South Dakota, the alti - tude is lowered to 1.324 feet in a distance of 382.6 miles, or an average of 0.81 foot per mile. The same characteristics of valley and flood plain predominate below Bismarck as above. The only unusual feature is the Great Bend above Chamberlain, where the river makes a big loop and. after flowing a channel distance of twenty-five miles, it comes back to within two miles of where it began its loop. From Chamberlain to Running Water. South Dakota, the altitude falls to 1.207.06 feet in 127.3 miles, an average of 0.81 foot per mile. From Running Water to Yankton the distance is 43 6 miles and the altitude falls to 1,157 feet, an average of 1.16 feet per mile. The valley from Chamberlain to Yankton does not vary much in width, being generally from one to two miles wide, and the channel swings from one side to the other with marked regularity. The meander limit has evidently not been reached and the valley bears a good many indications of youth. The banks are being cut slowly at many points along the way, but not rap - idly enough to jeopardize seriously the value of bottom lands. It is also to be noted that the grade of the river from its entrance into North Dakota to Yankton, South Dakota, shows great uniformity. It is then to be expected, as is the case, that the valley characteristics shall also be uniform. </seg>

Just below Yankton the valley width increases abruptly from about three miles to nearly eighteen miles. The stream throughout this distance is characterized by well-developed meanders, cut-offs, oxbow lakes, and prominent cut banks. The channel in some places has shifted more than a mile since 1891.

From Sioux City to Blair, Nebraska, the channel distance is 116 miles; the altitude lowers to 1,011.2 feet, an average fall of 0.85 foot per mile. From Blair to Omaha, a distance of 35.5 miles, the average fall is 1.0+ feet per mile. Between Sioux City and Omaha the flood plain varies in width from four to ten miles and the river does not strike the Iowa bluffs until Council Bluffs is reached. There the valley is much constricted, being less than five miles wide. From Omaha to Nebraska City the altitude lowers from 975.55 feet to 947.66 feet in 51.4 miles, an average fall of 0.54 foot per mile. From Nebraska City to Rulo the elevatron changes from 947.66 feet to 864.54 feet in a distance of 70.7 miles, an average fall of 1.1 feet per mile. From Rulo, Nebraska to the mouth of the Missouri the distance is 537.5 miles and the total fall 448.18 feet, an average fall of 0.83 foot per mile. It should be noted that the Missouri flows on alluvial land throughout much of its middle and lower courses. Only here and there does it strike bed rock at the cut-banks. The fall is far from uniform and the difference between high and low stages is marked, the maximum flow at the junction with the Mississippi being about twenty-eight times that of the minimum. Sandbars and snags are features throughout the river length. In Montana, the Dakotas and along most of the Nebraska border, the river is usually closed by ice during a part of the winter. The flood stages are two, in March or April and June or July. EiVe have reviewed some of the conditions in the basin. Now, for purpose of placing before you certain problems which are to be died by other speakers, let me ask the following questions: tl. Will the storing of flood water for power and irrigation purposes the tributaries affect the flow of the trunk stream? Will this in any t tend to decrease the floods of the lower Mississippi? t2.

Of course the only hope lies in the .Missouri river and its chief tributaries. A brief study of the river and the commerce that in earlier days floated on its rhulent waters may be worthy of a few moments of our time. Speaking as the historian it may le noted that the first time the Missouri river was seen by a white man was in lt&gt;73, when Marquette and Joliet saw its muddy flood pour into the Mississippi river. Some time between 169* and 17'i5 the river was ascended for some hundreds of miles, but the fxict date is somewhat uncertain. By 1724 it was fairly •veil mapped, but its upper course wa first explored in 1738 by Verendrye. 'Sim. of course, by the Indians in soon began to use the cotton wood was unfitted for service on this Commerce on the Missouri was I: canoes. French trappers followed am anoe. as the birth bark eano&lt; snaggy stream. Other early forms of 1 oat used by white men were the pcrogue, the batteau, the mackinaw anil the bull-boat. All of these forms were used by the fur traders especially, but continued to be used in later days for carrying supplies and provisions. The fur trade ended about 1845 and these types of boats practically passed away at that date. With the beginning of the 19th century the keel-boat, the chief means of river navigation for many years, began its career. Manuel Lisa was one of the first to employ it in the up-river trade. Lewis and Clark in 1804 ascended the river by its means, as did Pike in 1800. J. J. Astor in 1810 had a fleet of five of these 1 oats. The means of propulsion was a rope, perhaps 300 yards long, with ten to twenty men on land to draw the boat up-stream; tails, poles and oars were also used as occasion or necessity might determine. Some of these keel boats were nearly a hundred feet in length, and capable of transporting many tons of freight. In 1819 the first steamboat entered the river, and from that time to 1830, occasional trips were made, with a gradually in leasing number of boats in use. During the next decade regulaj" lines of steamers, equipped with one engine, were placed in service on the river. However, the years 1850 to water routes may le developei </seg>

Many it ti.e seamers used at this time were handsome and well equipped. of the largest on&gt; 240 feet in length, with forty-foot team, and were capable of carrying 4uu people and 500 tons of freight. They were then called "floating palaces." At Leavenworth in one year 30€ s. earners entered and dewed, while in 1859 at Sioux City some 312 ids to the value of 11,260.000, entered in one season.

By the latter date the profits of river traffic sone, and the vessels that continued in sen ice did so largely as tramps, and 1 e ai:se they were in existence.

V. P. STOUT Head Professor of Civil Engineering, University of Nebraska Major Chittenden, of the Corps of Engineers of United States army, has said that in no portion of her works has Nature left so much to be done by the engineer to supplement her deficiencies as in the modification of the natural flow of streams. Major Chittenden has been stationed for many years on the Missouri river and is probably the most thorough stu - dent of that stream in all Ita aspects and relations that we know. It is, Krefore, fair to assume that the Missouri river inspired the statement ich has just been quoted. So far as a river like the Missouri is concerned, its uses for which it is or can be made available, are agriculture, transportation and power. In addition to the studies and works necessary to develop these uses we have also to interest ourselves in the works that are necessary to insure life and properly against the destructive tendencies of the great stream. So far as power and transportation and the prevention of the ravages of the river are concerned there is a single, simple condition which may be kept in view as the ideal which is to be approached as closely as practicable. This ideal is a condition of absolutely uniform How in the channel at all points, and is an ideal which is, in this case, as far removed from the actual as can well be imagined, for the Missouri river is sub - ject throughout its course to extremes of high and low water. If abso - lute uniformity in the flow could be obtained all power developments would be able to deliver the constant output which is desired. The craft engaged in transportation would have a single and well known set of conditions to encounter, and the river, in due course of time, would settle itself into a regular and permanent bed, and the shifting and change which is now so prominent a feature would disappear. When, however, we consider the application of the water of the river to agricultural uses we find that absolute uniformity of How is not consistent with complete utilization, since the demand for water for irrigation is a variable one even throughout the irrigation season, and ceases entirely during a large portion of the year. It is to be remembered also that it withdraws or di - verts the water from the channel of the river, and that a large proportion, probably about two-thirds, is permanently withdrawn, given off by evap - oration from the surface of the irrigated fields and crops. This is borne away in the upper currents of the air so that there is no assurance or ground for belief that when it does return to the land it will fall on the drainage area from which it was originally withdrawn. The other one - third of the water which has been diverted for irrigation will sink into the ground and in the form of return and seepage waters will sooner or later reappear in the main stream. It is easy to see that this action would interfere with any scheme or plan which aims to bring about a uniform rate of flow in the river. However, even though irrigation would be a distributing factor in a scheme which contemplated a constant rate of flow in a stream, it is of itself an effective means toward the reduction of the extremes in the flow of streams. The features responsible for this effect being the stor - age of flood waters, which reduces the highwater stages, and the return of the seepage waters which augments the low water stages. </seg>
            <seg id="p357">354 NKBRASKA BTATK BOAKO or ACHim/TIKE The discussion of the storage of water in connection with the utiliza - tion of streams for irrigation, power, and transportation has appealed chiefly to those who in some degree have been interested in these indus - tries. The storage of water as a measure of protection against floods, ho\ve\er. has seemed to attract popular interest and us is usual in such cases, some mistaken ideas are entertained. The matter has been the subject of investigation in this country at various times for the last fifty or sixty years, and the conclusion generally has l.een the equivalent of that which Major Chittenden has formulated. 'The function of reservoirs will always he primarily the promotion of industrial ends: secondarily only, a possible amelioration of Hood conditions in the rivers." An illustra - tic n which seems to apply in this connection is t hat of the large reservoirs on the head waters of the Mississippi river. Experience has shown that these reservoirs are substantially effective in improving the navigation conditions on t lie upper Mississippi river down as far as St. Paul and that water ]K&gt;wer developments along the same stretch of river also are indebted to these reservoirs for an increased steadiness of flow. So far as floo&lt;l conditions, however, arc concerned, it is said that the effect of ■ rvoirs on the stage at St. Paul is inappreciable. This fact should not occasion surprise when it is remembered that although these voirs are among the largest in the world and store entirely the water drained from an area which is in itself large, this area is only a liitle more than ten per cent of the area drained by the river al&gt;ove St. Paul, so that a little less than ninety per cent of the area which was originally available to produce floods at St. Paul still remains effective to that end. When we come to consider the regulation of the rate of flow in the 11 ri river, by mea.ns of reservoirs at its head waters, we are con - fronted by some facts of history and exj&gt;erience which convince us that such an expedient can be only in i&gt;art effect he. Thus in the great flood of 1844 which lias never, within the period of record been equalled on the . mi ri river at Kansas City nor on the Mississippi river at St. Ijouis, low water was re]&gt;orted at Sioux City, showing that this flood owed none of its intensity to waters which came down from the mountain drainage areas at the head of the river and that reservoirs in that region could not have sened to mitigate the flood. The United States Reclamation Service, which has been in existence since \'M\2. has surveyed, estimated and in part const ructed reservoirs for irrigation on the Missouri river catchment area, to the extent of an aggregate capacity exceeding four million acre feet. Four million acre feet is the equivalent of about G0.000 cubic feet per second for one month, or of M.MM cubic feet per second for three months. The first of these amounts withdrawn from the Missouri ri\er is sufficient to reduce materially the height of the June rise and the second is sufficient, if permitted to te applied to that use, to raise materially the height of the low stage in the river. Major Chittenden has estimated that the stage of the upper flood waters might reduce the flood height at Sioux City to an extent of from three to six feet, according to how completely the work of reservoir construction was carried out. A five year record at Sioux City shows the range in height of river there to be about twenty-two feet. Six feet taken off at the flood height, and an equal amount added to the low stage would reduce the extreme range in height from twenty-two feet to ten feet, which reduction would be a long step in the direction of securing the uniformity of flow which is so desirable from the stand - points which have been mentioned. An idea which seems to be very generally prevalent is that the floodt in the Missouri river are, to a large extent, resjionsible for the destruc </seg>

The high floods in the lower Mississippi correspond closely in point of time to those in the Ohio river, and occur several weeks earlier in each year than the Hood in the Missouri river. The Missouri river flood is much smaller in volume than the Ohio river flood and is superposed on the Mississippi waters at a time when the Ohio and the upper Mississippi are in moderate flood at r The question of storge &lt;&gt;f the waters in the upper Ohio and its tribu- taries was discussed extensiiely about the middle of the last century, and the conclusion seems to have been that suck Btorage if carried out to an extent to make it effectlye was impractical on account of magnitude and cost. The subject, however, has been lately reviewed by the Chief Hydro- grapher of the United Stales Geological Survey, who has had the advan - tage of a large amount of topographic and hydrographic data in addition to which was available in connection with the investigations of earlier engineers, and the modern view-point also has been modified by the de - velopments in electrical transmission of power, and by the recognized desirability of conserving our coal supply. The conclusion reached in this later investigation, although advanced as a somewhat tentative one. is that the storage of water on the upper Ohio and its tributaries, cost ing from one hundred and twenty-five million to two hundred million dol lars. would le repaid ! y (he returns from power development alone that the advantages to ni\igation would le material and pronounced, and that an effective measure of flood protection would be secured. It is not believed that this case can be taken as the basis for assuming that a similar investigation on the Missouri river would lead to a similar con- clusion. As previously noted, the largest flood on the Missouri did not originate in a region where reservior sites can be found The Missouri River Commission which was in existence from 1884 to lent al.out nine and one-half million dollars on works of regula tion and protection in the river, about two million dollars of this amount being spent above Pionx City, and the balance between Sioux City and the mouth. The expenditure of this large sum of money accomplished little for the benefit of navigation, since for this purpose the work must be systematic and continuous. The chief benefit which has been derived was in the nature of protection to private property, and even in this respect th«" demands for protection have been many times greater than could possibly be accommodated with the means at hand. This work. which has consisted largely of bank protection and similar construction. lacks the general utility which attaches to reservoir construction. If a reser\oir is constructed and used intelligently it is known absolutely that flood heights will le reduced, low water stages will be raised, navigation conditions will be improved, the value and availability of the stream for power de\elopment will le increased, and riparian property will be more secure. There can be no doubt «s to the direction of these effects. As So the measure of the effects in any given case there may be a wide range of uncertainty and difference of opinion rn the introduction of the fourth speaker, the chairman said: "Every river has relation to forests Where there are forests there are rivers; where there are no forests there are no rivers, the only possible excep - tion being in the sand hill areas. When man wholly destroys the forests, the rivers disappear. In place of the stream is a dry river bed, aban - doned as a continuous river course.

We will now ask Professor Phillips to discuss the subject which interests him THE RKL.ATIONS OF FORESTS TO RUN-OFF WATER. iiy r. .i. I'lULi.irs. Professor of Forestry. University of Nebraska Mil Ciiukman. Lamm and Gk.ntlemkn: The relation of forests in rving water supply is an exceedingly important one. There is scarcely an old resident who has seen forests disappear but has also noted a marked increase in floods and the serious damage which results. On the other hand, where a nation has re-established protective forests on steep slopes and secured far-reaching, beneficial results, as France has done, it should be a strong object lesson to every nation where there is need for similar work. The general laws pertaining to the growth B trees and those relating to rainfall and stream flow are every - e same and what several nations have already learned by cruel •e ought to be an object lesson to the younger nations which &gt;rnod with the same problems. fin our own country no waterway is so important as the Missouri - ississippi and certainly in no part of this continent does the run-off reach such a maximum or produce such devastating results as it does along this stream course. Muir appropriately describes the situation when he says, 'Think of ( his mighty stream, springing in the first place from the sea, flying on the wind, alighting on the mountains in hail and snow and rain, lingering in many a fountain feeding the trees and grass; then gathering its scattered waters, gliding from its noble lake, and going back home to the sea, singing all the way! On it sweeps through the gates of the mountains, across the vast prairies and plains, through many a wild, gloomy forest, cane-brake, and sunny savanna; from glaciers and snow banks and pine woods to the warm groves of magnolia and palm; geysers dancing at its head, keeping time with the sea waves at its mouth; roaring and gray in rapids, booming in broad. tx)=sy falls, murmuring, gleaming in long, silvery reaches, swaying now hither, now thither, whirling, bending in huge doubling, eddying folds, serene, majestic, ungovernable, overflowing all its metes and bounds, frightening the dwellers upon its banks; building, wasting, uprooting, planting; engulfing old islands and making new ones, taking away fields ttnd towns as if in sport, carrying canoes and ships of commerce in the midst of Its spoils and drift, fertilizing the continent as one vast farm." Truly, this magnificent waterway demands our most serious considera - tion and our engineers and scientists should unite in trying to make it tbest controlled stream of its size on earth as well as making the k s&lt;tvp as a model for smaller streams. Conditions such as prevail at the headwaters of the Missouri show the value of maintaining a dense forest cover. The general elevation of the region is between 8,000 and 9,000 feet. Sudden, heavy rainfall is common during the summer. Snow comes early in winter and piles up to housetop depths before spring. Slopes are steep and were it not for some of the best forests that occur in the Rocky mountains every </seg>
            <seg id="p360">357 foot of slope soil would be washed away in less than a decade. It is well that the government controls most of these forests and that ade - quate provision will be made not only to maintain these forests but to actually improve them. The proximity of this work to the state of Nebraska and the great importance of the river to the state make it imperative that some consideration be given to the specific effect which a forest has in regulating the water supply. A brief statement of the effect of the forest may be made as follows «1. It has often been argued that the forest increases the rainfall, ost of the scientific investigators have found that forests do not in - crease the rainfall and only one or two men contend that the forests do increase rainfall. It is a generally accepted truth that the forests do not increase rainfall. 2. Forest trees do intercept a considerable portion of the rainfall on its way to the ground, thus allowing more time for the water to sink into the slope soi!s than would le the carp if the slopes were bare. 3. The bases of standing trees together with decaying vegetation and other ground litter have a barrier effect which aids in preventing surface run-off on slope land. The greatest importance of this is manifested when comparison is made between a forest from which the litter has been burned and one in which the litter forms a perfect ground cover. 4. Forest litter and a densa humus serve as a great natural reservoir, which is much more retentive of moisture than bare soil would be. This decaying vegetation absorbs water quickly and has an immense capacity for holding it. and hence thi against flooding in mountain regions rential rain of more than four in&lt; forest humus. factor serves as an effective check Often the erosive effect of a tor- will be entirely prevented by 5. A forest-covered slope has a more porous soil than a bare slope or one covered with grass and hence the soil proper is more capable of water absorption than would be the case if the soil were hare. 16. Forest-covered slopes constantly increase in soil depth and thus water-holding capacity while bare slopes rapidly lose soil and soon become incapable of retaining water. It has often been noted that in the United States, slope soil which has been forming for centuries was entirely washed away in the short course of three to five years after the complete removal of the forest. If we retain the forest under the proper Kiagement it will serve as a permanent resource which will give an ual yield of wood: destroy the forest and it may take centuries of e to reestablish a satisfactory cover. K7. The forest soil sends much more snow water to the water table an does bare soil, since the snow melts much more slowly in the forest than in the open. This is due largely to the shade furnished by the tree crowns, hut is also due to a limited extent to the lessened evapo - rative force of the wind. The average temperature of the forest soil is 2 to 3° (Centigrade) lower than bare soil, which has an effect equal to about the same number of degrees in latitude for the bare soil. The im - portance of this temperature effect is shown by the fact that snow-fed streams flow approximately twice as much during the day as at night, hence an average difference of 2° to 3° must have an appreciable influence in the annual run-off. Briefly, then, the value of forest cover lies in the greatly in&gt; amount of water which is sent to the water table instead of becoming surface run-off, thus effectually regulating flow whenever the forest cover is in sufficient proportion to the size of the watershed. It serves, too. </seg>
            <seg id="p361">358 in retaining flow during early spring, when there is least need for ihe water and making available more water for summer, when there is greatest need for it. fortunately, we have not had a sufficient amount of scientific study i country on the changes which result in deforesting a water-shed has been previously densely forested. The government has, how - made scientific comparisons between two adjoining water-sheds were as closely similar as was possible to select. This compari - son brought out many strong facts in favor of retaining the forest cover on slope lands, yet the results were not as striking as they would have been had they been tried on a watershed which was densely forested and then had the forest removed. ThP question lias probably been most thoroughly worked out tn France where two-thirds of all the torrents of Europe occur. During the French Revolution immense slope areas were entirely denuded of forest growth and at least MO,&lt;KM acres of agricultural land was washed away or seriously affected by flooding. The danger was becoming worse each year and fully 1.500 streams were considered dangerous. The first policy for flood prevention was a vast system of reservoirs and dams. Then sodding the slopes was tried and finally recourse had to he made to reforestation. This method was effectually started under national laws in 1882 and alreads lf&gt;:! of these torrential streams are under full control, while nearly 700 of the remainder are beginning to show the tieficial influence of reforestation. The difficulties of the work can fully comprehended only when it is understood that it was sometimes i for the tree planters to carry soil up the slopes in baskets order to make a suitable bed for the trees to grow in. Another phase of protective work is of vital significance to Nebraska. There is a vast area of slope land within our state which is not per - fectly suited for agriculture yet and which is well a&lt;!ipted for forest growth. The relative value of keeping these slopes tilled, in sod and rn forest is fairly well shown by Professor Shaler. who says: "As soon as the tilled soil is moistened, each raindrop acts to break up the clods, bringing the n.aterial into the condition of mud. in which it is readily borne away by the rills, which, if the shower be heavy, quickly form in such numbers as to interlace the surface. In a few moments these little streams, at first obscure, gather into distinct rills, which, with quickly-swinging curves, carve out a model of a new drainage system. In the course of an hour a very rapid downfall on a bare, plowed field, with a declivity of not more than five feet in a hundred or less than the average slope of land, may have an average of one-third of an inch of its surface soil removed to the channels of a stream which drains it." "A brief comparison of the effects of a heavy rainfall on a newly - tilled surface, bare of vegetation, and on a like area which is protected by the natural covering of living and dead plants will show the peculiar influence of the vegetable shield on the history of soils. On wood and grass lands the rainfall has practically no erosive effect whatever. In the forest the matter of decayed vegetation is in most cases able to take in three or four inches of water, which it yields ud so slowly as to distribute the flow over weeks and in such a manner that it removes not a liit of soil." Th°re is. however, a great distinction in sod and forest land, since a well-matted sod land has a large run-off, while the proper forest cover has a minimum run-off. This rapid run-off and lack of erosion on sod land is due to the surface mat of roots charac - teristic of the grasses, and while grasses may prevent erosion, the sodding of slopes may augment floods. </seg>
            <seg id="p362">359 Russia have made provision for forestry work on the banks of streams which flow through regions quite similar to our own, and it is a well-known fact that there is no soil binder which compares in efficiency with forest growth. This type of land is capable of producing high-class forest growth and may be capable of yielding a considerable supply of timber if great care will be taken in selecting only mature timber. Since the amount of tree growth depends vory largely on the amount of soil moisture, it becomes readily apparent that these areas would support some of the best stands of timber that could be found in the state. In conclusion, then, it may be stated that no phase of water-shed protection demands more serious consideration than does forest growth. If our forests are rightly managed, there is no doubt that they will still serve a very high protective function and may even supply a considerable amount of wood. Destroy our protection forests ami the entire gain from harvesting all of the timber on any great water-shed may be entirely offset by the damages of a single flood, while each recurring flood is bound to grow proportionately more serious. The most progressive of European nations maintain the strictest vigilance over their pro'ective forests: and what Germany, France, Austria and Switzerland can do, with good results, certainly can be done in this countrv, with equally good or even better results. Our protection should not only concern the mountain stales but also those which adjoin them on all sides, and since the increased future development of almost the entire Rcky mountain region depends upon water and E&gt;er. the question is one vital to our best welfare. We should stand ngly for forest protection and forestation in the mountains and for extension of forest areas in Nebraska.

University of Nebraska. Mr. Chairman, Laiuks ami Gkntijimkn: I will briefly describe the meanders as they occur along the Nebraska border. Dr. Condra gave you a picture of geographic conditions in the basin and Professor Cald - well has reviewed the history of the early utilization of the river. My remarks are to be illustrated with about twenty lantern slides The "treacherous Missouri" is an expression common to people in the Missouri valley. The expression was originally applied by the steam - boat pilots in the days when river transportation was a prominent industry. It was prompted by the fact that the channel in most of its course is in a bed of fine sand and therefore suffers frequent change of exact location. Recently a new meaning has been given, bearing more upon the relation existing letween the river and its flood plain. The ■is paper is a part of Mr. Bengtson's second degree thesis, which spared under the direction of Dr. G. E. Condra and presented Department of Geography, the University of Nebraska, May 15. </seg>

While it is true that it has a shifting channe.1, and some - times forms cut-offs, these are merely minor incidents in its work. The "cut-banks" are the results of meanders, whose laws of progress have long ago been slated and discussed at length by Professors Davis, Rus - ■nd others Hut inasmuch as the rate at which meanders progress varies with different streams and with different parts of the same stream, attempts to forecast the course of the Missouri have frequently proven disastrous. The Missouri river is corrarJing its banks to a greater or less degree along nearly its entire course bordering Nebraska. Commercially speak - ing, the cutting is generally slow and takes place only during the flood seasons. At periods of low water the banks are protected by the talus formed of surface material, which slides down by wind and water action. This material is generally fine silt, which in water becomes very com - pact and hence protects the coarser and more sandy layers at the water's edge. The bank of the stream opposite the cut-bank is almost invariably aggrading, forming a sand bar, or shingle bank. We should therefore not forget that the work of the stream is of two kinds, erosion and deposition, both about equal. The Missouri river above Yankton, South Dakota, has a comparatively narrow filler, its Hold plain being generally less than a mile wide. The course of the stream is characterized by long swings, striking the hanks along either side alternately at distances of about four to eight miles. In that part of the couise the meander limit has not been reached, and hence the progress of the meander3 is affected by the escarpments bordering the flood-plain. Where this is the case the chan - nel of the stream does not shift abruptly, as the records show but little change in the course of thirty years. At the South Dakota-Nebraska line only a slight change has taken place since 1881, the date of the first accurate data available. At but one place above the mouth of the Niol rara river has the channel changed its position in the flood plain more than forty rods within the time stated. At Niobrara the valley widens. From there to Yankton its width is from two to three miles, and with the wider lloodplain channel migration becomes more marked. On the Nebraska side of the front of the first meander below Niobrara (|i of Hood plain three miles long and averaging one-eighth mile in has teen cut away since 1882. The land has not been flooded i this time and is generally about six to eight feeet above flood i. This I-ank. which is opposite Springfield, South Dakota, and just if Santee Agency. Knox county. Nebraska, is the first important cut - along the Missouri river in Nebraska. The cutting there cannot e very rapid in the near future because of the influence of the ion of the bluffs. Where the river leaves the Nebraska escarpment winsis toward Springfield, South Dakota, the direction of the bluffs from north 2.V east to north 37° east. The bend thus formed serves as a spur which deflects the stream and will prevent in large part very rapid cutting of the floodplain we6t of Santee Agency. The South Dakota floodplain south of Bon Homme and the first two Ne - braska floodplains east of Santee Agency are not as favorably situated. The directions of the bluffs are such that rather violent cutting will continue on the upstream sides of the floodplain and the rapid addition of accretion land on the downstream sides The first Nebraska flood - plain east of Santee Agency has had about 800 acres cut away from Its </seg>
            <seg id="p364">THE MISSOURI KIVKIl AND ITS TRIKITAKI KS 361 east side of the floodplain building is going on at nearly the same rate, but the accretion land has no commercial value for many years after its formation on account of the danger from floods. The accretion land is gradually built up, however, first by deposition of silt from Hood waters, later by deposits due to wind action. The willow growths which spring up about the third year after the formation of the accretion land bear a vital relation to wind deposits. The willows irrow very dense and hence when the win-d blows from sand bars or cultivated fields over the willow thickets its velocity is checked and much of its suspended dust and sand is deposited. Thus in the course of a com - paratively short time floodplain deposits may be elevated above the alti - tude of the flood stage of the river. When that point is reached other trees prosper, such as the elm. cottonwood, and some oaks. This stage of heavy timber may Le noted as the third stage in development of accretion lands for industrial uses. The forest stage is generally followed by man's activities. The forests are removed and the land reclaimed for agricultural purposes. The floodplain north of Herriek, Knox county, Nebraska, has also suffered considerable cutting since 1881. But cutting is not now very rapid because the stream strikes the bluff above Herriek almost at right angles and hence is deflected lack at an angle almost equally sharp. Cutting under these conlitions will pro - ceed in proportion to the normal progress of the meander. Tha 1 progress, judged by human standards, is necessarily slow and in consequence does not threaten seriously the land values. Just east of Yankton the valley widens abruptly, from there to Sioux City averaging from ten to seventeen miles. The river between these cities nowhere touches the South Dakota escarpment while it strikes the Nebraska bluffs seven times. The course in this wide flood - plain is characterized by more abrupt curve* and these generally swing against the comparatively loose materials of the flooilplain. At S City the river males a &gt;0* turn in its course, coming in from and its course below the city is due south. That these eondlttOM, floodplain and abrupt change in the direction of the river, have a direct relation to development of meanders cannot be doubted. Above Yankton the meanders are nearly symmetrical. The downstream portion of the loop is about equal and similar to the upper. I'.elow Yankton the upstream part of the meander is generally Barb longer and mar - smaller angle with the mean stream direction than the lower part. is clearly shown by every meander between Yankton an-1 Sioux I Below Yankton the river first strikes the Nebraska bluff near St. Helena. The mean direction of the stream is east 28° south, distance twelve miles.

About six hundi have been cut away from the South Dakota floodplain and very nearly the s'.rae area added to the Nebraska side sin-e 1892.

Eie same type of change has occurred tietow St. Helena at Vermillion , Ionia, Ponosi landing and near the month of Aowa Creek. At illion Ferry tlie stream has shifted its postion one and one-fourth miles, and at Ionia about one mile since 1882. At Ponca Landing and Aowa Creek the changes have not been quite as marked, but the differ - ence is of degree not of type. The strikingly rapid work has all been on the front of the short, sharp curves of the meanders while on the longer stretches the erosion has at no place exceeded one-eighth as much, and in many places no important changes have occurred. It seems true that the direction of the stream and the wide floodplain cause the meanders to have a long upstream course of gentle curve and a short downstream course at a sharp angle to the mean direction of the stream. In the long sweep of the meander cutting is slow for a greater distance: in hort swing the cutting is intense for a short distance. The total results measured in acreage eroded or areas aggraded are probably nearly equal. The cutting on the front of the sharp curve bears the more vital relation to man because of its relative rapidity and the short span of human life. The direction of the bluff in relation to the floodplain and the angle at which the stream strikes the bluffs are also factors whose importance should be emphasized. These relations are deserving of very careful study, and should immediately be made the basis of exten - h on the part of the state and federal governments. The control exercised by the direction of the bluffs in relation to the stream course is well illustrated in many places, and especially so at Blackbird Hill. Decatur. Florence, Bellevue. Plattsmouth. Nebraska City and Peru. Space forbids detailed discussion of conditions at each of these pla'-es but the last two named stand as typical examples. The direction of the bluffs north of Nebraska City has an influence over the direction of the stream that bears a vital industrial relation. In the lower part of Copland's Bend the direction of the bluff changes from east 2S" south to east 40" south, then its direction changes so that in the north part of Nebraska City the direction is smith 20" east. The am follows the concave face of the bluff and hence at its turn tWted toward the Iowa flnodplain. striking it about one-half mile north of the Burlington railroad bridge. This causes a cut bank against the floodplain and a tendency to build a bar next the Nebraska side. If not checked this would mean a shifting of the channel to the eastward with its attendant sequels. A sandbar would be built under the bridge, the railroad grade to the eastward would he cut away and the bridge would be left a useless structure, spanning only an area of accretion land. To overcome this tendency the Burlington railroad company is compelled to protect the floodplqin above the bridge from being cut. Hence ex - tensive riprap work has been resorted to. but the force of the stream is such that this work must be kept up continually at great expense. Con - stant vigilancp is necessary for breaks in the riprap must be attended to promptly. The cause of this condition is not the erratic Missouri, but rather an expression of the influence of bluff direction upon the con - sequent course of the stream. The work of the Burlington in its efforts to save its bridge also protects a large portion of the floodplain from encroachment by the river. Enditions north of Peru. Nebraska, furnish an interesting example ■ same kind of control of river changes. (See Fig. 3.)

While this condition lasted the high floodplain was not being cut very rapidly because the Kffs, situated as they were, served as a protective barrier. In this ilion normal deflection would tend to throw the stream just south tl.inc island. The cutting on the floodplain was done by only a ion of the stream. With the downstream progress of the meander it inevitable that very rapid cutting would ensue. Before 1890 the branch of the channel between Hog-Thief Island and McKissock Island was abandoned and a fusion of islands had occurred. The geological significance of these movements is of interest.

The farmers there cannot sell their products in their own state, their industrial relations are with Missouri and Iowa, but they help determine the political affairs of Nebraska. In the election of 1907 the island vote determined the political complexion of two of Nemaha's county officials. In 1890 the course of the upper meander had become more pronounced. The stream cut the bank almost at right angles at Minersville, was deflected and gave rise to a cut bank north of Line Island with sand bars on both sides of the channel below that point. The Barney station had been moved almost three-fourths of a mile farther south. About 500 acres of land had been cut away just north of Barney To the east where the main force of the current struck fully 8»o acres were removed. But at this time landowners near Barney felt but little apprehension for they considered the bar a protection to them and took it as proof that the channel would migrate toward the Missouri side. This bar was being cut slowly on the north side, and it was but a question of time until the meander should progress beyond it and the stream exert its full force on the floodplain unless held in check by artificial means. Since 1890 the changes have been marked. (See Fig. r&gt;. I The meander has progressed beyond the south spur of the bluffs and since then the cutting has been rapid. In July, 1907, Barney station was moved to a point nearly half a mile southwest of its former location. The railroad had to fin-d a new right of way. Notwithstanding all these marked changes note a conformity to the same general features shown previously. The floodplain was for a long time partially protected by a spur in the bluff, and while the meander was thus checked cutting was not rapid. When the barrier was passed abnormal cutting l&gt;egan. North of Peru the plain has not been flooded since 1882, lacking 3 or 4 feet. Structural conditions of the floodplain favor erosion. At low water the plain is about sixteen to twenty feet above the river surface. The lower twelve feet is loosely cemented sand interstratifled in places with thin lay - ers of fine silt or clay. The upper three to six feet are composed of much finer materials, mostly silt mixed with organic matter which becomes very compact and is sometimes known as "gumbo." This is a con-dition very common In the Missouri river floodplain and causes erosion to be done very largely by undermining which leads to the falling in of strips of land from two to twenty feet wide and sometimes several rods long. The cutting varies with the local conditions at each place and with the stage of the river. Cutting occurs at but relatively few places at low water stages and always slowly, while just the opposite is true of the high water stages. The cutting on the Peru floodplain was unus - ually great during the summer of 1907 partially at least because the last of the sand bar noted on the map for 1890 was cut away early in July. This bar had served to divide the current, hence only a part of the force of the stream was exerted against the higher terrace. The bar also increased friction and thus reduced the cutting power. The losses due to cutting in 1907 as measured in acres were severe. The owners named suffered as follows: Mr. Wells, 60 acres; Mr. Rawson, 40 acres; Mr. Cook, 12 acres; Mr. Brunsdon, 40 acres; Mr. Adams, 36 acres: Mr. Wheeler. 23 acres; or a total loss from June 1, 1907, to May 8, 1908, of 211 acres. In productiveness this land ranks with the best that can be found anywhere. If it were not menaced by the river it would easily have a market value of $100 per acre. Thus computed the loss in the single season was $21,100.

The cost of su-h a wall should not have been prohibitive because the necessary limestone and sandstone are exposed in the bluff and but a very short haul would have been necessary. Two hundred thousand dollars' worth of land has been destroyed. In the face of such figures we can readily see that even if the retaining wall would have cost $20,000 it would have been a profitable investment. These projects are too extensive for individuals to contend with. The government spends its millions in reclaiming arid lands and we laud its generosity in a worthy cause. Is it then asking too much for the government to protect from destruction the lands which are of the best that can be found anywhere? </seg>
