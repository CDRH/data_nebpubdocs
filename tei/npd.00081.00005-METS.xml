            <seg id="p004">LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL To His Excellency, R. L. Cochran, Governor of Nebraska : I have the honor to submit herewith the official report of the Department of Labor, for the years 1935 and 1936. Respectfully yours, V. B. KINNEY, Commissioner of Labor. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">t Lincoln, Nebraska, „. „ „ December 1, 1936. His Excellency vernor R. L. Co :hran, Capitol Building, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Governor: I have the hoi or to submit, herewith, the records of the Department ■&gt;{ Labor provided by law for the years 1935 and 1936. For the first five months of 1935 the Department of Labor was charged with the administration of the workmen's compensation law. Upon the enac tment of the law providing for the compensation court, :he two activities were separated and practically all records and sta - :istical data m the department related to compensation matters and went to the compensation court. The Department of Labor, for the first time m twenty years, was then able to function m its proper field. During all the years when the Labor Department and Workmen's Compensation weie consolidated, appropriations were never adequate to hiore than provide for administering the vitally necessary compensation law. The 1935 legislature, not only passed the compensation court law, but also made modest appropriations for both the court and the Labor Department. With its appropriation the Labor Department has been able to keep four safety inspe :tors on the payroll, giving fairly adequate coverage to factory and construction inspection m addition to investigating and caring for the complaints regarding violations of the female labor law and the child labor law. Inspection of Industrial Plants The Labor Department has been able to make complete inspections on all industrial plants m Omaha and Lincoln, and has completed a re - inspection m Omaha. Industrial plants m all towns of any size m the state have also been inspected. Reinspection m Lincoln and other cities are now m progress. Accident reports coming to the compensation court are gone over daily m the Labo- Department, and where indications point to unneces - sary hazards special inspections are made at once. A number of larger concerns m the state had been ignoring the requirements to make reports of all accidents, but through cooperation between the Labor Department and the Compensation Court they are making these reports now. During the last few years when little, building was under way some contractors had become lax m complying with requirements of the Nebraska Safety Code. Nebraska has one of the best Safety Codes m the country. Particularly does this refer to construction industry. The 5 </seg>
            <seg id="p006">Nebraska scaffolding law, which was passed through the strenuous efforts of Building Trades Unions, is considered to be most satisfactory, from a safety standpoint. Since there has been a revival of construction m the State, the Labor Department is paying particular attention to the construction safety laws. Hazardous conditions had existed at sand and gravel pits through the state, and a number of accidents had occurred. During the past summer, every gravel pit between Plattsmouth and Bridgeport was inspected and hazards have been remedied. Wage Collection There is no provision m the Nebraska law for the Department of Labor to collect wages for employes. However, when complaints are made by wage earners the Department has frequently succeeded m making settlement for these people. The Labor Department has been contacted by many relief recipients and WPA workers who were m ignorance of the proper persons to ap - proach m the various Federal agencies. The Department has made special efforts to serve these unfortunate persons and has generally been able to put them m contact with the agency which should serve them. In September, 1935, a meeting was held m the Labor Department with safety engineers of the insurance companies, safety representatives of the large corporations and safety inspectors of Omaha and Lincoln city governments, together with the Labor Commissioner and the in - spectors of the Department. As a result of this conference a working understanding was effected among the various elements interested m industrial accident prevention. This understanding has greatly facili - tated the work of the Department's inspectors, and we are told that the insurance companies' engineers have profited from this also. Conferences with insurance company engineers have been held at intervals since. With the advent of cold weather much time is occupied by the Labor Department m inspections of service garages, where there is always a disposition to shut out the cold air and leave the workers subject to the effects of carbon monoxide from running motors. Dangers to Eyesight The Department has authority under the law to tag a piece of machinery that is dangerous unless the hazard is removed. However, during the two years compliance with safety recommendations was secured m every case except one without recourse to the use of the "red tag." Invariably our inspectors found managers and superintendents eager to cooperate. Greatest difficulty has been found with workers who will remove guards from machines and refuse to use goggles m 6 </seg>
            <seg id="p007">operations dangerous to eyesight. One source of eye injury often over - looked is m welding operations. Not only is it necessary for the operator to have his eyes guarded, but where the machine is unguarded persons m the vicinity are m danger from the intense light produced. One matter where the absence of a law has created an annoying situation is m the matter of steam boilers and pressure tanks. The Nebraska law provides that boilers and tanks must be inspected "at least every 12 months by a steam boiler insurance company, or by an equally efficient and duly authorized boiler inspection department." Insurance co npanies will inspect only the boilers on which they carry the risk. Tle Nebraska legislature has not passed a law creating a boiler inspsction iepartment. The Labor Department, therefore, is un - able to properly function m this matter. One matter which has given the Department considerable concern is inspection worl: and state labor. law enforcement where our inspectors come m contact with Federal agencies. At present state and city in - spectors are powerless to enforce any law where Federal agencies func - tion. This condition will pi-obably be remedied soon, as a bill prepared by the Texas Labor Department is pending m Congress, This measure would give state and city inspectors authority to enforce local safety and sanitary laws on Federal premises. From along the Missouri river, where the War Department is m charge, we had a number of complaints, and our inspectors at times had to act as peacemakers. In one instance where the use of contaminated drinking water was causing a dangerous situation the Department in - spectors took hold, brought samples of the water to the State laboratory, had them analyzed, and found serious contamination. The state chemist prepared a formula for purification of the water and we insisted on its use to purify th« water, with excellent results. Ventilation m Theatre Booths The Labor Department m 1935 was confronted by a serious problem, the existence of which everybody connected therewith seems to have been ignorant. About the first of September complaints were made to the Department regarding conditions m several theatre booths. Investi - gation showed poor ventilation and unsanitary conditions m these booths. Inquiry of the operators working there indicated that some of them were suffering from some unexplained ailment. About the same time an operator, who had been m poor health for some time, changed physicians and consulted a physician familiar with the effects of toxic gases, who, upon investigation, was convinced that the cause of this man's ailment was from gases generated from the carbon light used m the booths. This physician collaborated with the Labor Department m some blood tests and other investigations regarding this situation, which, together with reports from workmen m booths, convinced us that a condition existed which must be remedied. Carbons used m these lights were secured by 7 </seg>
            <seg id="p008">the Labor Department and at our request the State Health Laboratory ran some testa, the result of which is explained m the following report made to. the Department: "Following information from you of a number of cases of chronic illness occurring among motion picture operators employing the carbon arc light for illumination purposes, some of these cases having been tentatively diagnosed as carbon monoxide poisoning, and at your sug - gestion that the Laboratory aid m attempting to determine the nature of poisonous fumes emanating from the carbon arc light, some experi - ments were undertaken which will be discussed m the paragraphs to follow. i "An apparatus was arranged to collect the -fumes from above the carbon arc and cause them to pass through an enclosed glass chamber at a regular uniform rate. Guinea, pigs exposed to such fumes m this chamber showed restlessness and irritation beginning a few minutes after exposure had started and progressing with increased intensity, the animals staggering around until at the end of forty-five minutes to one hour the animals so treated were unable to stand any longer. They were then removed from the chamber and a rapid recovery of the animals to apparently normal state followed. "An adsorption train designed to adsorb nitric oxide but to permit the passage of carbon monoxide was introduced between the carbon arc and the glass chamber. Tests for nitrites showed that this adsorp - tion train did not remove all of the nitric oxide gases, but indicated that the amount of such gases reaching the chamber were considerably reduced. Guinea pigs exposed to the fumes m this chamber following such absorption showed no signs of irritation or toxicity at the end of 1% and 3 hours' exposure, respectively. "Spectroscopic examination of the bloods taken from these two series of experiments were made immediately following the experiment. The spectroscopic appearance of the blood from the animal exposed to the unaltered fumes showed an abnormal spectrum identical with normal blood. No spectroscopic evidence of carbon monoxide poisoning could be found m the blood of the animal so exposed. "The fact that nitrogen oxides are produced by the arc and that these oxides are toxic is not new knowledge. However, these brief experiments illustrate the importance of adequate ventilation to prevent exposure of workers to the fumes from the arc. The experiments con - ducted showed definite evidence of considerable toxicity resulting from the nitric oxides, but showed no evidence of other poisonous substances m the fumes from the carbon arc light." Between September and the end of the year 1935, practically every theatre booth m the state was inspected and wherever improper con - ditions prevailed recommendations were made to eliminate the trouble. A simple, cheap, home-made forced ventilating system was devised and drawings made. Blue prints were furnished to all theatres where there was improper ventilation. j 8 </seg>
            <seg id="p009">I &lt;ack of Statistical Information I ■ - Frequently the Labor Department receives requests for information regarding industrial and employment statistics in Nebraska. This is one of the few states where the Labor Department does not gather such information. In most of the states the laws require that all business concerns furnish monthly reports to the State Labor office, from which records of industrial and employment conditions are kept up to date. Some time ago the Labor Department sponsored an application for a WPA project which would, at no cost to the State, have furnished the basis for a set-i;p which could have been carried on and kept up per - manently without extra expense. Unfortunately the project was turned down at Washington, though endorsed by the Nebraska WPA. Full enforce ment of the Nebraska statute governing private em - ployment agencies is difficult because these agencies are taking advan - tage of a Unit* d States Supreme Court decision invalidating a New Jersey law. Th s law fixed the maximum fee which an agency could charge an applicant for a job. The court by a divided vote declared the law violated the right of private contract and was unconstitutional. The Nebraska law his a similar provision to the invalidated New Jersey law. There are 16 private employment agencies operating in Nebraska — 12 in Omaha. The Labor Commissioner was called upon several times to act as impartial chairn an at conferences of employer and employe representa - tives. One impc rtant meeting of this nature was when representatives of industry , ins nance companies and labor met and came to a com - promise agreement which resulted in passage of the compensation court bill. Another i nportant meeting of employers, labor and public rep - resentatives prepared an unemployment compensation bill which was presented to the Special Session of the legislature. Disagreement in the legislature as t&lt; the number of employes to be covered resulted in the defeat of this treasure. However, the fact that groups of citizens with widely divergen ; viewpoints could sit in council and ultimately agree on such measures £ s the Compensation Court Law and proposed unemploy - ment compensation bill augurs well for future tranquillity in Nebraska industry. 9 </seg>
            <seg id="p010">Nebraska Employment Service Failure to properly handle the problem of employment has long vexed social-minded persons. In an effort to solve this question, in 1933 Congress enacted a law commonly called the Wagner-Peyser Act, which, as its title explains, is "to provide for the establishment of a national employment system and for cooperation with the States in the promotion of such system, and for other purposes." The act sets forth that "it shall be the province and duty of the bureau to promote and develop a national system of employment offices for men, women, and juniors who are legally qualified to engage in . gainful occupations, to maintain a veterans' service to be devoted to securing employment for veterans, to maintain a farm placement service, . . . . to assist in establishing and maintaining systems of public employment offices in the several states and the political subdivisions thereof in which there shall be located a veterans' employment service. The bureau shall also assist in coordinating the public employment offices throughout the country and in increasing their usefulness by developing and prescribing minimum standards of efficiency, assisting them in meet - ing problems peculiar to their localities, promoting uniformity in their administrative and statistical procedure, furnishing and publishing in - formation as to opportunities for employment and other information of value in the operation of the system, and maintaining a system for clear - ing labor between the several States." The Act appropriated "$1,500,000 for the year 1934, and $4,000,000 a year for succeeding years up to and including 1938, and thereafter such sums as Congress may deem necessary." During the 1935 session of the Nebraska legislature, due to insist - ence from Washington authorities and a strong demand from various sources in Nebraska, a law was passed creating the Nebraska State Employment Service. This law provides that the service be established in compliance with the Wagner-Peyser Act, arid that it be affiliated with the United States Employment Service. It further provides that "The good faith of the state is hereby pledged to make available for the several purposes of said act, funds sufficient at least to equal the sums alloted from' time to time to this state from the appropriations made by - said act and to meet all conditions necessary to 'entitle the State of Nebraska to the benefits of said act." At the time of the passage of the Nebraska law there was available at Washington $67,380 for use of the Nebraska Service, with the pro - vision that only as much of the federal money would be available as was matched by the State. The legislature saw fit to appropriate $33,690 for the Service, for the biennium ending June 30, 1937. After making a survey and consulting with the United States Em - ployment Service authorities, it was deemed inexpedient to try to inaugu - rate the Service immediately following passage of the law, as the amount 10 </seg>
            <seg id="p011">available was considered inadequate to take over the activities of the National Re-employment Service at that time. Later on, wlien the time to be covered by the biennial period had been reduced, it was necessary to comply with the mandate of the legis - lature. Accordingly a plan providing for the merit system in appointing employes and budget was prepared and received the necessary approval of the United States Employment Service. Examinations for appoint - ments were cone ucted by the United States Employment Service last April. All appointments to the Nebraska State Employment Service were made strictly in accordance with the merit system from the eligible lists prepared by the United States Employment Service. No person may be removed except for proper causes, and any discharged person has the right of appeal. The Nebraska Service began operation on August 10, with a budget covering the money available for the balance of the biennial period end - ing June 30, 1937. It was not considered possible to cover the entire state with an ade - quate service even for the remaining period of the biennium prior to July 1, 1937. Therefore, it was arranged with the United States Employ - ment Service that the Nebraska Employment Service would take over the eastern third of the State, which contains two-thirds of the population and a greater proportion of industrial activity. The National Re - employment Service still operates in the western two-thirds of the State. The State Service consists of three districts with district offices at Lincoln, Omaha and Norfolk, and branch offices at Beatrice and Fremont. The Norfolk District serves the counties of Antelope, Boone, Burt, Cedar, Colfax, Cumingi Dakota, Dixon, Knox, Madison, Nance, Pierce, Flatte, Stanton, Thurstbn and Wayne. Omaha District serves the counties of Douglas, Sarpy and Washington. Lincoln District serves the counties of Butler, Cass, Fillmore, Jefferson, Johnson, Lancaster, Nemaha, Otoe, Pawnee, Polk, Richardson, Saline, Saunders, Seward, Thayer and York. Although the State Service has been in operation only a short time, there is a noticeable increase in the number of placements being made' in private -industry. These private placements are expected to rapidly increase. In addition to handling placements in private industry, the Nebraska Service has to care for the WPA and other federal placements in its territory. In compliance with the State law, the Nebraska State Employment Service is under supervision of the Labor Commissioner. The following is a report of the active file of the Nebraska State Employment Service and National Re-employment Service for Nov. 30th. It gives a fair picture of the number of persons seeking employment in Nebraska counties: 11 </seg>

            <seg id="p014">Age and Schooling Certificates Section 48-303, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, provides that no child under 14 shall be employed during the hours when public schools are in session. Section 48-302 provides that no child between the ages of 14 and 16 shall be employed without the consent of the school district in which he resides, and such school district is required to make certification of such employment and the hours which the child shall work. A copy of such certification shall be placed on file with the Department of Labor. Attached hereto is a tabulation of the age and schooling certificates which are on file in the Department of Labor for the years 1934 and 1935. For 10 months of the year 1936 there has been filed with the De - partment of Labor 210 certificates. Of this amount 74 of them are for girls, of which 71 are from the City of Omaha and 3 are from various cities out-state. The remaining number are for boys, which totals 196. Of this number 119 of these boys are employed in Omaha and 5 are employed in Lincoln. The type of employment that these children are engaged in is prac - tically the same as the tabulation shows for 1934 and 1935. Of this num - ber of employed children some of these certificates are renewals. This Department feels that with the cooperation of the various school districts in the State, the Child Labor Law of Nebraska is well enforced. There are no children engaged in hazardous occupations and none employed in so-called sweat shops. School Status is broken into the following classifications : In school includes all certificates issued to children whose past and continued attendance in school is certified and the period of which is not obviously limited to the summer vacation months. Vacation permits include all those issued exclusively for the period of the summer vacation months. Not in school includes all those whose attendance in school is not certified and makes no distinction as to the period covered by the certificates. Number of Certificates Issued — This obviously includes some re - newals otherwise noted elsewhere. Place of Employment — This is broken into the following classifica - tions, which in the absence of more specific information gives the best indication of the types of employment of the children certified. Parks or Clubs — In nearly every case those so employed are caddies. 14 </seg>
            <seg id="p015">At Horne — Presumably these cases are all employed at typical I home tasks, though there are few notations indicating this ex - plicitly. y Other Homes — Presumably these are employed m purely do - mestic service, this being indicated m some cases. Depa rtment Store — Place of employment is the chief indication of the type of work done m these cases. Other Shops — Included m this group are all retail sales and service establishments (as stores, theaters, restaurants, beauty parlors) not elsewhere classified. Place of employment is chief indication of type of work done. i Telegraph Company — Messenger service is frequently noted and probubly the sole type of work done. Public Agencies — In each case listed, the employment was m service connected with the schools. Industrial Plants — Besides manufacturing establishments, meat, poultry, and dairy products processors and the like are in - cluded. .
