         <seg id="p064">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT BEFORE THE NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION In the Matter of the Application of the ) Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad ) Company to discontinue its Agency at ) APPLICATION NO. 12912 the Station of Marion, Nebraska, and to ) Substitute a Custodian or Caretaker ) therefor. ) OPINION, FINDINGS AND ORDER BY THE COMMISSION: This matter came on for consideration of the Commission on the application of the Chicago, Burlington &lt;_ Quincy Railroad Company, a corporation, to discontinue its open agency station at Marion, Ne - braska, and to suhstitu'.e t'.xr for a custodian or caretaker. After due notices given all interne', parties, t'.e application was set for public hearing in the American Legion Eoom in tie Court House at McCook, Nebraska, on the 24th day of January, 1940, at 2 P. M., before Com - missioner Swanson. Two persons, reprecenied by counsel, appeared and testified in oj-.position to the granting of the application. This is the t'ird request of the applicant to substitute agency service at its Marion station. In Application No. 8447 the Commis - sion, after a hearing, entered an orcer on the 20th day of December, 1930, in which t'e r:qu st to substitute a custodian for an agent was denied, but applicant was granted permission to discontinue com - mercial telegrap'.'. service al t'-.at point, t was revealed at that hearing that the appro:;imate rev.mue lir. m all source; for the year 1929, which was the only year shown, was §28,681.06. I On May 7, 1935, the Commission entered its order, after hearing Application No. 11242 in which the request of applicant was again denied with the proviso, however, that applicant be permitted to renew its application on or after September 30, 1935, if station revenue did not increase. In an exhibit offered by applicant at that time the total station earnings for 1932 were shown as $21,116.62, 98% of which accrued from carload shipments. In 1933 the total revenue was $9,535.49, 98% of which accrued from carload business. In 1934 the total revenue credited to the station was $12,835.02, 97% of which accrued from carload shipments. On April 24th, 1938, applicant filed the instant application, No. 12912, and after studying the statistical facts presented, the Com - mission, on May 24th, 1938, granted applicant's request, subject to </seg>
         <seg id="p065">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION protest within 30 days thereafter. Protests were received and said order did not become effective and the application was not called up for hearing until January 24, 1940. Marion, Red Willow County, Nebraska, is an unincorporated village of approximately 150 people, located on the Orleans-St. Francis branch line of the applicant railroad connecting at Orleans with the St. Louis-Denver line of said railroad. It is located 4.4 miles east of Danbury and 11.7 miles east of Traer in the State of Kansas, both being open agency stations on the applicant's railroad. The territory surrounding Marion is wholly agricultural and the station is used prin - cipally for shipments of agricultural products, livestock and supplies. State Highway No. 89 serves Marion to Beaver City and other points to the east and is a graveled, all weather road. 5 miles to the west of Marion it connects with U. S. Highway No. 183, a hard surfaced road to McCook and in turn connects with U. S. Highway No. 6 to all points in the state. Present train service furnished is as follows: Mixed train service westbound, daily except Sunday, arriving at Marion at 11:02 A. M., and eastbound at 5:34 P. M. connecting at Oxford with main line trains. Local freight service operates westbound on Monday, Wed - nesdays and Fridays and eastbound on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sat - urdays, as extra trains, jnot on regular schedule. There is no con - templated change in the present train service. Free telephone service is offered to patrons of Marion to Danbury and Western Union mes - sages have been handled for years from the Danbury office. The exhibit offered by applicant shows the total revenue credited to the Marion! station for the year 1934 as $12,835.02 which includes carload shipments forwarded and received, L. C. L. shipments for - warded and received, ticket sales, cream revenue and express earnings; for the year 1935, the slim of $7,555.50; for 1936, the sum of $13, - -719.15; for 1937, the sum of $6,631.46; for 1938, the sum of $12, - -743.78; and for the first 11 months of 1939 the sum of $7,065.73. Carload business which represented,: according to the witness, 96% of all the business handled at the Marion station, consisted of 23 cars of grain, 3 cars of coal, 16 cars of cattle, 1 carload of hogs, and 6 miscellaneous cars, a total of 48 cars for 1937. During 1938 there were 66 cars of grain, 1 car of coal, 5 cars of cattle, 1 carload of hogs and 1 miscellaneous car, a total of 74 cars. In 1939 there were 40 cars of grain, 1 car of coal, (there was some conflicting testi - mony that there were 2 cars of coal received during 1939), 4 cars of cattle, 1 carload of hogs and 3 carloads of sheep, a total of 49 cars. 19 of the 40- carloads of grain moving in 1939 were shipments of wheat received from an elevator at Bird City, Kansas, for storage purposes, both elevators being operated under the same management. </seg>
         <seg id="p066">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT It was testified that the agent could perform all oi the necessary duties required of him in 15 minutes each day if it could be so adjusted that he could perform them all at one time. It was also testified that the applicant credits both forwarding and receiving stations with the full amount of the revenue, and, therefore, the figures shown should be discounted approximately 50% as moved entirely over ap - plicant's lines. The witness further testified that Marion is being served by common and private carriers of motor vehicles and most freight formerly moving by rail now moves by truck except carload shipments. Passenger traffic produces but little revenue due to auto - mobiles and the improved highway system. Decrease in revenue was also admitted to be partially due to the present drouth conditions in the territory. The approximate annual cost of maintaining the agent, including payroll taxes, is $1615. If a custodian is substituted he would be paid approximately $380. per year, including payroll taxes, which would effect an annual saving to the applicant of approximately $1,235. The two protesting witnesses testified concerning the prevailing drouth and general business conditions. One is engaged in the coal and lumber business and is also a cattle feeder and shipper. He now has 129 head of cattle on feed which will move during this year. The other witness manages the elevator and testified that there are ap - proximately 10 car/oads of grain in storage which will move by rail during this year. To substitute a custodian for the agent at Marion would result in some inconvenience to the protesting witnesses. Apparently they either shipped or received all of the carload shipments shown on the exhibit. Other than during the month of July, when most of the wheat moves out of the elevator, the only demand for an agent would be for the several livestock and coal shipments. We do not believe that the public, at the present time, demands the services of a full time agent at Marion as reflected in the revenue figures submitted. Numerous stations of similar size in Nebraska are now being operated by custodians and with few exceptions the Commission does not hear of any complaints on service furnished to patrons of the various rail - roads. Under the circumstances, the Commission is of the opinion that the present revenue received at Marion and the general conditions under which the carrier is now operating requires the applicant, in the honest, efficient and economical management of its railroad to substitute a caretaker or custodian for its agent at Marion. However, if and when general business conditions reach a standard of normalcy, this Commission will gladly entertain a petition asking for reinstate - ment of the agent. </seg>

COMMISSIONERS CONCURRING: (Signed) Will M. Maupin (Signed) Duane T. Swanson COMMISSIONER DISSENTING: Z (Signed) F. A. Good GOOD, COMM., DISSENTING: As indicated in the majority opinion, this is the third hearing I excerpt from Chairman Randall's opinion, findings and order—Ap - plication 8447, Dec. 20, 1930, commenting on gross revenue of Marion station: "These figures show that the business done by the company at the town of Marion is of considerable volume, much more' so than is usually the case in a town of that size."**** "The volume of busi - ness at that station, outside of the revenue for telegrams, in the judg - ment of the Commission is sufficient to require the company to furnish an agent to transact the business for the patrons of that station *** Therefore, custodial service at Marion should be denied *** The com - pany should be permitted to discontinue telegraph service if they so desire." ¦ Order denying application followed in accord with findings, and telegraph service at Marion was discontinued and agency continued. I also excerpt from Commissioner Maupin's opinion, findings and order—Application No. 11242, May 7, 1935: "The Commission dis - misses the effort of the applicant company to show that truck com - petition had any. considerable part in the reduction of revenues at Marion station. Truck competition at that point is to little to take </seg>
         <seg id="p068">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT into account. The whole story lies, in the fact that for the three years last past there has been little production, either of grains or livestock, in a section that normally produces all of these in surplus, necessitating transportation by rail haul. That these conditions will not always prevail, is admitted. That they are about to disappear is highly probable. With a return to normalcy, business at Marion will again approach the high average of earlier years." "Taking all these things into consideration, and pointing out that an average of receipts of more than a thousand dollars a month over a period of more than three years of business depression and a series of crop failures never before approached, is a pretty fair index of the Marion community and its future possibilities. This Commission is of the opinion that the applicant company is not at this time war - ranted in making the change applied for; that it should in this par - ticular instance, go along with this loyal community for such a length of time as to allow for a revival of business." Commission's order follows in conformity with its opinion and findings. I hereby affirm that all the above quotations from previous opin - ions, findings and orders are in accord with my individual view of the instant matter, except that from the revenue receipts of any 3, 5 or 10 year periods that there is little or any warrant for granting this application. I herewith append a record of gross revenues allocated to the station of Marion for the full 10 years, 1929 to 1938, inclusive, to - gether with the computation of an average for that period. These figures are from testimony of company witnesses except for the years 1930 and 1931, they being set up from records on file in the archives of this Commission.

NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Testimony to the effect that an agent might perform all neces - sary work in 15 minutes of each day, I hold to be absurdly put. Per - haps a tower man or a crossing guard or train dispatcher—perhaps even a vice president might have a somewhat identical challenge, if put on an actual time at work basis. Ha caretaker were appointed it is assumed he would attend to station necessities a matter of hours. It is a matter of judicial knowledge that there is a statutory requirement in North Dakota from which I quote: "No. 4656. When stations and Station Agents to be Maintained. Every railroad in the State of North Dakota shall build a station house and keep a station agent twelve months each year when so ordered by the Railroad Commissioners at all its sidings where there is grain and merchandise of any description to be shipped,,'when the outgoing and incoming freight, and all other receipts at said station amounts to six thousand dollars or more on an average of! the three last pre - ceding years. Provided that said stations are not less distant, than five miles apart upon the same line of railway." | '¦-.- ¦'. 7 ."'.¦ " "\ - ¦'-.- I-. :¦¦ * ' "Provided, further, that in event the gross revenues do not amount to six thousand dollars or more annually, based on the average of such revenues for the preceding three, year period, the Board of Rail - road Commissioners shall exercise its discretion, after giving proper consideration to public need, convenience and safety, in determining whether or not the permission sought by the railroad shall be granted." It is also a matter of judicial knowledge, based upon research, that seldom has any state commission closed a station where gross receipts for the last full five years have been $10,000. or more, on an average yearly basis. For the past full i five years the station of Marion has contributed a gross average revenue of $10,697. and for the past 10 years an average, gross revenue of $19,093. as elsewhere evidenced. ...'.••. ;:". A large area dedicated to agricultural crops, and suffering from a cycle of a dearth of rainfall, does not lend color to a continued program of despair. If oil wells, once producers, fail, if coal or lead or silver is exhausted from mines, there is no replenishment possible —they are, "gone with the wind". Not so with agriculture; the soil, by virtue of its seasons of rest, has its vitality rejuvenated and it - ability to produce, so full of capacity as ever before. It appears to be a matter of common knowledge that the rails are now operating with very large tonnage and passenger increase and the Burlington lines are sharing this notable increase of business.

Your petitioner further calls attention to the fact that the route of the Missouri Pacific from Louisville and Oreapolis or Plattsmouth to southeastern Nebraska is the short route, and it has always been the custom of your applicant to equalize this competitive situation by publication of the Nebraska interstate scale (or specific rates as the case may be) for application via an interstate route operating through Pacific Junction and Payne, lowa. Further, the applicable law concerning multiple carload ship - ments is in the formative stage on interstate traffic, and if your peti - tioners sought the usual recourse in attempting to meet this competi - tion to southeastern Nebraska a crucial situation would arise, which we feel at this time is uncalled for. Therefore, we present this ap - plication seeking authority to effect our remedy for this competition by the use of specific point to point rates which are constructed by the application of the short line mileage to the present scale of rates for application on intrastate traffic. Your Commissioner is further petitioned with a view of relieving the applicant from the necessity of observing the provisions of the Long and Short Haul clause so as to make it unnecessary to needlessly reduce rates to a large amount of intermediate territory." '&#132;.-¦, Upon consideration of the facts, the Commission finds this supple - mental application on behalf of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company is justified and should be approved. The Com - mission further finds the rates herein authorized should become ef - fective on one day's notice so as to permit the applicant to meet the similar rates of the Missouri Pacific from Louisville and Oreapolis, or Plattsmouth to the same points because of inability to obtain such relief over their regular short line interstate route operating through Pacific Junction and Payne, lowa to the same destinations, which constitutes an emergency justifying such publication. </seg>
         <seg id="p074">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT The Commission further finds the applicant should be given re - lief from the provisions of the Nebraska Long and Short Haul Statute so as to make unnecessary needless reductions of rates to a large amount of intermediate territory over the intrastate route over the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company between the origin ant) destination points herein named.

When the application to establish Western Trunk Line Tariff No. 25 on Nebraska intrastate traffic was filed the applicants prom - ised that if any of the cancelled items were later found to be neces - sary for Nebraska intrastate traffic because of shippers objections that the applicants would promptly reinstate the previously existing items and would then be in a position to file petitions for public hear - ing on such matters following such reinstatement if the railroads thought same desirable. When the matter of one-half of fourth class rating on empty cement and flour bags was called to the attention of the Nebraska Railroads following complaint of the Ash Grove Lime &amp; Portland Cement Company of Kansas City, Missouri, the instant application was promptly filed by the Nebraska Railroads. Upon consideration of the facts, the Commission finds the pro - posed restoration of one-half of fourth class ratings on empty cement or flour bags in Western Trunk Line Tariff No. 25 and the proper amendment of Western Trunk Line Tariff No. 262-D to make same effective on Nebraska intrastate traffic, is justified and should be approved.

Almost every, town on the I line between Beatrice and Holdrege, numbering twenty, was repre- 1; sented by groups, some 20 to 35 each from several towns. 1 A rail gas-electric motor serves the towns with passenger, mail, i cream and express accommodations and over a route of approximately 1 151 miles in length. g Statement of counsel for the railroad was to the effect that this I service was losing the company approximately $500. per month and ft that from motives of economy, supplemented by an alleged non-use B of said service, their petition to the Railway Commission was that ffi they be authorized to discontinue said trains. 11 Counsel for the interested individual merchants and chambers M of commerce responded, that certain obligations of the rails, supple- If mented by public convenience and necessity, nullified the specific; If item of present loss and that shippers and patrons were now setting M up a "back to the rails movement" in their respective communities. 1 This line of rails is crossed by other Burlington lines at Tobias, 1 Strang, Blue Hill and Wilcox; and contacts other Burlington lines at 1 DeWitt and Edgar. Foreign lines cross said road at Shickley, Edgar I and Lawrence. £ • ii REVENUES AND EXPENSES: §| Exhibits No. 7, No. 8 and No. 9 were received as part of the i record tendered by counsel for the Burlington and comprehend rev- M enue and expense records for the years 1937, 1938 and first 9 months M of 1939, both as to the trains 97 and 98 and also as to general rev- m enue and expense for total operation of the line in the instant matter. |§ </seg>
         <seg id="p081">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION ....... *. I ¦ Exhibit "A" is a list of 1807 petitioners, persons living in towns or territory tributary to said line of railroad. Exhibit "B" sets forth total revenues, freight and passengers allocated to this line. ; The grand total of revenue as allocated to this branch line for the period 1928 to 1937, inclusive, (10 years), is $4,747,287.38 gross revenue or an average gross revenue of $488,427. per year. However, said sum takes no cognizance of revenues accruing by virtue of tele - graph, express, mail, Tents or any revenue whatsoever from the term - inal cities of Beatrice or Holdrege. The Commission recognizes that a certain large element of rev - enue becomes intangible for reasons herein set up, but by and large it would appear that when consideration is given to revenues for a period of 10 or more years, also to the unnatural drought conditions for the past 6 years, this branch line is not in a discouraging position as compared with branch lines in general. The exhibits of the Burlington includes only a two and three - fourths year period against which Exhibit 10 may be considered as under normal in the traversed territory of this line. In the year 1933 and. succeeding years crops have been "short", "very short", "bad" or "very poor"' as described by numerous witnesses. It is a matter of common knowledge that on or before the date of this hearing snows began falling and have since continued to fall generously over Ne - braska and melted into the ear^h, thus producing a new atmosphere of optimism by the whole population as relates to the 1940 crop. It is a matter of grave importance as to whether a just and reasonable decision by this Commission could be reached by having 2 years and 9 months revenue as a basis. Perhaps a jten year period, or mayhap all revenues since the Commission has filed reports avail - able, i.e., since 1907 would be more fairly representative of actual or potential revenues from all sources accruing to this line. The Commission takes judicial notice that station reports of revenues, compiled by the Burlington officials, are on file in the Com - mission's archives up to and including July 1, 1938, (at said date and upon request of all railroads the company was relieved from furnish - ing said station reports). Upon request a compilation of all revenue receipts was made including all stations between Holdrege and Beat - rice, but including neither Holdrege or Beatrice. A summary of the last 10 years (see Exhibit "B"), indicates that from the enumerated 20 towns intermediate a gross revenue of $4, 747,287.38 was received by the Burlington to which should be added the amount received for carrying the U. S. mail or $137,140. being computed at $13,714. per year, making a total of $(4,884,427. Hence, for this 10 year average, </seg>
         <seg id="p082">T.HIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT 1 we have gross annual revenue established for this line, of $488,427. 1 Against this we have an average operating expense, including taxes I and rents, of $152,105., (Exhibit 8). It is notable that this same 1 exhibit shows that for the period 1937-1938 and 9 months of 1939 1 that the average per mile revenues increased from $.4953 to $.5270 | and for the same period expenses and taxes decreased from $1.1046 1 to $1.0488. .Hence, the alleged net loss was reduced in this period I from $.6093 per train mile all service to $.5218. It is a matter of i common knowledge that the discontinuance of this motor service would &amp; in no way reduce the tax expense of the system or maintenance of i same and further that notwithstanding existing and continuing drought 1 conditions, revenues have increased and expenses reduced. Exhibit 1 No. Bof the company appears to allocate revenues and expenses on a I basis of miles moved over this branch line crediting nothing to its contribution to main line tonnage. In this way if a car of wheat originated at, say, Wilcox and was billed to Omaha or Chicago, Wilcox would be credited with 8 miles only, notwithstanding that the car moved 200 or 700 miles on the same system. It is obvious that no branch line would find itself in a position to show profit under such a system of accounting. S Likewise if a car of lumber originated in the far west, Wilcox | on this branch line would be credited only 8 miles out of a possible total haul of approximately 1800 miles from the Pacific Northwest. OPERATING RATIO: In response to questions by Attorney Anderson, Mr. Lavidge tes - tified, Tr. p. 69-70, that the total operating ratio of the State of | Nebraska for the Burlington lines was, for 1938, 71.27, whereas for 1938 the said operating ratio for the whole Burlington system was 72.08, which would indicate that Nebraska was maintaining a high | average as compared with the system as a whole. QUOTED TESTIMONY: | From testimony adduced from business men at nearly all towns 1 enroute it appears that said towns have, during the past lean years, | held their own as to population; that the number of business houses 1 has not decreased and that the service accorded to their several com- I munities is now as full and complete as it ever has been heretofore. 1 The following are excerpts from the testimony of Mr. Miller of Tobias,, g and Mr. Hart, mayor of Edgar, and of several other witnesses at i sundry points on the line of railroad. I Transcript, p. 147, Mr. Miller of Tobias: | Q. About how does your number of businesses compare now with i what you had 7 or 8 years ago? E </seg>
         <seg id="p083">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION A. I think they are about the same. Q. Practically everybody has stayed on? A. Yes, sir. Q. Have those business houses suffered any decrease of business? A. The merchants, always claim they aren't making any more money than the farmers. Q. Has your income decreased? ; A. Decidedly. j Transcript, p. 183, Mr. Hart, Mayor of Edgar; Q. Now generally and to what extent have you made an attempt to contact the people of your community? ¦ A. I have been a booster for the railroad for several years,— they helped the country grow in the first place and while we are in a state of drought, such as we have never seen before, I don't think they should run out on us. Transcript, p. 197, witness continues: Q. You hold that the service of the other business people;of Edgar is comparable with, what it was in the days, say prior to 8 years ." : . ago? A. I would say that the same quality of service is offered now that was 8 years ago. I don't know of any line of business that has been discontinued. !¦' I further quote from testimony of Mr. Gilsdorf, of Lawrence, manager of the local telephone company of the community: i Q. What effect, if any, has it (drought conditions) had on the num - ber of your subscribers? A. Well, it has just about cvt them in two. Q. Are you extending the same i service to your people in the com - munity that you have for the past 15 or 20 years? ¦ ;* " A. More, if anything. . . |Z i I further quote testimony of i_r. Sukovaty near Swanton, Tr. p. 270:. .'. .':...":': ;•- . .'.' j Q. During that period of 9or 10 1922 to 1932, what were the crop conditions, were they good? j </seg>
         <seg id="p084">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT A. Yes, we had fairly good crops—the last big corn crop I raised was in 1932 or 1933. Q. Do you recall how much of a crop that was? A. Yes, I had approximately 207 acres of corn and I think it averaged 48 to 50 bushels to the'acre. Since that time we haven't raised much. We like this snow. Down in Saline County the wheat is growing and this snow will make a pretty good crop, I know. Mr. E. L. Bunger, postmaster at Upland, testified there would be a mileage increase if Highway No. 4 be used as a star route mail service amounting between Edgar and Holdrege to 76 extra miles of travel. To this must be added other mileage incident to off-route travel of several more miles. In other words, the star route, if established must negotiate some 80 miles off federal and state high - ways moving in and out to contact these towns. Testimony adduced relating to actual condition of highways, es - sentially used by carriers of mail via star route, to most of the towns off the direct route from Beatrice to Holdrege: said testimony would indicate that the physical condition of said by-roads from Highway No. 4 is, and has been, very poor and from time to time all but im - passable, said condition being the result of snows and soft roads in wet weather such as exist at the time of issuance of this opinion, find - ings and order. Because a United States District Court has completely expressed itself in an analogous case, and with a competency and weight not possessed by this Commissioner, I herewith append said court finding as my own reaction and applicable to the instant case. Re: discontinuance of passenger service on a branch railroad line, I cite an excerpt from the opinion of the United States District Court, D. Montana (No. 3010) (28 F Supp. 812). "Great loss is claimed by the plaintiff in maintaining a service the public does not use, resulting in an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce. Some of the witnesses for defendants assert that this loss is considerably exaggerated. No doubt the state can require the carriers to furnish reason - able and adequate facilities to serve not only the local neces - sities but the local convenience. ? * * Taking into account the population of the towns and adjacent communities and the pursuits of the residents thereof, and the amount of travel and volume of business generally, is the court prepared to say that there would be adequate service if these trains were removed? Is not the service now in use not only con- </seg>
         <seg id="p085">r^. z i. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION venient but necessary, and froiri fair consideration of the testimony does it not appear quite conclusively that the public, or that part of the public interested in the territory involved, is urgently demanding the continuance of these trains? * * * .'-...¦ The application for injunctive relief as prayed for in plaintiff's complaint in respect to the trains Nos. 239 and 240, and 41 and 42 (now 42 arid 43) will be denied. ¦:¦...'.; All concur." Text writers in view of the ho] lings of the courts, have said: 22 R.C.L. 908. "It U very generally agreed that in the absence of legis - lative, authority a railroad company cannot arbitrarily aban - don its road or a branch thereof after construction, but that it can do so only on the score of imperious necessity. Having . entered upon the exercise of its charter franchises, the rail - road company owes a duty to the public which it may not at its caprice abandon, and in equity and good conscience, the obligation is still greater where the company has been the recipient of land grants and subsidies to aid in the con - struction of its road." In L. R. A. 1915 A 549 it is said: "The general rule seems to be that a railroad cannot abandon its road or a branch, even though it may be.oper - ated at a loss, and eases which are apparently in conflict with this rule will be found to have turned on special cir - cumstances that warranted the decision." In C. &amp; 0. R. R.; Co. v. P. S. Comm. of W. Va., 242 U. S. 603, it appeared that the railroad had for a great many years operated a branch line only for freight In a proceeding by the state to compel the railroad to operate two passenger trains daily each way the Su - preme Court of the United States said: "One of the duties of a railroad company doing business as a common carrier is that of providing reasonably adequate facilities for serving the public. This duty arises out of the acceptance and enjoyment of the powers and privileges grant - ed by the State and endures so long as they aTe retained. It represents a part of what the company undertakes to do in return for them, arid its performance cannot be avoided merely because it will jbe attended by some pecuniary loss." </seg>
         <seg id="p086">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT FUTURE PROSPECTS It is a matter of judicial notice that in station closing cases at - torneys for the rails have pressed witnesses to testify that not only have crops been poor or bad for several years last past, but led wit - nesses to express opinions that the 1940 prospects were also poor or bad. Judicial notice is taken that we have now had an era of snow fall averaging one foot or moTe, and the same interrogation directed to a witness now would elicit a very reverse answer than might or was given at said hearing. Effective January 1, 1940, this Commission on petition of the rails issued an order requiring the said rail companies to pay a cash amount of 5 cents for delivery of each and every can of cream from any cream station to the rail station for transportation. It'was as - sumed this would effect a notable increase in this business and on this line, provided the motor car service was retained to render said service. It appears (Tr. p. 134) that town councils along this line are con - sidering the levying of an occupation tax on trucks serving their respective towns. A co-ordinated effort is now well under way set - ting up such a tax to the end that the rails may retrieve a share of the business now lost to private carriers by truck. SUMMARY It is evident that the people now living on this rail line, feel very concerned as to this move to take the motor service car from them. In addition to the several hundred attending the hearing in - cident to the matter, a many paged petition containing 1807 names remonstrating against this train discontinuance was tendered and placed in the Commission files. Mentioned, and testified to, are sundry items of present opti - mistic concern among which I call attention to the following: Ist. Soil condition as to moisture greatly improved over that of any recent year, as of date of issuance of this order. 2nd. Disposition Of approximately all communities to give great - er share of transportation to the rails. 3rd. Helpful action of this Commission to allow a 5c pick-up of cream. The rails could not qualify to transport this rather large traffic by mixed train service. It is wholly lost to them if train is discontinued. 4th. General pick-up of rail business reflecting notable increases of revenue of all class one railroads. The Burlington is a class one road. </seg>

Inasmuch as it appears from the record and also highway 5 maps, in event that the transportation of mail via a star route might |, be substituted for that of the tails, then a mileage of approximately 1/ fifty per cent increase would be set up —most of which would be over | vtvierioT toads, thus materially slowing down mail service to the serious I inconvenience of the public. The fact that no bus transportation | route is operating on highway No. 4is doubtless due to the fact that | so many towns are at varying, distances off route, and adds to the 1 difficulties to which the communities would be subjected if said trains | No. 97 and 98 be discontinued. Also we point to the fact that the f. rails would lose the substantial sum of $17,250. per year; this being I the amount of revenue accruing to them for carrying the U. S. Mail | between Beatrice and .Holdrege. I It appears to be an historical fact that most passenger train I service throughout the years has been continued at a revenue loss, I so, essentially their operation has leaned upon surplus freight rev- I enues for sustenance. Passenger service has potential advertising lure I not evidenced in freight transportation. Luxurious stream-lined I trains are generally recognized as show windows from the advertising I standpoint of railroads. In the instant case the transportation of |j passengers is of minor value to the public; mail, express, cream, live S chicks and perishable commodities generally indicate the more essen - a tial service to the rail communities in the instant matter. I '¦¦''¦ I. CONCLUSION 1 -i. '".¦¦¦¦¦ I It is my conclusion that from the evidence heard and by virtue !of a careful examination of the transcript, that the facts adduced do not warrant the abandonment of trains No. 97 and 98. That the assumed obligation of the company is not nullified because of drought 1 conditions. That the service of said motor trains and their revenues f, will respond advantageously, to both the rails and the communities I served with,'the advent of a normal crop recurrence. That this opti - f mistic news item here quoted strengthens confidence that the past era | of drought conditions may be at or near an end.

         <seg id="p090">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT OPINION, FINDING AND ORDER FWANSON, COMMISSIONER: This is an application of the Union Pacific Railroad Company, a Corporation, requesting authority to discontinue agency service arid to close its station at Holmesville, Nebraska. Notice was given to all interested parties and the matter came on for public hearing in the depot at Holmesville on the 25th day of January, 1940. Applicant was represented by counsel, and approximately thirty citizens of Holmesville and vicinity appeared in opposition to the granting of the application. This is the second request of the applicant to close said station. A-11861 after public hearing and a full consideration of the facts was denied on July 14, 1936. The evidence disclosed that Holmesville, Gage County, Nebraska, is an unincorporated village of approximately 149 people, located on the Valley-Marysville Branch of the applicant's railroad approximately S.B miles south of Beatrice and 4.7 miles north of Blue Springs, both being open agency stations. The territory immediately adjacent and tributary to Holmesville is wholly agricultural and the station is used principally for the shipment of livestock, agricultural products, lumber and coal. Very little L.C.L. freight is received or forwarded at that point. Highway facilities serving Holmesville are not the best at the present time, it being located on a county-maintained road approxi- \ mately 5 miles north of Blue Springs and approximately 9 miles south - easterly from Beatrice. At Beatrice said road intersects Nebraska state road No. 4 which is a gravel all weather road extending in an &gt;' easterly and westerly direction across the state. At Blue Springs I the county road intersects U. S. Highway 77, which is a paved high- ; way running north and south making connections with a network of ' improved highways to all points of the state. -.-' At the present time and for many years last past an agent-oper - ator has been maintained at that point. The present train service ; consists of a daily motor southbound through Holmesville at 10:15 '; A.M. and northbound through Holmesville at 9:23 P.M. A daily freight train southbound through Holmesville at approximately 1:50 P.M. and northbound at approximately 5:15 P.M. Carload shipments of live- i stock are usually handled by manifest trains during the evening. No change in existing train'service is proposed by the applicant. The revenue statement offered by applicant shows the actual amount credited to that station from all sources as follows: 50 per cent of all carload business received or forwarded at Holmesville which terminates or originates on the Union Pacific Railroad Company; 100 </seg>
         <seg id="p091">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION per cent of the actual line haul revenue accruing to the Union Pacific on L.C.L. and C.L. shipments originating at Holmesville and destined to points on foreign railroads and on those originating on foreign roads and delivered at Holmesville; 100 per cent of all L.C.L. ship - ments, ticket sales, milk and cream, express and Western Union rev - enue received or forwarded from the station. On that basis the total revenue credited to the station for the year 1937 from all sources was $2,575.00; for 1938 the sum of $2,498.00 and for 1939 the sum of $2,585.00. The cost of maintaining the station for the year 1939 was $1,462.00, consisting of wages in the amount of $1,325.00; fuel $25.00; telephone $27.00; stationery $20.00; miscellaneous supplies $5.00; maintainance of building $60.00. Applicant proposes to discontinue the agency service and close the depot and to handle that stations business from either Blue Springs or Beatrice. The waiting room of the depot would remain unlocked and shippers would leave their L.C.L. and cream shipments there until arrival of the train and the train crews would pick it up. Billing would be handled from one of-the open stations above mentioned. The telephone would remain available in the waiting room for patrons if it could be arranged with the telephone company. Inbound shipments would be left in the waiting room by trie train crew and picked up by the consignee. Witnesses appearing in opposition to the application testified that the decrease in business at their station was the result of a general decrease in business conditions caused by the drought which has ex - tended over the state for several years last past. That very little corn has been raised! in the vicinity and that as a consequence the number of livestock in the community has diminished. However, one witness testified that last Fall he again started buying cattle and hogs for carload movement to market and also for feeding purposes and pros - pects looked brighter; that the'local stockyards were repaired and put into condition and that he had shipped 11 cars of hogs between No - vember Ist and January Ist. Prospects for a crop after several years of failure looked better than in any time since 1934. ' Other witnesses i were concerned about the lack of any representation whatsoever by i the railroad company at that point, especially for the handling of L.C.L. shipments, express, ticket sales, baggage, cream shipments, | Western Union messages and the billing of carload shipments of wheat and livestock. It was also mentioned that their town was not favored with usual good Nebraska highway system and that it was difficult to secure adequate motor transportation in the community. While the amount of L.C.L. business has been considered as a /convenient means of measuring the necessity of maintaining an agent </seg>
         <seg id="p092">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT 1 a: a railroad station, it is not the only factor to be considered. Neither _ do we believe that revenue alone is the controlling factor. Every case | of this character must be decided in the light of its own facts and we 1 do not know of any hard and fast rule that may be applied to deciding I this and numerous similar applications. In determining the question many factors should be considered, such as the volume of business done at the station, proximity to other stations, accessibility thereof, high - way conditions, location of grain and livestock markets, cost of main - taining the agency, financial loss, if any, to the railroad company, due regard for the public welfare in furnishing reasonably adequate ser - vice to the community, cost of operating and maintaining the service, probability of future development, adequate alternative transportation facilities, etc. The revenue statement does not show a very large margin, how - ever we believe that so long as the applicant is not losing money on this station the shippers in the community should be entitled to every favorable consideration. After a full consideration of the record in this case, the Commis - sion is of the opinion that the application should be denied. The en - couragement inspired by normal spring rains, increase of hogs and cattle in the vicinity, together with better crop prospects and business conditions generally will in turn increase the revenue at Holmesville to sufficiently warrant the continued service of an agent.

Nebraska be, and the same is hereby denied. MADE AND ENTERED at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 11th day of May, 1940. _ I NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION I (SEAL) (Signed) WILL M.

         <seg id="p093">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Recognizing that but three years of revenue has been given con - sideration, although the Commission had in its files a complete record since 1907, I dissent from my colleagues. It appears that the gross receipts at Holmesville averaged for the three years given weight, in the opinion, finding and order—from which I dissent—averaged the yearly gross revenue of $5,106.00. That for the prior 21 years (Com - mission's Record) the average gross revenue was $9,123.00. From these figures I deduce that the jamount of expense of agency, i.e., $1,462.00 per year, was for the past three years 29 per cent of the gross revenue. That basing a like estimate on the previous average for 21 years, then the cost of agency expense would be 16 per cent of gross station revenue. - ... I ¦¦;. : '; -.- ..-..' ¦'.-'.•'. Although it might be recognized that 29 per cent of gross revenue might be condoned for a brief period of three years of very severe adverse conditions, yet in the instant case the prior 21 years reflected a per cent for agency maintenance of 16 per cent which I held to be an unreasonable confiscatory and unwarranted percentage of gross reyenue to be so diverted over a long period as instanced and a relief should have been granted by this Commission, hence I dissent.

Due notice was given to </seg>
         <seg id="p094">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT all concerned of the time and place of said hearing and the matter was heard and submitted on the record. Applicant was represented by counsel and approximately 20 shippers and residents of Atlanta ap - peared in opposition to the application and were likewise represented by counsel. A representative of the Order of Railroad Telegraphers was also present but did not testify. _ The evidence disclosed that Atlanta, Phelps County, Nebraska, is an incorporated village of approximately 207 people, located on appli - cant's Chicago-Denver main line, approximately 7.5 miles west of Holdrege and 15.2 miles north and east of Oxford. Hascot is 8.5 miles. south and west of Atlanta, and has been a custodial station since 1926. The territory immediately adjacent and tributary to Atlanta is wholly agricultural and said station is used principally for the shipment of coal, lumber, grain, and agricultural supplies. The village is served by U. S. Highway No. 6-34, a hard-surfaced road, extending in an easterly and westerly direction across the state. At the present time, and for many years last past, an agent - operator has been maintained at said station daily, except Sunday, between the hours of 8:00 A.M. and 5:00 P.M. Present train service consists of a daily except Sunday motor car eastbound through Atlanta at 1:10 P.M. and westbound at 3:35 P.M., and also a way-freight regularly scheduled through Atlanta daily except Sunday. Many main line trains traveling between Denver and Chicago pass through Atlanta but are not scheduled to stop. Exhibits offered by applicant show the total revenue accruing to the applicant railroad at the station, from all sources, including car - load and L.C.L. shipments received and forwarded, ticket sales, cream revenue, express earnings, baggage, and Western Union. The figures were compiled for the years 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939, and for the first 2 months of 1940 and show the following gross income: For the year 1936 the sum of $10,714.31; for 1937 the sum of $11,568.13; for 1938 the sum of $14,434.67; for the year 1939 the sum of $5,848.74, and for the first 2 months of 1940 the net sum credited to the station was $406.09. The greater portion of said revenue was derived from carload shipments as follows: For 1936 carload revenue was $6,971.10 on cars forwarded, and $2,725.04 on cars received. In 1937 carload revenue was $8,738.40 on cars forwarded, and $2,010.86 on cars received. In 1938, there were 37 cars of grain forwarded and 41 cars of road con - struction material and 9 cars of coal received. During 1939, there were 27 cars of grain forwarded, and 9 cars of coal and 3 miscellan - eous cars received. During the first 2 months of 1940, there were 4 cars of coal received. </seg>
         <seg id="p095">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION It was also testified to by applicant that the community was being amply furnished with transportation facilities by common and private carrier motor vehicles for both passengers and freight. Witnesses appearing in opposition to the application, testified that the decrease in business at their station was due to the general de - crease in business conditions caused by the drought which has extended over the state and particularly in that vicinity for several years last past; that very little corn has been raised there and, as a consequence, the number of livestock in the community has diminished. The County Assessor testified concerning the number of cattle and hogs in that trading territory from 1929-1939, inclusive, and observed that the herds were gradually increasing in number. Other witnesses testified that farming conditions were looking better and that with more mois - ture, corn and wheat would again be plentiful. Some were concerned about the lack of any representation whatsoever by the railroad com - pany at that point for the handling of regular station business. While the amount of L.C.L. business has been considered as a convenient means of measuring the necessity of maintaining an agent at a railroad station, it is not the only factor to be considered. Neither do we believe that revenue alone is a controlling factor. Every case of this character must be decided in the light of its own facts and we do not know of any hard and fast rule that may be applied. In deter-\ mining the question, many factors should be considered, such as vol - ume of business done at the station; proximity to other stations; ac - cessibility thereto; highway conditions; location of grain and livestock markets; cost of maintaining the agency; duties performed by the agent; amount of time necessary to perform those duties; financial loss, if any, to the railroad company; due regard for the public wel - fare in furnishing reasonably adequate service to the community; cost of operating arid maintaining the service; probability of future de - velopment; adequate alternative for transportation facilities, etc. The revenue statement does not show a very large margin for the year 1939. Years prior to. 1939 appear to have been very good rev - enue producers. Applicant did not show a net loss in operating the station and the Commission is of the opinion that the shippers in that community are entitled to every favorable consideration. After a full consideration of the record in this case, the Commis - sion is of the opinion that the facts and circumstances warrant the continued service of a full-time agent, and said application should be denied.' :¦'.'"": .'.

J.

         <seg id="p097">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION i¦¦ V '-'¦- .'.¦¦¦'.''•" ¦ '.;..' The proposed rate reductions are approximately 35 per cerit. Z The proposed revised commodity description provides a single rate basis for gasoline and the fuel oils, including kerosene, distillate and "burning oil" among others. Present rates on fuel oil are gener - ally eighty (80) per cent of the rates on gasoline. Present tariffs provide an estimated weight of 6.6 pounds per gallon for gasoline and 7.4 pounds per gallon for fuel oil. This difference in weights has long been a subject of controversy among shippers and carriers, many ship - pers contending that the bulk of the kerosene, distillate and burning oil transported will actually weigh the same as gasoline per gallon. Applicants propose to publish the amended commodity description and reduced rates on petroleum products to alternate with the present rates retaining for the shipper the benefit of any lower rates or charges now in effect. It is a well known fact that shippers of petroleum products at Omaha and Superior are in competition with numerous refiners and shippers of the same commodity located at Oklahoma, Kansas, Mis - souri and Wyoming refining points and at pipe line termini such as Council Bluffs, Sioux City and East Omaha in lowa. The failure to reduce the state rates on petroleum products from Superior and Omaha simultaneously with the reduction from interstate points into Nebraska would apparently handicap Nebraska shippers and may dis - criminate against them in favor of their interstate competitors. By petition dated April.l 2, 1940, the United Transporters of Petroleum Products, Inc., and its members individually, requested the Nebraska State Railway Commission to disapprove the commodity description and reduced rates on petroleum products covered by this application, as set forth in Exhibit A, attached hereto. In addition to various other alleged grounds for such disapproval of the tariffs and setting the issues down for hearing, our attention was called to the fact that a petition for suspension of the reduced interstate rates had been filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, which, if grant - ed, would require similar action as to state rates if relationships were to be preserved. Upon consideration of the matters presented the Commission set the instant application for hearing at Lincoln, Ne - braska, in the Commission hearing room, at 10:00 A.M., May 20, 1940. By verified supplemental petition dated April 26, 1940 all Ne - braska railroads, recited the refusal of the Interstate Commerce Com - mission to suspend reduced interstate rates and revised commodity descriptions of petroleum products, that such interstate rate revisions became effective April 25th and 26th, 1940, that Nebraska shippers and respondents are suffering serious.rate disadvantages because of the higher intrastate rates now in effect between Nebraska points and </seg>
         <seg id="p098">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL' REPORT Superior and Omaha. They allege that an emergency exists requiring the establishment of similar reduced intrastate rates forthwith to avoid substantial loss of business and revenue to Nebraska shippers and the people of Nebraska. The disparity between the state and interstate rates is very great as shown by the comparison of reduced interstate rates from Council Bluffs and existing rates from Omaha to the same points as shown below: Reduced Rate from Present Rate Council Bluffs, lowa from Omaha in TO in cents per cwt. cents per cwt. Lincoln 7 12 Grand Island 14 . 20 Hastings 15% 21 Kearney 19 23 Beatrice 10% 16 Applicants were accorded an informal hearing as to their supple - mental application and the opposing counsel for the United Petroleum Transporters Association, Inc., was heard in opposition thereto. While it is impossible for us to reach a final conclusion on the complex issues presented by the applications herein and the opposing petition on behalf of petroleum transporters and the hearing now scheduled is necessary to fully consider the facts involved, we are con - vinced that the shippers and consumers of Nebraska ought not to be required to suffer any unnecessary losses or prejudice while this con - troversy between carriers is being threshed out. The provisions of the Emergency Law, Chapter 75-602, plainly apply to such situations and justify our approval of the reduced rates on petroleum products, in carloads, from Omaha and Superior to points in Nebraska and the revised commodity description, as set forth in Exhibit A hereof; until the further order of the Commission. We find that such emergency approval of this application until the further order of the Commission is justified, to prevent rate wars and to prevent injury to Nebraska shippers and that the reduced rates and the revised commodity de - scription set forth in Exhibit A should be effective April 30, 1940. •ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that all Nebraska railroads, viz: Chicago &amp; North West - ern Ry.

         <seg id="p100">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT Although the Commission found an emergency justifying prompt ac - tion to safeguard the interests of Nebraska shippers by making the new rates effective April 30th the form of our order herein was de - signed to make it possible to quickly amend or cancel the new rates if the evidence offered at the hearings on May 20th justified any such action. At the hearing had, as scheduled, applicants submitted evidence showing the existence of severe truck competition by both private, contract and common carrier truck operators which has taken from the railroads more than half of the total tonnage of petroleum prod - ucts transported. In an effort to recover some of this traffic appli - cants decided to reduce both state and interstate carload rates, from pipe line or barge termini in Nebraska and lowa to points in Nebraska and from Mid-Continent Refineries in Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana to Nebraska and other adjoining states, approxi - mately 33 1/3 per cent- Exhibits were offered showing the approxi - mate equality of the reduced state rates and the reduced interstate rates for similar hauls and, that the reduced rates yield car mile earnings ranging from 42.6 to 132 cents and ton-mile earnings of from 15 to 50 mills. Applicants witness testified that rates yielding such car-mile and ton-mile revenues are compensatory. We share this opinion. Protestants offered no testimony. At the conclusion of the hearing protestants withdrew their form - al complaint which was incorporated in their petition of protest but they did not withdraw their protest. On the record, after giving careful consideration to the papers filed by all parties, the testimony received and arguments made, we find that the reduced rates on carloads of petroleum products estab - lished in conformity with our order of April 29, 1940, herein, have been justified and should continue in effect, in conformity with that order, until the further order of the Commission.

Hall, Creston, Nebraska, on June 14, 1940, Commissioner Maupin presiding. The instant application seeks authority to discontinue agent-operator ser - vice at said Creston station, and substitute therefor the services of a custodian. Z '.'.if- Creston is an incorporated village of approximately 275 people, located on the Scribner-Oakdale branch,of applicant's railroad, 7 miles west of Leigh and 8 miles east of Humphrey, both open stations on said branch-line railroad. Creston is located on Highway No. 91, a graveled highway, affording highway facilities to Fremont, Omaha, Norfolk, Sioux City, Lincoln, Grand Island and Columbus. The pres - ent train service consists of bi-weekly mixed freight and passenger trains, westbound Tuesdays and Fridays, and eastbound, Wednesdays and Saturdays. No change in train service is contemplated by this application. </seg>
         <seg id="p102">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT The custodial service proposed is similar to that provided for in similar cases. Inbound shipments, freight and express, will be pre - paid. Outbound shipments will be billed from the next open station in the direction the shipment proceeds. The custodian will handle no money, and passenger fares will be paid to conductor on train without penalty. It is provided that the custodian shall meet all trains, keep the depot open, lighted and warmed when necessary, receive and trans - mit telegrams by telephone, order cars, see that they are "spotted" and in good order, and accept bills of lading for transmission to the next open station. On request he shall ask information as to tariffs, routes and fares of the open stations next adjoining. At the present time no United States mail is handled on the Scribner-Oakdale branch, that service being rendered by Star Routes. Testimony shows that the annual out-of-pocket cost of maintain - ing agent-operator service at Creston approximates $1994.28 a year. This includes agent's salary of $141.44 per month, plus $10 per month for pumping water, plus living quarters, fuel and water, plus $12 per year for water station use and maintenance of depot and grounds approximating $50 per year. The purpose of the application is to effect needed economies in the operation of applicant's railroad. The saving sought to be made will be, if application is granted, approximately the salary of the agent - operator. It is proposed to install a caretaker whose whole remunera - tion will be living quarters in the depot, fuel, light and water. Njo pro - vision is made, or purposed to be made, for any monetary compensa - tion for the caretaker. The total gross receipts at said Creston station for 1937 were $9,891.95; for 1938, $11,449.77; for 1939, $5,321.57, and for the first three months of 1940, $1,879.25. The average annual receipts for the period 1917 to 1937, inclusive, interstate arid intra - state averaged $31,901.80. This Commission may not in good conscience base its decisions upon futures. It is concerned only with conditions now confronting the public and public utilities in general. In no other utility field has there been greater changes than in the field of transportation. Be - tween 1917 and 1937, statistics submitted in the instant case, this great change has taken place. In 1917 and for several years there - after, transportation was dependent wholly upon the rails, there being comparatively little road improvement and competition by motor truck was negligible. Then came the era of all-weather road building and the tremendous increase in truck transportation. These two combined to deprive the railroads in large measure of their once profitable </seg>
         <seg id="p103">NEBRASKA; STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION L.C.L. traffic, and curtailed to a considerable degree their carload traffic. Today the railroads are confined in largest measure to car - load traffic over long distances. There is no longer a possibility that the rails can recapture the short haul L.C.L. traffic at rates that will prove remunerative. In the language of a former president of the United States it is "A condition, not a theory", that confronts the railroads of the country. That they are warranted in seeking every means of reducing expenses, short of failure to render reasonably adequate service, cannot be questioned. It is this reasonably adequate service that interests this Commission. It is its bounden duty to see that all public utility organizations subject to its jurisdiction render reasonably adequate service. The instant case, like others of similar nature, must be considered only on its merits. The question at issue is whether the services of a custodian at Creston will be "reasonably adequate service". In an - other application by the instant applicants, witness Hoover, Superin - tendent of the Nebraska Division, testified that a custodian was sup - posed to be on duty about the same hours put in by an agent. He further testified that a custodian was usually given living quarters, fuel, light and water as compensation, and in a few instances an additional compensation of $5 a month. This Commission is of the opinion that reasonably adequate service cannot be rendered at a station by a caretaker or custodian who re - ceives only horise rent, fuel, light and water. He certainly must have some time in which to earn money enough to feed and clothe himself and family. Another Nebraska railroad provides similar living quar - ters and in addition pays a monthly salary of from $25 to $30 per month. This Commission has held in numerous like cases that upon this basis a custodian can, and does, render reasonably adequate ser - vice. ' ¦'!•'" In view of the testimony and the attendant facts this Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that the service proposed at Creston cannot be reasonably adequate in view of the receipts at said station, the volume of work required of the agent and the general existing conditions in said territory. ' Therefore, the application will be denied. An order in conformity with this finding will be issued. </seg>

This is an application of the Chicago, St Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha; Railway Company, requesting authority to discontinue agency service at Hubbard, Nebraska, and to substitute in lieu thereof the services of a custodian or caretaker. Notice was given to all inter - ested parties and the matter came on for public hearing in the Court House at Dakota City at 2:40 P. M. on the 14th day of August, 1940. A delegation of shippers and residents appeared and testified in op - position to the granting of the application. Representatives of the Order of Railroad Telegraphers were also present in opposition to the application. The evidence disclosed that Hubbard, Dakota County, Nebraska,' is an incorporated town of approximately 180 people, located 9.4 miles 1 south and west of Dakota City and 12.4 miles east and north of Emer - son, on applicant's railroad. Between Dakota City and Hubbard is the village of Coburn, which has had custodial service since 1930, and between Hubbard and Emerson is Nacora, which has had custodial service since 1931; Both Dakota City and Emerson are open-agency stations, the latter being open 24 hours a day. The territory adjacent and tributary to Hubbard is wholly agricultural and said station is used principally for the shipment of coal, lumber, and occasionally grain and livestock. It is served by State Highway No. 35, connecting to the east with U. S. No. 77-73. A county-maintained road connects to the north, a distance of approximately 5 miles, with U. S. No. 20, thus making available the network of state and federal highways to all parts of the state. It is situated approximately 16 miles from Sioux City, lowa, via highway, and 16.5 miles via rail. At the: present time, a full-time agent-operator is maintained at thej station daily, except Sunday, between the hours of 8:45 A. M. and 5:45 P. M. Train service consists of train No. 9 operating between Sioux City; and Omaha, southbound through Hubbard, flag stop, at 9:07 A. M., and in.the opposite direction through Hubbard at 10:16 </seg>
         <seg id="p106">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT P. M., both trains daily. Train No. 5, Sioux City to Norfolk, passes through Hubbard westbound at 12:17 A. M., flag stop, and train No. 4, in the opposite direction, through Hubbard at 6:32 A. M. way - freight No. 13 daily, except Saturday, passes through Hubbard at 10:36 P. M., and way-freight No. 14, in the opposite direction, daily, except Sunday, passes through Hubbard at 5:26 P. M. Also west - bound, time freight No. 19 daily, except Monday, passes through Hub - bard at 1:32 A. M., and No. 18 eastbound at 5:25 A. M. No. 17 west - bound time freight, Sunday only, passes through Hubbard at approxi - mately 7:10 P. M. No change in existing train service is proposed in this application. Exhibits offered in evidence show the total revenue accruing to the applicant at the station, from all sources, including carload and L.C.L. shipments received and forwarded, ticket sales, cream revenue, express earnings, baggage, storage, Western Union, leases, and mis - cellaneous income. The figures were compiled for a period covering the years 1937, 1938, 1939, and for the first six months of 1940. The exhibit credits the station with 50% of the revenue, obtained by ap - plicant on shipments moving wholly over its lines and 100% of the revenue accruing to the applicant on shipments originating or term - inating on foreign railroads. Under the above schedule, the exhibit shows the net revenue credited to the station as follows: For 1937, the sum of $4,232.00; for 1938, the sum of $4,312.00; for 1.939, the sum of $2,644.00, and for the first six months of 1940, the sum of $367.00. Approximately 95% of said revenue was derived from car - load shipments as follows: During 1937, there were 36 cars of sand and gravel, 1 automobile, 4 farm implements, 11 coal, 23 hay and straw, 16 cars of livestock, and 9 miscellaneous cars received, a total of 100 cars. There were 2 cars of grain, 12 cars of livestock, and 1 miscellaneous, or a total of 15 cars forwarded from the station. Dur - ing 1938, there were 4 cars of automobiles, 4 farm implements, 8 coal, 8 livestock, 3 lumber, and 3 miscellaneous, a total of 30 cars received, and 30 cars of grain and 4 cars of livestock forwarded. Dur - ing 1939, there were 2 cars of farm implements, 1 car of automobiles, 7 coal, 1 grain products, 6 livestock, 19 stone, and 6 miscellaneous cars received, and 10 cars of grain forwarded. During the first six months of 1940, there were 2 cars of coal, 1 carload of automobiles, 1 binder twine, 1 logs, and 2 lumber, a total of 7 cars received, and none forwarded. Revenue from Western Union was negligible through - out the period. The out-of-pocket cost of maintaining the open-agency station as shown in the exhibit, including wages, payroll taxes, fuel, telephone, and supplies, amounted to $1,869.00, for the year 1937; $1,855.00 for the year 1938; $1,805.00 for the year 1939; and $485.00 for the first </seg>
         <seg id="p107">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION three months of 1940. Agericy expense on applicant's entire system during 1939 amounted to approximately 8,49% of the gross revenue received. Witnesses appearing in opposition to the granting of the applica - tion testified that the small amount of revenue credited to the station was the result of the continued drought conditions and the shortage of livestock and grain in the territory. They were of the opinion, how - ever, that conditions would get better as time goes on; that.many bushels of corn are now under government seal on farms and in eleva - tors, and when released, will either be shipped or will be fed to live - stock and later shipped to market, thus again necessitating the use of applicant's railroad. The operator of the general merchandise store testified that approximately 25% of his L.C.L. freight was received by rail, and the balance was either brought in by himself by motor truck from Sioux City, or was delivered by common or private carrier motor vehicles. He also testified that practically all grain and live - stock in that vicinity moved to Sioux City. Some were concerned about the lack of any representation whatsoever, by the railroad com - pany at that point for the handling of regular station business. While the amount of L.C.L. business has been considered as a convenient! means of measuring the necessity of maintaining an agent at a railroad station, it is not the only factor to be considered. Neither do we believe that revenue alone is a controlling factor. Every case of this character must be decided in the light of its own facts and we do not know of any hard and fast rule that may be applied. In determining the question, many factors shoud be considered, such as Volume of'i business done at the station; proximity to other stations; accessibility thereto; highway conditions; location of grain and live - stock markets; cost of maintaining the agency; duties performed by the agent; amount of time necessary to perform those duties; financial loss, if ariy, to the railroad company; due regard for the public welfare in furnishing reasonably adequate service to the community; cost of operating and maintaining the service; probability of future develop - ment; adequate alternative for transportation facilities, etc. The revenue statement does not show a very large margin for the year 1939. Years prior to 1939 appear to have been very good rev - enue producers. Applicant did not show a net loss in operating the station and the Commission is of the opinion that the shippers in that community are entitled to every favorable consideration. After a full consideration of the record in this case, the Commis - sion is of the opinion that the facts and circumstances warrant the continued! service of a full-time agent, and said application should be denied.

Good (Signed) Duane T. Swanson BEFORE THE NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION The County of Buffalo, Nebraska, ) &#132; Complainant ) v. ) FORMAL COMPLAINT Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad ) NO. 830 Company, A Corporation, ) Defendant ) OPINION AND FINDINGS BY THE COMMISSION: Hearing on this application was held by Commissioner Maupin at Ravenna, Nebraska, on October 9th, 1939. The matter in hand pre - sents numerous complications. The complaint was brought under Sec - tions 75-517 to 75-520, inclusive, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929. Section 75-517 provides that whenever a railroad crosses or shall hereafter cross "a public highway at grade" outside of incorpor - ated cities and villages the railroad company and the county may agree upon such changes, alterations or construction as will promote </seg>
         <seg id="p109">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION the pubic convenience or safety. Both public convenience and public safety are closely iriter-woven in this matter. The law further pro - vides that in the event that the county board and railroad officials are unable to agree that the matter shall be submitted to the Railway Commission. This statute contemplates jurisdiction on the part of the Railway Commission only in the event that there is in existence a legally established highway crossing a railroad. The protestants in the instant case argue that the statute contemplates jurisdiction on the part of the Railway Commission only in the event that there is in existence a legally established highway crossing a railroad', further, that it was not the intention of the legislature to give the Railway Commission by this statute jurisdiction to determine in the first in - stance whether a highway should be open. and established across a railroad. Due research of the statutes and court decisions seems to be well founded. Such jurisdiction, that is the jurisdiction to open or establish a new highway either across a railroad or elsewhere outside of incorporated cities and villages has always been and still is ex - clusively a function and jurisdiction of the county board. This is recognized by the complainant in this case when the allegation is made that the county commissioners have established legally a highway at the point in question. Defendant in its answer challenges the allegation, particularly that there was a legally established highway and specifically alleges in paragraph V of the answer: "Defendant further alleges that no public road or high - way has been legally established or created at said point by ;..-.• the complainant or by any. other authority, and no easement, or right of way for said road across the defendant's property at said point has been acquired or purchased by the complain - ant. That said road is not a section line road but is located on the half section line of said section 8 and no petition signed by at least ten electors residing within five miles of said proposed road has been filed in the office of the County Clerk of Buffalo County as required by law. That no date has ever been fixed as required by law by the County Clerk of said County for the filing of objections to the establishment of said road and no notice has ever been served on this defend - ant or published as required by law of said date for the filing of said objections and no hearing has ever been held by the j Board of County Supervisors of Buffalo County for the pur- I pose of hearing objections to the establishment of said road and determining the feasibility and necessity therefor and the Board of' Supervisors of Buffalo County has never deter - mined in the manner provided by law that said 'road now sought to be established and described in the complaint is </seg>
         <seg id="p110">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT feasible or necessary. That defendant is the owner in fee simple and occupier of land—namely, its right of way lying in the proposed road at the point where said half section line of Section 8 intersects defendant's right of way and this de - fendant has had no opportunity to present objections or to have such objections head on the question of feasibility and necessity for the establishment of said road and this defend - ant has not consented in writing to the establishment of said road, and this defendant by reason of all the foregoing al - leges that the resolution of May 17th, 1939, of the Board of Supervisors of Buffalo County, set forth in paragraph 111 of the complaint, is null and void and of no effect and that said road is not and never has been legally established and that this Commission is without jurisdiction, power or authority under the statutes of the State of Nebraska to require this defendant to establish a crossing at said point over its right of way and track or to determine the amount of expense or cost thereof which either party shall be required to pay." Examination of Exhibit I, being a certified copy of the proceed - ings before the County Board for the establishment of said road, shows that no road has ever been legally or lawfully established across the defendant's right-of-way and that the resolution of May 17th, 1939, of the County Supervisors is an nullity. First, the petition for the establishment of said road is signed by but 7 petitioners. The Statute, Section 39-104, expressly requires that the petition be signed by 10 electors residing within 5 miles. Since the road in question is on a half-section line and is not a section line road, the board can only act on a legal petition signed by the required number of electors. Such petition has been held in many cases to be jurisdictional. See Leatherman vs. Hauser, 77 Neb. 731. In this case the court said in the syllabus: "The statutory provision that a petition for the estab - lishment or vacation of a public road shall be signed by at least 10 electors residing within 5 miles of the road is juris - dictional." It should be remembered that the road petitioned for and pur - ported to be established by the county commissioners extends on the half section line from the south line of Section 8, northerly about 3/4 of a mile and is laid across defendant's right-of-way which, at the point of intersection, is 100 feet in width and to which the defendant has a fee title. It was conceded at the hearing that the defendant had not consented in writing to the establishment of the road across </seg>
         <seg id="p111">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION its right-of-way. Roads may be established by consent under the pro - visions of Section 39-136 without the appointment of a commissioner, "provided the legal consent of all the owners of the land to be used for that purpose be first filed in the County Clerk's office". The road in this case cannot be qualified or dedicated as a con - sent road under this section because the written consent of the de - fendant that its land be used for road purposes has not been obtained and filed as provided by this section. The Supreme Court has held that under this section the written, consent of all owners of all land to be occupied by the road: must be filed with the County Clerk j and that the petition of the owners for the. establishment of the road is hot such a consent., See Deloughrey vs. Lapsley, 193 N. W. 109. [ The transcript shows that after the insufficient petition described' above was received and filed the county commissioners appointed Frank J. Green as a commissioner to file their report upon the prac - ticability of this road; that said commissioner qualified and thereafter viewed and made his report which was accepted by the commissioners about March 15, 1939, and the report was submitted to the road com - mittee. The next action by the commissioners was a resolution of May 17, 1939, purporting to legally establish and open this road. In so proceeding after tht commissioner's report, the board seemingly overlooked compliance with Sections 39-115 and 39-116 which provide that after the report of the commissioner is received and it be in favor of establishing the road, the county clerk is required to appoint a day not less than 60 or more than 90 days, "on or before which day all objections to the establishment or alteration of the road and all claims for damages by reason thereof must be filed with the County Clerk." Within 20 days after the date above provided for is fixed by the county clerk, the statute provides that a notice must be served on each owner or occupant of the land lying in a proposed highway or abutting thereon and must also be published for 4 weeks in some newspaper, in 'the county, which shall give notice of the filing of the report in favor of the establishment of the road and notice of the date on which objections thereto or claims for damages must be filed. ¦ The transcript shows conclusively that no such date for filing of objections or claims for damages, was fixed by the county clerk and no notice of any kind served or published and the resolution of May 17, 1939, is wholly void because of the failure of the county clerk and the commissioner to follow the statute in these particulars. The Statute, Sections 39^118 to 39-126, inclusive, contemplates, if objections are filed, or claims made, a hearing will be held before the county commissioners andi. the county commissioners are required to determine the objections and fare authorized after such hearing to </seg>
         <seg id="p112">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT establish or refuse to establish the road, as in their judgment, founded on the testimony, the public good may require. No such hearing has been held and no determination of this character made after notice of hearing to the parties who were entitled to such notice and the right to be heard and the resolution of May 17, 1939, is, therefore, plainly void for that reason. For these reasons, it appears that the county commissioners have not followed the statutory procedure for the opening of a new road on the half section line and that there is now no legally established road across the defendant's property. Since there is no legally es - tablished road across defendant's property, the Commission is without jurisdiction in the premises. It has not yet been legally determined in the manner provided by statute whether a highway shall extend across the railroad property and under decision of the Supreme Court of Nebraska that question belongs exclusively with the county com - missioners. See State vs. Omaha and S. I. Railway Co., 170 N. W. 496, where the court said in the syllabus: "In a certain sense the Railway Commission has juris - diction concerning the crossing of a railway by public high - way. It may in reason prescribe the method by which the crossing shall be made but it has no power to determine whether or not the highway shall extend across the right-of - way. The right to determine whether a highway shall extend across a railway belongs to the county board." The same question was before this Commission in Formal Com - plaint No. 557, 19 Nebraska State Railway Commission Reports 191. It was claimed there as here that a consent highway had been estab - lished but the Commission said (Page 193): "Section 2598 provides that before a consent highway may be established, all owners of land which would be taken for highway purposes, must sign the petition. The question is presented as to whether the easement of the right-of-way at the point where the railroad crosses the highway, consti - mtes an ownership within the meaning of Section 2598. "This question is settled in Missouri Pacific Railroad Company v. Cass County, 76 Nebr. 296, 400, wherein the Supreme Court of the state said in a similar case. " 'We think, however, that for the land condemned with - in the plaintiff's right-of-way for public use there should have been compensatory and not mere nominal damages ! </seg>
         <seg id="p113">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION awarded. It matters not whether the right of the plaintiff in the land was a mere easement or a fee simple title. It has acquired its right by its own condemnation proceedings and was entitled to the uninterrupted use and enjoyment of the right of way, subject only, as all property is, to the right of eminent domain.' "All section lines in Nebraska are potential roads, 54 Nebr. 443, but become actual existing roads only under cer - tain procedure. It is evident that the county commissioners in the action in 1886, did not consider the railroad as a prop - erty owner under the provision of Section 2598, which was , then on the statute (books. Hence, it seems clear that this particular road, as it related to the portion assumed to cross the railroad right of! way, was never legally established." -^-:- ]z':.z. ' ... -7':. This commission acquires jurisdiction as to the nature of a cross - ing of a highway and a railroad, only when the county has legally established the road. C. R. I. &amp; P. v. Nebraska State Railway Com - mission, 88 Neb. 239. We must find, therefore, that we have no juris - diction to designate the kind of crossing involved in this complaint, until such time as the county commissioners shall have completed the establishment of the road. In view of the above conclusions, it is not now necessary to dis - cuss the question of the necessity of the crossing at the point involved. .j-' ' ORDER ¦ ; IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the complaint be, and it is hereby dismissed without prejudice, MADE AND ENTERED at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 20th day of March, 1940.

The Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, a common carrier of pas - sengers and freight in Nebraska and in other states, applied for per - mission to discontinue motor-passenger trains numbered 97 and 98 which are operated daily except Sunday on the branch line of railroad between Beatrice and Holdrege. Between those cities, the towns and stations, east to west, are Hoag, DeWitt, Swanton, Western, Tobias, Ohiowa, Strang, Shickley, Ong, Edgar, Deweese, Lawrence, Rosemont, Blue Hill, Bladen, Campbell, Upland, Hildreth, Wilcox, and Sacramen - to. The municipalities named appeared before the commission by counsel and remonstrated against the granting of the application.

This court in discuss - ing the regulatory powers and duties of the commission in respect to services of common carriers unanimously adopted the following views of the law; " 'The prime object and real purpose of commission control is to secure adequate sustained service for the public at the least pos - sible cost, and to protect and conserve investments already made for this purpose. Experience has demonstrated beyond any question that competition among natural monopolies is wasteful economically and results finally in insufficient and unsatisfactory service and extrava - gant rates. Neither the number of the individuals demanding other service nor the question of fares constitutes the entire question, but rather what the proper agency should be to furnish the best service to the public generally and continuously at the least cost. Anything which tends to cripple seriously or destroy an established system of transportation that is necessary to a community is not a convenience and necessity for the public and its introduction would be a handicap rather than a help ultimately in such a field.' 3 Pond, Public Utilities (4th cd.) sec. 775." Publix Cars, Inc., v. Yellow Cab &amp; Baggage Co., 130 Neb. 401, 265 N. W. 234. In the same case the court ruled that consideration should be given to the public rather than to individuals. A ruling based on the abandonment of an unprofitable branch line of railroad, while its entire mileage is operated at a profit, is not necessary to a decision on this appeal and decisions of administrative boards and opinions of courts on such a problem are not controlling herein. The question is narrowed to the finding of the commission that applicant is not, under existing conditions as disclosed by the evidence, entitled to a regulatory order permitting it to discontinue motor passenger trains 97 and 98 on its branch line of railroad be - tween Beatrice and Holdrege. Transportation of passengers by steam - engine trains on this line was profitable before the advent of auto - mobiles, private trucks, common carrier trucks and public highways adapted to the use of the new motor vehicles. Much of the evidence on both sides was directed to changed conditions resulting from the new methods of transportation. Such changes were inevitable and </seg>
         <seg id="p117">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION railroad transportation must be adjusted to existing conditions if it is to survive.

Its entire mileage in Nebraska is practically 3,900 miles and it has a vast mileage of connecting lines in other states. The grounds on which applicant relies for the relief sought by it may be summarized gen - erally as follows: The primary purpose of the motor trains was trans - portation of passengers. Incidental thereto the service included the carrying of mails, express, baggage, cream and other commodities transportable in a one-unit motor train. The use of private automo - biles and public motor passenger buses or coaches on improved high - ways, paralleling, or crossing applicant's branch line, reduced the pas - senger service thereon almost to the vanishing point. Trains 97 and 98 are no longer needed for passenger traffic and are operated at a loss which places an unreasonable and unnecessary burden on the main railroad lines of applicant and on interstate commerce. If these trains are abandoned, all adequate transportation facilities and public ser - vices for passengers, baggage, mails, express and freight in all the towns and territory along this line will be furnished by other trains thereon, by other railroad lines of applicant, by lines of other railroad companies operating in the same territory and by common carrier trucks and motor coaches. In brief, the foregoing propositions indi - cate generally the position taken by applicant. Evidence in support of the application tends to prove the follow - ing facts and inference therefrom: The motor passenger trains oper - ate daily except Sunday between Beatrice and Holdrege. According to the schedules, train 98 leaves Holdrege at 6:40 a. m. and arrives at Beatrice at 12:08 p. m. and 97 leaves Beatrice at 1:00 p. m. and arrives at Holdrege at 6:34 p. m. The average number of travelers on these trains per train mile did not amount to two passengers for the years 1937, 1938 arid 1939 and they were not used generally by the public for transportation of passengers during those years. The expenses of operating this branch line during that period exceeded the revenues at least $500 a month and to that extent was a burden on other lines. On the line between Beatrice and Holdrege applicant operates mixed-service steam trains numbered 102 and 103. They are equipped to carry passengers, express, baggage, cream and freight and have the i facilities and connections for receiving and forwarding daily </seg>
         <seg id="p118">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT shipments at or near the towns along the Beatrice-Holdrege line. Train 102 is scheduled to leave Holdrege on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sat - urdays at 5:50 a. m. and arrive at Beatrice at 3:35 p. m. Train 103 is scheduled to leave Beatrice on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 9:20 a. m. and arrive at Holdrege at 7:30 p. m. This service will re - main if trains 97 and 98 are abandoned. In that event the federal government will provide for the handling of mail now carried by ap - plicant on those trains. Freight railroad traffic with resulting revenue in this territory has been greatly reduced by motor trucks operating on improved highways. Some wholesale merchants use private trucks to deliver merchandise to their retail customers. To a great extent cream and other farm products are taken to market by farmers in their own motor cars. By these methods and other means, the rev - enues arising from applicant's transportation of freight on this line have been greatly reduced. The main purpose of the application is to reduce operating costs of this branch line and preserve it for public service. This question presented by the appeal as understood. by counsel for remonstrants is the same as already indicated and has been stated by them in this form: "As the authority of the commission to grant or deny the applica - tion of the company is not challenged and cannot be challenged be - cause of this court's previous holdings, the only substantive issue be - fore the court is whether the order of the commission denying the application is supported by evidence showing that such order is not unreasonable or arbitrary." In the argument on this question the evidence is discussed at length on behalf of remonstrants. Many witnesses residing in the towns or territory along the Beatrice-Holdrege branch line testified in favor of the remonstrants, but their testimony is too voluminous to recite in detail. The general import of it, however, including infer - ences, conclusions, opinions and forecasts of witnesses is indicated by the following summary: The record of railroad operation on this branch line covers the period since 1886 and estimates of earnings, expenses and losses in revenue for the years 1937, 1938 and 1939 are not conclusive since the business during the 10-year period ending at the close of 1939 shows a profit and the net earnings in 1939 prove an increase over 1937 and 1938. The main lines of applicant are operating at a profit. The discontinuance of trains 97 and 98 would leave the municipalities along this branch line wthout adequate mail. </seg>
         <seg id="p119">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION .'; ' .. :!. v ¦'. ' ; express and passenger services. The years 1937, 1938 and 1939 were not normal for this territory on .account of continuous drought which destroyed crops and interfered with the Jive stock industry—the two principal commodities for transpqrtati'on. • Rainfall and snow at the time of the trial and previously indicate a more prosperous season for 1940. The livestock industry is reviving owing to the cultivation of crops adapted to the dry climate and resulting production of more feed for cattle. Chambers of commerce,, city councils, municipal officers, merchants and others have assumed a friendly attitude toward appli - cant and have united in efforts to increase its business asa-common carrier and to curb transportation by motor-trucks operating in the same territory. To this end some town councils have passed ordin - ances imposing occupation taxes on operators of trucks. Other coun - cils have been urged to pursue the same course. There is a general movement to turn transportation business back to the applicant and to prevent the abandonment of trains 97 and 98.. Trains 102 and 103 do not run on schedule time and will not provide adequate mail and express service. Some of the county roads to and from towns along the branch line have been blocked by snow and at other times rains have made them.dangerous and unfit for mail and express routes. "Testimony of the character indicated by the foregoing sum - mary was! multiplied by witnesses opposing the application, but not - withstanding such testimony and all evidential facts in the record, trains 97 and 98, operated as passenger trains, are practically obsolete. Income from passenger traffic, averaging less than two passengers per train mile!, is out of all proportion to the cost of operation as shown by uncontradicted evidence. There is no public necessity for exclusive passenger! trains operated as such' without compensable revenue nor is there any competent probative evidence of a material increase. Witnessesj generally crime to the "hearing before the commission in private automobiles. They were prompted by natural impulses to do so. They preferred a convenient, speedy and comfortable way to travel on (highways constructed and improved at public expense. They started from their own doors. They were not hampered by railroad time tables or limited in speed by motor trains or delayed by stops at stations. It is expecting too much of human nature, of optimism, of forecasts for moisture, and of proper attitude toward the railroad company, to find that trains 97 and 98, if continued, will be substi - tuted for automobiles ¦in the transportation of passengers between Beatrice and Holdrege. Conditions of railroad transportation have changed since 1886, when this branch line was constructed, and. the i . -' ¦ '-'.-'- ¦!':.". '-'•'. </seg>
         <seg id="p120">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT revenues during the entire intervening period are not proper measures of earnings and expenses under present changed conditions. Earnings and expenses since 1932, a period suggested by remonstrants for com - putations, are not proper measures of present or future profits and losses. Applicant must reckon with conditions resulting in present losses. The slight decrease in the loss occasioned by the operation of the motor passenger trains in 1939 was due in part to dismissal of one member of a train crew. Neither the evidence nor the findings of the commission show a public necessity for trains 97 and 98 as means of transporting passengers between Beatrice and Holdrege, when the daily service, equipment and connecting links of trains 102 and 103 are considered with other available services of applicant and of other common carriers." Do the franchises and public duties of applicant require it to operate these passenger trains for the incidental purposes of trans-: porting United States mails, express and cream? It is not a duty of a railroad common carrier to run passenger trains at heavy monthly losses for years on a branch line of railroad after such trains have been abandoned by the public for general and ordinary passenger traf - fic producing only a small decimal of operating expenses, where ade - quate facilities and public services are provided by daily mixed-service trains carrying passengers, mail, express and freight, and by other public utilities. Motor passenger trains operated on a branch line of railroad at a loss may properly be discontinued, where adequate public transportation is otherwise furnished, though the main line is operated at a profit. More moisture and resulting prosperity, anticipated by witnesses, are not likely to so change human nature as to turn short - trip passenger traffic, generally in rural communities, from automo - biles to motor trains on railroads. Ordinances imposing occupation taxes have not yet materially lessened transportation by motor busses and motor trucks in this territory and the evidence so proves. If, in the future, there should be any unreasonable departure from the schedules of trains 102 and 103, the regulatory power of the Nebraska railway commission will be available to the public for corrective reme - dies. It should not be assumed or found, in absence of evidence, of which there is none, that county officers will fail to perform their duty to keep county roads in a reasonably safe condition for mail and express routes and for other public purposes; nor that the postmaster general of the United States will fail to perform his duty to furnish adequate mail services for the people residing along this branch line of railroad. </seg>
         <seg id="p121">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION The examination and consideration of all the evidence lead to the conclusions that the operating expenses of passenger trains 97 and 98 far exceed the revenues therefrom; that those trains are not need - ed by the public for passenger traffic; that the continuous operation of trains 102 and 103 and of other utilities will furnish the public in this territory with adequate transportation for passengers, mail, ex - press, cream and freight. In these views of the record, the final order denying applicant permission to discontinue trains 97 and 98 is based on findings without support in the evidence and for that reason is unreasonable and arbitrary within the meaning of the law.

         <seg id="p144">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT BEFORE THE NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION In the matter of the application of The ) Lincoln Traction Company for author- ) APPLICATION NO. 14186 ity to abandon Tenth Street Railway ) and to substitute Buses. ) OPINION AND FINDINGS BY THE COMMISSION: This matter came on to be heard upon the application of The Lin - coln Traction Company, in which it requests authority to abandon its street railway lines, facilities and services on Tenth Street, between "P" and South Streets in Lincoln, and to substitute buses in lieu there - of. Applicant also requests that its loss in capital investment in prop - erty, and added pavement expense be amortized in an amount not less than $'56,500.00. The application was set for public hearing before the full Com - mission at Lincoln on the 27th day of May, 1940. Due notice of said hearing, together with a copy of the application, were sent to the City Attorney, City Clerk, City Engineer, and to the State Engineer. The City, through its Attorney, expressed the desire that the application be granted. No one appeared in opposition to the application. Testimony revealed that the said Tenth Street is to be enlarged, improved and repaved under a joint project of City, State and Federal Governments in making said street a part of State and Federal High - way No. 77: that all preliminary arrangements have been made, with exception of approval by this Commission of applicant's application. Applicant testified that it is willing to make the substitution and to co-operate in said improvement project provided it be permitted to amortize over a reasonable length of time, as a part of its operating expenses, the book value of the physical property which will be super - seded by the change in the type of transportation service. Its testi - mony tended to show that it possesses equipment requisite to continue to furnish adequate service by the existing street car line on Tenth Street and while it is willing and desirous of furnishing the improved motor bus service, applicant feels that it cannot financially afford to do so if it must bear the entire loss of used and useful equipment which will be superseded by the proposed change. In this connection applicant submitted, through testimony and exhibit that said improvement project would cost in the neighborhood of §148,498.00, of which amount the Federal and State Governments would contribute $73,108.00; the City of Lincoln $48,890.00, and the applicant's share would approximate $26,500.00, which would reflect </seg>
         <seg id="p145">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION the net cash pavement and street restoration expense under its fran - chise. ¦:¦'.-' In addition to the $26,600.00 mentioned above, applicant testified that loss in capital investment of the physical property to be abandoned under the proposal, based on book value, would amount to approxi - mately $29,600. after deducting: salvage. Four new buses to provide the improved service will cost the applicant approximately $24,800.00. The Commission is well informed and fully aware of the benefits and convenience to be derived from a substitution of buses for street cars, and is not hesitant in granting permission to make said substitu - tion in the interest of public welfare and convenience. The question, however, of amortizing the loss in capital invest - ment as a result of abandonment of property incident to said im - provement, and the necessary expense incident to removal of traak and cost of repaying is more difficult. ZThe Commission has given careful consideration to the general subject of the amortization of property rendered obsolete under cir - cumstances of this nature. When property is rendered no longer used and useful for the public service by reason of improvements made in the public interest, and past earnings have failed to permit the pro - viding of an ample reserve for its retirement or write-off. such as is present in the instant case, it is equitable and just, in our opinion, that the retirement of the remaining value; after deducting salvage and af - ter, the application of such portion of the depreciation reserves, if any, accumulated for the ultimate retirement of the property in question, should be permitted to be amortized out of the earnings as an oper - ating expense over a reasonable period of years. Recent, cases discuss - ing the problem may be found, as follows: Re St. Joseph Railway, Light, Heat &amp; Power Co. (Mo.) 5 P. U. R. (N.S.) 253; Springfield Gas &amp; , Elec. Co. (Mo.) 17 P;U.R.

After, a full consideration of the facts and circumstances, the Commission is of the opinion that applicant's request for permission to amortize its losses and repavement and street restoration expense, is not 7improper or unreasonable.. The public-is entitled -to the street improvement and the project details have nearly been completed. Time is of the essence and it was testified that July Ist, 1940, is the latest date in which approval may be secured from the several agencies in - volved. Under the exigencies of the situation the Commission is of </seg>
         <seg id="p146">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT the opinion that applicant should be permitted to amortize its losses and repavement and street restoration expense. This does not mean, however, that the instant action is to control future applications. The Commission is therefore of the opinion that said applicant should be granted authority to substitute buses for street cars on its Tenth Street Line, and to abandon the rail facilities thereon; that it should be permitted to amortize its loss in capital plant investment and expense in removing rail and repaying in an amount not to ex - ceed $56,500.00, the actual figures to be submitted upon completion of the project, at which time a supplemental order should be entered, showing losses in abandoned property, and expense in detail; that a ten year period would be a reasonable time in which to amortize the account. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Lincoln Traction Company be, and the same is hereby authorized to substitute buses for street cars on its South Tenth Street Line, and to abandon the rail facilities thereon. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant be and the same is hereby permitted to amortize its loss in capital plant investment, and expense in removing rail and repaying in an amount not \o exceed $56,500.00. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant shall submit to this Commission, upon completion of the project, full and complete details of the losses in abandoned property, and expenses incurred in repay - ing, whereupon a supplemental order shall issue, providing for ihe amortization thereof, over a ten year period. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED chat this order shall become effec - tive on June 1, 1940. MADE AND ENTERED at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 31st day of May, 1940.

Swanson COMMISSIONER DISSENTING: (Signed) F. A. Good </seg>
         <seg id="p147">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION GOOD, DISSENTING: From a study of recorded files it-is. found that since 1925 and the advent of bus transportation in the city of Lincoln there have been fourteen (14) applications for abandonment of track and street car service on certain streets. Further, in no instance has the company applied for the amortization of any value for the property superseded by bus transportation nor for the amortization of the cost incident to removal of rails and other items of material incident to rail transpor - tation and the essential repaying of the vacated, roadway. As to the ' item of amortization of the essential cost of removing rails and re - paying, although this has not been requested, or done in the past, I offer no objection although the cash item of funds on hand is of a very generous amount as of this date. ' In the instant case there is urged a necessity for the amortization of an amount alleged to be the value of all property superseded by the contemplated change over to bus transportation and in the urgency of "the matter I have yielded in this case to the appeal. However, I have not recognized as reasonable, or just to the public, to accept as a true value of the involved property the figures attested to by appli - cant. If we are to part with precedent established by preceding cases, I held in my substitute motion to a series of values very materially lower yet also attested to by the same officials. Becoming definite as to the latter set of values, I am quoting same as reflected in identical items in the 1940 attested tax schedule of the Lincoln Traction Company. Therein is listed "12 miles roadway @ $450——..._.— .-.55,400.00" "14 old street cars—_____ ;___-.—___. 2,100.00" From above I deduce that the said street cars are valued at $150.00 each. As a matter of record it was testified to by Mr. Schleuter, As - sistant City Engineer, that his department had made an estimate as to the total cost to be borne by the Lincoln Traction Company for rail removal and repairing, said estimate being in the sum of $21,780.00 Adding thereto the value of two street cars now in service $150.00 each—s3oo.oo but adjusted to conform to an esti - mated 70% of actual value and raised to 100%.—_______ 430.00 Adding thereto 2.6 trackage miles at $450 per mile and in like manner raising- the value to 100% or $650.00 per mile __________j__.____________.__..___ 1,690.00 ; Adding miscellaneous expense.. __________ ;________ 100.00 ' $24,000.00 </seg>
         <seg id="p148">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT From above digest of value of the 10th Street line, i.e. $2,120.00 as against the applicants claim for $30,000.00 plus salvage estimated at $8,000.00, or a total of $38,000.00, it is worthy of note that the company's value as allowed by my colleagues is' eighteen times the value sworn to by the Vice-President and General Manager of the Traction Company. It is notable that transportation fares, in the City of Lincoln, are in the very high brackets as compared with a composite fare of all cities of 25,000 population or more, in the United States and Canada. I hold that the car or bus riders of Lincoln are entitled to a lower fare if modem transportation might be afforded and although this transition will result in lower operating expenses, on this particular line, yet, the, to me, unwarranted burden, placed upon the one who must pay i.e. the riders over the whole city, extends materially the time when a lower fare might be found by this Commission to be fully warranted. My colleagues have cited instances where plant values have been amortized. There are also many instances where such authorization was not allowed: however, in the instant case, I am concurring in said amortization, but am in open revolt at the imaginary, nonexistent and unreal values as set forth by applicant herein depicted, and as now O.K.'d by a majority of this Commission.

The engineer, Lehman, was employed to make this re-valuation under direction of the Commissioner's engineer. In December, 1938, the Commission by unanimous vote suspended fur- </seg>
         <seg id="p149">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION ther work of re-valuation because of insufficient funds with which to proceed. On February 9, 1939, the City of Omaha filed with the Commission its application seeking a revaluation of the respondent company and a reduction of fares and offered to continue the work of revaluation at its (City's) expense and asked that the Commission turn over to the City all the records and data up to the date of dis - continuance of the appraisal by the Commission. This request was granted and the records and data were transferred to the City of Omaha and given into the custody of the City authorities, who then took up the work of appraisal discontinued by the Commission,-em - ploying the engineer, Lehman, in its own behalf. V ISSUES/. The respondent company by its amended answer and cross-ap - plication affirmatively requested a finding of the fair values of its property and also a finding of the reasonableness of the present sched - ule of fares charged by the Company as prescribed by this Commis - sion.. &#132; ¦ /.j- .Z The issues as presented to the Commission involve: (1) the fair value of the respondent company's property as of January 1, 1939, and (2), the reasonableness of the rate schedule charged by the Com - pany as heretofore prescribed by the Commission. A full hearing was afforded both the City and the Company ex - tending over a period of four weeks. The transcribed record consisted of 1480 pages of testimony. There were 14 exhibits offered by the City and 68 offered by the Company. The City's brief consisting of 59 pages, was filed August Bth, 1939, and the Company's brief, con - sisting of 372 pages, was filed on the 20th day of September, 1939, and the case was finally submitted for consideration by the Commis - sion. At thjs point it may be of interest to observe, that during the long hearing in this case, not one single street car rider appeared in protest of the present fares, nor were there any objections received from any source. It has been a tremendous task with limited per - sonnel to accumulate, digest, compare, analyze and attempt to recon - cile the voluminous exhibits, testimony and various accounts. It will be necessary later on to comment in some detail upon the evidence adduced by the respective parties and it will appear quite obvious that the showing made by the City was not as full and com - plete or as well buttressed by corroborative testimony as the evidence of the respondent company. Lehman had no field notes or working papers and for most accounts, produced no corroborative evidence as to quantities or unit prices.- Lehman was employed by the Commis - sion in the first instance as the engineer of its own selection to work under the Commission's.Chief Engineer and was later taken over by </seg>
         <seg id="p150">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT the City. Both the Commission and the City were hampered by lack of funds and presumably neither of them was in a position to prepare their case as well as did the respondent company. The Commission has endeavored to weigh the testimony on both sides as fairly as may be and to allow so far as it may be able, for the difficulties encounter - ed by the City in preparing its case. -The Commission cannot, how^ ever, disregard the evidence adduced or the weight of the evidence as shown by the record and has been compelled, perforce, to decide this case upon the record as presented to it, coupled with such matters as aTe within its judicial knowledge. The legal points involved are numerous, and of necessity, citations of law and court decisions must be considered and included, all of which may be confusing to the lay - man, but must be given due consideration. HISTORICAL The respondent company began with a horse car line established in Omaha in 1869. In 1884 a cable tramway company entered the field. In 1887 an electric tramway, the Omaha Motor Railway Com - pany, came into being. The cable company and the horse car com - pany merged in 1889 into the Omaha Street Railway Company which later in the same year took over the Omaha Motor Railway. Before the end of 1894 the system was completely electrified. Other and lesser tramway companies came into existence but eventually were taken into the Omaha Street Railway Company. In December, 1902, the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway Company, the present respondent, was organized and acquired from the Omaha Street Rail - way Company the following properties, to-wit: all tramway facilities, property and franchises in the City of Omaha. At that same time the respondent acquired from the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Railway and Bridge Company a 99-year leasehold of the street railway system in the City of Council Bluffs, lowa, including the interurban line be - tween Council Bluffs, lowa, and Omaha, Nebraska, and the Douglas Street Bridge across the Missouri River connecting the two cities. This Commission has, of cburse, no control over the tram system operated in Council Bluffs by the respondent as lessee. The property used and useful in that lease and the results of operation have been excluded from consideration by both parties and will not be here considered. The lease of the Douglas Street Bridge was disposed of prior to the institution of this proceeding. It had been for many years a lucrative property and from its earnings outstanding bonds of the Company had been reduced from $9,619,000 to $4,878,000. The matter with which the Commission has to do here, is the valua - tion of the property used and useful in the service of transportation in the City of Omaha and State of Nebraska as of January 1, 1939., and does not involve either the Council Bluffs leasehold or the lease of the Douglas Street Bridge. </seg>
         <seg id="p151">NEBBASKA S^ATE RAILWAY COMMISSION PREVIOUS VALUATION On September 25, 1923, in Application No. 3539-A (16th Annual Report, Nebraska State Railway Commission, Pages 184 to 243) this Commission found that the fair value of the property of the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway Company used and useful in the public service within the State of Nebraska was $13,800,000, as of December 31, 1919, subsequently increased by the Commission on September 22, 1924, to $14,100,000, (17th Annual Report, Nebraska State Railway Commission, Page 232). There was an attempt made in that case to reproduce the histori - cal or book cost of the property, but this was found by the Commis - sion to be unsatisfactory and the findings of the Commission appear to have been based almost entirely upon an appraisal on the basis of reproduction new less depreciation. The manner of procedure was thus stated: "The making of the inventory was a heavy task. Ap- • plicant undertook to do this with its own staff of engineers . and department heads. The inventory, prepared with ad - mirable care, was contained in one bound exhibit of 810 large pages. It was filed with the Commission May 6, 1921. In part it had been checked by the Commission's engineering department prior to filing and in part subsequent thereto. Hearings were begun at Omaha May 16, 1921, and continued from time to time upon direct evidence by the company until June 23, 1921. Cross-examination of the company's witnes - ses occured in September, 1921. From January to March, '" 1922, evidence was presented by the Commission's engin - eers oh costs?of the property as disclosed by the books. Cross - examination and rebuttal testimony were concluded and the case submitted on March 10, 1922." It would thus appear that the Commission approved the appraisal in part and controverted it in part, its: conclusion being based partly upon the evidence proffered by the Company and partly upon the conclusions of its own engineering staff. BASIS OF VALUATION It is the duty of the Commission here to find the fair value of the property used and useful in the service of transportation. The courts have never laid down any hard and fast rule which must be followed in the valuation of a public utility. Consideration has been given in many cases to an appraisal upon the basis of reproduction new less depreciation. In other cases historical or book costs have been considered the better basis. As above pointed out no conclusive </seg>
         <seg id="p152">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT evidence of historical cost has ever been presented to this Commis - sion as to the value of this property as a whole. In the instant pro - ceeding, each party has presented an appraisal based, in most in - stances, on reproduction new less depreciation, although reflecting historical costs in a few instances. There is some evidence in the record as to the assessed value of the property and as to the value of the Company's stock and bonds. While useful for comparative pur - poses in a proper case, it does not seem to the Commission that con - trolling weight should be accorded here to such evidence, especially since both parties appear to be agreed that the method of appraisal on the basis of reproduction new less depreciation should be followed. ACCOUNTS AFFECTING TANGIBLE PROPERTY Each party assumed in its appraisal to follow the form of ac - counts set up and prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission for electric railways. These accounts cover both tangible property and intangible values arrived at with reference to the tangible prop - erty or some part thereof, such as the account covering the cost of, engineering and the so called overheads, or general expenses incurred during an assumed construction period. For the purpose of discussion the Commission finds it more convenient to discuss together those accounts which deal only with tangible property, leaving for later consideration the other accounts or elements to be considered in con - nection with the valuation for rate making purposes. ACCOUNT 503 This account includes all land used by the Company, exclusive of buildings. The witnesses on this branch of the case appear to be equally competent and disinterested and the Commission believes that each has tried fairly to reflect his view of what the property is ac - tually worth. There is a wide variation between the City's and the Company's appraisement. The Company's figure was $337,932 as against the City's figure of $110,052. This difference is only partially accounted for by reason of the fact that the City insists that the Com - pany should not be allowed to include any part of the power plant premises at 6th and Jones Street because it claims that the switching which is now done in that plant building should and could be done without expense to the Company within the premises of the Nebraska Power Company, situated some 1500 feet away. The Company claims that it is necessary to occupy approximately 1/8 of the space afforded by the power plant building for this switching; that it is entitled to do its own switching on its own premises and should not be compelled to make use of the facilities of another company even though that company furnishes it with electrical energy. This question is dis - cussed more in detail in connection with a later account and it will </seg>
         <seg id="p153">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION suffice here to say that the Company is correct in its contention. All authorities are agreed that regulatory bodies should not invade man - agement. In Benton ~. Belt Line Railway Corporation, 268 U. 8 - -413, 69 L. Ed. 1021, the court condemned the invasion of manage - ment in the following words: "Broad as is its power to regulate, the state does not • enjoy the freedom of an owner. Appellee's property is held in private ownership; and, subject to reasonable regulation in the public interest, the management and right to control the business policy of the company belong to its owners." (Citing cases) For the purpose of this.account that portion of the land occupied for switching purposes should be considered and it is not controverted that the portion would be approximately 1/8. Taking an average between the City's figure of $76,680 and the Company's figure of $129,700 and allowing 1/8 thereof for. actual property used, produces a figure of $12,899. By the same token, if an average is taken between the figures of the respective parties for remaining ( lands not including the parcels at 24th &amp; Ames, 24th &amp; Vinton, 10th &amp; Pierce and 25th &amp; Burt, the result is $70,471 to which should be added the amount of $12,899 above mentioned, and adding the Sarpy County parcel, $1,000 produces $84-370 which the Commission believes is a fair and reason - able value of the lands except the parcels referred to above- The four parcels upon which are located the car barns, cause more difficulty. The expert witnesses are at great variance in these items arid it is impossible to reconcile their differences. The City's figure for the prop - erty at 24th &amp; Ames was $23,960, the Company's $59,800. At 24th &amp; Vinton the City's expert found a value of $19,210 and the Company, $61,250. At 10th &amp; Pierce, City's figure was $&#132;085 and the Company's was $29,106. The garage property at 25th &amp; Burt was shown as $20, - -295 by the City and $68,123 by the Company. The total for the City was $71-550 and the Company $218,279. However, taking into consid - eration the testimony of the expert witnesses, plats, pictures and ex - hibits it would seem that a lump figure of $121,482 for the four par- - eels last above mentioned would be a fair arid reasonable figure. [ The Commission is therefore of the opinion that this account should carry a valuation of $205,852. ACCOUNT 504 This account covers grading. The City's depreciated figure was $155,623. The Company's was $214,298. ' It appears that the City is 11,433 cubic yards short in the amount of grading actually done although the quantities were: secured froni plats and cross-sections obtained from the company. No field notes or Working papers or </seg>
         <seg id="p154">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT supporting data were submitted by the City nor was there any dis - tinction made between going through dirt or pavement. It is a matter of common knowledge that excavation through pavement would be more costly than through dirt and that grading for curves, turnouts, etc commonly called "special work", would of necessity require hand work arfd therefore would be more expensive than straight machine work. Under these circumstances, the Commission feels lustified m accepting the Company's figure. ACCOUNTS 505 AND 506 Account 505 covers ballast and Account 506 covers ties. As to - each of these accounts some consideration must be given to the test holes which were dug under the direction of the City's engineer, Leh - man, for the purpose of disclosing what lay below the rail surface. ; It would seem that more representative locations could have been , chosen. From the records in the Company's office selections could have been made which would have reflected more evenly the old and I new construction. It is apparent that any material deterioration either in ties or ballast might reflect itself on the surface and it wouldl be a fairer method to make the selections in advance of the inspection of the trackage rather than after inspecting the same However the , test holes were dug and the pictures are in the record and the Com - mission has tried to reconcile as well as it can the testimony of the witnesses for the respective parties. As to ballast, the Company in - sists upon a reproduction cost of $297,287 and a 100% °»**™-™? City's reproduction cost is a considerably lower figure, $155,961 which is due to discrepancies between the City and Company in quantities and prices. The Commission feels that the City is mistaken in its estimate of reproduction cost, but cannot agree to the 100% condi - tion which the Company claims exists. The City allowed nothing in the unit cost for transportation and handling although the Inter - state Commerce Commission, Classification of Accounts, states: "This account shall include . . • cost of transportation and handling (except final distribution)." j The Company included such charges in its unit costs. The Commis- j sion is of the opinion that concrete and cinder ballast do depreciate and that the percent condition of this account should be computed as follows: Crushed rock 100% Concrete - 75% Cinders 50% This would give a depreciated cost figure for Account 505 of $283,677. </seg>
         <seg id="p155">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION In the tie account the parties found no material difference in quantity of ties or in types, to-wit: Treated, White Oak and Mixed Oak. Their main differences were in unit cost and condition percent. The difference in unit cost is readily apparent. The City used prices F. 0. B. Omaha, whereas the Company included expense of inspection, stores and handling as provided in Interstate Commerce Commission, Classification of Accounts, as follows: "This account shall include the . . . cost of transporta - tion and handling (except final distribution); the pay and expenses of employes engaged in obtaining, purchasing, treating, framing, and inspecting ties for construction pur - . ... ' poses.". Under the circumstances, the unit cost of the Company' should be accepted. The City used a flat condition percent of 50, including all types of ties. The Company, after breaking down condition percent of each of the types, arrived at a composite condition percent of 61.5. The Commission finds itself unable to agree with either figure. The Com - pany's witness testified that he arrived at condition by determining the age of the tie and then estimating depreciation from the Com - pany's experience as to service life of ties,! stating that the average age of creosoted ties was 9 years and white oak ties, 22% years. After a careful analysis of the record, exhibits, pictures and briefs as to this account, the Commission finds that by applying a weighted average age for all ties as .'a guide and using: a service life figure for each type of tie in the Company's system, a result is ob - tained as follows; ¦ COST OF REPRODUCTION Unit New Cond.

         <seg id="p156">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT ACCOUNT 507 This account covers rails, rail fastenings and joints. There are dif - ferences between the parties in the quantities of all of these elements as well as discrepancies in the unit prices and costs. It appears that witness Lehman, was short in his computation as to the amount of rails required. He also failed to include any charge for handling, store - yard and equipment charges. Again in this account Lehman used a flat condition percent of 50 which would indicate that the rails of the Company were half worn out and the Commission does not believe the evidence supports this contention. The Company's witness claims a 64.2 condition percent for all rails. However, the Commission is of the opinion that the ball, girder, web and base do rust and corrode and necessarily deteriorate with age. Salt, too, on hills and connect - ing special work reduces the service life of rail. In response to a ques - tion by Chairman Maupin (tr. pg. 1203) the Company's witness stated: "Q. Would your groove be any smaller? A. The groove would be shallower on this old type section. At the same time that rail was on a heavy line down in there and that rail was really too light for the line. A little bit of corrosion would affect the strength of the steel carrying the loads." All factors considered, the Commission is of the opinion that a com - posite condition percent of 60.25 would be fair and equitable and this account is therefore adjusted to $681,451. ACCOUNT 508 This account covers special work at crossings and curves. The : differences here, as in Account 507, are mainly in quantities and unit prices. There appears to be no reason for discrepancy in inventory as blue prints and photostat copies of all special work layouts were available for the appraisal. The City did not include cost of trans - portation, inspection and handling. The Company's figure of $424,397 should be accepted for this account. ACCOUNT 510 This account covers track and roadway labor. As to quantities, Lehman is short in special work some 1260 long tons which would approximate $31,000. As to labor cost, he estimates $25 per long j ton for laying special work in place. He presented no detail as to ] costs and stated his figure was an tstimated price. He proposed to lay the ties and rails on untamped ballast and would align the track by eye only. This testimony is of little or no value to the Commission. As to straight track, he uses a cost figure of 20c per track foot in- </seg>
         <seg id="p157">1 NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION eluding the handling from the railroad yard to the site, and all other labor expense necessarily comprised in the total cost. Again the Com - mission was furnished with no detail in support of this cost item. The City did riot depreciate this account but left it in a 100% condition. With this the Commission is not in accord. A weighted average con - dition of accounts 505, 506, 507 and 508 would produce a condition percent of 63.23 which would appear to fairly reflect the facte, thus arriving at the figure of $333,365 for this account, which is adopted. ACCOUNT 511 7 This covers paving. A considerable difference developed between the City and the Company as to what should be included in this ac - count.' The City includes in its account only paving between gauge lines on track originally laid through a previously paved street where the Company had to remove and relay pavement. The Company on the other hand includes all paving which was actually done by the Company. In this the Commission thinks the Company is justified. The Company was required by the City to put this pavement in place and it was a necessary part of the construction of the system. In Dcs Moines Gas Company vs. City of Dcs Moines, 238 U. S. 153, the court ruled that a gas company might not include for valuation pur - poses the expense of taking up and relaying pavements where ,there were no pavements when the gas mains were laid. What was, in ef - fect, held in the Dcs Moines case was that the Company might not in - clude expenses never incurred. Here the expense of paving was all necessarily incurred and should have been taken into account by the City. : Z'Z :- ¦ z";" Because of the failure of the City to present complete figures the Commission must, perforce, rely on those of the Company, which amount to $949,759 as the depreciated cost. The Company's figure and the condition percent of 82.38 both seem high to this Commission, but the City has submitted no reliable estimates covering reproduction cost as to the entire property which should be considered, and its con - dition figure of 100% seems entirely indefensible. No pavement is that good. ACCOUNT 512 .' '.';-. This is a relatively small account covering roadway machinery and tools. Here the City's witness appears to have arrived at his appraisal by a study of an inventory prepared for the 1918 hearing and without observation or detail, lumped all items into one figure of $30,000, Obviously, he could not arrive at a proper cost figure in this manner. The condition percent was applied by another witness. Under the circumstances the Company's figure of $65,706 based upon </seg>
         <seg id="p158">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT the testimony as to items, cost new and observed condition should be accepted- ACCOUNT 515 This covers bridges, trestles and culverts. Although this account is small it, again, is unreliable so far as the City's figures are con - cerned. The City shows 22 surface track drains and 3 inlets. There are actually 102 surface track drains. As to price, Lehman estimated $40 each, for the track drains, but without any attempt to estimate the items of material or labor making up the $40. He gives this ac - count a condition percent of 90 as against the Company's condition percent of 75. The Company included in its appraisal of this account the sum of $10,857 representing its portion of the original cost of the Q Street Viaduct. Regarding this item Lehman testified as fol - lows: "Q. So if the street railway company's part of the cost of that viaduct and what they had to pay out in dollars and cents is $10,857. you would have to add that to this item of bridges, trestles, etc.? A. If it were found that the company built it and it was within the requirements of the laws, sure, it would be a part of it.' 1 Obviously, the property in this account was not properly appraised by the City's engineer and the Commission accepts the Company's de - preciated cost of $12,755, which was based upon the proper evidence. ACCOUNT 516 This account covers crossings, fences and signs. Here the Com - pany's depreciated figure of $1,486 is lower than the City's figure, hence will be accepted by the Commission. ACCOUNT 517 This account covers signals and interlockers. This is a small account and it is apparent that the engineer, Lehman, included but three block signal units when' the Company actually had five and he gives no detail as to how he arrived at the reproduction cost. The five block signals were estimated by the Company at a reproduction cost of $325 as against a reproduction cost for three signals by the City of $887.61, but the City included in its reproduction cost, cable and pans without any attempt separately to value the same, whereas the Company assigned separate values to these items. The Company's depreciated cost figure of $1,010 should be accepted. </seg>
         <seg id="p159">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION ACCOUNT 519 . This account covers poles and fixtures. The Company's figure for depreciated cost is $175,989, which is slightly less than the City's figure of $186,607. It is conceded by the Company that the lesser figure should be accepted and the Commission agrees. ACCOUNTS 520, and S2O-A These accounts cover underground conduits. It was admitted by the engineer, Lehman, that his original exhibit was incorrect and an additional exhibit was later offered by him. The Commission realizes the difficulties under which Mr. Lehman labored and the disadvantage which he suffered in attempting to appraise the property of the Com - pany particularly such property as is underground and not readily accessible for inspection. It also realizes the amount of work which is necessary to be performed in working out proper unit costs and making due allowance for depreciation in work of this nature. How - ever, by reason of the lack of detail the City's figures are of very little value and the Commission recognizes the Company's figure of $&gt;153,162 as representing the depreciated cost of the items covered in this account. j . ACCOUNT 521 This account covers the distribution system of the Company. It is to be noted that this account covers visible items and the City's appraisal is in marked contrast to some of the other accounts, al - though it is apparent that even here there were a number of items omitted by the City. The City's exhibit shows a depreciated cost of $284,693 representing a condition percent of 85.7. This is to be com - pared with a depreciated cost of $304,974 claimed by the Company at a condition percent of 79.46. Allowing only for the omitted items and nothing for the difference in quantity and price on cable, wire and labor would add $31,376 to the City's reproduction cost, and esti - mating condition percent at the City's percentage^ would leave a de - preciated cost in excess of the figure submitted by the Company. The Company's figure of' $304,974 as the depreciated cost, therefore, should be accepted. .'. ACCOUNT 523 This account covens the buildings used as shops and carhouses. Competent and reputable expert witnesses appeared for the respective parties and, as in the land account, their figures vary so much it has been a difficult job to reconcile them. Chief differences are in con - dition percent and in method of computing direct construction ex - penses. The City's witness testified that he did not insert the depre - ciated figures in his exhibit and did not know who had carried out the </seg>
         <seg id="p160">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT totals. The record is silent as to who actually appraised the condition percent on City's exhibit.

" ¦ - .'' * ... ACCOUNT 530-A Z ; This account covers street cars without motors. The parties were close to agreement in this account as to quantity, there being J. 96 four - motor cars, 2 Birney cars and 2 Jones caTs. The City did not include the 2 Jones cars. There is little difference in reproduction cost on the cars without motors as fixed by the parties—the City's figure being $1,476,700 and the Company's figure of $1,483,520. The dif - ference is brought about by the City's failure to include transporta - tion and unloading charges. The Company allowed $15 per car for "unloading, inspection, setting up, and trying out" under Interstate Commerce Commission, Classification of Accounts. 'During' the years 1931, 1932 and 1933, the Company rebuilt its street cars practically 100%, the only substantial physical part: re - maining, being the original frame. The improvements in the re-build - ing of the cars, including new vestibules, heavier and increased num - ber of motors for higher speeds, pneumatic doors, increased seating capacity, steel wheels in lieu of cast iron wheels, lightning arresters, lighting' increased, electric heating, life guard fenders, dead man's safety control, and complete re-painting. The cost of these improve - ments aggregated $512,484. The work was done on each and every one of the 196 street cars. It is a matter of common knowledge that Omaha street cars, in sightliness and efficiency, rank among the best in the United States—and the Commission may. take judicial notice of facts of common knowledge. Muller v&lt; Oregon, 208 U. S. 412; 52 L. Ed. 551, at 555; U. S. of A. v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1, 80 L: Ed: 477, at 486. Z:Z Z'.Z ¦'.' Considerable difference presents itself in percent condition ap - plied by the parties to this account. While proper maintenance and replacement of deteriorated or worn parts does lessen depreciation, the fact remains that obsolescence (function depreciation) exists to some extent in the Company's cars.' Differentiation should be made between operating efficiency and present condition as present condi - tion is used in reference to valuation, i.e. cost of reproduction less depreciation, including physical and functional depreciation. Taking all factors :into consideration and using the Company's reproduction cost of $1,483,520 and applying a composite condition percent of 61 for all of the cars,-produces a figure of - $904,947 which the Commission feels''to he a'fair and reasonable amount for this ac - count. .

         <seg id="p164">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT ACCOUNT 533-A (ELECTRIC EQUIPMENT FOR STREET CARS) This account includes electric equipment for street cars. There is very little difference as to the reproduction cost figure, the unit costs being almost identical. The difference comes in the condition percent. It is apparent that the motors have been well maintained and there is no question but that they are kept in first class condition and are entirely serviceable. It seems absurd to give a percent con - dition of 38.69 as proposed by the City to equipment whichis actually functioning as efficiently as this equipment is. The Company's figure of 83% is somewhat high but if this percent be reduced to 80 it will give a proper figure. This would result in a figure of $890,600 for the depreciated cost of these motors. ACCOUNT 530-B This account includes buses used by the Company. No differ - ence appears in number of vehicles. The Company insisted in itß brief that if the City would add the cost of tires, reproduction cost would be the same. Testimony shows that tires were rented on a mileage basis and charged to operating expenses and were not purchased. Ob - viously such items are not a part of plant investment. The Commis - sion is of the opinion, therefore, that the City's figure of $456,855 for reproduction cost is correct. Considering condition percent on a ser- ' vice-life basis it appears that the City's composite condition percent of 68.5 is correct. The depreciated reproduction cost figure of $313, - -157 proposed by the City should therefore be adopted.

ACCOUNT 532—SERVICE CARS and ACCOUNT 533—ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT FOR SAME These accounts represent the electromotive service equipment without motors and in a separate account, motors for the same. There is little difference in the figures submitted by the City and the Com - pany for the cost of reproduction. The difference lies almost en - tirely in the condition percent observed. The City's'figure for equip - ment without motors is 18.95% and for motors 13.22%, It sho«rtd be remembered that the annual depreciation on this equipment is not </seg>

The figures submitted by the City are ridiculously low. A motor in only 13.22% condition could not possibly operate. It seems in this instance that the Company's claim to 57.42% for the percent condition for service cars is reasonable and as to Account 532 its figure for depreciated cost of $60,394 should be adopted. As to motors the Commission is of the opinion that there should be a reduction from the condition percent claimed by the Company •from 83% to 80% in line with the reduction; made as to motors on street cars. This would result in a figure of $108,464 for the depre- -, ciated cost items included in Account 533, foriservice equipment. ACCOUNT 532—AUTOMOTIVE The City's figures appear to be inaccurate both as to items in - cluded and as to cost figures. ..The following items of property were entirely omitted: one four-wheel flat trailer; one four-wheel reel wagon and accessories; one two-wheel-pole carrier, and fifteen spare tires. The Company does a not own the transfer table and the No. 113, Model 54, snow plow, in - cluded in the City's inventory. The City claims to have obtained actual cost figures from the records of the Company. The ledger records and job orders of the Company were produced at the hearing, for examination, and the City^s cost figures do not represent the cost figures shown in the Company's records. .;•:.•.••¦ Upon the showing made in this account the Commission is of the opinion that the Company's figure of $64,233 should be taken as fairly representing the depreciated cost. ACCOUNT 534—LOCOMOTIVES This was omitted by the Company and the figure of $770 cover - ing a locomotive not used is excluded from consideration. : :"-.-' ACCOUNT 536 This account covers shop equipment.

The depreciated cost figure of $350,429 should therefore be adopted for this account.

         <seg id="p170">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT Differences in this account result mainly from the respective methods used. The Company had no account 542 and if the City's figure of $24,133 under its Account 542 be added to its figure in this account, a total of $385,921 would be procured. The City's reproduc - tion cost figure was arrived at by taking actual cost price under the 1929 contract. No increase in cost resulting from labor, social se - curity taxes, workmen's compensation and labor overheads was in - cluded. Testimony revealed that the 1929 cost figure would have to be increased 18.4% to install the equipment at the present time. This increase, together with other proper present-day charges mentioned above, would make the City's figure $478,170 or approximately $2,000 over the Company's reproduction cost. Condition percent figures are at greater variance. The City's witness testified that his field notes and working papers had appar - ently been lost and they were not produced at the hearing. It was difficult to obtain information in the record on how condition percent was ascertained. After considering the testimony and exhibits in this case the Com - mission is of the opinion that the Company's depreciated cost figure of §410,728 should be accepted. ACCOUNT 544 This account covers transmission equipment. There is little dif - ference in the reproduction cost, but the City's condition percent is some 10% less than the Company's. Considering the condition in which this particular class of property must be maintained to be useful it would seem that a percent condition of 67.97 would more nearly re - flect actual conditions than the percent condition of 57.5 as claimed by the City. The Company's figure of $124,285 should be accepted by the Commission as the proper figure for depreciated cost for the items contained in this account. SUMMARY This brings to a conclusion the accounts affecting tangible prop - erty of the Company and the Commission believes that the figures set forth above fairly and accurately represent, under the evidence as presented, the present fair value on the basis of cost of reproduction new less depreciation of the items therein included. The Commission is not unmindful of the matter of obsolescence. It has been, and undoubtedly will be, contended that obsolescence should be given more weight in appraisal of this property than is af - forded by the ascertainment of condition percent through observed depreciation of the various items. When this investigation was.orig- </seg>
         <seg id="p171">NEBRASKA STATE! RAILWAY COMMISSION inally instituted it was suggested that it should be taken into account that mass transportation was in the process' of transition; that many cities were served by completely motorized units and that this par - ticular system should be valued on the basis of substitution of bus service for electric equipment. It is undoubtedly true that mass transportation is in a state of flux, but it is equally true that no one knows what the outcome may be. Motorized transportation is not the only form of mass transportation which is being offered the public. Trolley buses operating from overhead trolleys but without rails are common sights in other cities, as for example, Kansas City and Indian - apolis. To attempt to say what equipment is or will become obsolete and within what period, would be for this Commission to leave the realm of fact and enter into the realm of speculation and fanciful con - jecture. The experience of the Company in street railway operations, does not differ materially from the experience of Other tram companies in cities of 100,000 to 500,000 population,- as to numbers of passengers carried, and revenues received. Omaha, with a population of 220,000, has all of the characteristics rendering tram service difficult and highly expensive. The City's boundaries form an oblong, being 11% miles long, and 3% miles wide, making one of its tram hauls 12.27 miles in length. The topography is quite hilly, including several grades in excess of 8%. The.climate reaches the extremes, both in winter and in summer, It is industrial in character, having major branches of the four largest packing: industries, and an extensive stockyards, resulting in high peaks demand, with more than 60% of all passengers being hauled during peak periods. The tremendous increase in costs of operations is conclusively demonstrated in several of the Company's exhibits. From 1913 to 1938, wages of Company's employees increased 135%; general con - struction costs increased 125%; electric railway construction costs in - creased 68%; operating expenses generally increased 132%; and taxes (exclusive of Social Security, Capital Stock and Corporation) Taxes) increased 324.59%. During the same period, the Company's fares increased only 67%. j Like other tram companies, since the effective advent of the au - tomf-ile, and subsequently, the appearance of low fare taxicabs, the Company has been subjected to constant and increasing destructive competition. Passenger automobile registrations in the City of Omaha for the year 1915 were 4,947. and for the year 1938, 47,321. As passenger automobile registrations increased, street railway passen - gers automatically decreased. The effect of the use of the privately owned automobile is : reflected in the fact that Company's passengers riding, receded from a maximum of 61,650,839 passengers carried in the year 1920, to 25,025,054 passengers carried in 1938. Conversely, </seg>
         <seg id="p172">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT during the same period, passenger automobile registrations increased in the City of Omaha from 15,750 in 1920, to 47,321 in 1938. The result of the effective advent of the privately owned passenger auto - mobile on the Company was no different than the effect of other tram companies in cities with populations of 100,000 to 500,000 people, and is entirely beyond the control of tram company officials. In the last several years, taxicabs, and other public cars, very substantially reduced their fares, and as a class engaged in the carry - ing of several passengers—as many as five—at the same price as a single occupant of a taxicab or public car would pay when riding alone. This new form of competition has [definitely adversely affected the tram business. In the City of Omaha, along with the substantial de - creases in taxicab fares, there has been an equally substantial increase in the number of taxicab units operated. Notwithstanding the difficulties besetting all tram companies in cities of populations generally-comparable to that of the City of Omaha, and particularly applicable to operations in the City of Omaha, the Company has continued at all times to accord adequate and suffi - cient service to the people. In 1903 the City of Omaha had a popula - tion of 123,000, and in 1938, 220,000, yet in 1903 the Company car - ried 23,212,048 passengers, and in 1938, 25,025,054 passengers—an increase of only 7.81%. During this same period, due to expansion of City environs, and trends toward peak period riding, the car and bus miles operated, increased 41.34%. The route miles were increased' 37.66%. The operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation, increased 132.35%, primarily because of higher costs of labor, materials and other operating expense items. In the same period, taxes increased 324.59%, or from $64,938.95 in 1903 to $275,726.20 in 1938. The record shows that the net Additions and Betterments made by the Company since the acquisition of the property in 1903, aggre - gates $5,367,387.49 —the largest expenditures being in the years 1929 to 1933, and reflecting in part the cost of the extensive rebuilding of the Company's street cars, and the construction and equipping of new sub-stations. 1 During this same period, Replacements and Renewals, less salvage, are shown to be $3,057,972.46. It is the Commission's duty to accept the Company as it is and to value it on its present basis. In McCardle, et al, v. Indianapolis Water Co., 272 U. S. 400; 47 Sup. Ct. Rep. 144, Justice Butler, in delivering the opinion, said: "There is to be ascertained the value of the plant used to give the service and not the estimated cost of a different plant." </seg>

In the adoption of the method of appraisal on the basis of Te - production new less depreciation, each party has, of course, assumed a construction period during which the property will be acquired and placed in operation. The period assumed by the Company was 2% years; a period of one year was assumed by the City. The extent of </seg>
         <seg id="p174">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT this period is, of course, a matter of conjecture. The actual history of the Company shows no construction period for the system as it now exists. As above pointed out it has been a matter of organization of smaller companies, mergers and extensions with no distinct promotion period for any of them. The actual experience of a utility with re - gard to promotion expenses, that is whether or not it actually had such expense, has been given controlling weight and the fact that no promotion expenses were actually incurred has been considered good reason for denying the allowance of such expenses. Re Capital Tran - sit Co., 25 PU.R. (N.S.) 177; Los Angeles Gas &amp; Eke. Co. V: Cali - fornia R. Com., 289 U. S. 287. There are, however, other expenses which will naturally and unavoidably be incurred during any period of construction which may be assumed. This has been recognized by the City and it has submitted its estimates for such expenses. ACCOUNT 501 This account covers engineering and superintendence. As nearly as can be ascertained from the record, the City proposed 5% on most of the items based upon cost of reproduction new, less depreciation. The Company in this case criticized the method used by the City. However, the Interstate Commerce Commission in its valuation of some 121 railway properties allowed from 2 to 5% for engineering and superintendence, the average being 3.6 percent. (Engineering Valuation, Marston and Agg, 1936, p. 314; Texas Midland Railroad, Valuation Doc. No. 2, 75 I. C. C. 1, 28; Middletown &amp; U. R. Co., 125 I. C. C. 143). The Commission believes that a fair method would be to take 3. 5% of the depreciated cost in Accounts 504 to 529, and 540 to 544 inclusive. This would depreciate the cost of engineering and superintendence along with other costs and would result .in a figure of $185,530 for this account. OVERHEADS Accounts 546 to 550 include overhead costs during the construc - tion period. In the matter of overhead costs the testimony is con - flicting, and the Commission is, perforce, compelled to. exercise its discretion in arriving at a conclusion. The City recognizes in its Ex - hibit 12, that overhead costs represented by Accounts 546 to 550, in - clusive, are proper items to be included in determining the fair value of the property. It places a percentage basis on each of the items as follows: Account 546—Law expenditures during construction__l.s% Account 547—Interest during construction 4.0% Account 548—Injuries, damages during construction__o.s% Account 549—Taxes during construction 1.5% Account 550—Miscellaneous during construction 2.5% TOTAL _ .10.0% </seg>
         <seg id="p175">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION ¦ To determine the amount of such overhead costs as a part of the fair value of the property as of January 1, 1939, such (City) per - centage of 10% would be applied to the reproduction cost new less depreciation of $8,461,923, which produces the sum of $846,192. The Company, on the other hand, computes these overhead costs on an estimated experienced cost basis without using the percentage basis. Company shows a total of $2,206,207 amounting to 23.67% of its Reproduction Cost less Depreciation. The percentage basis having been used practically throughout the valuation, the Commission finds the percentage basis of overhead costs in consonance with the entire proceedings. From a study of reported cases it was found that an average allowance of 10.88% was made for general overheads. The Commission is of the opinion that allowance of 12% for these over - heads would be fair and reasonable under the facts and circumstances in this case. This would result in a figure of $1,015,431 for the total of the overhead costs included in the accounts an question. WORKING CAPITAL—CASH, I MATERIAL AND SUPPLIES These allowances were omitted by the City but there is no just reason for their exclusion. The Company claims $137,077 for mate - rial and supplies, which the Commission believes is a fair figure and should be allowed. The Company also claims an allowance of $185,125 for cash working capital. This is based upon what cash it is estimated would be necessary to carry on operations for a month. Inasmuch as the Company would be taking in money from the first day of its op - erations there would appear to be no reason why it should be appre - hended, that so large an amount of cash working capital would be re - quired. An allowance of one-half of that amount or $93,592 should be allowed for this item. '¦' 7 !.'.';¦ I;;'' ' '.'¦' 7' . ' Z\ j J GOING VALUE ilt is the theory of the Company that the value of its property, used and useful, as computed upon unit costs and as depreciated by observation of its condition, does not in and of itself reflect the fair value of the system as a system; that such value is merely what is termed a "bare bones" value; that there should be added to the same a "going concern value" reflecting the additional value of the prop - erty as a living entity. There is no quarrel with the general principle invoked by the Company. (Dei Moines Gat Co. v. Dei Moines, 238 U, S. 163; Denver v. Denver Union Water Co., 246 U. S. 178; Gal - veston Electric Co. v.

         <seg id="p176">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT the various counties. Ch. 77, Art. 8, Comp. Stat. 1929. This tax was sustained as a tax upon "corporate excess" value by the decision of a three-judge statutory court in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska, sitting at Lincoln, Nebraska. Western Union Telegraph Company vs. Weaver, et al, Eg. No. 301, Opinion by Gardner, J., filed Dec. 1, 1932. The Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Los An - geles Gas and Electric Corporation vs. Railroad Commission of Cali - fornia, 289 -\ S- 887, declared it to be self-evident "that there is an element of value in an assembled and established plant doing business and earning money over one not thus advanced, and that this element of value is "a property right" which should be considered "in de - termining the vaue of the property upon which the owner has a right to make a fair return." In Yonkers Railroad Company v. Public Service Commission of New York, 242 App. Div. 319, 274 N. Y. Supp. 535, one of the most recent cases dealing with this precise question, the Court in reversing the Commission for failure to include going value, said: "The Commission refused to allow any going concern value giving as a reason that street railways, except in large cities, were fast losing ground, and lines were being aband - oned, and buses were taking their places. This was beyond the power of the Commission to decide; their function was to determine whether or not the company was receiving a fair return upon the property actually devoted to public use under the decisions of the United States Supreme Court in Dcs Moines Gas Co. v.

Ct. 144, an amount for going concern value should be included in the rate base, but that the amount should reflect the good judgment of the regulatory commission based upon all the facts and evidence." . . . "The difficuty in determining the going value will not justify the disregarding of it. Rate making is difficult, but will not justify confiscation; the difficulty, however, will lies - sen, as it does in most cases, when we cease to think about the subject vaguely. It takes time to put a new enterprise of any magnitude on its feet after construction has been finished, mistakes of construction have to be corrected, sub-' stitutions have to be made, economies have to be instituted, experiments have to be made, which sometimes turn out to </seg>
         <seg id="p177">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION be useless, and organization has to be perfected. None of these things are reflected in the value of the physical prop - erty.

Supp. 662." Z .;'-' In the case of Re Platte County Independent Telephone Co., Ap - plication 4575, 15th Annual Report, Nebraska State Railway Com - mission, pg. 294, this Commission, in considering going value, said: "One element of going value is that the plant is com - pleted, its units working together in a coherent whole, func - tioning for the purposes for which the property was con - structed. The value of the property as thus co-ordinated, is greater than the value where each of the parts is considered in a sense unrelated to any other part." In Springfield Gas _. Electric Co. v. Public Service Commission of Missouri, et al., 10 Fed. (2d) 252, 255, the Court held as follows: "Adverting, therefore, to the facts in the case, the testi - mony not only predominated, biit was practically one way, that the fair present value of plaintiff's property, used and useful in the public service on December 31, 1922, was $1,273,230. This includes an item of going value in the sum of $117,949. The parties in like manner are in agreement that some sum should be allowed for going value. Dcs Moines Gas Co. v.

Upon the testimony, the court must accept plaintiff's claim as reasonable and proper." While the Company has not been able to earn enough to pay dividends upon its stocks, still it has met its taxes and fixed charges and paid all of its operating expenses, including the wages of its em - ployees, an the Commission is of opinion that it is entitled to be re - garded as a going concern. The amount, however, to be assigned as its "going concern value" is quite debatable. The City did not treat this item of Going Value in its reply brief. It seems highly theoretical to assume a period in excess of 7 years during which the Company would start from scratch without any customers and build up to its present carrying capacity after a series of annual losses. This theory has been condemned by the Supreme Court of the United States. Galveston Electric Co. ys. Galveston, 258 U. S. 388; Los Angeles Gas &amp; fclectric Co. v.. Cali - fornia R- Com., 289 U. S. 287. On Page 291 of the Company's brief a tabulation is presented of twenty cases before Commissions and Courts involving street railways in which "going concern value" has been allowed and an average fig - ure for the twenty is 9.16%. It may be contended that a Company which is able only to earn its operating expenses and fixed charges and is not paying dividends is not to be regarded as in average con - dition. The Commission believes that circumstances which make up the present economic situation must be given some weight. Omaha is in the heart of the great agricultural west which has been suffering from drought and depression for a considerable period of years. The defendant Company has served that portion of the population of Omaha which does not own automobiles and at a cost less than the ownership and operation of an automobile would entail. It has paid wages to its employees and has paid interest to those who have in - vested in its bonds. Nothing derogatory to its management has been shown in the record and it is only fair to the City to say that no issue was made on that subject. It is a fair assumption that this Company will prosper as prosperity returns and that with increasing prosperity it will be able to pay dividends to its stockholders. The Company claims some $1,400,000 for going concern value. This appears to be too high. The Commission is of the opinion, however, that if a figure, based upon 9.16% of the depreciated cost of the tangible property including engineering and superintendence, of the Company, or $775,112 be assigned, that this will be a fair appraisal of going value of the Com - pany. </seg>
         <seg id="p179">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION SUMMARY OF VALUES Conclusions as to valuation as shown heretofore result in the following: Tangible Property $8,276,393 Allowance for Engineering; Acct. 501 185,530 Intangibles included in Accts. 546 to 550 inclusive 1,015,431 Cash Working Capital 93.592 Material and Supplies 137,077 Going Concern Value . 775,112 TOTAL $10,483,135 which the Commission finds to be the fair value of the property used and useful in the.service of transportation as of January Ist, 1939. RETURN ON INVESTMENT Having thus determined the value of the Company's property the next step would naturally be to determine what rate of return should be permitted • upon that property. The order of this Commission pre - viously fixed the rate of return at 7%. It might well be contended that this rate of return should-be,modified, in view of the lower in - terest rates which are being demanded by investors at the present time. However, it is obvious that the question is entirely moot. There appears to he no reason, therefore, for going into this matter or to discuss the same further than to say that the annual average, com - puted over a ten year period from 1928 to 1938, inclusive, excluding the year 1935, shows a total income of $2,415,385 and total operating expenses, including taxes, of $2,042,007 or earnings before fixed charges of $373,378; This amounts to 3.56% upon a rate base of $10,483,135. In 1935 the Company experienced labor trouble and that year has been eliminated from consideration as not being representa - tive of normal operations. For the year 1938 the Company had a total income of. $2,121,546, .and total operating expenses, including taxes, of $&#132;975,057, or earnings before fixed charges of $146,489, amount - ing to 1.40% upon said rate base. ,'; . The previous order of the Commission will not be disturbed, not because it necessarily would be followed at the present time but be - cause there is no reasonable likelihood of the matter becoming mate - rial in the immediate future. This matter is closely related to the reduction of fares and will be further discussed in connection there - with. . ¦ ¦'-.' " </seg>
         <seg id="p180">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT C REDUCTION OF FARES It is a matter of common knowledge that mass transportation companies have been going through a difficult period. The respond - ent Company is faced not only with competition from taxicabs in its most profitable field, to-wit: the short haul field, but it also has a relentless competitor in the private passenger automobile. This com - petition may not be so keenly felt in larger cities where traffic diffi - culties and parking problems tend to eliminate some of the competition which is found in the smaller cities. However, the automotive indus - ¦ . . -¦ i try has been one of remarkable development. Mass production jhas resulted in putting on the market a product which has increased in quality and decreased in price. It is hard to find the family even amongst those earning only moderate wages which does not possess an automobile. Automobiles are sold largely upon an installment pay - ment plan of financing and an increasing number of owners are trad - ing in their cars after a short period of use to avoid depreciation. Thus not only new cars but second hand cars are increasing in number. Those using the street cars and other forms of mass transportation are largely confined to those who are compelled to do so by reason of not being able to afford the purchase and upkeep of a private car. While it .would be highly desirable, of course, to favor these "necessity" riders with a reduction in the cost of their transportation, it must be remembered that every reduction in operating revenues must be compensated by an increase in the number of revenue [pas - sengers sufficient to offset the loss to the Company. The Company's operating revenue at the present time barely covers fixed charges. There has been no evidence presented to this Commission which would justify it in assuming that a sufficient gain in revenue passengers would offset the loss caused by a reduction in fares. An exhibit pre - sented by the Company (Exhibit D-65), shows what would be the result of prescribing a 5c fare. Starting with the present number of revenue passengers carried, 25,025,455, and the gross revenue in. dollars, $2,097,373.19, produced therefrom, the exhibit then proceeds to ascertain how many additional passengers on a 5c fare basis would have to be carried to produce the same amont of dollars, and such increased number of passengers is shown to be 16,922,010 or an in - crease of 67.62% in revenue passengers carried and to make up the new and additional expense, added equipment, labor, etc., necessarily incurred in handling the 16,922,010 of added passengers, would re - quire further additional riders to the extent of 11,671,283. The Company's Exhibit D-65, carried forward its estimates, but with a reduction of 10% in the accumulated operating cost per mile, and demonstrated that, on a five cent fare, for the Company to ac - complish the same 1938 gross income (before fixed charges) it would </seg>
         <seg id="p181">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION have to transport 68,000,000 revenue passengers per year, or an in - crease of 43,000,000 passengers over the 25,000,000 passengers car - ried in 1938. This would be an increase of 172% in riding, and would represent approximately 309 rides per capita in comparison to the Company's 1938 per capita rides of 113, and this increase, in a City of Omaha's population, is obviously beyond! the realm of possibility. Company's Exhibit D-66 demonstrated a generally like effect of a six and one quarter cent fare, as indicated above concerning a five cent fare, but in somewhat lessened.proportions, the six and one quar - ter cent fare requiring a 44,000,000 increase in revenue passengers to balance the Company's 1938 experience on an eight and one-third - cent fare. . . ¦ Z Thfe effect of any intermediate fare between a six and one quar - ter cent..are and the existing eight and one-third cent fare was orally demonstrated to be in general inverse proportion to the effect of a five cent fare and a six and one quarter cent fare, as above indicated- It: is apparent that the present fares are transporting the pas - sengers riding the street cars at barely the cost of transportation, plus taxes and fixed charges, with nothing for return on the investment. While lower fares would undoubtedly benefit the passengers it is apparent that the Company could not be expected to provide trans - portation at any less than it is now charging. ¦ '¦.( "' "' ¦ 7 ¦'.'•'¦: . -;''..'".'' . ' ¦¦.:¦ .._¦ Z. The matter of reduction in fares and return on investment would seem to go along side by side. If and when the Company shows in - creased revenue and ability to pay an adequate rate of return upon its investment, it will then be an appropriate time to consider the matters, both of reduction of fares and fair return, and until such time the present order of the Commission with regard to rates of charges for fares should not be disturbed. 7.!".•/"".¦¦¦¦• '¦¦' 'v.' -\"Z -: '. -..

         <seg id="p183">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION COMMISSIONERS CONCURRING: (Signed) Will M. Maupin (Signed) Duane T. Swanson COMMISSIONER DISSENTING: :-'(Signed) F. A. Good BY GOOD, COMMISSIONER, DISSENTING: I am unable to concur with my colleagues in their Findings and Order in this matter. The principal basis of my disagreed ent is that in arriving at the fair value of the property used and useful, the ma - jority has failed to give due weight to the items making up deprecia - tion. Ido not object so much to the rule they have followed in ar - riving at the fair value of the property, but in the application of the rule, I cannot agree. To be specific, little, if any, weight is. given to the obsolescence of the ComPany's property or to the fact that street cars and street car systems are rapidly being superseded by street buses. The majority does make mention that some obsolescence exists as to street cars but as a matter of fact passes over that item quite lightly, assigning a condition percent of 61% to the street cars. It will be obvious that very little, if any, of the depreciation assigned to these street cars could be called obsolescence or supersession when it is realized that the average age of the cars is somewhere between 22 and 27 years of service which, on a 4% depreciation would elim - inate practically all value as of this date. This fact is further evi - denced by the testimony which, indicates that such cars as have been disposed of by reason of their replacement by buses or loss of busi - ness have either been burned because there was no market for them or dismantled and sold as junk at a figure somewhere around $90 to $120 per car, but it appears obvious to me that the rapid replacement of street car systems by. bus transportation because of economy, ef - ficiency, speed and comfort of the buses, renders a street car system obsolete to a far greater extent than that evidenced by the percent condition allowed by the majority of the Commission. This is further borne out by the fact that in the past two years, approximately 67 American cities operating rail and bus.service has been supplanted by 100% bus service. The fact that street cars are considered obsolete, is borne out by the fact that the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Rail - way Company is and has been for the past several years increasing its bus mileage; that no hew tracks have been laid for a considerable number of years; that where streets have been torn up to be rebuilt invariably the tracks have-not been replaced: but a bus service has been substituted for tram service and all extensions of transportation which have been made to outlying districts, which are being built up in Omaha and its environs, are served by buses. It is a matter of </seg>
         <seg id="p184">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT common knowledge that no street railway tracks are being laid in any city in the United States nor has any such tracks been laid for a good number of years. The testimony of the Company's witness, Frank Hudson, its As - sistant General Manager, bears out this contention that the system is obsolete, (Tr. pg. 1429). Mr. Hudson, in answering questions with reference to the disposition of street cars which are not now in service and which were replaced by buses, testified that the street cars were in most instances burned up and that they had "become obsolete as far as we were concerned." The same degree of obsolescence and supersession to be applied te street cars should be applied, and in the same proportion to the tracks, ties, ballast, trolley wires, poles, stays and to the several sub - stations, signal systems, under-ground conduits, and to all other items incident and essential to the operation of a tram system. I do not, of course, contend that the system should be given no value because of this obsolescence and supersession, but I do say that very material weight should be given to it in the item of depreciation and that the obsolescence evidenced at the present time would be more rapidly accumulative in subsequent years. All of this very materially lessens the value of the property. This is strongly evidenced by the market value of the bonds of the company as of this date. The majority opinion stresses the fact that the market value of the Company's stocks and bonds and the record of the assessed value of the Company's property, is useful for comparative purposes, but may not be given controlling weight. Let us compare the market value of the securities of the Company with the figure arrived at by the majority .as the fair value. The average market value of the outstanding bonds for the year 1938 was $65.17 and for the purpose of evidence that figure was adopted by stipulation of all parties, (Tr. pg. 27), making a total of the outstanding bond securities in the amount of $3,178,992.60. Inasmuch as stocks are no more listed when their value is less than 25c per share and they have not been listed for years, I hesitate to place other than a nominal value thereon. However, adding to the bond value a something for a possible or prospective value of the stock, which at the moment is not quoted at any market value, the sum of $121,007.40, we arrive at a total of $3,300,000. This chal - lenges the figure of $10,483,135. placed as a value by the majority of the Commission. I contend that the present market value of the securities would compare more favorably with the fair value of the property had the majority of the Commission given reasonable weight to obsolescence and supersession. The same comparison can be made on the tax assessment of the Company's properties which, in 1939 the Company contended was $3,500,000, but it was revised by the Board of Equalization to a figure of $4,500,000. No doubt the Board of </seg>
         <seg id="p185">I NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION •--•'' Z- !--.-' Z '.- Equalization gave due weight to obsolescence and supersession or it would not have arrived at such a low figure. I am not entirely in accord with the statement of the majority of the Commission that the assessment for taxation purposes can be used only as a comparison. It is a sworn statement by the Company of what it regards its assets to be. While it may not be controlling, it does bear out the fact that the Company's properties are notably but a fraction of the value of the majority opinion would indicate because of obsolescence and supersession. Of much stronger effect is the case of State, ex rel Public Ser - vice Commission vs. Southern Pacific Company,' et al, — Utah — 79 P. (2nd) 25, 24 P. U. R. (N. S.) 305, which clearly indicates the trends of courts and commissions toward a refusal to recognize one principle for valuation for rate making purposes and another almost ! opposite theory for taxation purposes, both of which operate to the benefit of the.Company and the detriment of the public when ap - plied. The common sense principle applied to every day life that "You can't have your cake and eat it", should be applied to utilities. | If the properties of the Company are worth a certain amount when the Company is attempting to urge a low basis for taxation, it should not be. heard in a rate case to deny that which it so eloquently urged when it was beneficial to it to have a low valuation. GOING CONCERN The majority opinion quotes at some length from Commission and court decisions to-buttress their allowance for going concern value. The Company claimed an amount of $1,400,000 for this item and the majority of the Commission set the amount at $775,112. which is 55.36% of the amount claimed. Going concern value is intangible, is difficult of definition and is very often confused with good will and is an effort on behalf of the utility to recoup past losses. At best it is nebulous and if a percentage is allowed it is arrived at by reaching into the air and grasping some percentage that cannot be borne out by any substantial evidence. The general custom in appraising a ( utility is for the regulatory body to conclude that the going concern value is included in the reproduction cost figure which is arrived at and that the appraisal was made on such a basis. Courts have in - variably sustained Commissions findings where such a-recitation is made without requiring a definite showing as to where the going con - cern value is. But my conception of going concern value leaves no room for any question of it in this case. Mr. Chief Justice Hughes, in Los Angeles .'.*; Electric Corporation vs. Railroad Commission of California, 289 U. S. 287, ih dealing with this question of going value .-' says: ¦.';-"¦¦"¦.'¦•; •: ¦'•'¦: ¦:¦"¦ ¦¦•.';:.¦: ..- _"•¦;"¦' -Z • . </seg>
         <seg id="p186">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT "This court has declared it to be self evident 'that there is an element of value in an assembled and established plant doing business and earning money over one not thus far ad- ¦ vanced' and that this element of value is 'a property right that should be considered' in determining the value of the property upon which the owner has a right to make a fair return." (Underscoring my own) The very contention of the Company in all of its testimony is that it is not earning money but, as a matter of fact, losing money. The testimony indicates an estimated loss for 1939. of $170,719.69, (see Exhibit D-12), according to the Company's own witness. When a patron of water, gas or electric or telephone utility pro - cures service he does it ordinarily by signing a contract. The utility . then proceeds to lay mains or builds its wires to his house in order to serve him. This being done the service is available at all times and at least fot a definite period of time is contracted for by the patrons j and ordinarily is used in perpetuity. It is like Tennyson's brook, —it "goes on and on forever". Nothing like that gives going concern to any mass transportation system because the unfettered prospect may walk, ride a bicycle, thumb a ride or drive his automobile and. in no sense is he obligated to use the .service. It is, therefore, my conclusion that based upon the court decision cited above, which has been ap - proved many times, that no going concern value should be allowed in the face of the fact that the Company is and will continue to lose money according to its own presentation if it continues on the basis as is. WORKING CAPITAL Available cash with which to meet current requirements is es - sential to the conduct of any public utility. A water company,'gas, electric or telephone company usually collects at monthly • intervals after the service has been rendered. The reverse, however, is true as to street car companies. Here the patron pays for the sertice before he rides the cars or buses and in most instances buys tokens for ad - vance rides. It is notable, also, that many thousands of tokens are lost or never used. In view of these facts, the amount of cash nec - essary as working capita] can be reduced to a nominal amount and something like $20,000 in lieu of the $93,592 allowed for this item by the majority. OVERHEADS None of the items listed as overheads which amount to 10% of the figure set as the physical value of the properties of the Company are established by any documentary evidence whatsoever and are but </seg>

         <seg id="p188">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT It is further testified to that Omaha is about 3% miles wide and 11 miles long, hence very difficult to serve. It is notable that many large cities are builded paralleling rivers or lakes. This tends to pre - vent sprawling of the cities' development, they cannot sprawl over a river or lake. The testimony that grades are extraordinary in Omaha, (Exhibits X, V, and Z), is evidence that other cities, some with lower fares, have much heavier grades for mass transportation to negotiate. The climatic rigors of Omaha are notably temperate, as compared with Edmonton, Alberta, with a 5c fare, Quebec with a 6% fare, Calgary and Duluth each with a 7%c fare. Ice and snow are not unknown to the dwellers thereabout. The City of New York, bounded on both sides by water, is approximately 20 miles long by 2 miles in width, yet the transportation fare is sc. OFFICERS' SALARIES Exhibit D-13 indicates officers' salaries for a 20 year period, i.e. 1919-1938. For the period officers' salaries, for the average per revenue passenger is given as .00089, and for 1938 as .00128. During the 20 year period the average of revenue passengers carried was 40,110,365. During 1938 the number of revenue passengers carried was 25,025,454. An analysis of these statistics indicates that from the period (20 year) average revenue passengers, the passengers car - ried for the year 1938 was reduced 37.6% and amount paid over same period for officers' salaries was increase. 43.8%. I note that al - though the amount of officers' salaries estimated on each passenger carried appears to be negligible yet it is axiomatic that anything mul - tiplied by 25 or 40 million grows to an imposing figure. SUMMARY It appears to be a matter of general knowledge, that for many obvious reasons street railway systems are being rapidly superseded by motor bus operation. The inventory of the Company, supplement - ed with the majority finding of this Commission, indicates an at - tained fair value easily twice as much an investment as would be necessitated if an 100 per cent modern bus system might be inaugur - ated. However, despite such evidence as could be presented, as com - petent proof of this allegation, the fact remains that the application did not ask the Commission to order such substitution, but the Com - mission should give due and warranted weight in its findings of value to the items of bus operation as it relates to civic welfare such as economy of operation, safety and comfort of passengers, speedier transportation, and clearance of city streets of rails and trolley sys - tem. These items, also market and assessed value, appear to have </seg>
         <seg id="p189">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION been quite ignored in the over ten million of antiquated value as now established. This largely neutralizes an immediate lowering of the existing high fare of 8 1/3 cents. For these reasons held by me to be substantial, I hereby dissent from the findings and order of the majority of this Commission. (Signed) F. A. Good Commissioner. </seg>

A resume of the Commission's activities dur - ing the previous years is contained in our previous Annual Reports. The legislature, in its 1939 Session,. adopted certain amendments to the Motor Carrier Act, which more clearly outline the Commission's jurisdiction, and also, definitely provided for exemptions -relative to the transportation of livestock and farm commodities'by motor ve - hicle. These exemptions resulted in somewhat of a curtailment of the number of carriers who were subject to regulation by the Com - mission. The curtailment, however, was unimportant because the Vast majority of motor carriers operating in the transportation of prop - erty on a for-hire basis did not in any sense.confine their operations to what may be termed as "the transportation of agricuTtufaFcbmmo - dities;" consequently, the Commission retained jurisdiction over at least a portion of their operations sufficient to compel them to com - ply with the provisions of the Act relating to Insurance coverage, annual fees and certificates of operation. During the year 1940, approximately 4700 motor vehicle units were registered with the Commission by the various motor carriers operating under the Commission's jurisdiction in the transportation of property, and passengers, on a for-hire basis. Of this number, 4100 units were registered ]?y property carriers, and approximately 600 by passenger carriers. Also, during the year 1940, 257 new, or supplemental, applications were filed. The vast majority of-these applications requiring hearings, which in .most cases were. conducted by an examiner of the. Motor Transportation Department. The continuation by the Commission of regulation of motor car - riers, which is a comparatively new industry, presents many and diverse problems. In certain cases the Commission is unable to pro - ceed because of restrictions contained in the statutes, and in others, </seg>
         <seg id="p199">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION the Commission is unabe to act because of omissions. With each suc - ceeding year the Commission is, through investigations and public hearing., creating a stable industry in the motor carrier field. In no instance is competition unduly restricted, and in no case is the public deprived of adequate service by motor carrier either in the transpor - tation of property or passengers. ) The Enforcement Division of the Motor Transportation Depart - ment continued its very active policing of the.Act and rules and regu - lations of the Commission during 1940. Prosecutions for violations increased due to the fact that the violations were found to be deliber - ate, whereas in previous years there were considerable unintentional violations because of ignorance on the part of motor truck owners within the state. One of the more important cases under the/Motor Carrier Act was The State of Nebraska, ex rel. Walter R. Johnson, Attorney General; and Louis A. Holmes, County Attorney of Hall County, Plaintiff vs. The Donald Company, a Corporation, John A. Donald, President; Lawrence H. Donald, First Vice President; Carl V. Willard, Second Vice President; Robert C. Donald, Secretary; and Bruce Donald, Treasurer, Defendants. The action was instigated as a result of an investigation by the Enforcement Division of the Com - mission. The case is set forth on page number 254 of this report. In addition to the above-mentioned case, which was a petition for a temporary and permanent injunction; the Donald Company was fined $700.00 and costs in a criminal proceeding for violation of the Motor Carrier Act and rules and regulations of the Commission rela - tive to the prescription of rates for the transportation of property by common motor carriers. Five of these motor carriers were also fined $15.00 and costs each in connection with the same violation. It was possible during the year to increase the staff of inspectors by the addition of one new inspector, and it is the intention, and the hope, funds permitting, to make at least one or two further additions to the Enforcement Division in the immediate future. 'During 1940 the regulation of the motor carrier industry con - tinued to require a considerable amount of the Commission's time. In. a large number of cases-exceptions were taken by interested par - ties to the examiner's report and recommendation on applications that' had been-referred to the Motor Transportation Department for hearing. The Commission progressed during this time, and while conscious of the fact that numerous problems will be presented in the future, it appears that the preliminary ground work in the regulation of the motor carrier industry in Nebraska intrastate commerce has been successfully completed". </seg>

         <seg id="p236">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT BEFORE THE NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION In the Matter of the Application of H. ) Ray Pool, dba Pool's Transfer of Gib- ) bon, Nebraska, to establish vested rights ) APPLICATION NO. M-3701 as of April 1, 1936, to operate as a ) CERTIFICATE NO. 2892 motor carrier of property for hire up- ) on the highways of Nebraska. ) OPINION AND FINDINGS BY THE COMMISSION: By application filed October 13, 1936, the applicant, H. Ray Pool, dba Pool's Transfer, Gibbon, Nebraska, sought a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing motor carrier operations as a common carrier of commodities generally over regular and ir - regular routes in Nebraska intrastate commerce- The application came on for hearing before an examiner at Kear - ney, Nebraska on September 27, 1937, and a report recommending that the application be granted was subsequently filed by the exam - iner on October 18, 1937. Before the report of the examiner was submitted to the Commission for consideration, objections were re - ceived to the report of the examiner and the application was reset for hearing at Kearney, Nebraska on January 20, 1938. The application was filed under the "Grandfather Clause*' of the Nebraska Motor Carrier Act (L- B. No. 178, 1937 Legislature,) which empowered the Commission to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity authorizing the same motor carrier operations that the applicant was enjoying on April 1, 1936, and continuously to date of hearing. This particular application was complicated by the fact that the applicant. the said ,H. Ray Pool, was relying upon the rights of Martin Christen - sen and Dennis F. Walsh, dba C. &amp; W. Transfer of Chappell, Nebraska, his predecessor in interest, for a portion of the operations requested in his application. At the first hearing before the examiner, where no objections were entered, some evidence of operation as of April 1, 1936 of the C &amp; W. Transfer was presented, and consequently, the examiner recommended that the entire application be granted. At the second hearing on January 20, 1938, a more comprehensive examination was made by the examiner, and contradictory evidence in opposition to that portion of the application which necessarily depended upon the operation of the C. &amp; W. Transfer was presented by persons repre - senting competing motor carriers. As a result of this hearing, a more complete report was filed with the Commission- The second examiner's report on this application filed with the Commission on January 28. </seg>
         <seg id="p237">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 1938, recommended that the portion of the application which requested regular route operations as a common carrier by motor vehicle be - tween Omaha and Grand Island, Nebraska on U. S. Highway No. 30 and between North Platte and Scottsbluff, Nebraska via U. S. High - way No. 30 and Nebraska Highway No, 29, be denied. For this por - tion the examiner found that the applicant was unable to present evidence which showed proof of continuous operations either on his own part, or together with the operations of his predecessor, the C. &amp; W. Transfer of Chappell, Nebraska, from April 1, 1936 to the time of the first hearing on the application on September 27, 1937. The application was approved by the Commission on June 3, 1938 in accordance with the examiner's second report. A certificate of public convenience and necessity was prepared authorizing the opera - tions found by the examiner to be those which the evidence disclosed had been continuous from April 1, 1936 to' September, 1937, including those of the applicant together with those of his predecessor in in - terest, the C &amp; W. Transfer of Chappell, Nebraska. However, be - cause the applicant, the said H. Ray Pool, had not complied with the rules and regulations of the Commission adopted under General Order No. 73 of the Commission relating to insurance for motor carriers, the certificate was not forwarded to the applicant until March of 1939. During April of 1939 evidence was obtained by an enforce - ment inspector of the Commission that the applicant was not con - ducting his motor carrier operations according to the terms of the certificate of public convenience and necessity issued to him by the Commission and a criminal complaint was filed, resulting in arrest and conviction. On May 12, 1939 a petition for reopening and for rehearing on the application was filed by counsel for the applicant. This petition was granted by the Commission, and the original application was set for hearing before the Commission on June 8, 1939 at Lincoln, Ne - braska. The hearing could not be completed on this date, and it was necessary in order for the applicant and protestants to present their evidence to continue the hearing until June 16, 1939, after which, the attorneys for the applicant and protestants were permitted by the Commission to file briefs and same were received and considered by the Commission. At this point it might be well to consider the evidence offered by the applicant in support of his application. There is apparently no real conflict with reference to the applicant's "Grandfather Rights" with the exception of the operations between Omaha and Grand Island, Nebraska on U.S. Highway No. 30 and between North Platte and Scottsbluff, Nebraska on U. S. Highway No. 30 and Nebraska High - -7 way No. 29. Consequently, this opinion will be confined to this por - </seg>
         <seg id="p238">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT tion wherein the evidence and testimony is conflicting. The applicant first relies upon the contention that he is entitled to authorization to conduct motor carrier operations between the Nebraska points men - tioned because his own operations were being conducted over these routes on April 1, 1936, and have been continuous since that time. Second, the applicant contends in effect that if his own motor car - rier operations were not sufficient to qualify under the "Grandfather Clause," then he is entitled to these rights by virtue of earlier opera - tions of the C. &amp; W. Transfer, his predecessor in interest and to whose rights he would succeed. In the consideration of the first contention the evidence pre - sented at the hearings reveals that on April 1, 1936 the applicant was engaged in the transportation of livestock into the City of Omaha, Nebraska, and that it was only infrequently that any commodities of a general nature were transported in his motor vehicles. In the transportation of general commodities neither the evidence before the examiner nor the evidence presented at a later hearing before the Commission was sufficiently substantial to warrant a finding by this Commission that the applicant was in truth, and in fact, a com - mon carrier of general commodities over the routes that are at present in conflict. The evidence offered by the protestants, the competing carriers, to the general effect that this applicant was unknown in the City of Omaha, Nebraska as a carrier of general commodities is much more substantial. There is evidence in the record that the applicant had no terminal facilities in Omaha, Nebraska during the spring and summer of 1936; nor did the applicant have any listings in the trade journals or directories which would advertise to the general public that he was a carrier between the points and over the territory that is now in conflict. No documentary evidence was offered to prove his operations, and the applicant's own testimony was to the effect that he did not operate beyond North Platte, Nebraska, therefore, that portion of the routes in conflict need not be further discussed. The second contention of the applicant is likewise not substan - tiated by the evidence presented- The operations of Martin Chris - tenson and Dennis F. Walsh, dba C. &amp; W. Transfer, Chappell, Ne - braska, are somewhat confusing. The freight bills and shipping orders prior to the time a transfer was effected to the applicant are very limited in number. They do not show movements of property as a common carrier to all the points in conflict for the period of time commencing April 1. 1936 and terminating approximately November 13, 1936, at which time H. Ray Pool took over their operating rights. The evidence, which was confined to testimony of the applicant and Martin Christenson, is not sufficient to sustain a finding that the combined operations of the applicant and the C. &amp; W. Transfer are such to justify operating rights as a "Grandfather Carrier" over this </seg>
         <seg id="p239">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION territory. -It might also be added that with reference to this second contention, the evidence presented by the protestants showing a com - plete cessation and abandonment of operations by the C. &amp; W. Trans - fer before the execution of the transfer application is quite substantial and in many instances uncontradicted. The operative rights, if any, of the C. &amp; W. Transfer were never determined by the Commission prior to the transfer of said operating rights to the applicant herein. It was, therefore, incumbent upon the applicant to also prove by satisfactory and sufficient evidence the "Grandfather Rights" of the C. &amp; W. Transfer. .'-• Counsel for the applicant in his brief argues that motor carrier regulation in the State of Nebraska is comparatively new, and that the Commission should be lenient in the application Of the Motor Car - rier Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder. This Commission fully realizes the necessity of leniency and consideration in the disposition of the applications filed under the Act, arid wherever possible leniency has been extended. How - ever, more importantly does the Commission consider the duty of administering and enforcing the mandate Of the legislature. Leniency has been extended where it was possible to do so without adversely affecting the rights of others. Where, as in this case, rights of other parties are necessarily involved it is the duty of the Commission to adhere to the provisions of law, and to the best of its ability carry out the intention of the legislature. The purpose of the legisature in the enactment of the Motor Carrier Act was, among other things, to stabilize the motor carrier industry by the prevention of unfair, com - petition. This policy is clearly outlined in Section lof the Act. For the Commission to disregard this policy and grant authorization to motor carriers to operate as common carriers over routes to which they are not legally entitled under, the Act itself would be an unlaw - ful exercise of legislative powers and tend to defeat the policy ex - pressed in the Act. ' The question of the convenience and necessity of the public re - quiring motor carrier operations of the applicant, which are involved, cannot be considered since the applicant has chosen to depend en - tirely upon his rights under the "Grandfather Clause" contained in Section 7 of the Motor Carrier Act The applicant relies solely upon the assumption that he is entitled to these rights because of contin - uous operation since April 1, 1936 to the date of his hearing on Sep - tember 27, 1937, and this alone is the issue. The.question of good faith and fitness, ability and willingness of the applicant is likewise not material. : The counsel for the applicant dwells considerably upon these points in. his brief, but the Commission </seg>
         <seg id="p240">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT does not believe they are involved in the instant case, and consequent - ly, they are not further discussed. From a careful consideration of all the evidence presented in support of this application, the Commission is of the opinion and finds that the prior order of the Commission entered June 3, 1938, approving the instant application in accordance with the examiner's report filed January 28, 1938 should continue in full force and effect, and that the evidence adduced at the hearing before the Commission fails to extend the rights granted in the previous certificate. The Commission further finds .""at the order of the Commission entered June 3, 1938, authorizing motor carrier operations as a com - mon carrier of commodities generally over the following regular and irregular routes should constitute the extent of the applicant's opera - tive rights in their entirety: Regular Route Operations; Route No. I—From Grand Island to and from North Platte, via U.

Beach was authorized, to conduct operations as a common carrier by motor vehicle of commo - dities generally for a period of one year over the following designated route: Route No. I—Omaha to Columbus on U. S. 30, serving all intermediate points. (Includes operations between Fremont and Omaha) Route No. 2—Columbus to Norfolk via U. S- 81, serving all intermediate points.

A supplemental order was entered by the Commission on Decem - ber 18, 1939 amending the prior order of the Commission and effect - ing a change in the operations outlined in Route No. 1 to include authorization to operate motor vehicles as a common carrier between Fremont and Omaha, Nebraska. The original application, which was approved by the Commission in its order of June 6, 1939, set out the agreement which had been entered into between the applicants herein, and was carefully con - sidered by the Commission. One of the most important provisions </seg>
         <seg id="p245">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION in this so-called "lease agreement" which, as previously stated, was an inherent part of the application provided that the agreement should expire at the termination of one year; and at that time, if the said D.

C Beach would be filed with the Commission. At the same time, by Commission order entered June 6, 1939, similar applications with similar agreements attached were approved by this Commission for and on behalf of the Union Transfer Company of Omaha and Kenneth Blakeman of Norfolk, Nebraska. The appli - cations were identical with the natural exception that the operating rights to be transferred were separate and distinct. On April 19, 1940, applications for a complete transfer of the operating rights involved under the agreement between Kenneth Blake - man of Norfolk and the Union Transfer Company of Omaha, Ne - braska were filed with the Commission, together with a request that a certificate of public convenience and necessity be issued to the said Kenneth Blakeman authorizing common carrier operations by motor vehicle of commodities generally in compliance with the terms and conditions of our order of June 6, 1939. This application was sub - sequently approved by the Commission on the 30th day of April, 1940; and by separate order of the Commission the operating rights involved will be transferred to Kenneth Blakeman and a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued.' The Commission, not having received a similar application with respect to the application of the Union Transfer Company of Omaha and D. C.

Under said resolution, the Commission's Rate Department was required to make an investiga - tion and report, which it did, the report having been filed on January 10th, 1938. 1 Subsequently-numerous continuances and conferences were held in an attempt to establish a rate by agreement. This failing, the matter was set for hearings for purpose of obtaining information and knowledge of the situation for the record so a fair and reasonable taxicab fare for,the City of Omaha could be established. Many complaints have been received by the Commission from different operators within Omaha, from passengers, and from quite a number of drivers, requesting that this matter be given attention. Safeway Cabs, Inc., Peoples Cab Company, Checker Cab Com - pany, and United Cab Company, Inc., were represented by counsel at the hearing held at Omaha, Nebraska, on December 13, 1939. Drivers of taxicabs and officials of the city of Omaha also testified. Ample opportunity was giyen to all interested parties to be heard. 'The Yellow Cab and Baggage Company failed to appear at that hearing. However, their position was stated in a letter to the Chair - man of the Commission, dated November 8, 1937, which was intro - duced in evidence, together with an operating statement covering the first six months of 1937, The rates therein proposed were; v-zCß^^z.-.-'' M A::zz-V; 'For.the! first 1% miles or fraction thereof :25c For each additional mile or fraction thereof ... :10c For each 6 minutes of waiting time — :-... ¦ __10c When cab is engaged for one hour or more, on an hourly basis, per hour '_'_ ¦_¦ —$2.00 </seg>

The Transportation Committee of the Omaha City Commission, in a formal statement at the hearing, said that taxicab drivers could not make a living wage under the present rate schedule and that they were in favor of a reasonable increase in fares. No. one appearing at the hearing opposed the increase. None of the operators appearing at the hearing were prepared to introduce in evidence operating statistics, but declared it their opinion that the showing made by the Yellow Cab and Baggage Com - pany, was correspondingly correct with their operation experiences. They did, however, make mention that State and Federal Social Se - curity and other Taxes, and high cost of Insurance and law suits for damages resulting from accidents would, under present conditions, add materially to the expenses. An officer of the United Cab Company, Inc., testified that their operations consist of serving colored patronage in a district of 8 to 10 blocks square in the vicinity of 24th and Lake streets. The average haul being from 3 to 6 blocks. While the proposed rates were not expressly objected to, the gist of his testimony was fo the effect that their peculiar situation should be given some consideration in the fix - ing of rates for their use. Introduced in evidence was Exhibit No. 2, being a bulletin of taxicab farefe published under date of January 1, 1939, listing ap - proximately 280 cities in the United States and Canada, and the taxi - cab fares in leffect in each of such cities- The Omaha fares are listed as 20 cents for the first 2 miles or part thereof, and 10c for each additional mile or part thereof. Although not shown in the exhibit, </seg>
         <seg id="p249">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION it is a matter of common knowledge that an identical fare is collected by Omaha taxicab companies, regardless of the number of passengers transported at one time. It is notable that in a survey of the said exhibit, at the following somewhat adjacent cities, they have the fares indicated, all of such fares being higher than collected for taxicab service in the city of Omaha. Z-. .. Lincoln, Nebraska first mile 25c Sioux City, lowa first mile 25c : Dcs Moines, lowa first two miles 35c Denver, Colorado first mile 25c and 30c Grand Island, Nebr. first 1% miles 25c Kansas City, Missouri first mile 25c ' On this exhibit are also listed the fares of Yellow Cabs operating in 76 different cities. Of all such fares, those applied by the Yellow Cab and Baggage Company of Omaha, Nebraska, are the lowest. From the testimony adduced, it was shown that under the present taxicab fares, drivers of taxicabs were receiving inadequate wages, and many of them were, at the time of the hearing, included on the relief rolls. . Owing to the lack of any operation statistics having been offered in evidence at the hearing, other than that heretofore referred to, the Commission felt the need of obtaining such data, and instructed its Chief Accountant to make the necessary investigation to obtain the same. This instruction has been complied with, and we now have before us, for consideration, the reports for each operator, as pre - pared and submitted by our Chief Accountant as exhibits in connec - toin with his testimony herein. .

         <seg id="p252">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT tion thereof, and 10 cents for each six minutes of waiting time, and J2.00 per hour for cabs engaged for one hour or more on an hourly basis, and that said rates be prescribed to become effective only after 15 days from the date of said order. The Commission having been of the opinion that the motion of the Yellow Cab and Baggage Company, for a rehearing, did not con - tain sufficient reason therefor, on March 20, 1940, entered an order overruling said motion. It did, however, in the same order, vacate and set aside the order of February 13. 1940, and set the matter for further hearing, in the Commission's Hearing Room at Lincoln, Ne - braska, on April 11, 1940, at 10:00 o'clock A. M., and all interested parties were notified. At that hearing, the Yellow Cab and Baggage Company intro - duced evidence and exhibits and offered testimony in an effort to justify the fixing of the rates and charges that they had requested to be prescribed. Their showing was based upon the analysis of trips actually made on February 15, 1940. It was contended that the date chosen, was representative of average operations, but the record is void of any convincing proof that it was. In view of the various weather, seasonal and other conditions obtaining during a year's op - erations', we are far from being convinced, that a showing based on only one day's operation experience can be representative of a full year's actual operations. They also endeavored to show that the rates requested by them, will be more desirable than those heretofore proposed by the Commission, in that any increases resulting there - from, would apply largely to long haul passengers, that is, those riding a greater distance than the first mile and one-half, that it would affect fewer passengers, and that there would be less falling off in patronage by reason of any increase in fares and charges. The Checker Cab Company was not in sympathy with the rates and charges requested by the Yellow Cab and Baggage Company, and offered no objections to the Tates previously proposed and fixed by the Commission. i The Taxicab Driver's Union, concurred in the attitude of the Checker Cab Company, and likewise did not offer any objections to the rates previously proposed by the Commission. Out of all the appearances at either the hearing held on Decem - ber 13, 1939, and the hearing held on April 11, 1940, no objections to the rates and charges heretofore proposed, other than that lodged by the Yellow Cab and Baggage Company, have been received by the Commission. Neither have any objections to said rates and charges been received from any other source. </seg>

         <seg id="p269">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION INFORMAL COMPLAINTS i\ Pending at close of year— ____ 3 Disposed of during the year.— __—;— 0 BEFORE THE NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION In the matter of the application of The ) Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Com- ) APPLICATION NO. 13935 pany for authority to discontinue tele-) phone exchange at Murdock, Nebraska. ) OPINION AND FINDINGS BY THE COMMISSION: Applicant, The Lincoln Telephone and Telegraph Coftipany, is a corporation organized and existing under, and by virtue of the Laws of the State of Delaware, qualified to transact business in the State of Nebraska. It operates a telephone system in the southeastern sec - tion of the State of Nebraska, consisting of numerous exchanges and toll lines connecting these exchanges with each other and with the exchange and toll lines of other telephone companies, and is furnish - ing telephone service by means of a dial switchboard and exchange, located in the Village of Murdock, to the subscribers located in that village and surrounding territory- .'"¦: Applicant requests this Commission to approve the discontin - uance of the exchange and dial switchboard at Murdock, Nebraska. It proposes to provide service to the present subscribers in that com - munity and vicinity by direct wires to the Elmwood exchange. - Pursuant to appropriate notice, a hearing was held, in the Com - mission's Hearing Room at Lincoln, Nebraska, on January 17, 1940. For the consideration of the Commission, there was presented a petition which had been signed by approximately 88% of the total number of subscribers of the Murdock exchange, who desir. and have requested the proposed discontinuance of the Murdock exchange, and subscribing for telephone service-from the Elmwood exchange- The said consenting subscribers are alleged to have had rental or exchange service at a date six months before the circulation of the petition. A counter petition, asking that their names be withdrawn from the petition, bearing the rames of some 30 of the petition circulated by the company, and thus reducing the number of signers to that petition to less than 60 % of the subscribers of the Murdock exchange, was also submitted to the Commission prior to the date of the Hear- </seg>
         <seg id="p270">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT:' '.-• ing. That petition requested that their names be withdrawn from the petition circulated by the company representatives, for the reason that they were not fully informed as to what effect the contemplated change would make to their service. Several of .the Murdock' sub - scribers also appeared at the Hearing in protest to the proposed dis - continuance of the Murdock exchange. It seems apparent that those protestants, appearing at the hear - ing, were convinced, upon the showing made, of the reasonableness of the company's proposed action. Introduced in evidence was an exhibit showing that the owner - ship, operation and maintenance of the dial switchboard .and exchange at Murdock, Nebraska- has in the past, resulted in a heavy financial loss to the applicant, and that a reduction of such operating losses can be effected by discontinuing exchange service at Murdock, and providing service in that community and vicinity by direct wires to the Elmwood exchange. The exchange rates now in effect at the Murdock and Eimwood exchanges are as follows; Murdock Elmwood Business one-party $3.00 $3.00 Residence one-party 2-00 1.50 Residence two-party 1.75 1.35 Business ten-party 2.25 2.25 Residence ten-party 1-75 1.75 There is now in effect, for toll service, between Murdock and Elmwood exchanges, on station-to-station calls—loc; person-to-person calls —20c, which charges will be discontinued when the Murdock subscribers are attached to the Elmwood exchange. Upon receiving service from the Elmwood exchange, the Mur - dock town subscribers will receive service under the Elmwood rates for ten-party service. There will be no change in the rates of rural subscribers. The objections to the proposed change in service appear to be premised upon the apprehension that to"o many subscribers would be attached to a single line, thus interfering with reasonable and satis - factory service. However, the proposed change will increase the zone of service, making available service to some 155 subscribers of the Elmwood exchange, and a pay station on an individual line will be installed at Murdock. In view of the testimony and evidence adduced at the Hearing, and that the continued operation of the Murdock exchange, under the present rates, will constitute confiscation of applicant's property, </seg>
         <seg id="p271">;'•¦ NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION contrary to Law, and for the further reason that from past experience, where subscribers of one exchange, after discontinuance thereof, had been attached to another exchange, has proved satisfactory, the Com - mission is of the opinion and so finds that the application for author - ity to discontinue the telephone exchange at Murdock, Nebraska, should be granted, effective April 1, 1940, and that the proposed changes in rates should take effect only if and when applicant is pre - pared to, and does, furnish the Murdock. subscribers service from its Elmwood exchange. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that application of The Lincoln Telephone and Telegraph Company, for approval to the discontinuance of the exchange and dial switchboard at Murdock, Nebraska, and to provide service from the Elmwood exchange, at the rates set forth in the Opinion and Findings herein, and by reference made a part hereof, be and the same is here - by granted, effective April 1, 1940. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the proposed changes in rates shall take effect only if and when the applicant is prepared to, and does, furnish the Murdock subscribers service from the Elmwood ex - change..:" MADEr AND ENTERED at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 13th day of March, 1940.

The Southern Nebraska Rural Public Power District states in this supplemental application, "That in the constructing of said; Rural Electrification System it was found necessary and for the best' inter - ests of the District to re-route some of said lines and to make various minor additions and extensions to, and changes in, the District's Sys - tem of Distribution Lines as originally proposed and as approved by the Commission." Z i The District, by its instant application, seeks authorization of lines constructed but not heretofore authorized and authority to oper - ate and maintain the same. Said lines are operated at a potential in excess of 700 volts and are located in Adams, Kearney, and Phelps Counties, Nebraska.

         <seg id="p308">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT time of filing of the application, and in accordance with the law and the Commission's General Order No. 72 all such parties named by applicant were notified to appear at a public hearing. Hearing on the application was set for March 8, 1939, and was re-set for April 10. 1939, upon motion of the Glenwood Telephone Company, complainant in Formal Complaint No. 826 and an interested party and objector in this application. The action in Formal Com - plaint No. 820 was instituted because of alleged inductive interfer - ence with service on complainant's telephone lines from electric.trans - mission lines included in this supplemental application. The supple - mental application of the Southern Nebraska Rural Public Power Dis - trict and Formal Complaint No. 826 were both heard by the Commis - sion on April 10, 1939. Interested parties who appeared at the hearing to offer protests to the granting of the application were, viz: Nebraska Continental Telephone Company Glenwood Telephone Company Union Telephone Company Diamond Line of Loomis Funk and Hayden Telephone Company Holdrege Line 714 Bcrtrand Telephone Company Objections of the Nebraska Continental Telephone Company were disposed of by stipulation of record by the parties. The stipulation incorporated therein the terms and conditions of an agreement by and between said Telephone Company and the applicant. The terms and conditions of the agreement are set forth in Exhibit 3 which was of - fered and received in evidence. j The objections and complaint of the Glenwood Telephone Com - pany were disposed of by the Commission's order in Formal Complaint No. 826 entered November 13, 1939, and subsequent orders therein- The protests of other interested parties were, with one exception, confined to inductive interference with telephone service. Mr. Neil Schreck, witness for the Bertrand Telephone Company, testified that his company besides experiencing inductive interference had also ex - perienced trouble due to improper construction of applicant's lines. Mr. Schreck testified as follows: I, ; - Q. The construction at this point of trouble, would you say that construction would be safe, as a matter of safety for your operators, farmers, and linemen, construction by the Southern Nebraska? </seg>
         <seg id="p309">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION * A. I would not. i Q. Are there other places where the line crosses your own lines where the construction is not what you would call the best construction from the standpoint of public safety? A. That's right '*'*¦*¦ ¦ j'.:' ' Q. Do you know of any other case of wrong construction? ." A. There are a number of their poles in my territory. I have •'..' not traveled over it all. but in my immediate territory is the same condition. **.•'.' Z '¦¦'.:¦ ¦(' '•"*'. "" 'Z ' '-' Q. You have no objection to the granting of this supplemental application? ' ZZ'l'-¦--¦ A. Only to the point I think the old construction should be put in a safe condition before a new application for the lines is granted. ' | '..'• ;"¦"! It is stated both in the specifications for the lines included in the original application (A. 12617) and in the specifications for the lines included in this supplemental application (A. 12517, Supp. 1) that the construction would "conform with the laws of Nebraska and the rules and regulations of the Nebraska State Railway Commission." Electric transmission line construction which meets the requirements of Nebraska laws and complies with the minimum requirements and conforms to the specifications which this Commission has established as its rules and regulations for electric supply and communication lines is safe construction- New electric supply lines not so constructed are improperly constructed and built contrary to law. Improper con - struction should not be permitted to continue,, but wherever found should be corrected without delay. '¦'.'. The Commission in many instances';in.order to further the ad - vancement of rural electrification in the state has permitted reason - able latitude in the original construction of rural electric projects. The Commission's orders, however, have in every instance provided that when any changes in routing or. extensions: of lines were necessary that all owners of existing communication or electric transmission lines liable to be affected by such changes or extensions be advised thereof and their consent thereto in writing be obtained prior to con - struction of the lines and that an application covering all changes and extensions be timely filed with the Commission. The Commission by its original order entered in Application No. 12517 authorized the Southern Nebraska Rural Public Power District to construct, operate, </seg>
         <seg id="p310">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT and mantain 430 miles of electric transmission line. The record shows that said Public Power District constructed 229 miles of line on routes authorized by the Commission and 146 miles of line without obtaining authority therefor from the Commission. Such extensive building of electric lines without authority certainly cannot be con - sidered a minor proposition. Applicant in constructing the ;146 miles of unauthorized lines did not obtain the written consent of all the owners of existing lines liable to be affected by the construction of its lines- The Commission does not condone such action by applicant or any other party. The rural electric lines of the Southern Nebraska Rural Public Power District unquestionably are benefiting all the customers served by said lines and indirectly the whole territory served by the District. The benefits of rural electric service, however, should not entirely overshadow harmful results to communication lines. The construc - tion of rural electric lines should be encouraged so long as the con - struction and operation of the lines will not unreasonably interfere 7 with the safety, operation, and efficiency of existing properly con- 7 structed electric transmission, telephone, and telegraph lines. Ground - ed telephone lines even though properly constructed are especially ¦'. susceptible to inductive interference from paralleling electric power lines. The amount or degree of inductive interference depends on three factors, to-wit: 1. Influence of the power line. 2i Suscepti - bility of the telephone line. 3. Coupling of the power line and the telephone line. Each inductive interference case is separate and dis - tinct due to the wide variance in attendant conditions. Mr. H. R. Huntley, American Telephone and Telegraph Company engineer, re - cently said, "Each noise situation is a specific problem." The Com - mission concurs in this statement. ' "¦' The Commission said, In Re Application No. 12783, Supplement No. 1: "The Commission does not condone the actions of the applicant 7. in the instant case in constructing lines not authorized by the Com- 'j mission which parallel grounded lines of a telephone company that j was not given an opportunity to appear and protest said construction. j! However, after construction has been wholly completed and inductive j interference results the matter may again be submitted to the Com- ;' mission by formal complaint. ¦¦'"'} "That the lines herein concerned are already constructed and ;-y the objections to the granting of the application by the . ... .. . (A) v Telephone Company should be overruled; and thalt any com- . plaint relative to interference with existing communication or elec- I trie transmission lines, therefore, should come before the Commission j in a separate proceeding - : ".':] i </seg>
         <seg id="p311">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION "That the . .... .(B) ....... v Telephone Company makes no objection to the granting of the instant application and that any complaint said company may have in respect to non-compliance with a previous order of the Commission should be submitted to the Com - mission as a complaint in the preceding matter-": In Re Application No. 12560, Supplement No. 1, the Commission said: "¦ : '¦ ¦ ¦' j ' '..¦'¦' 7 ¦"' - . » : .' ' "That the .'.. .... (C) ..-.-.- .... Telephone Company makes no objection to the granting of the instant application and that any complaint said Company may have relative to interference, inductive or otherwise, should be presented to the Commission by way of a formal complaint." In Re Formal Complaint No. 826, Glenwood Telephone Company vs. Southern Nebraska Rural Public. Power District, it was said: "There were] also objections filed by other telephone companies to the granting of the supplemental application herein above referred to (A. 12517, Supp. No. 1), but we are of the opinion that any tele - phone companies suffering undue inductive interference as a result of defendant's rural electric transmission line should file formal com - plaints as did the Glenwood, Telephone Company in this case." The record discloses that the greater part of the parallels causing inductive interference were constructed under authority granted in the original application (A. 12517). It is questionable whether or not the parallels involved in, this supplemental application are exten - sive enough in themselves to cause unreasonable interference- The Commission recognizes that inductive interference resulting from adding parallels or inductive exposures to a given telephone line is cumulative. A single inductive exposure may not cause: unreasonable telephone interference whereas the cumulative interference of several exposures with the samej telephone line may be unreasonable. The testimony of respective witnesses for the Diamond Line of Loomis, Funk and Hay den Telephone Company, and Holdrege Line 714 fails to prove that applicant's electric transmission lines covered by and included in this supplemental application are unreasonably interfer - ing with telephone service on said telephone companies' lines. The total inductive interference or result of the combined interference of all the inductive exposures may be unreasonable, but the Commis - sion is of the opinion that the evidence adduced is not sufficient to warrant the denial of this supplemental application and that any tele - phone company suffering unreasonable interference as a" result of the construction and operation of applicant's rural electric trans - mission lines should file a formal complaint as did the Glenwood Telephone Company, whereupon it could be determined if the total inductive interference from applicant's lines were unreasonable. </seg>

It is engaged in the distribution and sale of natural gas at Alma, Arapahoe, Beaver City, Brainard, Cambridge, Edison, Holbrook, Loomis, Orleans, Oxford, Ragan and Stamford, Nebraska, with its headquarters located at Oxford. This is an application for authority to issue stock in the amount of $200,000.00, and Bonds in the amount of $95,000.00, the proceeds of which are to provide for the payment and discharge of indebted - ness or obligations incurred in and/or to cover the cost of the pur - chase and reconstruction of the gas distribution system in the city of McCook, Nebraska, and the construction of gas distribution sys - tems in the towns of Bartley and Indianola, Nebraska. Upon appropriate notice a hearing was held in this matter, in the Commission's Offices at Lincoln, Nebraska, on July 10, 1940- and the testimony and evidence adduced thereat, is now available for our consideration. As relates to the increase of capital stock, applicant has given notice, pursuant to, and in accordance with Section 75-1002-1004, Chapter 75, Article 10, 1937 Cumulative Supplement to Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929- By our order in Application No. 12036. entered on March 30, 1937, and Supplemental Order thereto, entered on March 28, 1938, applicant was authorized to issue $66,000.00 of Bonds and $100,000. - -00 of Stock. Of the total amount of stock and bonds authorized there has been issued, and is now outstanding, stock in the amount of $75,000.00. At applicant's request that part of the former orders, authorizing the issuance of the Bonds and Stock in the amount of $'25,000.00 that has not been issued, should be rescinded, and final action, in respect to the Stock in amount of $200,000.00 as herein applied for, should be deferred, and continued for future hearing;, and it will be so ordered. That being the case, there is left for our immediate consideration the applied for authority to issue Bonds in the amount of $95,00000. </seg>
         <seg id="p335">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Applicant's outstanding Stock of 750 shares is closely held, there being only .8 shareholders, one having 660 shares, and another 70 shares. - It is proposed to issue the Bonds at face value, under a Trust Indenture, to be dated as of May 1, 1940, between the applicant and The First Trust Company of Lincoln. Nebraska, as Trustee. They will bear interest at the rate of 5% per annum, and be of the de - nominations of $1,000.00. numbered M-l to M-95, both inclusive, and mature according to the following schedule: ;..¦¦- ' -.' ¦¦".'.-.. ... ¦-..- ¦,':: -. :-... ;. 7 j ¦.-. ¦; M-l to M-10. due May 1, 1942, |."

It is .provided, among other things, that all of applicant's proper - ties shall be subject to the lien of this Mortgage.' and that the bonds may be redeemed, prior to maturity, by payment of premiums ranging from % of 1% to 2%, depending on the time of redemption. At May 31, 1940, applicant had Total Assets of $281,196.73, consisting of Fixed Assets (include, plant and equipment) $259,094.46; Current Assets $18,363.28 ; Deferred Assets (including undistributed costs and prepayments) $3,738.99. As of the same date applicant shows for Capital Stock Issued $75,000.00; Customers Deposits $6,839.18; Current and Accrued Liabilities $91,637.25; Reserves $97,414.34, and Earned Surplus $10, - -305.96. -¦¦¦''&#132;.'. ' The purchase and reconstruction costs of the gas distribution system in the city of McCook are included in the above statistics. They were entered on basis of "Original Cost" when properties were first devoted to public service, and the amounts thereof are claimed by applicant to approximate the values as carried by the predecessor/the Central States Electric Company. Competent witnesses testified that the properties'as stated on the balance sheet, are very conservative, on basis of present day values. Construction costs for the distribu - tion systems at Bartley and Indianola are represented as $8,149.00. These tre not reflected in the above statistics. ¦ A:Statement of Income, shows applicant's Net Income, before Dividends, from September 1, to December 31, 1936, as $2,416.23; for year 1937, $3,190.27; for 1938, $2,404.44; for 1939, $4,267.91; and for first 5 months of 1940, as $6,277.11. </seg>
         <seg id="p336">THIRTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT Experience in the natural gas business indicates that about one gas meter will be obtained for each five people of the total popula - tion of a town when saturation point has been reached, and that it takes about five years to saturate a natural gas property. The total meters now connected in McCook on manufactured gas are approximately 800. East McCook and South McCook are not now served, but will be connected with natural gas- The estimated total meters that will be connected in McCook. Indianola and Bartley by years is as follows; McCook Bartley Total Indianola End of First year 900 60 960 Added Added End of Second year 131 1031 58 118 1149 End of Third year 131 1161 58 176 1337 End of Fourth year 90 1251 41 217 1468 End of Fifth year 87 1338 39 256 1594 On the present system of the applicant company, the average gross revenue per meter for the past three years has been $79.00 per year. Since 800 meters in McCook have been on manufactured gas in the past, it is estimated that the average gross revenue per meter for the first year will be only $60.00. After that the average of $79.00 should be easily attained. The probable gross revenues are estimated as follows: First year gross revenue on 960 meters @ $60.00 —$ 57,500.00 Second year gross revenue on 1149 meters @ 79.00— 90,600.00 Third year gross revenue on 1337 meters @ 79.00— 105,500.00 Fourth year gross revenue on 1468 meters @ 79.00— 116,000.00 Fifth year gross revenue on 1594 meters @ 79.00— 125,900.00 As indicated in applicant's Financial Statement as of December 31, 1939—Total Operating Expenses which include cost of gas. labor, automobile expenses, rents, etc., constitute 74.4% of the gross reve - nue. All taxes constitute 4.2% of the gross revenue. Present interest charges (interest paid on meter deposits and borrowed money) con - stitutes 1.7% of the gross revenue for 1939. or total charges of 80.6% of the gross revenue, leaving 19.4% available for depreciation reserve, bond interest, bond payments, dividends, and surplus.

The gross revenue for the first two months of 1940 has exceeded that for the same period of 1939 by $3,201.00.

The city of McCook alone, will have nearly as many meters as the entire present system, when i saturated. The operating expenses in McCookjfor labor and other ' items should be far less than for the present system, which is scattered over three counties. Also, it is generally true, that the gross revenue , per meter per year is greater in the larger towns, as compared with j the smaller towns. Under this reasoning, the estimated revenue and income are conservative. -.;'¦,! !
