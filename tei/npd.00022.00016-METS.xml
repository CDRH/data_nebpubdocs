WINTER GAINS EXPENSIVE ill be noted that in these experiments the cost per of winter gains exceeded the market value per pound e cattle. There was a considerable money loss during inter, counting the forage at market price, and crediting ixains made. This is clearly an erroneous way of count- profit or loss of the winter operation, as the holding e cattle over from one time of cheap gains until another ar time is worth considerable The only way to Igure and loss from the cattle growers' standpoint is to figure &gt;st of wintering as against the difference between the slue of the cattle in the fall and in the spring. To ■ value of gains during the winter, the value of cattle • spring has been figured fifty cents higher than in the The financial statement on page 22 gives approximately tit on the steers used in this experiment, counting the arket values of feed and cattle. There was an unusu- heavy loss, amounting to 10 per cent of the steers. The death of three was due to accidents; the other seven died from the effects of a dose of a too virulent blackleg vaccine. ( 'ount- ing these steers as a total loss, there was a profit of *l'90.30, or routing the steers at market price at time of death, there was a profit of $470. While this profit is not large, we should remember the steers are charged a full price for everything eaten. On the ordinary farm, the cost of feed would be re - duced, because much of the feed would be of a low market value, as cornstalks, waste hav, straw, etc. </seg>
