            <seg id="p006">Fire Prevention Week Proclamation The Governor of Nebraska annually requests the observance of Fire Prevention Week throughout the state. Most fires are positively preventable. How inexcusable, then, is the per capita tax of S2.25 which we assessed against ourselves in Nebraska in 1931 as a result of our fire losses amounting to the immense total sum of §3,106, 633.00. More important still is the fact that in this state we sacrificed sixty-one lives and two hundred fourteen persons suffered painful injuries as the result of fires. This record is worse than any year since 1910 with but one exception. Moreover, 1932 seems about to exceed it since the first six months we had in this state 1,300 fires with 115 persons injured and 32 killed and a property loss of more than one and one-half millions of dollars. The most common of the numerous causes of fires as repoited by the fire chiefs of the state in 1931 were: (1) chimney sparks on roofs, (2) careless smokers, (3) defective electric wires and accessories, (4) defective chimneys, (5) overheated stoves and furnaces, (6) gasoline and kerosene stoves, (7) spontaneous combustion, (8) children and matches, (9) rubbish in besement ignited by sparks, (10) bon-fires and burning grass. It is time to stop starting fires — to begin a year-long carr.i:a tr... NOW THEREFORE, I, Charles W. Bryan, Governor of Nebraskc, do hereby designate the week of OCTOBER 9th to OCTOBER 15th as . . FIRE PREVENTION WEEK and urge that it be observed throughout the State as a week to think and act on preventing, restricting and extinguishing fires — to begin a campaign lasting throughout the year. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the Governor to be affixed, Done at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 14th Day of September, 1932, CHARLES W. BRYAN, Governor. </seg>
            <seg id="p007">DIVISION OF FIRE PREVENTION Comment by "Farm Fire Preyention", published in the interest of prevention and control of farm fires, copyrighted by Mr. James Slocum, Detroit, Michigan, is as follows: NEBRASKA LEADING IN FIRE PREVENTION The State of Nebraska is taking the lead in teaching fire prevention in the schools, giving special attention to the rural districts, that branch of the work being turned over to Miss Chloe C. "Baldridge, by Assistant State Fire Marshal L. J. Butcher. The 100-page fire prevention manual recently issued, should be in every rural school in the United States. What a wonderfuL work the State of Nebraska is doing. It is too bad that other states cannot profit by this splendid example, which would naturally result in the saving of hundred of lives and millions of dollars worth of property. Even if the work could not be made to cover the entire state, it should be made possible and directed in the rural districts where farm property and the population is spread out over a wide district, where in case of fire, so much can happen before help may be had. In some communities, fire trucks maintained in the nearby villages are available, and if the distance is not too great and too much delay is not occasioned in getting the alarm to the fire department house, much property may be saved from destruction. While the building on fire may not be saved, those adjacent usually are, where the fire truck services are available. Other letters received commenting on the manual are as follows: I am very much pleased to acknowledge receipt of two copies of the new Fire prevention manual for use in public schools, and one copy of the small pamphlet, "Rules and Regulations of the Division of Fire Prevention." I haven't had time to examine the school manual closely but in glancing through it hastily, it strikes me as being excellently prepared and arranged for schoolroom use. The persons responsible for its preparation and distribution are to be commended. With kind personal regards, Mr. J. V. Parker,. Mgr. Western Actuarial Bureau, Chicago, 111. Please accept our thanks for copy of the very excellent Fire Pre - vention Manual, a course of study for the public schools. This is very interesting and constructive, and the benefits will be manifested through the effort to instill in the mind of the youth the grave responsibility as citizens to avoid the unnecessary destruction of life and property. You </seg>
            <seg id="p008">STATE OF NEBRASKA are to be congratulated and the state commended for making funds available for the publication and distribution of this much needed book - , xr T S trUly&gt; W- R Flickin S er . Associate Mgr. Insurance Company of North America, Chicago, 111. I am pleased to acknowledge receipt of the very useful Fire Pre - vention Manual for a course of study in the public schools, prepared by Chloe C. Baldridge, Director of Rural Education, Nebraska State Department of Public Instruction. This pamphlet has been very care - fully arranged and I am sure will be of great benefit to your system of schools. With our best wishes, I beg to remain Sincerely yours T Alfred Fleming, National Board of Fire Underwriters, New York. Thanks for the Fire Prevention manual just received. You certainly deserve much praise for this work. You are giving the other fire marshals something to work on and it shows how progressive your office is. Under separate cover I am mailing you our 1932 Safety Calendar. James A. Flynn, Pres. Potter Manufacturing Corp. Chicago, 111. I have received a copy of the Fire Prevention Manual which was senv to me and by an accident the wrapper was destroyed which bore the signature of the sender. I wish you to know that this book will be of considerable help to me in my insurance classes at Northwestern University School of Commerce and if you yourself were not the gener - ous friend, will you kindly see that my best thanks are returned to him who did this kind deed. With sincere thanks to yourself, I am Wm.P. Forbush, Mgr. Underwriters Salvage Co. Chicago, 111. FIRE PREVENTION LITERATURE Through county and city superintendents of schools twenty thousand manuals on fire prevention have been placed in the hands of every public school teacher for the benefit of the pupils. They are used as a basis of the requirement that each teacher must give 30 minutes instruction each month in fire prevention and safety measures. Fire chiefs and state inspectors have made many talks in grade and high schools and have held many fire drills-. Ten thousand copies of a graphic poster showing "Thirty-five Com - mon Causes of Fire" were printed and distributed through local fire chiefs to city and village schools and have prominent places in class rooms and halls. The demand exceeded the supply and an additional ten thousand copies were printed and made available for rural schools as well. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">DIVISION OF FIRE PREVENTION Four thousand large posters along the same general line and contain - ing Governor Bryan's fire prevention proclamation were issued for public display in offices and business houses. Window cards warning about safe and lawful handling of kerosene and gasoline were printed to the number of ten thousand and are dis - played in gasoline filling stations, along with an equal number of "No Smoking" placards. As long as the supplies last copies of any of the above literature may be had for the asking. Averting the hazards of fire and the saving of life and. property are, in the judgement of this department of state government, as important as convicting and punishing fire fiends. Waste is never justifiable; it is a moral wrong and an economic crime. The underlying principles of fire prevention are best implanted in the minds of young people, before habits of life are formed. The 450 thousand pupils and fifteen thousand teachers in Nebraska's puplic schools are preparing for a better future for fire prevention. Letters of comment on the Fire Prevention Poster are as follows: Just a line to thank you for mailing me a copy of your excellent Fire Prevention Week poster. It is one of the best which has come to my attention, and I congratulate you upon it. I am sure it must have done a great deal of good. With kind personal regards, I am Richard E. Vernor, Mgr. Western Actuarial Bureau, Chicago, 111. I have received copy of your Fire Prevention Week poster and not only wish to thank you for same, but also to congratulate you upon this very effective piece of work. Chas H. Love, Comra. Dept. of Labor, Nashville, Tenn. I want to thank you for sending me your 1932 Fire Prevention Week Poster and to compliment you on it. I have seen many Fire Prevention Week posters, and think you should get a blue ribbon with this one. Presume you have sent copies to the various State Fire Marshals ?.s well as the NFPA. If not, I would suggest that you do so to show them what a real live Fire Marshal's Department Nebraska has. With kind regards, I am James A. Flynn, Pres. Potter Manufacturing Corporation. Chicago, 111. </seg>

RURAL FIRES The farm fire loss, as reported by fire chiefs in the different towns of our state, is only a small per cent of the actual fire loss in the rural districts, for only the fires where the department is called to. participate are reported to this office. -These losses are included in the total fire loss as reported by counties. Loss of buildings ....$232,097.00 Loss of contents 78,050.00 TOTAL LOSS $300,147.00 Country fires invariably result in total losses. Few of the rural communities are equiped and organized for fighting fires. More homes are destroyed by fire than by wind. Defective chimneys and flues are the cause of many great losses of farm property. Every farm should be equipped with ladders long enough to reach the highest point of any of the buildings, and buckets should be kept handy, so that in case of fiire they can be readly filled and used to extinguish the fire.

            <seg id="p021">DIVISION OF FIRE PREVENTION and hastening fires with gasoline or kerosene is the greatest sacrifice of life and property. During this depression so many farmers have had their telephones removed. This is an added menance, for how will he call the fire department, or his neighbors, in case of fire. It, there - . fore, behooves the farmer to make a rigid inspection of his premises each day, eliminating the fire causes, so that the great unnecessary fire loss may be reduced.

            <seg id="p043">DIVISION OF FIRE PREVENTION Investigations of Suspicious Fires During 1932 the Fire Marshal's office made investigations of 207 suspicious fires. Of this number investigated it was believed that 149 of these fires were, without doubt, of incendiary origin. Twenty-geven persons were arrested and charged with arson; 8 confessed, were tried, convicted and sentenced; 4 others were tried and acquitted, and 8 bound over for' trial in 1932; 7 persons were dismissed and 2 are fugitives from arrest. Of the remaining cases, up to date, no charges have been preferred, as the collecting of evidence still continues. Six of the fires investigated proved not to be of incendiary origin, but in most cases carelessness on the part of the occupant in allowing fire hazards to exist. The other fifty-two were listed as unknown or doubtful. In the investigation of these fires the utmost care was taken to avoid publicity and reflections being cast on any innocent party or parties. It is a greater satisfaction to the investigator to be able to exonerate the suspected ones than it is to bring charges of arson against them. PAXTON — Dr. H. J. O'Donnell, M. D. the man who set five fires in Paxton, and three lumber yard fires, last year, and confessed to same, was tried the second time at Ogallala in January, 1932, and the jury found him insane. Consequently, he was sent to the Hospital for insane at Hastings. COMSTOCK — Earl H.

He carried insurance on the building amount - ing to 510,000 and on contents $3,700. The insurance company paid the loss. On February 1, 1932, the insurance company was informed that this was an incendiary fire. Mr. T. W. Carroll, special agent for the insurance company, investigated- the loss. Mr. Hines was arrested and brought into court — he pleaded guilty to having burned his home for the insurance— but promised to pay back the money to the insurance com - pany and the Judge sentenced him to one year in the Penitentiary.

The owner, Frank Schunemeyer, was arrested the next day and charged with arson— released on $1,500 bond - case has not yet been tried. His neighbor, just across the road on the south side, discovered a lighted candle burning in the hay loft of his barn about an hour before the Schunemeyer barn fire. The candle when found was within an inch and a half of setting the hay on fire. Both barns would have burned at the same time. The motive for the Schunemeyer fire was a note of considerable size that became due at the bank the day of the fire — and over-insurance. The neighbor car - ried no insurance.

Preliminary hearing held May 16. County Judge dismissed the case, although a witness, Jas. A. Colgrove, swore he saw Robinson strike the matches and Colgrove also informed the chief of police at Alliance two weeks before the fire that Robinson was planning to set the fire when the wind was right. Cause of fire was over-insurance and he was to be married and wanted new buildings. NEAR RED CLOUD— April 23, 1932. A barn burned at 8 P. M. on the farm owned by Frank Bean, occupied by Harry Hansen. Arthur P. Hansen, a brother, lived on the farm adjoining on the North, which belonged to Harry and Arthur's father, H. C. Hansen. Arthur discovered the Bean barn on fire, so he claims, and rushed over to turn the stock out (cattle &amp; horses). One hundred brood sows and their young were burned. He claims to have seen a car bearing a Kansas license, two men in it, driving from this place to the highway as he was going to the fire. A few days later he received threatning notes (3 in all) saying he better keep still or they would get him. These he presented to the sheriff. On the morning of May 14, 4 A. M., his barn burned, total loss to both barn and contents insured for $950 and not valued at more than $270. Following a rigid investigation Arthur Hansen was arrested on May 17, confessed to setting both fires, plead guilty before the county judge and was bound over to District court on $3,000 bonds. On May 19 he was sentenced by the District Judge to from three to five years on each fire. FALLS CITY— May 27, 1932. At 11:30 P.

Evidence obtained was that it had been started with kerosene and cobs. Blodgett had written notes to himself threatning to burn the property. He was arrested on June 3rd and confessed the next morning saying he did it for publicity and sympathy as more farmers would patronize him if they found that the other dairies were trying to put him out of business.

Corderman was burned early in the morning. He and family lived on the farm. At the time only a few had any suspicions that the- fire was set — and no investigation was made. In the spring of 1932 a revival meeting was held in a school building directly across the road from the Corderman place. He was converted and there publicly confessed that he had burned the barn in April, 1928, by upsetting the lantern just inside the barn and then going to the house for breakfast. Some time after the confession this was brought to the attention of the State Fire Marshal and with the assistance of the sheriff and county attorney, Mr. Corderman was brought to Albion and again confessed and said he was willing to pay the penalty. The district judge has not yet passed sentence this date. LINCOLN— July 6, 1932. The dwelling house owned by Geo. Phillips and occupied by Jack Parker and wife was discovered on fire at 4:25 A. M. Parker and wife were in Omaha. Fire damaged the house - about $500 loss and partially destroyed the $100 worth of husehold goods that had been insured for $1,500. This fire was set with some sort of inflammable oil — everything in every room down stairs was badly scorched. Jack Parker was arrested and questioned. He stated he did not set the fire— he admitted he bought the furniture from Frank Groumas, proprietor of a shoe shining shop, and gave him a note for $1,00 but had paid it in full. Frank Groumas had Parker meet Sam Plattes, an ex-convict, who was writing insurance, and Plattes advised him to carry that amount of insurance. Evidence revealed Groumas had not been paid and that he roomed at Parkers until a week before the fire. Jack Parker finally confessed that he was a fugative from justice - was wanted in Oklahoma for forgery and jail breaking four years ago. Case was settled for the time being by letting the officers at Tulsa, Oklahoma have him and the insurance company paid no loss on contents. HOLDREGE— July 18, 1932.

When Fire Inspector Urban arrested Gingrosso, he denied having any insurance on the house, but upon investigation found that he had a $2,000 policy on the house and that he owes $1,000 on the property. We also found that he had collected $263 on another fire that occurred in this same dwelling during the month of May, this year. Case not yet tried. OTOE— August 31, 1931. A fire was discovered at 3 A.

This stock of goods had changed hands five times in two years — most of it was obsolete and this was where the fire was discover - ed. Investigation disclosed that the fire started from gasoline and kerosene and that the new stock of shoes had been removed before the fire. Insufficient evidence at that time prevented any complaints being filed. However, on November 16, 1932, new information was revealed and the case reopened culminating in the arrest of three men at Fair - bury, Nebraska, Marcus (Red) Turner, Robt. Prather and Roy Deahl.

            <seg id="p050">STATE OF NEBRASKA I _ . . ■ Incendiarism Perhaps at no time in the history of the state have there been so many clearly defined cases of incendiary fires. Nor is this condition true of .Nebraska alone. Similar reports come from neighboring states. The same unwholesome situation seems to exist wherever the stress of the universal economic depression is felt. Month to month comparisons for 1932 with previous years' records show that fire chiefs, sheriffs and insurance companies and adjusters of Nebraska have reported for in - vestigation, by this office from 100 to 400 per cent more fires of incendiary origin than in corresponding months of other years. Depreciated values of real estate, inability to meet the fixed charges for taxes and interest, threatened foreclosures, delinquent rentals, lack of funds to maintain buildings in repair have been the most frequently discovered motives for criminal fires. But none of these reasons would have been impelling were it not for the significant fact that such prop - erties have almost universally been heavily over-insured. About twenty years ago there was an epidemic of arson in Omaha. Conditions then were similar to present times. Small .buildings and their, contents were burned by skilful and organized rings. The bad state of affairs was largely cured by an almost universal cancellation of insurance indemnities in the affected neighborhoods. From August 27 to December 31, 1932, another incendiary epidemic in the same section of Omaha and showing the same skillful handling by one, or many, expert firebugs, resulted in sixteen cases where compar - atively small properties, always insured beyond their present values, were destroyed by the use of gasoline or other inflammable, either as explosions or "flash" fires; It will be remembered that in June a large three-story brick building at the corner of Fourteenth &amp; Douglas streets, Omaha, was completely destroyed by an explosion of gasoline. </seg>
            <seg id="p051">DIVISION OF EIRE PREVENTION A long and painstaking investigation by local and state investigators failed to fix the blame upon the guilty parties. Despite the fact that there was serious question as to whether the fire preceded the explosion or the explosion was responsible for the fire damages insurance adjust - ments were effected and arson unproved. It is not unreasonable to assume that these facts gave encouragement for the many later cases of incendiarism. When whole families of otherwise industrious people are out of jobs the general morale of the community is weakened. Morbidity follows. Resentment promts disrespect for law, for human life and property rights. A suspected householder, speaking through an interpreter, said that if insurance companies wrote 54,000 of insurance on his $1,500 house it was their look out and not his if his well kindled fire cost them money and made him a profit. It is most difficult to prove an arson charge. County attorneys are reluctant to swear out complaints. It has been the policy of the fire marshal's office, in the investigation of suspicious fires where definite proofs seem impossible to secure, to let citizens and communities realize that they are under observation; also to discuss with insurance companies the bad effect of irresponsible agents and brokers, and to recommend close and deliberate adjustment of questionable losses.

            <seg id="p052">STATE OF NEBRASKA Can You Take It? 1 .1 : ! ; These are times when jumping out of the tenth story window using a pistol, or grabbing the wrong bottle of medicine are often taken instead of the truth, a remedy so easy to take if we but make up our minds. Therefore, let us mention a few facts regarding the present fire situation. Experts tell us there are many different causes for fires These same experts also tell us that during the past several years, fires have beenon the increase. In looking over their long list, entitled "causes of fires , it is found that only one cause has been responsible for the tre - mendous incre..se. : The cause- is "INCENDIARISM". This fact being established as the truth, why has this one cause alone been responsible for such an increase in the number of fires throughout America? Why is it that, up to the present time, authorities have been unable to deal effectively with his cause? There is but one important and outstanding motive for the cause "INCENDIARISM"— this motive is a FINANCIAL motive— often over - insurance. However, it is often found where over-insurance is not really evident— often times the amount of insurance carried is not exceedingly high, perhaps only enough insurance to cover the mortgage. Thus, two financial motives from two different sources are evident in this, period of stress— one where the mortgage holder wants to collect and the other where the owner of the property desires to sell to the insurance company. As the depression continues, more' and more it becomes evident that mortgage holders 1 motives toward incendiarism are on the increase. There are three outstanding reasons why authorities have been unable to date to satisfactorily cope with the above situation. </seg>
            <seg id="p053">DIVISION OF FIRE PREVENTION First — The most difficult case to prosecute is that of arson, even under ordinary circumstances and in normal times. Second — Authorities are now able to trace to their own satisfaction, where many fires have either been set, or have causd to be set, by a different class of people than those who set fires during normal times. During the past year it has not been an uncommon incident to trace incendiary fires to people, who, only a few years ago, were the leading citizens in their respective communities. And, a number of cases are on file" where people of State and National prominence are guiilty of arson so far as the authorities are concerned in their own minds. Thus we find many leading citizens closely connected with incendairy fires — people who would never have thought of committing such a crime a few years back and it is nearly always the case that such people have friends of financial or political influence who are brought into play, coming to their rescue when authorities get too close to them. Third — Lawyers well know the difficulty in the prosecution of an arson case. Those of us doing fire investigation work are aware that there are many honorable attorneys, however, we personally know of a few not so honorable, and our troubles are many with this class of lawyers, who, instead of upholding the law as they took oath to do, find it a pleasure and think it clever to successfully defend parties whom they know beyond a doubt are guilty. This may be clever but we will leave it up to you whether or not such action on the part of any lawyer represents good true American citizenship. FLOYD A. ATKINS, Deputy State Fire Marshal. REPORT by M. H. Mockenhaupt, Deputy State Fire Marshal The west section of the state has a fire prevention record of which they should be proud. The last five years the fire loss has decreased in the western part of the state in cities and villages where inspections have been made and fire hazards removed. Splendid cooperation has been given me on all orders issued — by the public — city governments — fire departments — Commercial clubs — Lions clubs — Rotary clubs — and Women's clubs — all taking part in fire prevention work. </seg>
            <seg id="p054">STATE OF NEBRASKA 1 - If home owners and farmers, where inspections are not made, would remove fire hazards, they also would reduce the fire loss, which means the saving of lives and property. The most dangerous fire hazard is RUBBISH and this should be removed from all buildings and premises— a competent electrician should inspect and overhaul the electric wiring - lamp cords should not be used for extentions-all chimneys should be repaired and kept in shape-furnace pipes should be inspected to see that they are a safe distance from the wood. If pipes are within 18 inches of the wood-wood should be covered with asbestos and metal. Do not clean clothings or materials in gasoline inside buildings— stay out in the open-it is safer not to use gasoline at all. Do not start fires with kerosene or gasoline. Do not put ashes in wooden containers, or against wooden fences or buildings. Do not build bon-fire near buildings —and always see that they are put out before leaving them. Every business or private building should be equipped with fire extinguishers. All fires are small when they first- start and with the aid of an extinguisher can be readily put out— thereby reducing the fire loss. FIGHT THE FIRE DEMON at all times. The insurance companies are only agents of the people that buy in - surance. They collect on the policy and pay the owner that has the loss. If the fire loss is high, you pay more for insurance. You only pay according to the loss-so do every thing to prevent fires. Keep your business places, homes and farm buildings free from fire hazards. Eighty-five per cent of the fires are caiised by carelesness and can be avoided if you will only take an interest in fire prevention work twelve months every year. Fire prevention does not cost much, yet it often saves a life's savings and the loss of a life. Fire has no respect for life or property. .' . I lake this means of expressing my appreciation for the cooperation given me in fire prevention lines in the west section of the state for which I am inspector. The fire loss has been greatly reduced by co - operating and complying with the orders I have given. Many towns have been re-rated and in that way reduced their insurance rate. This is due to their cooperation in fire prevention work, and in which 1 hope you will continue to take an active part. </seg>
            <seg id="p055">DIVISION OF |FIRE PREVENTION REPORT by L. J. Henning, Deputy State Fire Marshal The territory covered by me in my work as Deputy State Fire Marshal takes in all that territory from Naponee in Franklin County to the East line of the state and territory south of the Platte River to the Kansas line — Naponee being my western point. In this territory I have made many inspections, as well as doing considerable special work for the department, making a number of investigations of suspicious fires, and most of these investigations have been the means of prevent - ing more fires. In most of these inspections I have been treated most kindly and courteously by both the owner and tenants of the premises inspected and ' in most cases given most helpful cooperation, and I wish here to pub - licly express and stress the fine cooperation received at all times from the volunteer and paid fire departments in the cities and towns I have ■inspected, all of which is gratefully acknowledged and appreciated. The school superintendents and teachers as well as the custodians of buildings have cooperated to the fullest extent in the matter of fire prevention safety and fire drills. Probably the most outstanding ex - ample of fire drill, in my whole territory, is that exhibition of the School for the Blind at Nebraska City, in which it is most astounding to see " the orderly manner which these inmates use in complying with the file drills and how proficient even though blind, they are in their work of this kind. Another fine example of fire prevention and probably control is the manner in which many of the towns and cities in my territory daily remove the rubbish from the alleys and in business places, being re - moved by truck or incineraters. This could be followed most profitably by many more towns and cities of the state, and should be recommended where ever it is at all possible to have it done. Proper lighting of the alleys is also a great help at night, whereas it is well known most of the fires occur. " .. </seg>
            <seg id="p056">STATE OF NEBRASKA REPORT by H. N. Downing, Deputy State Fire Marshal Thirty counties comprise the northeastern territory of Nebraska in fire inspection work. The territory is bounded on the north by South Dakota and the Missouri River, on the south by the Platte River and on the west by the western county lines of Boyd, Holt, Garfield, Valley and Sherman Counties. This territory, however, does not include the city of Omaha, nor a- small part of Buffalo county. This section of the state is well settled, towns ranging in size from small villages to cities there being five cities with "a population of from seven to eighteen thousand. Fire inspection work has as its object the elimination of the hazards to life and property which could be prevented by proper care. In many cases the hazards are due either to ignorance or to indifference, and calling this to the attention of the property owner is generally sufficient to correct the trouble. In other cases a definite order is necessary to bring about the degree of safety required. Not only does the depart - ment of fire inspection deal with the danger to life and property in the way of fire prevention, but also with any menace to the public safety -in the way of buildings in such disrepair as to be a real hazard. So far as fire hazards are concerned faulty electric wiring and the accumulation of combustible waste are the most prominent, however, defective chim - neys and furnace pipes contribute their quota to the list of hazards especially when pipes are hard to reach as in the case of the merchant whose furnace pipe was burned through and who was glad to have its condition brought to his attention. In this instance it was simply a case of the owner neglecting to climb back through the dust and grime and he was actually dismayed when he learned of the risk he had been taking and was only too glad to receive an order for its repair. Fire extinguishers, filled every year and .properly tagged, are a source of satisfaction to the fire inspector as well as the presence of No Smoking signs where required. Kerosene is often found improperly stored, but gasoline, is more often cared for as it should be. Exits from places of public gathering come in for rigid inspection, panic locks being required on all schools and theatres, and fire escapes on school buildings of two stories or more. The projection booths in motion picture theatres come in for careful attention, and also the arrange - ment of seats with reference to the exits and the absence of any loose seats unless arranged and fastened in proper block form </seg>
            <seg id="p057">DIVISION OF FIRE PREVENTION In making an inspection of the average town it is found that about 38% of the hazards are accumulated waste and rubbish, 30% faulty electric wiring, 13% careless handling of gasoline . and kercsene and 19% miscellaneous, such as defective chimneys and stove pipes, lack of fire extinguishers, careless handling of electric pressing irons, failure to install panic loeks and fire escapes, etc. Generally speaking the public appreciates the services of the fire inspector and willingly complies with, the orders given. </seg>
            <seg id="p058">STATE OF NEBRASKA NEBRASKA EDITORS, CITY COUNCILS AND TOWN BOARDS, CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE, BOY SCOUTS AND CAMP FIRE GIRLS AND ALL OTHER ORGANIZATIONS We take this opportunity to thank you one and all for your splendid co-operation given us in fire prevention lines. Fire prevention is the cheapest form of protection, no matter what it costs. No matter what use the building may be put to — keep it free from rubbish, guard against the accumulation of waste of any kind, and you will have taken the greatest possible step toward immunity from fire. No matter how many precautions may be taken to prevent fires — they will start — for we are all human, and, therefore, careless; and as long as the human element enters, some points will be overlooked, some opening will be left for fire to enter. Even tho every step is taken that can be foreseen to prevent fires, we must not stop, but be prepared to fight it when it comes. Fire prevention, as well as fire protection, should cover the civic authorities realm of activities, both in the matter of clean street and vacant lots, cutting of grass and weeds and the beautifying of the town, generally, by encouraging the painting of building, the planting of trees andshrubs, and the' growing of flowers in every spot wliere they will show off to advantage. Purely accidental fires are few in number and are not the cause of the serioUs fire waste of our state. People as a rule do not commit crime without an incentive and a motive. With the criminal class, the arson gang, the pyromaniac, or those who are hopelessly involved in debt, it is an invitation to have a fire. Much can be done, thru the initiative of leaders in various commercial bodies in establishing higher ethical standards and cooperating for the purpose of eradicating vicious and unfair practices. If the- public conscience is sufficiently aroused, the better side of a man's instinct will respond, even though under more unfavorable surroundings he were criminally inclined. The atmosphere we breathe has an influence on our lives. Fire prevention is infectious — let us all try it and see how quickly it will spread over our town. The fire marshal's office is ready at the public's call to make in - spections, consult with builders and property owners, make investiga - tions, address schools and furnish data for newspapers — within the lim - itations of the law and funds available. </seg>
            <seg id="p059">DIVISION OF FIRE PREVENTION FIRE CHIEFS TAKE NOTICE Also Mayors or Chairman of Town Board in Towns Where a Fire Department has not Been Organized. The law requires you to report all fires — where the loss is S5.00 or more— to the Slate Fire Marshal at Lincoln, Nebraska, within seven days after fire. The Fire Marshal furnishes you with the proper blank forms on which to make these, reports — all you have to do is write this office for them. One dollar is paid the chief or mayor for each complete re - port forwarded. BUT YOU MUST MAKE A COMPLETE REPORT— filling in each blank space on the report. If it is not complete, it will be returned to you for correction. The following spaces must be filled in. Name of town ? County ? If farm, give distance from town ? Name of occupant ? Building constructed of what kind of material ? How many . stories high ? Condition of building as to age ? State whether building was a dwelling, store, manufacturing plant, garage, barnj etc. state what kind of business, if a business place. Value of building ? Insurance (amount in figures) ? Loss ? Value of Contents ? Insurance ? Loss ? Value of automobile ? Insurance ? Loss ? BE SURE AND READ DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING OUT REPORTS, BEFORE SENDING THEM IN Remember to place the value of building and contents and the insurance on both, even tho there was not a loss on both — as this will give you a better record for your fire department — showing how much you have saved the people of your town. Be sure to give the CAUSE of fire, in your opinion, and also advise in what part of the building the fire started. Typewrite your reports, if possible. If not, write as plain as you can, and be sure to print your name on the report, as well as writing it. All fire chiefs are furnished with a deputy fire inspector's card, </seg>
            <seg id="p060">STATE OF NEBRASKA signed by the Governor and State Fire Marshal. This is beneficial when making inspections and on the investigations of fires. Remember, .the law makes you an assistant in fire prevention. When new chiefs are elected, the secretary should notify this office at once giving the name of the chief, so that we may know on whom to call or write in case of necessity. FIRE DEPARTMENT OFFICERS TO BE ELECTED IN JANUARY We respectfully ask and recommend that all fire chiefs be elected during the month' of January, in Nebraska. It would not be a difficult task to change the date of your annual meeting to some day during the month of January, making this fact known by letter or printed ■notice that at your next regular meeting this proposition would be voted on, and if a majority of the members present at that meeting, • vote , to change the annual meeting it would be carried. In that way the Fire Marshal would be able to have a complete and up-to-date list of all chiefs in this state. ADJUSTERS MUST REPORT SUSPICIOUS FIRES Section 44-706, 1929 compiled statutes — Every adjuster, who investigates any loss claim in this state, shall ascertain whether there be double, or over-insurance upon such risk and the facts and circumstances so far as practical pertaining to the original or happening of the hazard or peril insured against; and in case he believes fraud has been committed or attempted to be committed, he shall promptly report the premises to the department of trade and commerce, and in case of fire insurance to the fire marshal as well.
