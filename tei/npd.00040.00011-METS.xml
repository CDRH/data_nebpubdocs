            <seg id="p005">SUMMARY. The results of eight years of careful experimentation thruout a series of favorable and a series of unfavorable years indicate that the common methods of growing crops in this region — the result of 30 years' experimentation and observation by intelligent farmers — are founded on sound principles of economic pro - duction. Moisture conditions are so all-powerful in controlling yields that tillage methods, rotations, crop sequences, and soil fertility are all thrown into the background. The changes in weather conditions from season to season and from day to day of each season are so radical and so various that one system of tillage may succeed one year and another system succeed the next year. However, there are a few rather broad principles that apply to a wide range of conditions covering the medium and also many of the extreme conditions. All of these principles are subject to modification, as there are no set and fast rules. It has been rather clearly established that moisture is the chief factor controlling crop production in this region. There seems to be an excess of fertility over available moisture at the present time. Therefore, any expense incurred for the purpose of main - taining or increasing the fertility is largely a loss so far as the yields of the succeeding crops indicate. Moisture is largely lost thru vegetation rather than from the surface of the soil. The soil mulch assists in retaining moisture under certain conditions but does not always retain sufficient moisture to pay the cost of maintaining an ideal mulch. Summer tilling the land retains a part of the rainfall and gives some security against drouth, but the cost of summer tilling has not been fully paid by increased yields of corn or spring grain. While the soil and crops respond to thoro methods of tillage, they do not respond sufficiently to extreme methods of tillage to pay for the added expense. A system of tillage that does not permit the soil to be robbed of moisture by vegetation which has no market value, and that keeps the surface of the soil from becoming hard and smooth, seems to accomplish the practical ends of tillage. While more labor than is required to accomplish these ends may increase the yields, yet the increase is likely not to be sufficient to return as much for a unit of labor expended in the extreme tillage as in the less intensive and more practical tillage. While on high-priced land a large part of the cost of produc - tion comes as land rental, this charge is relatively less on land of low value, and the labor involved becomes the largest factor in </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, Bulletin 155. the cost of production. This labor cost has a greater influence in the cost of producing a bushel of grain than the method of production. The results of this work indicate that the less expensive practices give the greater net profit. Small grain following corn has given more net profit than small grain follow - ing small grain, not because the former practice gave the greater yields but because the labor cost of the latter practice was less than of the former. Summer tillage and green-manure crops have increased the yield of the crops but not the profits because of the increased cost per acre. One of the chief ways of increas - ing profits is by reducing operating expenses. The factors entering into the cost of production aforementioned make practices of tillage commendable on low-priced land that should not be recommended on high-priced land. Profit in crop pro - duction in this region is likely to come from farming a large acreage with the minimum man labor and an adequate supply of power. "Good farming" is to be recommended in this region as strongly as in the more humid sections, but this term does not necessarily mean identical or even similar practices under the two distinctly different sets of conditions. Yield per acre usually is taken as the measure of profitable production. A low yield means a small profit or a loss and a high yield means a large profit. But this is not necessarily true. Europe produces high yields per acre but small profits per man. The measure of good farming in America is profit per man rather than yield per acre. As the yield per acre is increased beyond a certain normal, the cost per bushel, on the average, will be increased, tho in individual cases or during short periods of time the reverse may be true. While the results in crop production herein reported represent losses during severe years, like figures for almost any business enterprise would show similar results during periods of depression. Also, if we could include with this report the results the farmer obtained by keeping live stock and feeding the roughage grown during these years to the stock, the final item of profit would look much more favorable. This report deals only with certain phases of the fanner's operations, and these phases are those most noticeably affected by unfavorable seasons. That the farmer did not get fair wages for growing a certain crop, by a certain method, during a certain year, is not sufficient basis for asserting that the farmer did or did not make money during that year. It is probable that the farmer who judiciously combined live stock farming with grain production secured a profit during the most unfavorable season. </seg>
            <seg id="p007">ROTATIONS AND TILLAGE METHODS IN WESTERN NEBRASKA. INTRODUCTION. In the spring of 1906 a series of one-tenth acre plats was laid out on the table-land of the North Platte Experimental Sub - station. In these plats there are being tried various rotations, crop sequences, and methods of tillage in the production of corn, spring wheat, oats, barley, and sorghum hay. There are 92 plats in this series. Each plat is 2 rods by 8 rods in extent. The plats are grouped so as to indicate the relative effects of plowing and disking, of fall plowing and spring plowing, of growing one kind of crop continuously year after year on the same land and rotating the crops each season, of continuous cropping and alter - nate or occasional summer tillage, the effects of barnyard manure, green manure, or no manure, and of other common farm practices. There is always an opportunity to check the result on a cer - tain plat by the result on another plat where the only difference in the previous treatment of the two plats is the factor under consideration. Therefore, a result may be traced to its cause with a fair degree of accuracy. Fall and spring plowing may be cited as an example. By referring to Chart I it will be noted that Rotations 2 and 3 are similar excepting that in Rotation 2, the soil is always spring plowed, while in Rotation 3, the soil is always fall plowed. As Plat A of each of these rotations is seeded on the same day with the same drill and in the same manner, and as all other operations on these two plats except the time of Assistant in Soils and Crops, Experimental Substation, North Platte, and Assistant Agriculturist, Office of Dry Land Agriculture, Bureau of Plant Industry, United States Department of Agriculture. Mr. Osborn resigned March 1, 1915. and was succeeded by Mr. L. L. Zook. The data presented in this bulletin relating to climatic conditions and soil moisture have been obtained by the North Platte Substation in cooperation with the Biophysical Laboratory and Office of Dry Land Agriculture, Bureau Plant Industry, United States Department of Agriculture. The data from which this report is compiled were gathered in the years 1906 to 1912 inclusive by Mr. W. W. Burr, then Associate in Soils and Crops, North Platte Experimental Substation, and Assistant Agriculturist in Dry Land Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture, who was trans - ferred in March, 1913, to become Assistant in the Office of Dry Land Agricul - ture, United States Department of Agriculture. The data for 1913 and 1914 were gathered by Mr. W. M. Osborn, as above indicated. BY W. P. SNYDER AND W. M. OSBORN. 1 </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, Bulletin 155. plowing are similar, it is reasonable to presume that the difference in yield is due to this one factor in which the tillage methods differ, namely, the time of plowing. The yield of any one year may be influenced greatly by a local seasonal condition unusually favorable to the one or the other time of plowing, but when the results of eight seasons are combined, it would seem we have a fair basis for determining the probable relative results of fall and spring plowing. The basis of comparison is further strengthened by averaging the results of several fall-plowed plats and an equal number of spring - plowed plats. A plat only 2 rods by 8 rods appears too small for practical results to the man whose fields are from 40 acres to a half section in area. But it should be remembered that these plats are each handled as distinctly separate from each other as are large fields and that each plat has the same conditions as each other plat. It may be true that hot winds affect fields of small area more than those of large area, but we have noted that the yield on these plats has been about the same as that on larger fields tilled in like manner. The use of plats of this size has been carefully con - sidered by experimenters not only thruout the United States but also in Europe, and the consensus of opinion is in favor of the small plat with checks. Crops grown according to a definite method of tillage differ greatly in yields from year to year. Also there is considerable variation of yields each season on plats tilled in different ways. But the variations from time to time are not all in the same direction, and as yet it is not possible to foretell what method of seed-bed preparation will give the larger yield or larger net profit at the succeeding harvest. It is fairly well established that, on the average, certain methods will give better results than certain other methods, but during any season under trial the results may be the opposite of the average result. Some plats have been plowed each season for corn and the corn planted with the lister. We do not advocate this as the best farm practice for this region, but it is used in this work in order to keep all factors affecting the various plats as uniform as possible and still consistent with the objects sought. When this work was planned, winter wheat was purposely omitted, but at a later time a similar series of plats was laid out in which winter wheat formed the basis of the rotations. As this later work has not been in progress as long, it is not con - sidered in this report, altho winter wheat is a more profitable crop than any of the spring grains. </seg>

            <seg id="p010">10 Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, Bulletin 155. WEATHER CONDITIONS. The weather conditions of the eight years since these tests began have not favored profitable crops every year. In fact, for the small-grain crops there were three favorable and five un - favorable seasons and for corn four good and four poor seasons. The total rainfall of these years might lead one to expect fewer seasons of unprofitable returns, as the average precipitation of these eight years is 17.96 inches. This is only 0.54 inch below the average annual precipitation of a period of 40 years. The distribution of the rainfall thruout the season is fully as effective as the amount. The year 1912 may be cited as an example. The total precipitation was slightly above the normal. The rain - fall in March was heavy, being 2.23 inches above the normal of 0.85 inch. April followed with 2.93 inches. This was 0.92 inch above the normal. The rainfall of May was 1.93 inches or 0.87 inch below the normal, but the three spring months, March, April, and May, gave 2.28 inches above the normal. This would seem to give some assurance of a large small-grain crop. June followed — hot, windy, and dry. The normal rainfall for June is 3.26 inches, but in June, 1912, there was only 0.57 inch of rain - fall. This was the critical time for the small-grain crops. As a result of unfavorable weather conditions in June, the yields of small grain were very low. However, July gave a rainfall of 4.01 inches, or 1.18 inches above the normal. Tho the August rain - fall was only about half the normal, there was more than the normal amount in September, and a good corn crop was har - vested. The amount of precipitation, the distribution of the precipitation, and the occurrence of precipitation at times when the crop needs it, as well as temperature, wind velocity, and humidity of the atmosphere — three factors which largely control the moisture demands of the crop -all play important parts in the crop growth and yield. All these factors must work in harmony for maximum crop yields. WEATHER RATHER THAN TILLAGE CONTROLS YIELD The weather conditions of the season during which the crop is grown is the greatest factor controlling yields. The seasonal precipitation has a much greater influence on crop production than methods of seed-bed preparation, crop sequence, or manure. The average yield of corn on all plats in 1908, 1909, and 1912 was 26.2, 26.4, and 26 bushels per acre. These were seasons when the weather conditions were favorable for producing corn. Only 3 plats out of 22 yielded less than 20 bushels per acre in 1908. The lowest yielding plat in 1909 gave 21.6 bushels per </seg>

The seasons of 1911 and 1913 were so unfavorable for producing corn that corn was a failure under all methods of production. Only a few plats produced any grain, and the yield on these could not be credited to any one system of production. Similar results are shown by the yields of small grain. The seasons of 1907 and 1908 were favorable for producing small grain. There was an average yield of 24.7 bushels per acre of spring wheat on all plats during the former year and 26.3 bushels per acre during the latter year. No plat yielded as low as 20 bushels per acre in 1907, and only two plats fell below this amount in 1908. There were 19 plats in spring wheat. In 1911, spring wheat was a failure. From 1910 to 1914 inclusive no plat yielded as much as 20 bushels per acre. The variation of the eight-year average yield of the various plats is about 200 per cent, while the variation of the yields on each plat from year to year is many hundred per cent, on one plat being a variation from zero to 42. During favorable seasons, profitable crops have been produced by all methods, and during unfavorable seasons profitable crops have not been produced by any method. SUMMER TILLAGE VS. CONTINUOUS CROPPING The system of alternate cropping and summer tillage has failed to overcome severe drouth conditions and has been less profitable in the production of corn and spring grain than ordinary methods of production. However, this system, during some un - favorable years, has given a large increase in yields over common practices and thus has served as a partial insurance against entire crop failure. As has been stated, under extremely unfavorable conditions no method of production has given yields of grain. In 1908 summer-tilled land produced 38.2 bushels of corn per acre but during the same season a plat of corn following corn produced 38.6 bushels per acre and the average yield of 22 plats of corn was 26.2 bushels per acre. In 1909 corn on summer-tilled land yielded 25 bushels per acre, but 16 plats out of the remaining 21 yielded 25 or more bushels per acre and the average yield of the 22 plats was 26.4 bushels per acre. In 1912, the third good corn year, summer-tilled land gave 35.1 bushels per acre, but a plat of corn following corn gave 39.9 bushels per acre and the average yield of all plats was 26 bushels per acre. In 1911 grain was not produced on any corn plat, and the yield of fodder was not as large on the summer-tilled plat as on certain other plats. Almost no grain was produced in 1913. The yield of fodder this season </seg>
            <seg id="p013">Rotations and Tillage Methods in Western Nebraska. 13 on the summer-tilled plat was higher than on any other plat and about one and one-half times higher than the average of all plats. In 1907 the summer-tilled plat gave 17.9 bushels per acre. Of the 21 other plats, 15 yielded more than the summer-tilled plat and 5 yielded less. The average yield on all plats was 20.1 bushels per acre. In 1910 and 1914 the summer-tilled plat yielded much more than any other and serveral times the average of all the plats. During the former season the yield of the summer - tilled plat was 21.9 bushels per acre while the yield of all other plats was low, ranging from 1 to 15.4 bushels per acre with the average at 5.2 bushels. During 1914 the highest yield on a plat continuously cropped was 15.5 bushels, and the average yield of all plats was 5 bushels per acre, while the summer-tilled plat yielded 27.9 bushels per acre. The results of eight years, three of which were good corn years, one fair, two practically failures, and two complete failures, show an average yield of 20.8 bushels of corn from the summer-tilled plat, 18.2 for a plat that grew corn every year, and 13.6 bushels for all plats. It should be remembered that the yield of the summer-tilled plat is a biennial rather than an annual yield; that this yield must always be divided by two in order to get the annual yield. The results of these eight years indicate that if an acre of land had been growing corn under ordinary methods of tillage it would have yielded in the eight years 106 bushels of corn and 9 tons of fodder, or if it had been summer tilled one year and cropped the next it would have yielded in the eight years 83 bushels of corn and 5.4 tons of fodder. The yields of spring wheat throw more light on the problem of summer tillage. In 1907, a good wheat year, of two summer - tilled plats growing spring wheat, one produced 31.8 bushels per acre and the other 26 bushels per acre. Two plats not fallowed produced 28.3 and 28.7 bushels per acre. The average yield of all plats was 24.7 bushels per acre. In 1908 one of the summer - tilled plats yielded 40.5 bushels per acre and the other 42.2 bushels per acre. The highest yield on any other plat was 31.3 bushels per acre. The average of all plats was 26.3 bushels per acre. The lowest yield of any plat was 17.5 bushels per acre. In 1909, one summer-tilled plat yielded at the rate of 18 bushels per acre and the other at the rate of 27.2 bushels per acre. The highest yield on any plat not summer-tilled was 24.3 bushels per acre and the lowest yield was 8.1 bushels per acre. The average yield of the 19 plats was 17.1 bushels per acre. In 1911, wheat was a failure on all plats. From 1910 to 1914 the yields were very low. In 1910, one summer-tilled plat yielded 18.3 bushels per acre and the other 14.3 bushels per acre. The average yield </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, Bulletin 155. of these plats was twice the average yield of the 19 plats. Each summer-tilled plat yielded more than any plat not summer tilled. In 1912 one summer-tilled plat yielded 10.5 bushels per acre and the other 9.2. Of two plats that had grown wheat con - tinuously, one yielded 12.8 bushels per acre and the other 11.2 bushels per acre. The average yield of all plats was 6.4 bushels per acre. In 1913, one of the summer-tilled plats yielded 10 and the other 7.3 bushels per acre. The average yield of these two was more than twice the average yield of all plats. The highest yield on any plat not summer tilled was 4.3 bushels per acre. In 1914, one summer-tilled plat yielded 15.2 and the other 10.4 bushels per acre. The average yield of all plats was 6.3 bushels per acre and the highest of any plat not summer tilled was 8.8 bushels per acre. The average yield for eight years of one summer - tilled plat is 18 and of the other summer-tilled plat 17 bushels per acre. The average yield of all plats was 11.5 bushels per acre. Of two plats continuously cropped to wheat, one yielded 12.9 bushels and the other 12.2 bushels per acre. The lowest eight-year average of any plat was 8.6 bushels per acre. As with corn, the yield of the summer-tilled plat must be divided by two in order to get the annual yield. These results indicate that during these eight years if an acre had been cropped continuously it would have yielded 87.2 1 bushels of spring wheat, while if the acre had been summer tilled and cropped alternately it would have yielded 68 bushels of spring wheat. Oats have responded to the various methods a about the same manner as spring wheat. The average yield in 1908 was 61.8 bushels per acre. The maximum yield was 91.5 bushels per acre on a summer-tilled plat. Another summer-tilled plat yielded 91 bushels per acre. In 1911 and 1913, oats were a failure on all plats. The eight-year average gives an average yield of 27.4 bushels of oats per acre on the four summer-tilled plats. This is approximately 10 bushels per acre more than from plats that grew a crop each year. According to these results, an acre cropped continuously for eight years would have yielded 142 bushels of oats, while an acre summer tilled one year and cropped the next would have yielded 109 bushels of oats in eight years. The yields of barley on summer-tilled land favor this method more than the yields from other spring grains or corn. In 1907, barley on summer-tilled land did not yield quite as much as on some land not summer tilled but more than the average of the land cropped each year. The average of all plats was 37.8 ■The average of spring- and fall-plowed and disked corn land, which was 10.9 bushels per acre. From Table 1, Limited Edition. </seg>

In 1908 the summer-tilled plat seeded to barley yielded 67.7 bushels per acre, while the highest yield from any plat continuously cropped was 43.3 bushels per acre. Barley on the summer-tilled plat in 1909 yielded 23.8 bushels per acre, which was about 2 bushels per acre more than land that had grown corn the year previous. In 1910 the summer-tilled plat yielded 26 bushels per acre, while the highest yield on a plat continuously cropped was 16 bushels per acre. The 1911 crop was a failure on all the plats. In 1912 the summer-tilled plat gave 20 bushels per acre, which was slightly less than two plats continuously cropped and only slightly above the average of all plats. In 1913 and 1914 the summer-tilled plat yielded from two to four times as much as the plats continuously cropped. The eight-year average yield of the four plats continuously cropped was 15.5 bushels per acre and of the summer-tilled plat 26.7 bushels per acre. Dividing the latter yield by two give an annual yield of 13.3 bushels per acre from a plat summer tilled. In eight years, an acre of land continuously cropped, according to these results, would have yielded 124 bushels of barley, while an acre alternately cropped and summer tilled would have yielded 106.8 bushels of barley. When we consider the average yearly profit 1 or loss per acre for the eight years, we find that corn grown on summer-tilled land gave a loss of 3 cents as against a profit of $3.65 where corn was grown continuously. Spring wheat gave a profit of $2.11 when grown on summer-tilled land as against a profit of $2.28 or $3.06 on land that grew wheat continuously. Oats gave a loss of $2.29 per acre on summer-tilled land, while on land con - tinuously cropped the loss was small. Barley gave a loss of $2.08 per acre on summer-tilled land, while it gave a small profit on land continuously cropped. SPRING PLOWING VS. FALL PLOWING We recognize that there is but little land plowed for spring small grain or corn. Land is usually prepared for corn by disking and listing. Spring small grain is usually sown on cornstalk land prepared by disking. These practices are commendable, but occasionally it is advisable to plow in preparing the seed-bed. The results of these eight-years' tests indicate that from the standpoint of yields or profit it matters but little whether the land is spring plowed or fall plowed for corn or spring grains.

            <seg id="p016">16 Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, Bulletin 155. The average yield of corn on the spring-plowed plats and on the fall-plowed plats planted to corn was almost the same for each of the eight years excepting 1910, a very poor corn year, when the spring-plowed plats gave an average yield of 6.1 bushels and the fall-plowed plats an average yield of 2.8 bushels per acre. The average yield for the eight years was 13.1 bushels per acre for the fall-plowed plats and 13.6 bushels per acre for the spring-plowed plats. In the production of spring wheat, during no season were the results from fall plowing much different from the results of spring plowing excepting in 1908 when fall plowing gave an average yield of about 6 bushels per acre more than spring plowing. The average of the eight years gives a margin of 1 bushel per acre yearly in favor of fall plowing. In the yields of oats, there is more variation from year to year. The final eight-year average gives a margin of about 1 bushel per acre yearly in favor of spring plowing. Barley reverses the results of oats in reference to the effect of spring and fall plowing. The cost of production indicates that spring plowing gives the greater profit per acre. CORN STUBBLE VS. GRAIN STUBBLE FOR SMALL GRAIN The difference in the yield of spring wheat on land that grew spring grain or corn the previous year has not been marked during any season. The average of the eight years shows a margin of less than one-half bushel per acre yearly in favor of spring wheat following grain rather than following corn. Oats show practically the same results as spring wheat excepting that the eight-year average gives a margin of 1 bushel per acre yearly in favor of land that grew corn the previous year. Barley shows an annual average difference of 3 bushels per acre in favor of land that grew small grain the preceding year. A preceding crop of spring grain and a preceding crop of corn have had about the same effect on the yields of the spring grain crop following. But as corn stubble land is much more easily prepared for seeding to spring grain than small-grain stubble land, the land that previously grew corn shows the greater profit. In this work, corn stubble land usually has been double-disked twice and harrowed once while grain stubble land has been plowed once, double-disked once, and harrowed once in preparing it for seeding to small grain. CORN OR SMALL GRAIN PRECEDING CORN. During almost every year of the eight years under con - sideration, corn following corn has yielded more than corn follow - ing small grain. The average annual difference for the eight years </seg>

The fact that corn leaves the soil in condition for cheap production the following year is very much in favor of its cultivation. EFFECT OF SORGHUM ON SUCCEEDING CROP. Only two kinds of crops, spring wheat and oats, have been grown following sorghum sown for forage. The yields of these crops following sorghum have not been much different from the yields of the same crops following corn or spring grain. During most years, spring wheat has yielded more when following corn and spring grain than when following sorghum, but during some seasons the reverse has been true. The average for the eight years shows an annual yield of 0.6 bushel per acre more of spring wheat following corn and 1 bushel per acre more of spring wheat following small grain than of spring wheat following sorghum which had been sown broadcast for producing forage. During no season did land that grew sorghum the previous year produce more oats than land that had grown corn or small grain the preceding year, but the annual yield from the sorghum land for the eight years was only 1.5 bushels per acre less than from the small-grain land and 2.5 bushels per acre less than from the corn land. BARNYARD Barnyard manure has been applied to certain plats once in three years at the rate of about 10 tons per acre. In Rotation 43 of oats, corn, and spring wheat, all seeded on fall-plowed land, the manure was applied before plowing for oats. In Rotation 3 the same crops were grown in the same manner except that no manure was used. Th? value per acre annually of the crops Th? value per acre annually of the crops from the rotation not having manure is $1.78 more than the value of the crop from the rotation having manure. The other rotations in which manure is used are 44 and 47, in both of which grain stubble is manured during the winter and spring plowed for sorghum. There is no rotation differing from either of these rotations in manure alone, but Rotation 48 is somewhat similar and may assist in ascertaining the value of manure. The eight-year average yield of sorghum hay from the plat in Rotation 44, where sorghum was grown on manured wheat stubble, was 5,856 pounds per acre yearly. In 47 the corresponding yield was 6,464 pounds, or the average of the two plats manured was 6,160 pounds. In Rotation 48, where sorghum followed oats and preceded wheat without any manure in the rotation, the average yearly yield for the eight years was 6,316 </seg>

Altho the manure has undoubtedly maintained or increased the fertility of the soil, it has given no appreciable beneficial effect on the yields of the succeeding crop. However, it should not be inferred that the application of barnyard manure is to be condemned. Generally the manure can be applied when there is little demand for the labor of men and teams. Also the cost of spreading manure on the land is not very different from the cost of dumping it into a ravine. It is pretty definitely understood that water is the limiting factor in crop production in the Great Plains area. Organic matter if properly applied to the soil increases the efficiency of the water in the soil and tends to keep the soil in a good physical condition. Since the history of land longer farmed shows that the soil will eventually reach a point of diminishing returns unless plant food is returned to the soil thru the application of barnyard manure or some other form of fertilizer, it would seem advisable not to waste the barnyard manure even tho the suc - ceeding yields as recorded in this bulletin do not show any beneficial effect from the use of the manure. GREEN MANURE. Both rye and field peas have been grown and plowed under when in blossom as green-manure crops. Xo practical difference has been noticed between the results from these two crops when used for this purpose. The use of green-manure crops has proved to be more expensive and less profitable than alternate cropping and summer tillage. Tho the yields have been increased by the green-manure crop, the additional cost of producing the crop, as represented by the rental of the land an extra year, the cost of the seed for the green-manure crop, and the extra tillage that must accompany this method, is so great that the final profit from this method of production is not as great as from ordinary methods. ROTATIONS. Nearly all rotations giving a loss were designed to maintain the soil fertility by barnyard manure, a green-manure crop, or a grass crop. The other final items of loss occurred where corn was grown on summer-tilled land, where oats were grown con - tinuously on spring-plowed land or on summer-tilled land, or where barley was grown on summer-tilled land. The rotations giving a net annual profit of less than $1 per acre contained summer tillage as a regular practice once in three </seg>

There was no rotation in which the crops were grown accord - ing to common farm practice conducted thoroly that did not give an average annual profit of more than $1 per acre. Corn grown continuously gave more profit than any rotation of crops except as noted in the following paragraph, and wheat grown continuously gave more profit than any rotation of crops or than any other crop grown continuously except corn, and also with the exception noted in the succeeding paragraph. If we should assume that the barnyard manure did not materially increase the succeeding crop of sorghum, and we believe it did not, then the most profitable rotation of the entire series is sorghum, corn, and spring wheat. In this, corn stover is given a value of $3 per ton and sorghum a value of $4 per ton. The results place a relatively high value on sorghum where the forage may be used profitably at $4 per ton. Rotations of oats, corn, and spring wheat rank high in the profit per acre. The oats are usually the unprofitable crop in these rotations. CROP SEQUENCE. Continuous cropping of spring wheat has given an average yield practically as large as that obtained from corn land. Where spring wheat follows sorghum grown for forage, the average yield has not been greatly diminished when compared with spring wheat following corn or spring wheat. Where spring plowing is practiced, spring wheat following oats has given the lowest average yield of any crop sequence for wheat. This difference, however, has not resulted where the oats land was plowed in the fall. On fall-plowed land, continuous cropping of corn has averaged 4.9 bushels per acre more than following small grain, and on spring-plowed land a difference of 5.3 bushels per acre has favored the system of continuous cropping. Corn following sorghum has given the lowest average yield for eight years of any crop sequence for corn. Oats following brome grass or alfalfa has been the lowest yielding sequence for oats for an average of eight years. On fall - plowed land, the highest average yielding sequence for oats has been continuous cropping of oats, and the lowest average yielding sequence of land annually cropped has been oats following barley. On spring-plowed land, oats following spring wheat and corn has given the highest average yields. </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, Bulletin 155. Barley grown on disked corn land has given the lowest average yield of any crop sequence for barley. Barley following oats has given practically as good results as continuous cropping of barley. ALFALFA AND BROME GRASS. Alfalfa and brome grass are each used three years in six-year rotations. The purpose of these rotations is the production of forage crops and the maintenance of soil fertility. During five years out of eight neither the alfalfa nor the brome grass has produced any forage. Since 1911, a permanent stand of neither has been secured. It is evident that neither of these forage crops has been used successfully in these rotations. The failure of these crops should be expected during all but unusually favor - able seasons when grown on high table-land of this character unless seeded in rows and cultivated. SORGHUM AS A FORAGE CROP. Sorghum has been grown as a forage crop in certain rotations. It has been seeded with a press drill at the rate of 5 pecks per acre. The average yearly yield for seven years has been 3.1 tons per acre. During favorable seasons and also under drouth con - ditions sorghum has given a larger tonnage per acre than any other crop. The feeding value of sorghum, as reported in Bi letins 105 and 117 of this Station, is about the same as that .i native hay. RELATIVE VALUES O As a single crop and also in rotations, corn ranks ab&lt; of the small-grain crops in the profit per acre where the stover and grain are both used. That corn leaves the soil in a condition which favors profit from the succeeding crop adds to its value. ue Spring wheat ranks next to corn and gives the most profit when it follows corn in a rotation. Barley has given less profit than spring wheat. Oats have usually been grown at a loss. When forage for live stock is given full consideration, sorghum ranks high. The yield of sorghum hay has averaged 3.1 tons per acre as against an average yield of corn following corn, which system has given the largest average of corn, of 18 bushels and \\ tons of stover per acre. If corn is valued at 50 cents per bushel, corn stover at $3 per ton, and sorghum hay at $4 per ton, with the afore - mentioned yields, the corn would be slightly more valuable than the sorghum. But if the yield of corn following small grain were used with the prices given above, the corn crop would be worth </seg>
