            <seg id="p003">HOW TO SELECT THE GOOD LAYERS FRANK E. Ml'SSEMI A typical farm leek of ninety-four hens was culled by a try specialist last July and a few suggestions made as to im- proved methods of feeding. The report which the owner of the lock submits indicates the advantages of culling and the prompt - less with which results are secured if this work is carefully lone. The report on culling this Fillmore county Hock is as The result in this instance cannot all be accredited to culling ■ partly due to the improved opportunity which the better itla had to secure feed and care, but this does not minimize the •■•essity of culling but rather places additional emphasis on it. Certain standard methods of selecting good laying hens have veloped as a result of observations made at the laying and at other places where trapnesting is being done. Wt quality which is definitely established as being neces - &gt;r high egg production is body capacity and vigor. BODY tWPAtTTY AM) VMMtR lleavv layers are hearty eaters and must necessarily convert ■ relatively large amount of feed into eggs. A 5-pound hen that produces 200 eggs in a year must convert about 90 pounds of raw material in the lam of grains and by-products over into the finished product — eggs. Plenty of room for a large fully de - veloped digestive and reproductive system is, therefore, very important, and the term used to denote this quality is capacity. Comparative length and breadth of the body cavity is usual - ly measured by finger widths, the two measurements which are observed being the distance between the pelvic or lay bones, and the distance from the end of the breast bone to the pelvic bones. Kody width is indicated by the distance between the two pelvic bones, depth and length by the distance from the breast bone to the pelvic bones. ■ Before calling Alter calling M In-. .")() hens i Date Inly J.-) Inly 26 Inly 27 Eggs laid 11 I 10 Date ■luly :$1 Aug.

            <seg id="p004">4 MEASURING CAPACITY FOE EGG PRODUCTION tThe laying capacity of hens may be estimated by noting the distance 1 1 ) between th bones : and &lt;2i the distance from the end of the breast bone to the lay bones. The best layers in a typical flock will indicate a body depth of four or more fingers when in laying condition while the poorest hens may not indicate more than "two-finger" capacity. The distance between the pelvic bones may also vary from one to three fingers in width in birds of the same variety. Emphasis should here be placed on the fact that capacity measurements will vary with the breeds so that the same standard should not be used, for instance, for both Leghorns and Orping - tons. Leghorns with three-finger body depth capacity will repre - sent an expected high producer while Orpingtons with three - finger capacity are much more common. The greatest value is </seg>

IN" ONE YEAR Vigor and activity are characteristics of ttood lay to be attached to the capacity tests when birds of tin eral type or breed are compared. (food egg production is absolutely dependent "ii vi (t all vigorous hens are good layers, the breeding of the bird ving a great influence. The general condition of the bird, tnmetry and balance, strength of head and beak, are tin- best licators of vigor and vitality. Great activity of the bird at ?ding time, promptness to get off the roost in the morning and reluctance to go to roost at night, are characteristics of the &gt;st vigorous birds. LAYING CONDITION An observation of the laying condition of the lien will very naturally be made at the same time that her capacity is noted. </seg>

I'MJMK.NTATIOX TKSTS FOR HHJH LAYERS A method of selecting good layers in a flock of naturally yellow -shanked and yellow -skinned birds is known as the pig - mentation test. Pullets which have been naturally raised usual - ly have a considerable amount of pigmented body fat stored in the skin, shanks and other sections of the body. During a period </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 of heavy laying there is a tendency to draw on this reserve lat supply for egg-making material. The color pigment is removed with the fat and the shank and skin becomes much lighter in color. In a yellow .shanked flock in which all birds are given the same feed and care, the better layers may be selected after several months of heavy laying by means of the light colored shank characteristic. Poor layers will always have a consider able amount of the yellow pigment in the shanks and skin. LATE MOULTING TKiST I A study of trapnest records shows that hens which lay over comparatively long period make the best annual egg records. has also been observed that certain hens will lay persistently d then moult quickly while others will insist on a four-months cation for the moulting job. Those hens which moult early and &gt;wly are poor layers while the persistent layers that moult late ivays have better records. KAICI.Y MATIHITY It has also been observed that of a group of birds hatched at the same time and given the same care, the best layers arc those that mature earliest. Pullets that begin to la*' in October, November and December and lay consistently until the following November always have better records than those that do nni begin laying until January, February or .March and probably stop laying before October. With good (- are and management Leghorns should be matured in 2&lt;M) days. Rhode Island Beds, Wyandottes and Plymouth Rocks in 22.") days and Orpington* in 240 days from date of hatching. USE OF TKAPNKST I While flocks can be very efficiently culled by mean.-, of the ysical characteristics mentioned above, the evidence which is secured is circumstantial and is recommended for use especial because of its convenience. Even in flocks at caret'ully culled ■ds there will still be great variation in egg production and ! use of the trapnest is the only way to Ret positive evidence egg-laying ability or lack of it. Though the trapnesting of I great majority of farm flocks is not practical, the securing breeding stock, especially pedigreed cockerels, from stock that 3 been trapnested is practical and is therefore, suggested, eatest returns will be secured from the farm flock when proper ention is paid not only to culling and selection but to breeding I to feeding as well. </seg>
