I am pleased to state that they seem to be carefully and conservatively managed and in safe and sound condition. One of the most crying needs in the conduct of these a ciations, in my opinion, is a uniform practicable system of bookkeeping among all the associations. This Department has been advocating this for a number of years, and I think some progress along this line has been made. I am presenting this report to you, well satisfied with the showing made.
