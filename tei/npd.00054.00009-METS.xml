            <seg id="p011">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 11 complained to the Interstate Commerce Commission concerning the maintenance of lower rates on corn, oats, rye and barley than are simultaneously maintained on wheat. They contended that these coarse grains should pay the same charge as wheat moving between any two given points of origin and destination. In view of the large volume of coarse grain production in this state, this was a case of unusual importance to Nebraska. Members of the Commission and its staff of experts and counsel played an important part in this case resisting the demand for higher rates on coarse grain. K the coarse grain rate had been increased up to the basis applicable on wheat in this state Nebraska farmers would have been called upon to pay additional freight charges amounting to over a million dollars per annum. By a supplemental decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission in Docket 12929. rendered June 4, 1923, the contentions of this Commission and associated western state commissions were fully sustained and the carriers were not permitted to increase their coarse grain rates and Nebraska farmers were saved from the large annual loss referred to. Brick Rates In what is known as the Ballou Brick case, I. C. C. Docket 12708, shippers at Sioux City attacked the rates on brick to destinations in Nebraska and also contended that rates between stations in Nebraska disc riminated against Sioux City, by reason of the fact that Nebraska rates were lower for equal distances. This Commission intervened in the Ballou case and contended that the rates from Sioux City to Nebraska consuming points should in no case exceed the rates applicable for equal distances between stations in Nebraska. The decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission in this case required the establishment of rates from Sioux City to Nebraska points upon the basis of rates applicable in this state for equal distances and also provided for a lower scale of rates on low grade common building brick as described in the decision. Following this decision an investi - gation of Nebraska brick rates applicable on common brick was made under our Resolution No. 80. (See Part III.) After considering the evidence submitted the Commission established rates on common brick lieiween points in Nebraska upon the basis prescribed by the Inter - state Commerce Commission in the Ballou case. Joint rates on brick were also established which result in substantial reductions in the charges applicable on shipments moving over two or more railroads. Recent negotiations between brick producers, railroads serving Kansas and Nebraska and representatives of this Commission will probably result in the establishment of lower brick rates to destinations In northern Kansas and will materially assist Nebraska manufacturers of brick in selling their product in that market. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Class Ratre I Lines serving Nebraska which reach Kansas City and St. Joseph, isonri, filed tariffs reducing the class rates applicable from those es without making a similar deduction in the rates from Nebraska bing points to the same destinations in this state. For some years t the class rates from various Nebraska jobbing points and from the es ot Kansas City and St. Joseph, Missouri, have been upon the le basis (or equal distances to Nebraska consuming stations. It refore appeared that the proposed reductions from Kansas City and Joseph would bring about unjust discrimination against Nebraska ben. The Commission was instrumental in bringing about a sus - ision of the reduced rates in question and upon investigation the erstate Commerce Commission held that the proposed rates were awful and the defendant carriers were not permitted to make m effective. I There is also pending before the Interstate Commerce Commission case involving the propriety and lawfulness of interstate class rates tween Sioux City and Council Bluffs, Iowa, St. Joseph and Kansas ty, Missouri, and Atchison and Leavenworth, Kansas, and all stations this state as compared with the class rates applicable between all itions in Nebraska. This is a very important proceeding which will obably come on for hearing in the near future. Coal Rates In a general investigation made by the Interstate Commerce ommission known as "Western Coal Rates Case," rates on coal from olorado and New Mexico mines to stations in eastern Colorado adja - nt to the Nebraska state line were substantially reduced without aking any adjustment of rates to Nebraska destinations in adjoining rritory. The Commission took up with Nebraska lines, the question establishing coal rates to Nebraska consuming points which would te properly related to the new rates to eastern Colorado destinations. he interested lines informed us that they realized the necessity of ome rate adjustments but did not feel that they could properly take any action in view of the complaint of the Colorado &amp; New Mexico oal Operators' association, involving rates on coal from Colorado and New Mexico mines to all points in Nebraska and adjoining states. pon investigation we found that this complaint proposed a readjust - ent of coal rates from Colorado which might bring about reductions n the rates from that field, or advances in the rates from other coal roducing territories such as Illinois, Kansas, Arkansas and Wyoming, r both reductions from Colorado and increases from competing fields. We therefore intervened in the Colorado Coal Operators' case, Docket o. 14855, and representatives of the Commission attended the hearing f the Interstate Commerce Commission involving this matter and pro- </seg>
            <seg id="p013">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 13 duced testimony bearing upon the case. In general the Commission took the position that Nebraska being a state without fuel resources of its own, is interested in securing fuel from all possible sources of supply in order to protect the people of the state from failure of its fuel supply and to give them the benefit of competition between coal pro - ducers. The testimony in this case shows that the Nebraska coal market is supplied from some fifteen or twenty different states. Briefs were filed maintaining the position that reductions should be made to rates on coal from Colorado mines to Nebraska destinations but that no increases should be made, applicable from competing coal producing areas. This case has now been submitted to the Interstate Commerce Commission and a decision will probably be made public In the near future. The Western Grain Rate Case There was pending at the time our last report was issued, a case involving all grain rates between Nebraska stations and interstate markets as part of a general proceeding before the Interstate Com - merce Commission known as Docket No. 14393, Involving the grain rates of all the principal western grain producing states. In July the Interstate Commerce Commission handed down a tentative decision holding that the evidence before it did not justify an order reducing rates on grain but the case was reopened to afford an opportunity to present further testimony upon certain subjects referred to In the re - port of the Commission. Further hearings with respect to this matter have been held at Kansas City and Minneapolis, in connection with which members of the Commission and its experts have taken an active part, both in the production of testimony and the conduct of the case generally. This case will be submitted to the Interstate Commerce Commission early in the coming year and it is hoped that the reduction in grain rates asked will be granted. If reductions in rates are made the decision will no doubt be handed down in time to make the new rates applicable on next season's grain crop. COOPERATION WITH THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION Under the provisions of Section 13, paragraph 4 of the Interstate Commerce Act as amended February 29, 1920, the Interstate Com - merce Commission is authorized to avail itself of the services, records and assistance of the regulatory bodies of the various states and to proceed jointly with the various state commissions to hear, try and determine cases involving similar issues as to the rates, fares and charges of carriers engaged in furnishing transportation for both state and interstate commerce. Prior to the passage of this legislation a </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 shipper could complain to the Interstate Commerce Commission con - cerning alleged unlawful discrimination said to exist in the relation - ship between the interstate rates applying from points outside to points within a particular state as compared with the rates maintained for sim - ilar service between points both of which were located in the same state. Upon the filing of such a complaint it became the duty of the Inter - state Commerce Commission to hear the evidence and hand down a decision on the issues raised, without being able to avail itself of the cooperation of local authorities who are conversant with the rate adjustment under attack. Under these circumstances the opponents of state regulation said that there was serious conflict between state and federal auhorities and that the state authorities should be elimin - ated from the field of common carrier regulation by a federal statute giving the Interstate Commerce Commission complete control over both state and interstate rates. While it is true that there was serious doubts in the minds of very able constitutional lawyers as to the power of Congress to give federal authorities complete control over both state and interstate rates, the representatives of the railroads made an earnest and concerted effort to bring about such legislation. Since the passage of the "cooperative provisions" of the Interstate Commerce Act in Section 13, paragraph 4, a number of cases have been jointly heard, tried and determined by the Interstate Commerce Commission and the various state commissions, which show that the alleged con - flict of authority which was said to be of a serious nature was not in fact an unsurmountable difficulty. The Commission is directing atten - tion to certain cases in which the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Nebraska Commission have considered issues involving both state and interstate rates affecting Nebraska. Th«* lAvf St&lt;M'k Cmc Under I. C. C. Docket 13273, the Interstate Commerce Commi--ii&gt;n nstituted an investigation as to the lawfulness and propriety of all tes applicable on common live stock between every station in ebraska and the markets at Sioux City. Iowa, St. Joseph and Kansas ty, Missouri and the relationship batWMS the interstate rates in ques - on and the rates applicable on this commodity between points in this ate, including the important live stock markets at Omaha and Ne - raska City. Commissioner Browne sat with Examiner Disque to take le testimony in this case and the state was represented by Assistant ttorney General Hugh LaMaster and Rate Expert Little, who was assisting the Attorney General's department in this proceeding. Simul - neously, by Resolution No. 74, the Commission instituted an investi - ation as to the lawfulness of all rates on ordinary live stock in car - oad lots applicable between stations in Nebraska. Briefs were filed nd arguments were had by interested parties before the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Nebraska Commission, acting under he co-operative provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act. Numerous </seg>
            <seg id="p015">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 15 conferences have been held by members of the two commissions and it seems certain that the very difficult rate questions involved in this proceeding will be disposed of in a harmonious decision of both com - missions which will conserve the proper interests of both state and interstate commerce in live stock. The Hog Minimum Case As a result of rather general complaints in the western territory as to the carload minimum weight of 17,000 pounds applicable on hogs in standard 36-foot cars, the Interstate Commerce Commission instituted an investigation as to the lawfulness and propriety of the minimum weights applicable on hogs in carload lots. Acting under the provisions of section 13, paragraph 4, of the Interstate Commerce Act, state commissioners from states vitally affected by this question were asked to sit with members of the Interstate Commerce Commis - sion to hear this case and decide the issues presented. For Nebraska, Commissioner Browne sat with the members of the Interstate Com - merce Commission, who heard this case throughout the entire pro - ceeding. As a result of the joint consideration of this matter the minimum weight applicable on 3 6-foot standard cars of hogs was re - duced from 17,000 pounds to 16,500 pounds. The record in this pro - ceeding showB that the 17,000 pound carload minimum formerly in effect necessitated the extreme crowding of certain types of hogs which resulted in substantial losses in transit which were a matter of con - stant controversy between hog shippers and the carriers. The decision in this case will relieve this difficulty and should be of substantial benefit to hog shippers generally. The Express Case It will be remembered that before the war there were a number of express companies operating in various parts of the United States upon certain lines with which each company had contracts. After the terminaton of government war-time control of the railroads the vari - ous express company lines were consolidated into a large nation-wide system known as the American Railway Express company. As a result of a considerable volume of complaints, some of which alleged that the consolidated company should and could do business at a lower cost than the various companies existing before the war, the Interstate Commerce Commission instituted an investigation upon its own motion as to the lawfulness and propriety of the express rates applicable in all parts of the United States and particularly as to the lawfulness of the rates applicable in each of the several zones, governing the appli - cation of express rates, in and of themselves, and as related one to the other. It has long been the contention of those familiar with the express rate structure that express rates in the zone in which Nebraska is located, are too high as compared with rates applicable in other </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 sections of the country and particularly in the eastern states. To assist In determining the (acts a committee of western state commissioners was formed to produce testimony for submission to the Interstate Commerce Commission. Before the subject was assigned for hearing the Interstate Commerce Commission invited the state commissions to appoint a committee to participate in the hearing and trial of the express case. Chairman Taylor served on this committee. As a result of this cooperative proceeding, an order was issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission which will undoubtedly result in a substantial revision of the express rates applicable on merchandise traffic generally and on many special commodities. I The Commission feels that these cooperative proceedings have le a great deal to eliminate the apparent conflicts between state 1 federal authorities, which formerly were referred to as showing futility and impropriety of state regulation. The cooperative cases ■e generally tended to show that the alleged conflict of authority ween state and federal commissions was in fact more apparent than 1 and that a full understanding of the facts and circumstances in - red will usually permit the interested commissions to reach a monious decision.

The evidence presented was wholly confined to provisions of con - tracts between the Farmers Grain &amp; Lumber company of Dodge, Ne - braska, and the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company, the Cedar Rapids Elevator of Cedar Rapids, Nebraska, and the Union Pacific </seg>

It was stated, however, that these were merely illustrative and that the complainants desired such rules and regulations to be promulgated by this Commission as might be reason - ably applied at ail points within the state on defendants' railroads. Complainants allege chiefly 1. That for many years they paid a nominal rental for the ground leased from the railroad companies merely to protect the title In the lessor and that recent changes had been made by defendants in the conditions of the leases whereby the rental had been very greatly increased in amount. 2. That complainants have constructed permanent improve - ments on leased lands in fancied security that previous relationships between complainant and defendant would be continued and now, by - reason of such investments, can no longer deal arm's length with de - fendants a3 to terms of contracts. 3. That the present charges are too high and the method em - ployed by the defendant carriers in arriving at the amount of rental is unfair in that it takes no account of the lessened value of the lease - holds, because of limitations contained in contracts. t4. That so far as elevator companies doing a general business concerned they are really acting as agents of the common carrier performance of public functions, viz.; the furnishing of facilities for proper handling of freight tendered for transportation, and that by reason of this agency relationship the carriers have been relieved from spending large amounts for facilities and that this relief should be an offset to the rental charges.

That the Commission assume jurisdiction and control of the tracts and agreements concerning elevator sites along the various defendants' lines; that the terms and conditions be controlled; and that the rentals be defined as to maximum amount in a manner which will be just and reasonable to all concerned. defendant, Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company, de - ds chiefly upon two grounds: bl. That a nominal rental charge may, and usually does, result in rimination between shippers and is in consequence in violation he interstate commerce act, the Elkins act as amended, and the burn act as amended. </seg>
            <seg id="p133">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 133 2. That the federal government has so occupied the field with respect to the rental charges for industries on railroad rights-of-way as to preclude state authorities from consideration of and making valid decisions concerning matters here complained of. The Union Pacific Railroad company and the St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island Railway company defend on other grounds. They allege: 1. That the relationship between lessee and lessor in the matters complained of are not transactions between the public and common carrier, but are purely private transactions over which the state and its duly constituted authorities have no power of supervision. 2. That the carrier is not required to lease grounds and in con - sequence when it does so lease may do so upon such terms as it sees fit. 3. That the elevator companies are in no sense agents, perform - ing a transportation service. 4. That even if the state has the power of supervision over lease - hold contracts of the nature here considered there is nothing in the statute that would warrant the conclusion that power had been vested in the State Railway Commission to supervise such transactions. There is thus presented questions of law and questions of fact, the former wholly confined to whether the Commission has the juris- diction alleged by complainants and the latter relating to the level of the rental charges, the basis of arriving at them, and whether they are unreasonable or unduly high. It is clear that we are first concerned with the limitations upon the scope of the supervisory power of Commission In Hampton Lumber &amp; Coal Co. v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., Formal Complaint No. 405, the same questions were presented but with n very different setting of facts. Intervenors attempted to broaden the scope of the hearing to include all the kinds of industries here involved, but no proper presentation of the law of the case was made. For that reason we confined our conclusions to the particular instances involved in the complaint and found we had no jurisdiction. The present complaint presents no such uncertain record and it has been ably briefed on both sides. We cannot agree with the contention of counsel for the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company that the federal government has excluded the state from consideration of the matters complained of. It is true that the Hepburn act and the Elkins act forbid discriminations and preferences of all kinds as between shippers doing business by in- </seg>

If an order were entered by this Commission obedience to which would require a carrier to violate a federal statute such order would be null and void. We know of no place where the Interstate Commerce Commission has issued an order regarding leasing of industry sites, although it has indicated repeatedly its position regarding discrimin - ations growing out of methods of leasing right-of-way to private in - dustry. Were the Interstate Commerce Commission to issue an order affecting interstate carriers this Commission could issue no valid order which would undo the work of the Interstate Commerce Commission within its legitimate scope. But in the absence of such an order there appear to be no crossing of jurisdictions in the question at issue. Atlantic OMri Line v. Georgia, 284 I . S. 281. LWe come then to the contentions of defendants Union Pacific iroad and Grand Island Railway Companies. They allege that com - plainants have asked this Commission to entertain a complaint and to make investigations, to issue orders which relate entirely to privau - transactions and which are, therefore, beyond the scope of the Com - mission to inquire into. It is alleged that by section 5318, Compiled Statutes of 1922, ample relief is afforded any shipper to secure just and proper treatment from a railroad company in the matter of op - portunity to secure reasonable and adequate switching facilities. This statute, however, does not cover the relief sought by complainants for in each instance they already occupy leased grounds on which they have erected extensive and permanent improvements and from which they cannot readily escape. We do not agree with complainants that elevators on railroad right-of-way are agents of the carriers in the performance of transportation functions. V. S. ex rel. Northwestern Warehouse Co. v. Oregon R. &amp; Navigation Co. 159 Fed. (»7o. It is clear enough that in this great grain producing country where one thousand cars a year sometimes are shipped from one station, elevation of grain into railroad cars is a necessary facility at stations. In the absence of proper facilities for the handling of grain into railroad cars the carrier could probably be required to con - struct e;evutors, to operate them, and to accept grain and be respon - sible for it from the time it is dumped into the elevator pit. For such service the carrier would be entitled to reasonable compensation. It does not, however, perform such a service because no necessity has arisen. Private corporations in sufficient numbers have volunteered to perform the service of grain elevation and even of grain storage and </seg>
            <seg id="p135">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 135 the rates charged by the carrier are bottomed upon a condition of receipt in the railroad car and responsibility dating from the billing of the car. To say that the elevator is the agent of the railroad com - pany and that the transportation act begins when the purchaser dumps the grain into the elevator pit is to say at once that all the functions of the elevator are common carrier functions and that the charges for services are as equally under regulation as are those of the railroad itself. Such conclusion is strained reasoning, as well as unde - sirable result. Defendants rely chiefly on the decision of the Cnited States supreme court in Missouri Pacific- v. Stale of Nebraska, 104 I'. 8. 4O3, wherein it was held that a requirement by the state that a railway company lease ground for an elevator against its will was taking of private property without due process of law and that such effort was null and void. This decision has been referred to repeatedly in other cases. 159 Fed. 175; 44 L. B. A. 1133; 175 U. S. 91; 50 Neb. 899. In that case the court said that the carriers were free to lease or deny a lease; to lease to one and deny to another. In Southern I'arifli- Terminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 219 U. 8. 4»8, this same case was somewhat relied upon by appellants. In that case a shipping corporation, doing terminal work only, was found by the court to be an integral part of a common carrier system. It had leased ground owned by defendant to one shipper and others alleged that such lease constituted discrimination against those who were denied, and per force had to be denied, equal advantages. The carrier pleaded its right to do as it pleased in leasing its lands not presently required for use of the general public. The court said in that onnection "It was further found that the terminal company had indi - cated that it is not willing to accord shippers generally such facil - ities, and that the situation of its docks with respect to space is such that it cannot do so even if it were willing. It may be con - tended that the patrons of a railroad are not obliged to seek or compete for extraordinary facilities in its terminals. But, be that as it may, all shippers must be treated alike." And in the same case the court said: "Appellants bring forward the same arguments to support the contention under consideration which they advance to sup - port their first contention, to wit, the right, as owner of the prop - erty, to make a lease of its 'unused property,' subject only to the limitation that there shall be no interference 'with the use of the adjacent navigable waters.' It would seem that, if the argument have any force at all, it would extend the rights of ownership to used as well as unused property and be exercised in any form of preference, even to the exclusion of some shippers from the wharves." </seg>
            <seg id="p136">136 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Turning then to the case relied upon here chiefly, Missouri Pacific Railroad Co. v. Nebraska, supra, to ascertain the reason for the apparent conflict in the conclusions of the high court, we find that the court emphasized that it was dealing with a purely private enterprise. The court said: "They do not appear to have been incorporated by the state for any public purpose whatever; or to have themselves intended to establish an elevator for the use of the public. On the con - trary, their own application to the railroad company, as recited to their complaint* '"was to store from time to time the cereal products of the farms and leaseholds of complainants aforesaid, as well as the products of other neighboring farms." (This view of the nature of the business which was seeking a ation on the right-of-way was repeatedly alluded to and it was ther pointed out that the order required the railroad company to int a lease upon a portion of the right-of-way to the elevator com - inants "without reserving any control of the use of such land, or of s building to be erected thereon, to the railroad company for the ■ommodation of its own business, or for the convenience of the blic," and in reaching an adverse conclusion the court said that it confined itself "to what is necessary for the decision of the I.. fore it." In Hartford Insurance Co. v. C. M. £ St. P. K\. Co. 175 U. 8. 01, referred to by defendant, the conclusions in the Missouri Pariflr case, supra, were approvingly cited, but in that &lt;-as.- the court said: "The indenture contains no stipulation concerning, or even any mention, of, any transportation of goods over the railroad, or any relation of the railroad company as a common carrier to the lessee or to the public; and there is nothing in the record to show that such a relation existed between the railroad company and the lessee, or that the warehouse was built or maintained for the benefit of the public, or of the railroad corporation, or of any one but the partnership." Consideration of these cases leads us to the conclusion that in ealing with shippers the carrier is not free to exclude such applicants or leases as it sees fit, or to treat its relationships with lessees as an ntirely private transaction. Defendant, North Western Railway ompany, concedes that in the matter of making leases of right-of-way t is under close restriction not to grant preference or advantage to one lipper over another; in other words, its common carrier obligations n this respect extend to the lease transactions. Hence, it would ppear to be conceded by defendant that in this respect, at least, the arrier is not conducting a purely private transaction when leasing ground to an industry. This point seems to be partly conceded by de - endant Union Pacific Railroad company in brief, wherein it is stated lat the railroad company is entirely free in the matter of entering </seg>
            <seg id="p137">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 137 into leases or refusing to do so, or in the terms and conditions of leases, but that the proposition "may be subject to the possible ex - ception that the granting of elevator leases for nominal rental mar constitute an undue preference or an unlawful discrimination." It is the duty of this Commission, under the law, to protect shippers by railroad and patrons of all common carriers from unjust discrimination and undue preference to competitors. It cannot, of course, in the exercise of that function, require the carrier to violate any law of the United States or order of the Interstate Commerce Com - mission within the sphere where the federal government operates. It would appear that this Commission's duty is to investigate charges of discriminations alleged to exist in the relations of carrier and competitive shippers. We are impelled to the conclusion that if in the rental of railroad right-of-way to different shippers a discriminatory condition is brought about this Commission must upon proof of that fact, order its removal. Likewise if discrimination results by reason of relationship of lessor and lessee, between a railroad company and one shipper as compared with the carrier's relationship with another shipper not enjoying a leasehold, such discrimination would have to be removed and the Commission would have jurisdiction to hear com - plaint in the premises. It seems, therefore, that the Commission would have to pass on the reasonableness per se of the contract relationship in determining whether or not discrimination existed and that it would not, therefore, to secure jurisdiction on a question of the level of the rental, have to have before it a discrimination case, because it would exist indirectly lease terms were onerous, even though not alleged. It is obvious that in the exercise of such jurisdiction, which we here find to exist, great care must be used by the Commission not to unduly interfere with the amount of rental charged by the carrier on a leasehold where it can prove in the methods used in arriving at the reasonableness of such a rental. We are unable to agree with complainants that the old condition of nominal rental is proper. Competing industries are differently located on the right-of-way, the one having decided preference over the other and receiving from the carrier more valuable privileges. If the same rental is charged to each, discrimination results. If one competing industry at a station has a valuable leasehold from a carrier, for which it pays but a nominal rental, while its competitor, arriving late, has been compelled to purchase private ground, construct a side track thereto, and pay taxes and interest on the Investment, such shipper is probably at a disadvantage by reason of the relationship of Ids competitor and the railroad company. It may constitute a dis - crimination. The railroad company owns the right-of-way, on which </seg>
            <seg id="p138">138 It demands a fair return for a fair value. If the rates charged for its services to a shipper who has no leasehold privileges are partly for the purpose of earning a return on leaseholds, for which no adequate rental is received, inequality results to such shippers. We can see no off-setting valuable consideration from the in - dustry to the carrier. The industry is there for private gain and for no other purpose. If it is performing a function which the carrier would otherwise have to perform, it must not be forgotten that the carrier would be entitled to compensation in the performance of that function, which compensation it does not receive when the private industry is granted the opportunity to furnish the facility. It is urged that grain is loaded more rapidly by leassees than if scooped from wagons by producers, and that carrier secures higher efficiency and revenue from its equipment. It must be adnitted. we think, that the alternative to use of lessees' facilities for loading would not be loading from wagons, but existing or equally modern facilities would be furnished by the railroads. It is further urged by complainants that the practice of the carrier in measuring the value of leased right-of-way land by the value of Adjacent land and charging a fair percentage on such figure i- m equitable because the value of the leasehold is diminished by con - ditions of indefinite tenure, release of liability from fire and other damage, and requirments to observe certain rules of lessor. There is merit in this contention. The extent of the modification of value is considerably dependent upon the possibility and probability of can - cellation of the lease and requirement to move the improvements from the land. It is further modified by the value of being adjacent to a sidetrack without the necessity of investing in a spur track. On the whole we conclude that the Commission has jurisdiction in the premises; that a reasonable return on a reasonable value of the land leased is equitable and that upon complaint conclusions as to the fairness of these provisions must necessarily rest upon the facts of the individual situation. We are now prepared to discuss the facts presented on hearing regarding the four complainants who allege that the increased annual rentals demanded by the carrier in consideration of renewal of lease - holds are unreasonably high. The essential facts concerning each complainant are as follows: The Farmers Grain &amp; Lumber Company of IKmIro, Nebraska. The riplainant leases about 37,350 square feet of land on the south side the tracks of the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company, </seg>
            <seg id="p139">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 139 located on the railway right-of-way, in addition to owning some private ground adjacent. The town lies mostly or entirely on the north side of the railroad. The valuators of the railroad company compared assessed valuation of the city lots with sale values of the same lots and applied this ratio to lots immediately adjacent to the railroad right-of-way on the north side and on the south side. They found the average value of land by this method on the north side to be 7 '-2 cents per square foot and on the south side to be 1.38 cents per square foot. Local judges of real estate values fix the value of lots immediately north of the right-of-way at values ranging from 4 cents to 7.9 cents per square foot and on the south side adjacent to the leasehold at 1.6 cents per square foot. In using this method the company averaged values on the north side and the south side of the right-of-way and reached a figure of 4.44 cents. Complainant alleged that it had paid $16 rental in 1912 and was asked to pay $67 rental now tor the same ground. It was alleged also that the location is not good and that a price of $900 paid for one - half acre immediately adjoining the leasehold was a price well beyond market values which it was required to pay to secure the particular tract. Complainant showed that the state considers the entire right- of-way within the town of Dodge as worth $1000 per acre for taxation purposes. Complainant rents something less than one acre. Exeter Elevator Company of Exeter, Nebraska. Complainant leases a tract of ground on the right-of-way of the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company north of the industry track and three or lour blocks east of the main street of the town but immediately ad - jacent to a north and south highway leading into the town. The company has found a value of 2 l : cents per square foot for this leasehold on which it charges complainant six per cent per annum rental. The railroad company pays the taxes on the land. In support of this conclusion, the company sets forth that it has the record of one sale of land one block south of the industry site at a price of 2 1-6 cents per square foot. On the ratio of valuations for taxation and sale values where they can be found, the company finds the land im - mediately north of the industry site to be 1.6 cents per square foot. Local opinion from bankers and real estate dealers put an average value of 2.7 cents per foot on adjacent land. For taxation purposes the state finds the value of the entire right-of-way through the town of Exeter to be $1300 per acre. For leasing purposes the company finds the land in the locality to be leased to be worth $1100 per acre. Complainant alleges that from the knowledge obtained as to sales and proffered sales of lots in the locality occupied by the elevator the land is worth not much in excess of $200 per acre. Between 1911 and 1916 the company charged a rental of $30 per year, for the next five years $39 per annum, and is now demanding </seg>
            <seg id="p140">140 Eper year. Complainant chiefly objects to the rapid rise In rental ges and to the fact that on another railroad through the town lnal rentals are still being charged. Farmers Elevator Company of Carleton, Nebraska. This com - ainant occupies 15,840 square feet of right-of-way of the St. Joseph Grand Island Railway company Immediately adjacent to the main ghway north and south into the town and slightly more than one - lalf block from the main business corner of the small village. The mount of land leased to complainant is slightly more than one-third an acre. Complainant bases its objection to the proposed rental $47 per year on alleged excessive valuation of the land and to the omparative rates which have been paid for the same locality in the ast. Predecessor of complainant originally paid $3 per annum for he location. In 1917 this was raised to $7 per year. The company ow desires a very lafge increase. Complainant's manager also says tat he has been offered lots two or three blocks removed from the cation of its elevator at a price approximately $200 per acre. De - endant sets forth the average values given its valuator by local pinion witnesses as 3.7 cents per foot on the south side of the right - -way fairly adjacent to the main highway and on the north side of he right-of-way 10 cents per foot. The company used 5 cents per oot as the value on which to base the rental. Complainant put into le record that the state uses an average value for the entire right - -way through the town of $600 per acre in assessing taxes against le railroad company. The location of the elevator is on the most aluable part of the right-of-way, judged by its location to traffic and the business center. Cedar Rapids Elevator Company of Cedar Rapids, Nebraska. The nion Pacific Railroad company runs northwest and southeast through he edge of Cedar Rapids. The main street of the town crosses the railroad's right-of-way and runs east and west. The depot is im - ediately adjacent to the main street. Complainant's elevator is on he town side of the right-of-way from one-half block to one block stant from the main street and three or four blocks distant from le center of the business section of the town. Complainant rents 9,200 square feet, all on the right-of-way. The objection of com - ainant is that it is asked to pay $80 a year rental, or 6 per cent on value of approximately $2000 an acre. Complainant says that private lots immediately adjacent to the leased land are worth about $150 each, or 2 cen;s per square foot. The company finds from the relation of assessment values to sales values that the least valuable ground occupied by complainant is worth 3.4 cents per foot and the more valuable ground 6.7 cents per foot. It has used a figure of 6.07 cents in arriving at a value for rental </seg>
            <seg id="p141">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 141 Complainant testified that land on the opposite Bide of the right - of-way is farm land and is worth not to exceed $300 per acre. The town is platted to the railroad on the east side of the track and is partially built up with residences. For taxation purposes the state has estimated the entire right-of-way through Cedar Rapids as $950 an acre. The company says the land leased is worth $1800. Com - plainant says it is worth $600. The state tax commissioner says that for taxation purposes the amount of land in the leasehold is worth $700 as an average for all the right-of-way in the town. The land occupied by complainant is undoubtedly considerably more valuable that the average of the right-of-way. These are the facts presented on which we are asked to pass judgment. Plats ofthe various towns were used in testimony, but none were filed as evidence. The question is presented as to whether the right-of-way is worth, as much for rental purposes as a similar amount of ground immedi - ately adjacent. The evidence rather indicates that complainants have measured the adjacent land with particalar reference to its value for residence purposes and land immediately adjacent to the railroad is not valuable for these purposes. Its industry value increases as the railroad is approached. It is also true that the rental measure of the value of the leased ground is diminished by the possibility of removal on thirty days' notice if the land is needed for railroad purposes and by the further ftct that other clauses in the contracts lessen the value of the lease - hold. The lessened value of leaseholds, due to clauses providing for exemption from responsibility for fire damage, can be measured in the difference in insurance rates. There is no evidence presented on that phase. There is probably added rental value to an industry site on a railroad right-of-way over adjacent land by reason of its im - mediate proximity to trackage. The value of that proximity to trackage can be measured. The state of the record in this case is such that if we are to pass on the level of the annual rental charge of the four complainants in the light of the conclusions stated above it must be guess work. We are not prepared to guess. In the matter of comparisons of values complainants and defendants are far apart. In the matter of the effect of certain factors on the amount of rental that would be reasonable, the record is silent. We will reopen this case for further testimony, the date of taking such testimony to be fixed at the convenience of the parties. We will also grant the privilege at that time to intervenera to present other, </seg>

Such additional matter shall be filed with us in ample season that defendants may have opportunity to prepare testi - mony in support of whatever rental is now being charged. In the light of these conclusions, no order will be entered at this time. The record already made will form the groundwork for further testimony and, thereafter, such order will issue as the facts warrant.

            <seg id="p143">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 143 the hearing contended itself with an explanation of how the rate situ ation arose. Shipments from the city of Lincoln to points on the North West - ern south of Linwood must be routed by way of the Platte River Junc - tion, seven miles west of Fremont, a distance of thirty-eight miles more than shipments to same destinations arising at Fremont. Prior to 1916 there was substantial parity of rates from Fremont and Lin - coln and all points south of Brainard on the Superior line and south of David City on the Hastings line. As a result of the order in the Nebraska-Missouri River cases, 40 I. C. C. 201, a distance scale was put into effect from Fremont to all points in controversy. From Lincoln the North Western elected to meet the short line competition of the Burlington and the Union Pacific at Exeter, Geneva, Davenport and Superior and on the Hastings line at David City, York and Harvard. Due to the long and short haul provision of the Nebraska statutes intermediate points on defendant's lines were protected by a not greater rate than was given to the crossings with the short line com - petitor. The result of this rate structure was to permit Lincoln ship - pers to have the same rate at Dwight as Fremont shippers secured, although the distance from Fremont was forty-seven and from Lincoln eighty-five miles. On the Hastings line the Union Pacific made the rate to David City. The North Western met that short line competi - tion and by protecting the intermediate points gave Lincoln the David City rate as far back as Morse Bluff. The tables appended illustrate on first-class rates the rate struc - tures complained of. The same relative situation exists for all other classes.

It seems reasonably evident that complainants have good grounds for their protests on the rate structures from Fremont into territory south of Linwood as compared with the rate structure from Lincoln into that same territory. There are three possible methods by which the situation com- plained of can be remedied. </seg>
            <seg id="p145">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 145 (a) The North Western can make application to this Commis - sion tor authority to depart from observing the long and short haul provision of the Nebraska statutes to the extent of permitting meeting the short line competition at crossings Exeter and south, and David City and south, and of fllxing the rates at intermediate points on a parity with the straight distance scale to the same points from Fremont. (b) Reduce the rates from Fremont to the Lincoln basis, thereby giving to Fremont the advantage of rates brought about by short line competition from Lincoln whereas the same short line factor does not exist from Fremont. (c) A compromise of the above two proposals. We will discuss these proposals briefly: (a) This proposal would raise the rates from Lincoln to North Western points intermediate to the crossings where the rates are con - trolled by short line competitors, but if these rates were limited to the distance rates accorded Fremont shippers it would still permit Lincoln shippers a much lower rate than they would have on straight distance scales and a rate not in excess of the joint rates which they might en joy if they so elected. It is obviously essential If the North Western is to compete with the Burlington and the Union Pacific at the crossings it must meet their short line rates. Complainant urges that oven at these crossings it should not be at a disadvantage with Lincoln when its distance is less via the North Western. We cannot see the force of this comtentlon. We cannot require the North Western against its will to depart from the observance of the long and short haul provision of the statute. Section 5512, Revised Statutes for 1922, says: "If any railway company or common carrier subject to the provisions of this article, through or by Its officers, agents or em - ployees, shall charge or receive any greater compensation in the aggregate for the transportation of like kind of property or pas - sengers for a shorter than for a longer distance over the same line the same shall constitute an unjust discrimination which li hereby prohibited: Provided, upon application to the Commis - sion any railroad may in special cases, to prevent manifest injury, be authorized by the Commission to charge less for longer than for shorter distances for transporting persons and property, and the Commission shall from time to time prescribe the extent to which such designated railway company or common carrier may be relieved from the operation of this provision." (b) Fremont shippers prefer that their rates from Fremont to points under dispute be reduced to the level enjoyed for longer dis- </seg>
            <seg id="p146">146 tance by Lincoln shippers. To this extent they would enjoy less than the standard scale from the Jobbing points in Nebraska but mile (or mile would still have higher rates than those given to Lincoln shippers on account of the short line competition. It is urged that such a re - duction from Fremont would work to the serious disadvantage of in - terested competitors in Council Bluffs, Sioux City and Chicago and other eastern origins and would thereby constitute an undue prejudice against interstate commerce. This does not appear to be the result. For example, the rates from Chicago to Fremont and to Lincoln are the same as each is based on the same arbitrary over the Missouri river. If Fremont is then permitted to change into the territory here being discussed the rates nut lower than those from Lincoln to the same territory interstate commerce would be at no greater disadvan - tage by reason of Fremont shipments than now exists by reason of Lincoln competition. 1(c) If compromise rates are approved they could only be de - ded on the ground of traffic necessities. llltUKK I IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway mmission that, effective on or before March 15. 1923, the Chicago &amp; &gt;rth Western Railway company publish rates on class freight from emont, Nebraska, to destinations south of Linwood on the Superior d Hastings lines not in excess of the rates now published and in ect to the same destinations from Lincoln.

Lute, secretary Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation, Lincoln, Judge J. L. Root, for the carriers generally, R. C. Fyfe, Chicago, chairman Western and Consolidated Clas - sification Committees. F. Montmorency, general freight agent for the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R Co., especially. OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: tThe complainant is a producer and shipper of pure bred livestock, se residence and principal place of business is Lincoln. It appears, ever, that complainant buys and sells pure bred live stock at ous points in the state outside of Lincoln. The gravamen of the complaint is that the classification ratings established in both the Western and Nebraska Classifications, and the class rates applicable to pure bred live stock in less than carload quantities between all stations in Nebraska, are unjust and unreason - able per se and relatively, and that the maintenance of such unreason - able classification ratings and class rates operates to unduly restrict the movement, sale and production of pure bred live stock in Nebraska. We are asked to prescribe just and reasonable classification ratings and class rates in lieu of those here under attack. Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation was permitted to join in complaint, and it was treated as a party to the proceeding. Testimony was offered by the complainant in chief and the rep - esentative of the Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation. Complainants' stimony shows that there is much dissatisfaction with the freight larges assessed on less than carload live stock shipments in this ate. This complaint of shippers is alleged to find practical expn the substitution of motor trucks for rail transportation, the refusal 1 prospective buyers to purchase animals on account of the relation ' freight charges to purchase price and an increasing sale of pure bred ve stock for slaughter. It is contended that the charges now ap- </seg>
            <seg id="p149">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 149 plicable on this traffic in relation to present prices of pure bred live stock, impose a greater relative burden than charges in effect before the war, in relation to prices then prevailing. Complainant alleges and defendants do not deny that there are very few, if any, claims filed in connection with these shipments. It is urged that the sale and dissemination of pure bred live stock has improved the quality and increased the quantity of live stock raised on Nebraska farms and has operated to greatly increase the carload movement of stock. Defendants state that, generally speaking, the movement of live stock in less than carloads requires the use of a car for a single animal, that expedited and expensive service Is rendered in its move - ment, that the revenues derived from cars so employed is low as com - pared with carload earnings on the same commodity, and that on ac - count of the high value of animals transported, the freight charges are a comparatively unimportant part of the cost of animals delivered. Chairman Fyfe of the Western Classification Committee urged the desirability of classification uniformity and called attention to the fact that the ratings now published in the Western Classification and applicable between Nebraska jobbing points and all Nebraska stations are the result of the orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission 111 National Society of Records Association, et al. v. Aberdeen and) Kockflsh Railroad Co., et al., 40 I. C. C, 347, as modified in I. &amp; S. Docket 956 — in re Live Stock Classification, 47 I. C. C, 335. These cases brought by an association having a membership of 100,000 live - stock breeders, involved all railroads in the United States and sought uniformity in classification ratings governing less than carload live stock shipments in all parts of the United States. At the time the National Society of Records case, supra, was heard, the ratings and estimated weights applicable on less than car - load shipments of live stock in the Western Classification were sub - stantially the same as those named in the Nebraska Classification. As a matter of fact, the existing estimated weights governing live - stock shipments as shown in our Nebraska Classification, correspond very closely with the minimum weights found reasonable for applica - tion throughout the United States in the National Society case. The effect of this decision was to leave the minimum weights on the principal classes of live stock upon substantially an unchanged basis in the Western Classification territory, and to add thereto provisions for special minima governing small live stock, or pairs of animals such as a cow and calf or horse and colt, which corresponded very closely with provisions for similar traffic in Southern Classification territory. The new uniform ratings, however, required very considerable reduc - tions in the minima applicable in Official Classification Territory, the minimum on stallions or jacks being reduced from 7,000 to 3,000 pounds, on horses, mules or horned animals from 5,000 to 2,000 </seg>
            <seg id="p150">150 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT pounds and on additional horses, mules or horned animals from 3,000 to 1,500 pounds. Following the decision in the National Society case, lines serving Official and Southern Classification territories, attempted to increase the ratings applicable on less than carload live stock to a point which would compensate them for loss of revenues resulting from reduction in the minimum weights referred to. The changes in question were suspended by the Interstate Commerce Commission, and after hearing, a decision in I. tk S. IKH-ket No. !»54&gt; was made in November, 1917 in - creasing the minimum weights authorized in the National Society run' to the basis now published in the Consolidated Classification. Mbm no similar case was then pending before the Nebraska Commission and no application was made by Nebraska lines for authority to es - tablish minima upon the same basis as that existing in the Western Classification, no simultaneous change was made in Nebraska sificatiou ratings, and there are at present some differences in the minimum weights applicable under the Nebraska Classification be - tween non-jobbing points, and those applicable between the jobbing Knts and other Nebraska .station issification. shown in the current \\ tin addition to the differences Western Classification and the differences in the class rates in minimum weights w Nebraska Classification, there are applicable between jobbing points El other Nebraska stations, as compared with the class rates applir - e between all so-called non-jobbing points. Upon the hearing of 3 case, complainant virtually abandoned any effort to show that class rates applicable between non-jobbing points, or that the ratings shown in Nebraska Classification, were unjust or unreasonable. The testimony deals primarily with the ratings named in the Western Classification and the rates applicable between the jobbing points and other stations in Nebraska. I Since the ratings applicable on less than carload shipments of e stock are generally upon the base of first class rate or higher, s complaint raises an issue as to the reasonableness of class rates plicable between the Nebraska jobbing points and all destinations, this state. The class rates in question were prescribed by the erstate Commerce Commission in the Missouri River — Nebraska le, 40 I. C. C. 201, and displaced the equalized class rate adjust - nt which then existed as the result of our General Order No. 19. e Interstate Commerce Commission has recently set down a general estigation as to the lawfulness of class rates applicable from inter - te points on or east of the Mississippi river or on the Missouri river Nebraska destinations, in their relationship to rates between braska stations. A similar investigation is being undertaken by s Commission and, in view of this fact, the general question ot </seg>
            <seg id="p151">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 151 reasonableness of class rates raised by this complaint cannot be dis - posed of in this proceeding. In the National Society of Records cuse, supra, and in the testimony submitted in this proceeding, the carriers have laid great stress upon the proposition that less than carload shipments usually consist of a single animal which is generally given a separate car, by reason of the necessity of expeditious movement and by reason of the alleged fact that some difficulty would be experienced in loading dead freight in a car containing live animals. The mimimum weights governing less than carload live stock are somewhat lower than the minimum weights applicable on ship - ments of light and bulky freight too large to be loaded in the side door of a 36-foot box car or too long to be loaded through the end door of such cars, or which require an open car for their transportation. The minimum weight on such light and bulky dead freight is on the Iiums of 4,000 pounds at first class rates. It is obvious, however, that the same reasons which seem to justify the application of these weights on dead freight do not govern the handling of less than car - load live stock, and the fact that it is possible to load more than one animal in a car, or a certain amount of other freight with less than carload live stock, has been largely responsible for the differences in the minima on less than carload live stock as compared with light and bulky articles. The fact in this case, as stated by both complainant and de - fendants, seem to indicate the desirability of finding some new clas - sification rule which would have the effect of reducing transportation costs in connection with less than carload shipments, and if possible reduce the number of cars required for transportation of such ship - ments by increasing the loading of each car. The decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission in I. &amp; S. Docket No. 956, 47 I. C. C. 335, at page 342, provided for the carriage of small live stock in less than carloads on the basis of actual weight where the weight exceeds 3,000 pounds. The rule in question, as pre - scribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission, is reproduced below: Small live stock in less than carloads Calves (six months old or under), goats, sheep, or hogs will be subject to a minimum of 3,000 pounds for each shipment from one shipper to one consignee and destination, and when the weight of any one shipment exceeds 3,000 pounds actual weight shall be charged for, except that where it is impracticable to ascertain actual weight at point of origin or destination each animal will be charged at an estimated weight of 250 pounds, provided that in no case shall less than minimum weight of 3,000 pounds be </seg>
            <seg id="p152">152 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT applied upon the entire shipment, and further, that in no case shall the charge on basis of less-than-carload rate and actual, estimated or minimum weights exceed the charge on basis of car - load rate and minimum carload weight for a single-deck car ap - plicable to the animal or animals in the shipment taking the high - est carload rate and highest minimum carload weight (See note). Note. — When small live stock Is shipped with animals of the kinds named in items 2, 3 or 4 above, the latter, in less than car - loads, shall be subject to the estimated weights provided therefor, and the small live stock forming part of the same shipment will be charged at actual weight, first-class rate, except that where it is impracticable to ascertain the actual weight of the small live stock at point of origin or destination each animal shall be charged at estimated weight of 250 pounds." The rule in question, as carried in the current Western Clas- sification, now reads as follows Weight Rating "Calves (six months or under), goats, sheep or hogs, when from one shipper to one consignee, when the weight exceeds 3,000 pounds, actual weight will apply.

            <seg id="p155">155 NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: The complaint in this case brings in issue the practices of the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company at Omaha with reference to the non-absorption of switching charges of other lines at that point in connection with shipments of hay originating on its line, destined to Omaha and reconsigned at that point for delivery at the Union Stock Yards. Complainants allege that the Omaha Hay Exchange maintains an inspection service, as a result of which shippers can as- certain the grade of hay received at Omaha and its condition, having reference to national inspection standards, which operates to facilitate the sale of hay and to prevent waste of terminal services and attending congestion due to switching of refused cars which have not been of - ficially inspected. The inspection service is said to protect both shippers and carriers in the determination of the liability of the delivering line for loss and damage claims. The Hay Exchange con - tends that by rule 3 of C. &amp; N. W. Tariff 8419-F respondent has pro - vided for absorption of the switching charges of intermediate lines, necessary for the movement of hay from the inspection tracks at Omaha to the interchange track of the Union Stock Yards Company at South Omaha. Complainant and respondent agree that the Union Stock Yards Company charges for effecting ultimate delivery must be absorbed in accordance with G. F. D. 8419-F, subject to the provisions of the tariff as to minimum revenues. Respondent asserts that its Tariff G. F. D. 8419-F is not subject to the construction placed upon it by complainant, and contends that the movement from the hay inspection track to South Omaha involves a back haul of a line haul character, and that the absorption provisions apply to Omaha and South Omaha separately, as two distinct switching districts. Tariffs on file with the Commission show that rates on hay from C. &amp; N. W. points of origin are published to Omaha, and that South Omaha takes Omaha rates. South Omaha is part of the city of Omaha, and lines reaching South Omaha maintain a joint agency at that point, primarily to facilitate the traffic handled to and from the Union Stock Yards. By rule 3, section 3 of its Tariff G. F. D. 16390-C, the respondent provides that hay or straw, carloads, will be placed on its hold tracks, and that notice will be given to consignee either directly or by post - ing as to the arrival and placement of such cars for inspection, either at billed destination or at a point directly intermediate thereto. Cars so placed and held for inspection are subject to reconsigning charges </seg>
            <seg id="p156">156 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT of |2.25 per car. The record clearly shows that the C. 6 N. W. Ry. Co. has established a hay inspection track at Omaha which is gen - erally satisfactory to complainants. While the record shows that the hay inspection service is only afforded on shipments from C. &amp; N. \V points to industries at Omaha proper, it clearly appears that other lines have established hay inspection tracks from which cars may be moved on reconsignment to any industry located within the switching limits' of the city of Omaha, including South Omaha. It seems clear that the spirit and intent of the hay inspection reconsigning privilege la to provide a single inspection track for the use of all industries at Omaha and South Omaha. It appears that respondent construes its reconsigning and switching absorption tariff to provide for inspection of hay at Omaha and the absorption of C. B. &amp; Q. switching charges to Ralston, which is, in fact, a station outside the switching limits of Omaha. Complainant contends that rules 1 and 3 of section 2 of C. ft N. W. Tariff 8419-F must be construed as providing for the absorp - tion of switching charges on hay inspected at Omaha, for ultimate delivery at the Union Stock Yards, or the present practices of respon - dent must be condemned as unreasonable and unduly discriminatory, and hence unlawful. Respondent's switching tariff shows that it has direct track con - nections with the Missouri Pacific at South Omaha, and that all other lines at that point are reached via the rails of the Union Stock Yards Company. It is therefore clear that when C. &amp; N. W. G. F. D. 8419-F provides for the absorption of connecting line switching charges at South Omaha, it covers the charges of the Missouri Pacific and Union Stock Yards, with which direct connections are made; and the charges of other South Omaha lines plus the charges of the Union Stock Yards as an intermediate line at that point. The construction of absorption rules 1 and 3 in G. F. D. 8419-F, for which complainant contends would require the defendant to interchange South Omaha traffic destined to off-line industries with the delivering switching line at Omaha, instead of via the rails of the Union Stock Yards Company as an intermediate line at South Omaha, as provided in respondent's Switching Tariff G. F. D. 8419-F. Under all the circumstances, we are of the opinion that rules 1 and 3 of section 2 of C. &amp; N. W. G. F. D. 8419-F do not provide for the absorption of the switching charges of the Missouri Pacific or other intermediate line, where hay is reconsigned from the hay inspection track at Omaha for final delivery at the Union Stock The record, however, makes it clear to the Commission that it is unreasonable for defendant to deny consignees at South Omaha the benefit of hay inspection privileges, and it also appears that the ex - tension of hay inspection privileges to Omaha and Ralston hay dealers and consignees, and the denial of similar facilities to South Omaha hay dealers and consignees creates and gives Omaha hay dealers and </seg>
            <seg id="p157">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 157 consignees an undue preference or advantage, and subjects South Omaha hay dealers and consignees to undue prejudice and disadvan - tage. We are of the opinion and find that the respondent should cease and desist from the violations of law above mentioned, and that it should either place all hay consigned to South Omaha on the hay in - spection tracks at Omaha and then move it to South Omaha, subject to the switching absorption provisions of its Tariff G. F. D. 8419-F, or it should afford adequate trackage and facilities for the inspection of hay at South Omaha, in connection with which existing absorptions should be continued. An order will be entered to give effect to these findings.

For Iola Cement Mills Traffic Assn., B. L. Glover, Kansas City For Nebraska State Railway Commission, J. A. Little, rate expert OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION The complainant, Nebraska Cement Company, is a Nebraska orporation engaged in the manufacture of cement at its plant located ear Superior. It is alleged that the rates on cement established by lie Commission under its order in Resolution No. 70 from Superior stations in Nebraska east, north and northeast of Superior, as re - ated to the rates established from competing mills located outside of ebraska under and by virtue of an order of the Interstate Com - erce Commission in I. C. C. Docket S182. 69 I. C. C. 644, are un - uly discriminatory and unlawfully prejudicial to Superior and prefer - ntial of cement manufacturers outside of Nebraska. In substance, the complaint is directed primarily at reductions in rates from cement producting points in the Gas Belt district of Kansas to various destinations in eastern and southeastern Nebraska which are greater in cents per hundred pounds than the reductions resulting from our order as applied to rates from Superior to the same Complainant's case is based quite largely upon the theory of equalization of Superior with the Gas Belt mills in sout east Nebraska and in north and east Nebraska covered by lines operating between Omaha and Sioux City. To accomplish this proposition, the suggestion is made that a rate of 12 cents per hundred pounds be established </seg>
            <seg id="p159">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 159 '.rom Superior to Omaha and a rate of 12.5 cents per hundred pounds be established from Superior to South Sioux City. It is contended that rates from Superior to southeast Nebraska, which may be roughly defined as that portion of Nebraska lying south and east of the main line of the Rock Island railroad, extending from Omaha through Lincoln to the Kansas-Nebraska line, should never exceed the rate maintained from Superior to Omaha. I'nder our order in Resolution No. 70, we required all Nebraska lines to establish rates on cement in carload lots, applicable between all stations in Nebraska over not to exceed three lines, upon a distance hMta, with the exception of cement moving from Superior to Omaha, on which a special commodity rate of 12.5 cents per cwt. was fixed and applied as a maximum intermediate on the reasonably direct lined carrying traffic from Superior to Omaha. In view of the very large cement consuming capacity concentrated in the city of Omaha, and i nvirons, a relatively larger volume of traffic might be expected to move from Superior to that point than for equal distances to other ties or villages in this state, and it was felt that a rate somewhat wer than that resulting from the distance scale was justified In this connection, it should be remembered that it is the practice of icment companies to make relatively low prices on their product when sold at large cities, which are termed "dumping points" for the purpose of securing a volume of production which will enable the plant to keep in operation at a relatively low cost for its total output. In these cities the competition between mills is very keen and rates are usually made upon a basis which will permit and continue this com - nu rcial competition between producers. While we consider the rate which we established from Superior to Omaha just and reasonable under all of the existing circumstances, we are of the opinion that It is upon a basis which should permit Superior to compete with other ment manufacturers for the sale of cement at Omaha. The cement mills located in what is known as the Gas' Belt district of Kansas also enjoy rates from that territory to Omaha upon a basis lower than the distance scale otherwise applicable, which was estab - lished by the Interstate Commerce Commission in a decision which apparently took into account the commercial competition between cement manufacturers at certain points like Omaha, which were called key points in deciding Western Cement Rates, 48 I. C. C. 201, page 241. As a result of general increases and reductions made effective since the decision referred to, the key point rate named to apply from the Gas Belt to Omaha was 16 cents per hundred pounds upon the date of the supplementary decision of the Interstate Commerce Com- </seg>
            <seg id="p160">160 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT mission dealing with Western Cement Rates, reported in 69 I. C. C. at page 644. The key point rate of 16 cents per cwt., from the Gas Belt to Omaha was not applied generally as a maximum at intermedi - ate points, on lines handling cement from the Kansas Gas Belt to Omaha. For example, the rate on cement from the Gas Belt to Lincoln at that time was 19 cents per cwt., although the Rock Island and Bur - lington joined in carrying cement which might move through Lincoln, for 16 cents per cwt., from the Gas Belt to Omaha. In this most recent decision affecting interstate commerce, lines' serving the Gas Belt were required to establish rates not higher than 16 cents per cwt., applicable to points intermediate to Omaha, to eliminate viola - tions of the long and short haul provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act. It will be observed that, as a result of the order of the Inter - state Commerce Commission, rates on cement from the Gas Belt to Omaha were applied as a maximum at all intermediate points on the reasonably direct lines from point of origin to destination, in exactly the same manner that Nebraska lines were compelled to apply the rates on cement from Superior to Omaha as a maximum at all inter - mediate points on direct lines. To illustrate the alleged discrimin - ation complained of, attention is directed by complainant to the fart that the rate from the Gas Belt to Lincoln, which was formerly 19 cents per cwt., was reduced to 16 cents per cwt., although the distance rate for the mileage traversed would amount to 17 cents; while at the same time the rate from Superior to Lincoln was increased from 1 1 cents to the distance rate basis of 11.5 cents per cwt. As we under - stand complainant's contention, he seeks a rate from Superior to Lincoln as much lower than 11.5 cents as the 16 cent rate from the Gas Belt to Lincoln is lower than the distance rate of 17 &lt;ents. other - wise applicable, which would result in a rate of 11 cents per hundred pounds from Superior to Lincoln. The rate from the Gas Helt to Beatrice was reduced from 17 to lti rents per cwt. and tiie distance rate otherwise applicable is also It; rents per cwt. The rate from Superior to Beatrice was 11 cents per cut. and increased on a distance basis to 11.5 cents per cwt., which is identical with the situation existing in the rate adjustment from Superior to Lincoln. This alleged principle of rate-making in one cas-e would reduce the rat.- to Lincoln and permit the rate to Beatrice to stand as at present although before our decision in Resolution Xo. T#, the rates to these points were on a parity, and under the distance scales prescribed in that de - cision, that parity was continued. When our decision with respect to rates from Superior and between Nebraska points generally was rendered, the rate from Superior to Nebraska City and Crete was upon the basis of 12.5 cents per hundred pounds and the rate from the Gas Belt mills to these destinations was 18.5 cents per cwt. Under the distance scale now applicable from Superior, the rate to Nebraska City became 13.5 cents per cwt. and the rate to Crete became 11.5 cents per cwt., and under the same distance scale the rate from the </seg>
            <seg id="p161">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 161 Gas Belt to Crete became 16.5 cents per cwt., which is the same rate that would apply to Nebraska City, if the 16 cent rate from the Gas Belt to Omaha were not applied as a maximum at Nebraska Ci.y, which is an intermediate point on the Missouri Pacific Railroad. As we understand complainant's contention, it is that the rate from Superior to Nebraska City should not exceed 12 cents per cwt. because the rate from the Gas Belt to Nebraska City has been estab - lished upon a basis less than the distance scale. In this connection, it is clear that if the rates from Superior to Nebraska City and Crete were to be made with relation only to the rates from the Gas Belt to those points, the rate to Crete should not be lower than the rate 10 Nebraska City, which would deprive consumers at Crete of their natural advantages of location in greater proximity to the ceme~.it plant at Superior. From these illustrations, it is clear that the readjustment of rat;?s from the Gas Belt to points in southeastern Nebraska, upon a basis not in excess of the Omaha rate applied as a maximum at these inter - mediate points does not afford any uniform or workable standard with reference to which the rates from Superior to these points might be adjusted without producing unjust discrimination between the con - suming points located in that territory. Complainant has not shown any necessity or justification for fly - ing lower rates on cement from Superior to destinations in southeast or eastern Nebraska than are simultaneously applied for equal distances from Superior to other destinations in Nebraska. Generally speaking, Superior now enjoys rates on cement to southeast and easter.i Nebraska, as low or lower than any competing plant located outside of Nebraska. We are of the opinion and so find that the rates established by our order in Resolution No. 70 from Superior to points in south - eastern and eastern Nebraska are not unjust or unreasonable nor un - duly prejudicial or discriminatory against Superior, and this complai'.t will, therefore, be dismissed.

SCBSTITITK ORDKR BY THE COMMISSION: This matter came on to be beard on the complaint of Joseph F. Kovar v. Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company, wherein it is alleged that the railroad track of the defendant company crosses his land and that the plaintiff does not now have an adequate and safe means of crossing said track. Plaintiff alleges that a sub-grade cross - ing with a cross-section of six by seven feet under defendant's track will be required to serve his purposes. A hearing on the matter was held by the Commission at its offices in Lincoln, April 3, 1923. LThe testimony shows that the plaintiff is the owner of the north - t quarter of section 12, township 15 north, range 2 east, 6th P. M. in Butler county, Nebraska, and has been the owner of and resident on the above described property for about five years, and that the de - fendant's railroad track crosses the same in a northwesterly direction beginning at a point about two hundred sixty-six feet west of the southeast corner of said quarter section and leaves the property at a point about three hundred feet east of the northwest corner. It also shows that the plaintiff is engaged in farming and stock-raising, and that it is necessary to use a grade crossing in passing between the parts of his farm which have been severed by the railroad. It also shows that it is necessary for the plaintiff to drive his stock across de - fendant's track in order to move them from his pasture to his im - provements where water is located. Among other estimates the defendant offered one of $1042 based upon the assumption that a concrete seventy-two inch pipe could be installed on a non-traffic day when the equipment therefor was In that neighborhood and the cost attendant upon transportation eliminated. The Commission finds that the plaintiff is the owner of the land on both sides of defendant's railroad track on the northwest quarter of section 12, township 15 north, range 2 east, 6th P.

            <seg id="p174">174 FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 471 (it&gt; of Lincoln, Complainant v. Tin- Lincoln Traction Company, Defendant OPINION AMI KIMUM; BROWNE, Commissioner t Complainant alleges that the present fares and charges of The icoln Traction company, defendant, are disorimnaiory and un - isonable in that the first zone of service dots not include that •tion of the city which was formerly known as Normal. It sets two grounds of complaint, first, lliat the former village of Normal now part of the city, is within the city limits, and should pay no higher fare than is paid elsewhere within the city limn Ethe excess fare of two cents paid by patrons riding to and from portion of the city formerly known as Normal has the effect of rring traffic to such an extent that the higher tare toaa not result in higher gross revenues from the 1 articular traffic involv This matter was tiled by tht ty o:' Lincolc Edification of a previous rate ord re established more than ten year ion, has recorded this matter as ■&lt;, r. Inasmuch as the rate z ago the Commission, on it s formal complain Complainant and defendant hav submitted for of the Commission a stipulation which has to do with tbe smmd point raised by complainant in its allegation of unreasonableness and discrimination, viz.: that the present fares are so high as to result in actual diminution of gross revenues from the traffic involved. This stipulation avoids the present necessity for hearing on the complaint. It provides that by actual test of sixty days, beginning April 17. ltSS, the question of the effect on traffic of the charge for an outer zone between Normal and the business part of the city shall be determined and the results of such test shall be used in hearing on the matter. kThe stipulation does not commit either party to the rase on the stion of whether zone limits should properly be equivalent to city its, or at least not less than the city limits. It is suggested in the stipulation that the conductor on the car operating between Normal and the business section of the city shall at the point where the outer zone charge is now collected make a record of all passengers riding through the zone limit on each trip of each day during the test period. It is agreed that this r </seg>
            <seg id="p175">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 175 shall be filed with the Commission from week to week. It is also agreed that representatives of the public, or of the city of Lincoln, may make like tecords and through the city attorney's office file same for purposes of comparison and that both parties shall have access from week to week to the records made by all parties to the case. The stipulation appears to the Commission to be reasonable under all the circumstances and the purposes of the stipulation de- sirable.

OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This complaint was filed in April, 1923, by the city of Lincoln, In which it alleged that first zone boundaries of defendant company </seg>
            <seg id="p176">176 fuld correspond with the city limits and that to the extent that they 1 not do so they were discriminatory. It was alleged further that s extra two cents charged for those who ride beyond the zone ndary in the direction of what was formerly Normal had a serious erring effect on traffic, and that if the second zone two cents were .oved the increased traffic would offset the loss of revenue due to .uced rate. As to the first proposition, the Commission never did take the 0 itlon that the zones of service had anything to do with the limits the city. They were made at points which were reasonably con - . lent to both public and company in the matter of collecting the nd zone additional fare, and particularly for the purpose of requir - | the long rider to pay something more than the short rider. At the me the two zone rates were put into effect in 1912 the order desig - ated the city limits at only one point. The other points were be - mi the city limits. The second allegation of the petition relative to the effect on volume of traffic of the higher outer zone fare presented a very im - portant question. It was somewhat necessarily a matter of opinion To relieve the question somewhat of conjecture complainant and de - fendant entered into a stipulation, which was duly filed with the Com - iid, that for sixty days the outer zone fare on the line from Lincoln to what was formerly Normal should be removed and a care- ! check on traffic be kept in order to ascertain the effect of the re - i.-ed fare to the outer zone. The stipulation stated that either the ublic or the city of Lincoln might makt additional checks. Weekly ports were filed with the complainant and with the Commission aa the result of the study. Complainant does not raise the gui-Mi.m to the accuracy of the studies made. Some question was raised by e representative of the public in that vicinity. The trial period was, &gt;y agreement between the parties, extended one additional week so at it represented approximately ten weeks of trial period. The com - any had the record of the zone passengers on the line in question in 922 by corresponding weeks, but in order to be fair to the trial it had adjust this traffic record to represent the constantly diminishing olume of traffic experienced on all lines of the system. It did reduce y an average percentage. The record of zone passengers for the period pril 16, to June 18, 1923, inclusive, showed 21,864 zone riders as pposed to 19,298 in the same period of 1922, and estimated 1922 olume less the average slump of the whole system of 18,411 pas - ii am, This showed an increase in number of passengers in esti - d amount 3,453. To offset the reduced fare would have required . ii passengers. The city attorney raises the question that the result is not con - clusive in that it would be more valuable if extended a still longer </seg>
            <seg id="p177">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 177 period. We think it reasonably conclusive as an answer to the second proposition raised by the city. It does show that reduced tares will have some effect on increasing traffic, but that the increase will be con - siderably less than the reduction in the rate resulting in net loss of revenue less than the actual percentage of reduction in the rate, but nevertheless a net loss. By the terms of the order and the stipulation the reduced fares will automatically expire with the close of business June 23 without further order from the Commission. This case must, however, be disposed of. As to the first point raised by the city, the Commission finds that it was never the intention to have zone fares necessarily coincide with city limits. There does not, however, appear to be any justification for a considerably shorter zone in the direction of Normal than In the direction of College View, Lancaster, or the hospital for the insane. This case does not present the question of too limited a zone in the direction of Normal and we make no finding because of that fact. We do recommend that the zone limit be extended to approximately three and one-half miles from the central point of the government square in the direction of Normal, thereby corresponding fairly closely to zone limits in other direction. No order will be entered on this at this time, but if the company does not take the necessary steps to extend the zone limit the question can be raised either on motion of the Com - mission or on complaint. As to the second point, we find that the contention of complain - ants was Hot borne out by test. The contention, therefore, falls. If the further question were raised as to whether the company can afford the loss of revenue, admitting the existence of loss of revenue, that question will be decided by the Commission in the near future in passing 011 the permanent rates of The Lincoln Traction company at the same time the value of the property is fixed under Application No. 3667-A.

            <seg id="p182">182 SIXTEENTH ANN PAL REPORT O1MXIOX AM) FINDING TAYLOR, Chairman The Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Kailroad company proposes, a hange in the running time of the freight train which it operates be - ween Aurora and Hastings. At the present time the freight leaves urora at 5:30 a. m. and arrives at Hastings at 7:20 a. m. Running om Hastings it departs at 3:4U p. m. and reaches Aurora at 5:10 . m. The railroad company had ordered a change in the schedule so lat the freight would leave Aurora at 7:00 p. m. and reach Hastings 9:00 p. m., the schedule from Hastings to Aurora to remain un - langed. The change had been ordered to become effective on Febru - y 12, 1923, but upon ItflMI of the Commission, following com - aints from Hastings, Giltner, and Trumbull, the matter was deterred tending an inquiry. Hearing was held at the offices of the Commission n Saturday, February 2 4. It developed at this hearing ihat tin- railroad company to make the change in its freight service because of vigor plaints, of long-standing, submitted to i by wholesaler shippers at Grand Island who an desiro is of a more dir to the territory west and south of Hastings. As a resul ing of these complaints the company decided to pu schedule. Representatives of the Grand Island shippers were present at the hearing and vigorously ur*;ed that the new service h tgo into effect. Their testimony shows that there ar le live carloads of merchandise and other freight Island, daily, destined to points south and west of Hastings. These shipments go to Aurora on an evening freight and the follow ing are taken as far as Hastings by the freight involved herein they remain until night or the following morning when they prut to their destination. This twenty-four-hoar delay would if the freight from Aurora to Hastings is changed so as t ii evening at seven o'clock. It would then take these cars from (Iran Island and deliver them at Hastings so that connection could be made with southbound and westbound freights that night, or the next morning. The people of Trumbull and Giltner protest the change largely because it would interfere with their mail service. At the present time the morning freight carries a pouch mail, which delivers daily papers and letters from the east. If the change is made, the first mail received at these towns will be on the passenger from Hastings at about 11:30 at Trumbull and 12:10 at Giltner. It is possible, how - ever, that a pouch service can be handled o&amp; the freight leaving Aurora at seven o'clock in the evening, which would carry mail from eastern </seg>
            <seg id="p183">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 183 V t It is the impairment of the mail service which the representa - the two intermediate towns stress. They point out there is a sire on the part of people in their territory to go to Hastings and urn the same day, which they cannot do under the proposed company showed, however, that not to exceed one pas- i her day made the nip to Hastings on tue freight, so ;iui this traffic is insignificant. The Hastings Chamber of Commerce bjecta lo the change on two grounds; first, that it prevents people u coming from the Giltner and Trumbull territories into Hastings do their shopping; and, second, that Grand Island wholesalers uld not be permitted to go into the Hastings territory on an even ting with the Hastings shippers. It is conceded by taem that if has not been more than one passengtr every other day that the [ obj&lt; iiion is more or less unimportant, although they contend that ■n the highways are in bad condition many more people use the ght. Tney admit, also, that Hastings jobbers' and other shippers into most of the territory west and northwest of Grand Island on ally the same service basis as do the shippers at Grand Is. and. li is a long-established policy, initiated by the railroad companies approved by regulating authorities, taat passenger trains are pro- imariiy (of passenger service and that all other service per - &gt;y them is a mere incident to the carrying of persons. Tuis approved this policy on more than one occasion and it as being equitable and sound. On the other hand eight trains are operated for the transportation of freight. In some more particularly on branch lines, they carry passengers. This, Wt a more incidental accommodation and it is generally at passengers on such freight trains must adjust them- elves to the lack of conveniences and to the irregularity of the sched- s incident to freight train service. Passenger trains cannot be halted handle Freight or express without impairing their service to the eling public Nor can freight train schedules be modified to meet demands of the traveling public so long as there are reasonable 4uate passenger facilities furnished on the line in question. The service involved in this case is purely that of transportation of freight. If, in the judgment of the company, its schedules on the branch between Aurora and Hastings have not been, and are not now, so arranged as to provide the best service to all of its patrons it is justified in so rearranging them as to meet that requirment. It follows, therefore, that the Commission will tot interfere and will leave to the company the right to exercise its own judgment in the premises. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the complaint herein be and the same hereby is dismissed. </seg>

Curtiss, Secretary (SEAL) nRIIKRS ON APPLICATIONS APPLICATION NO. 353» -A In the Matter of the Application of the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway Company for Authority to Publish Permanent Rates. Appearances For the applicant: Powell &amp; Wilson, attorneys For city of Omaha: W. C. Lambert corporation counsel For the Commission: B. E. Forbes, chief engineer. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: The original petition in this case, asking for authority to increase rates, was filed in May, 1918, during the period of repeatedly advanc - ing costs of operation. The city of Omaha tiled objections to the juris - diction of the Commission under the statute and this question was briefed and argued during the months of June and July of that year. The Commission overruled the objections and the application was set down for hearing on its merits, which hearings occurred in September and October, 1918. An order was entered December 17, 1918 (11 N. S. R. C. 396) denying emergency rates on the ground that no emerg - ency existed and the case was continued for hearing and findings of a permanent nature. On December 21, 1918, applicant appealed to the supreme court of Nebraska from the decision of the Commission. On July T, 1919, the court handed down a decision remanding the case to the Commis - sion with directions to find that an emergency did exist, to increase the rates to a suggested figure of six cents per fare, and to proceed there - after to make a physical valuation of the company's properties and L render a permanent decision on the basis of the findings of value I net earnings (12 N. S. R. C. 430). </seg>
            <seg id="p185">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 185 Pursuant to the directions of the court the Commission entered an order on August 6, 1919, (12 N. S. R. C. 385) fixing rates on the basis where they have since been maintained without change. The order also set out the procedure to be followed in the making of an inventory and valuation for the purpose of securing a rate basis for a permanent order. Among other directions to the company were: (a) A detailed inventory of property located in the state of Nebraska as of September 1, 1919. (b) The cost and the date of installation of all property in - cluded in the inventory "so far as the same can be ascertained from the records of the company." (c) The average unit price the ten year period, September 1, of all property in the inventory for 1909, to September 1, 1919. (d) The present condition percentages. of the property expressed in The making of the inventory was a heavy task. Applicant under - took to do this with its own staff of engineers and department, heads. The inventory, prepared with admirable care, was contained in one bound exhibit of 810 large pages. It was filed with the Commission May 5, 1921. In part it had been checked by the Commission? en - gineering department prior to filing and in part subsequent thereto. Hearings were begun at Omaha May 16, 1921, and continued from time to time upon direct evidence by the company until June 23. 1921. Cross-examination of the company's witnesses occured In September, 1921. From January to March, 1922, evidence was presented by the Commission's engineers on costs of the property as disclosed hv the books. Cross-examination and rebuttal testimony were concluded and the case submitted on March 10, 1922. The company's brief, con - sisting of almost 900 pages, was filed on June 20, and that of the city of Omaha on June 10, 1922. In all testimony was taken before two members of the Commis - sion on forty-four different days. Sixty-eight exhibits were filed con - taining approximately 1500 pages of tabulations. The transcribed testimony covered thousands of pages. At the conclusion of the presentation of the direct evidence of the company motion was filed for an emergency increase of fares based on that evidence to tide the company over until the conclusion of the elaborate permanent case. This motion was taken under advisement and on September 6. 1921, supplemental order was entered by the Commission denying the increase in rates and suggesting the advis - ability under all the circumstances of making up the known and </seg>
            <seg id="p186">186 titted deficiency in net earnings by moderate reductions in operat - expenses, particularly in payrolls. In brief the evidence of applicant consisted of: t(a( A history of the origin and development of the street rail - business of Omaha from the time of the first horse cars to the of 1920. (hi The additions and betterments showing on the books of the company as having been made to the plant from the beginning of 19+1 to the end of 1920. These additions and betterments did not reflect the cost of such additional property, but rather only the amounts which were charged against the capital account. t(c) Revenues and disbursements under major accounting head - throughout the period l'.m:', to li»20, inclusive, and in more detail the year 1920 and a portion of the year 1921. Li (1 i Theooretical studies of the proper allowance to be made in rate base for interest during construction, thes.- studies being ttomed upon a theoretical reconstruct on of the proper rs 1916 to 1919, inclusive. (c) A theoretical study to determine con 1(fi An inventory and valuation of the property m idled on two bases, namely: four-year average prices, 191 lusive; and prices as of September 1, 1919. k Despite the requirements in the order dated August ipany presented no comprehensive data on the cost perty. The reasons given for failing to do so were th were that possible to ascertain that changes had not been made on any unit which might be identified from the accounts as a portion of the exist - ing plant and hence it was impossible to state that the book accounts reflected the actual cost. The turther reason was given that a portion of the property estimated at betwene 10 and 2 0 per cent had constructed prior to 1903 and the books of account which might show the costs of such property, in whole or in part, were not available, having been destroyed in a fire. The company also did not comply fully with the order of the Commission in that it used average prices for four years of the abnormal period in arriving at value of inven - toried property, rather than average prices of a ten year period. Evi - dence was submitted to show that to secure the prices for the four year period had developed into a most tremendous task and that had it been extended over a ten-year period it would have been an almost insuperable undertaking. </seg>
            <seg id="p187">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 187 Because of applicant's failure to comply with the requirements of the Commission, counsel for the city of Omaha filed a motion for direction from the Commission to applicant to proceed to meet the requirements of the order of August 6, 1919, and to submit the data thereon prior to cross-examination on the evidence of the applicant. This motion was taken under advisement and later overruled because the Commission's engineers and accountants had made a careful and painstaking check of construction records of the company from 1903 to ltS*, inclusive, and had prepared a large number of exhibits based on the information there secured. This data was later put into the record through witnesses and it was deemed unnecessary to have the company duplicate. Certain expanded and detailed data from the liooks was. however, required from applicant, this data having to do with the construction of roadway than any other class of property. History of Omaha Street Railway Business The omaha Horse Car Railway company, which began construe- in l^tis. was the first venture of the series of that municipality inimon carrier transportation. This company began operation In Win in a very limited area, with cars at first only ten feet in .length later sixteen feet long. It expanded rather rapidly until 1S83 when financial necessities and other inducements led to a re-organ - ization. It went through at least one receivership and sheriff sale. In 1881 the company had somewhere from twenty-five to thirty-six f trackage, measured single line. It had seen its most rapid in • - ii t between 1883 and 1889, during which period it is allegetf jm $700,000 to $800,000 of money was invested in additions n and betterments. It had in that period constructed pavement, double- tracked its downtown lines, and acquired a total of seventy-five pas - senger cars and six hundred horses. In 18S9, it was consolidated into the Omaha Street Railway company on terms hereafter mentioned. It !■ said that during the life of this company it paid its stockholders no dividends in cash The cable tramway was a subsequent development, reflecting the demand of the citizens of Omaha for some faster and more up to date means of locomotion than cars drawn by horses or mules. The com - pany was organized in 1884 under franchise granted by the city, taCM construction in 18S6 and operation the following spring. It built all told somewhere from nine to eleven miles, measured single track, although much of the construction was double track. The con - struction was expensive, due to the very large amount of concrete necessary in a conduit beneath the track which carried the endless steel cable. What little history was available of this company in - dicated an expenditure of approximately $1,000,000 in the develop- Knt of this company. It was alleged by witnesses of the successor, ilicant in this case, that the company never operated under pros- </seg>
            <seg id="p188">188 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Eus circumstances. This company was the second member in the olidation in 1S89 into the Omaha Street Railway company. The ing of the electric street car spelled ruin (or this company, as it did horse car companies, but much sooner after its organization. As E-amway company it ceased business about 1893. After consolida - i above mentioned it was worked over into electric lines. Much the roadway, which was of heavier design than that of the horse company's roadway, was used for many years for operation of :tric cars. Other portions of the property were scrapped in 1893, luding power house machinery. The terms of consolidation, so far available, are mentioned hereafter. The Omaha Motor Railway company represented the next step of development. It used electric power from the first. It was organ - ized in 1887 and began operation in 1889. Its lines in part paralleled and duplicated the property of the earlier companies. Its twenty miles of trackage was of forty-five pound rail and were placed in pave - ment. These rails were of girder type. Its power plant was at 22nd and Nicholas streets. tThe Omaha Street Railway company was organized in lsS9 for purpose of bringing about consolidations, eliminating the com - tion which had been found more or less disastrous, and advancing opportunity of financing reconstruction into electric properties. The city of Omaha presented the filed articles of union and con - olidation, as recorded on March 4, 1889, in the county records, as vidence of the terms of this consolidation. These articles indicate hat the Omaha Horse Car Railway received $2,000,000 in stock and 500,000 in bonds, from the proceeds of which bonds the Horse Rail - ay company was to pay its funded indebtedness in approximately like mount. The Cable Tramway company received $2,O00,0tMi of stock nd $500,000 in bonds of the consolidated company, these latter to be sed as near as might be for retiring senior indebtedness. The con - olidated company also issued $750,000 of additional bonds, which ere placed in the hands of a trustee for a period of two years. The board of directors was empowered to withdraw from the trustee one - lird of this amount for additions and betterments and the remainder as to be used in paying interest on other bonds outstanding and at le end of two years any remainder was to be drawn down and used n the interests of the owners who had consolidated their properties. Six months later the consolidated company purchased the property of the Omaha Motor Railway company. County records, referred to by the city in cross-examination, are said to show that the terms of purchase included $1,000,000 in stock of the consolidated company, the Omaha Street Railway company, and $500,000 in bonds. Thus, the Omaha Street Railway company came out of the period of re-or- </seg>
            <seg id="p189">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 189 ganization at the end of 1889 with $5,000,000 of stock outstanding and with bonds somewhere between 11,500,000 and 12,250,000. Much ni its proprety was at the retirement stage due to obsolescence, this property including inadequate horse cars, horse cars roadway too light for electric lines, a large number of horses necessarily disposed of when the lines were electrified, and the power plant and cable of the Cable Tramway company. The last decade of the nineteenth century was a period of great activity in street railway business under the direction of the consoli - dated company. It saw a very considerable extension of lines, the complete electrification of all lines, the installation of larger cars, and the change from light rail to rail ranging in weight from forty-five to seventy-three pounds. It was the period of the Trans-Mississippi Ex - position and the very wide use of the street railway company's prop - erties by visitors. Funds tor the extensions were partly secured through additional sales of bonds until at the end of the decade there was outstanding $2,500,000 of first mortgage bonds. The Omaha Street Railway company, just prior to its purchase of the Omaha Motor Railway company, built a power plant at 19th and Nicholas street. During the decade succeeding the purchase and con - solidation the two power plants on Nicholas street served the entire needs of the unified transportation system. During the decade 1889-1900 the street railway company acquired a considerable number of other independently owned lines, some of which were merely franchises with no property and some of which wwn indifferently constructed horse car companies promoted as a means of developing real estate ventures. It will be seen from this brief resume that the fifteen years from l&gt;v; to Lit Si involved a period oi very rapid transition in municipal transportation and resulted in wide destruction of public utility prop - erties long before they had worn out, to make room for the next de - velopment. The development by no means stopped in 1898, but not again did the street railway business witpess so complete a loss of investment as that involved in the construction of the tramway system just prior to the beginning of electrical development. i In 1902 there began the final negotiations which resulted in the re-organization of the street railway properties into its present form. Theretofore the capital had been largely local, but in 1902 New York financial interests were persuaded to enter the field and to supply needed financial stability. All the properties west of the river, with minor exceptions, were owned by the Omaha Street Railway company. Other interests owned the street railway systems in Council Bluffs and </seg>
            <seg id="p190">190 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT he toll bridge across the Missouri river. The re-organization into the maha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway company, applicant herein. &gt;rought into the properties a long-time lease of the toll bridge and the reet railway lines in Council Bluffs and vicinity, as well as all the roperties owned by the Omaha Street Railway company. Th.- warn orporation began business January 1. 1903. It opened its books with figure of $14,840,562.72 under the heading "Property, Plant, Fran - lise and Lease." This was, however, a balancing item reached after le completion of the details of reorganization and the issue of se- curities thereunder. A mortgage was executed on December 1, 1902, covering the Issm ts put into the hands of a trustee for the purpose of paying th&gt; - derlying bonds inherited by the new orporation with the properties the Omaha Street Railway company. The first liabilities statement contains the following items O. &amp; ('. H. bonds reserved retire underlyin bonds O. &amp; C. B. bonds issued ;md Preferred stork outstandii Common stock bThe Omaha Street Railway company had broag liabilities of $2. 500,000 of bonds mid |t,M«.&lt; rd indicates that the New York financiers' had 1.470,000 in cash, which money was used for development parpMM nd for taking up maturing obligations of the Council Bluffs leased (roperties. These obligations were later repaid. ImUm thi - which was apparently paid in during the years 1M1 and 1!hi4, the lie* orporation had whatever value was involved in the lease of th* bridge and the Council Bluffs properties, which was estimated liy Um promoters as worth $1,000,000. By cancelling out the bonds common to the old and the new &lt; oni - anies we find that the process of reorganization had transformed 5,000,000 of common stock into $o,imio.ihmi of common stock. $4. - 00,000 of preferred stock, and $4. Son. (him of refunding bonds. The roperties had gained $1,470,000 in cash and the lease of the Coun.il luffs properties. Nothing in the record indicates the price at which he bonds were marketed. If they sold as low as eighty and the Coun - 1 Bluffs lease were brought in at a value of $1,000,000 to those who lad it to offer the common stock in the predecessor company was ulti - ately represented in the new company by an equal amount of com - on stock, $60 of preferred stock and $6u in bonds.

            <seg id="p191">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 191 The organizers of the new company arrived at the terms of con - olidatkM partly by figuring up an estimate of what all the preceding ompanies had cost, with interest on that cost, regardless of whether he property remained in existence in 1902 or not; partly by some com - lutations on earnings which had gone into the properties from the &gt;eginning of the street railway business down to date of reorganiza - inn; and partly by estimating the value of the possibilities of the coin- to ba realized from the growth of the city, the expansion of the rties and the constantly increasing density of traffic. The property acquired in 1902 by the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs t Railway company, the reorganized company, may be briefly ibed as follows: 1. About ninety-one miles of trackage, measured single track, ness section doubled-tracked, and mostly paved with brick and te block on sand base. The rail in the down-town section was seventy-three pound girder and partly lighter weight girder. The T rails in unpaved trackage ranged in weight from forty-five pounds p.r yard to seventy pounds. Between 350 and 400 cars, single and double truck, open and bodies, some of them inheritances from the horse car days, a pr— natlni the old cable design, incapable of being remodeled, any of them cars developed during the last decade of the nine- ntury jwer station at 22nd and Nicholas streets for the gener- electric energy. It contained seven horizontal tubular boilers, iss engines, seven direct current generators of total 800 horse ipacity and necessary switchboards and auxiliary machinery. iver plant at 19th and Nicholas street, equipped with wenty-two horizontal tubular boilers, water pumps, other boiler equip - lent. three engines, and generators capable of producing 1200 to 1800 ors&lt;- power. Part of this machinery was very efficient. Car barns and other real estate and buildings In 1 !tl&gt;4 the company began the construction of its present power plant, located on the bank of the Missouri river, the change having been made for the purpose of securing more economical manufacture of power. To this plant was moved some of the equipment from the Nicholas street power plants, but for the most part that power property was disposed of to the best advantage and while the buildings are still owned they are not used for power purposes. </seg>
            <seg id="p192">192 I This history is of importance in this case as it has been made background for certain accounting studies, presented by the com - ,y as one of the factors in arriving at the valuation of the properties med by it. We will deal, first, with the data presented by the lpany's accounting expert, from which he arrived at conclusions of sent value; ; second, with the inventories and valuations on two es presented by the company; third, with the valuation and con - sions presented by the Commission's engineering department, using roximately the same inventory as that of the company; fourth, with computations made by the company regarding interest and taxes Ing construction; and fifth, going value. The effect of present enues and expenses on the net return will be discussed after the b base has been determined. Company's Book Cost Studied Mr. Powell, expert acounting witness of applicant, in making up s study of book cost of the property, did not go back of 1903 be - use early records had been destroyed to such an extent as to render ny previous financial data only fragmentary. To arrive at his iod - usions as to the book cost of applicant's property at the end of 1M&lt; e started January 1, 1903, with an assumed value, of $11,350,000. lis figure he found by taking the sum of the preferred stock and the K&gt;nds and concluding that such value was reasonable because ordinary nancing of that day was conservative to the extent of the bonds and le preferred stock and that generally the common stock represented peculative value. To the starting figure he added the additions and betterments shown by the books between January 1, 1903, and December 31. 1920, in the sum of $5,596,068.31. At this point in his compilations lie de - parted from a study of the books and entered the field of conjecture to the extent of computing interest and taxes on the hypothesis pre - sented by the engineers of applicant, viz : a reproduction of the prop - erty during a four-year period. He also made studies, of deficits in return for the first six years after the reorganization and arrived at a figure of going value. By this means he added to his book studies the theoretical amount of $2,598,421,711 for interest and taxes and $1,825,000 as going value. The conclusions of this witness were that the "bare boms' Mai &lt;&gt;f the property was $16,946,068.31, which amount he increased by his theoretical computations to a figure of $21,394,490.01. These con - clusions corresponded closely to the company's engineering estimates of the four year average reproduction cost, which showed a "bare bones" cost plus certain loading items, such as purchase expense, storehouse and yard expense, contractor's profit, and shop expense, of $16,812,459.45, which the company theoretically loaded with interest </seg>
            <seg id="p193">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 193 and taxes and going value, using tbe figures of the accounting expert, to a total of $21,740,254.57. Mr. Powell's work was done in elaborate and pleasing detail. It presents much valuable data for cross-checking other data in evidence. However, it is of very little value in arriving at a book cost of the property because of various weaknesses, which may be summarized as follows: (a) The assumption under which the starting figure of value in 1903 was used is violent; (b) the starting figure under the assumption was incorrectly stated; (c) no accurate records have been kept since 19U3 of property displaced or abandoned; (d) the book cost of additions and betterments since January 1, 1903, very sub - stantially failed to reflect the actual book cost of the property installed during the period; (e) little reflection of actual over-head expenses, such as shop expense, store and yard expense, purchase expense, and engineering and superintendence occurs in the book costs. These points will be analyzed briefly. (a) The discussion heretofore had of the history of the predeces - sors of applicant indicates clearly that it is quite unsafe to assume any - thing regarding the securities as measuring the value of the property at any time. At the time of the consolidation in 1889 the issues of NeirtttM to the constituent companies were extremely liberal, as evidenced by the fact that within one year of the time the cable com - l&gt;;iny built properties costing approximately $1,000,000, it received in the consolidation $2,500,000 of securities and these securities were recognized fully in the reorganization in 1902. No one can tell how much property was built out of revenues between 1889 and the end The testimony was that, with the exception of the period of o the Trans-Mississippi exposition, the company experienced lean days, but the evidence of property constructed when offset against the addi - tional securities issued for construction purposes would not bear out ti.ii statement. Between 1889 and 1903 much of the property which came into the consolidation on the former date disappeared, due to obsolescence and entire reconstruction occurred. There was also built very close to thirty miles new trackage. The amount of securities sold during the period apparently did not exceed $500,000. Whether or not the property in existence January 1, 1903, had cost $11,350,000 depends entirely upon the amount of revenues earned between 1889 and 1903 and used tor new construction. Certainly with bo nebulous a record of that period there is no warrant for the as - sumption used by the expert. (b) The figure of $11,350,000 was erroneously taken, even under the assumption. The company's balance sheet at the end of one full year after the reorganization of 1903 showed that the treasury </seg>
            <seg id="p194">194 still contained $650,000 of the bonds which the witness had included as having prior to January 1, 1903, already been expended for property. These bonds in the treasury were sold and the money expended for betterments in 1904 and 1905. Hence, even under the assumption of the witness, which we are unable to accept, the figure is at least $650,000 too hig'.i for a beginning. (c) Property was not always retired from the plant account hen it actually ceased to exist. This is particularly true of machinery nd cars. During the years of electric operation, prior to 1904, power as furnished from a central station on Nicholas street. With the dvent of the turbine engine it was found advisable to change location o a point where cheap water for condensation might be secured and le beginnings of the present very substantial and up-to-date power ant were made. By the first of 1905 the new power station furnished he current. A small amount of machinery from the old power station as transferred to the new. The remainder was sold or scrapped, but le company's books show no credit to plant for the loss. Likewise, le accounting expert had assumed in his starting figure the cost of le existing property in 1903. The evidence shows that a very large art of the early car equipment was displaced and scrapped because utgrown or worn out and the books show that this property tM Eced at a figure representing its present worth in 1903 an( &gt;k cost, llenic. there still remains in the plant aceOMU ounts of values of cars long sine- disappeared. (d) The failure to eliminate property correctly whet appeared from plant was much more than offset by errors in practii e in the other direction, viz., the construction of property which did not and does not reflect in the book records of property. This is more especially true of track and roadway and electrical distribution sys- tems, and in a minor degree of car equipment The best type of trackage existing in 1903 appears to have been made up of 73 pound girder rail, laid on oak ties on a cinder ballast, and paved with granite blocks. There was little of it on that date. Thirteen miles of such trackage still exists, but a very large part ot it has been changed to trackage which may be described as made up of 97 pound girder rail, laid on treated ties, resting on six inches of broken stone ballast, surmounted with six inches of concrete and paved either with vitrified brick block with grout filler or paved with granite block. Other portions have been reconstructed without change of weight of rail, but with decided change in the composition of the ballast. In reconstructed track during the period since 1903, only a small part of the added value brought about by the evolution into a better type of track and roadway, reflects in the additions and better - ments total used by the witness. This construction has been paid from operating expenses. No plant record was made. Not less than $5,000 </seg>
            <seg id="p195">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 195 per mile of earnings was therefore used in bettering the track and roadway as between the best type of track today and the best type of tra.k in 1903. It might be possible to approximate the amount of earnings that win' Mius put into plant without showing in the books as plant during the past eighteen years, but such data is not essential, at least in this part of the findings. It is sufficient to say that in place of $1,090,816 having been invested in track and roadway between January 1, 1903, and December 31, 1920, a very considerably larger amount was thus invested and to that extent the value of the property is higher than tlu- book study indicates. The same is true as to the manner in which the cost of Improve - ments to the electrical distribution system was handled. The record shows that. when wooden poles were removed and iron poles were substituted a much smaller part of the actual cost of the improvement was finally reflected in additions and betterments than the facts war - rant.-d. The difference between the actual additions and betterments anil that which the books showed was paid from current operating revenues. It lias already been pointed out that some dismantled cars were not properly charged out of plant. The evidence also shows that some r.irs built were paid for out of current revenues. In one year cars costing $75,000 were thus paid for and do not now reflect in the property accounts although in actual existence and appearing in the company's inventory of property. (•) The record shows that since 1903 the total capitalized overhead expenses, which may be summarized as interest and taxes vine ton (ruction, purchase expense, shop, store, and yard expense - il engineering and superintendence, amounted to an almost negligible sum. In so far as these expenditures were met, and no question exists but what certain amounts were paid, they came from current operating revenues, although they were items subject to legitimate capitalization. In its valuation, the company figured these items as amounting to 15.6 per cent of the basic figure which it contends ought to appear in any property valuation but which do not appear in the book ac - counts. The same items under the study made by the Commission's engineering department amount to more than ten per cent of the total "bare bones" cost and none of this appears to be reflected in the book accounts relative to any class of property. With the exception of these overhead expenditures just described, the book costs presented in the accounting study by applicant appear </seg>
            <seg id="p196">196 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Ey to reflect the actual coat of real estate, buildings, machinery, to the extent of more than 80 per cent, car equipment, and these s in turn represent one-half the value of the total plant. I It thus becomes necessary for us to seek, from other evidence n book assets, facts on which, to base conclusions as to fair value the physical property, except insofar as the exhibits of the ac - inting expert contain corroborative evidence on the cost of certain sses of property in connection with the studies on actual cost made m the company's books by the Commission's accountants. These er factors include (a) the hypothetical reproduction of the property the company on four-year average cost and again on reproduction t of the particular and accidental moment fixed by the Commission calling for the data; and, (b) the studies of actual cost made by Commission's departments and applied so far as possible to the intities of property in the main agreed upon by all. To these two tors must be added the other relevant facts, such as intangible ues and a proper consideration of higher price levels. Company'* (ii-nt-ral Plan of Valuation The general plan followed by the company was to reach values of the tangible property on an entirely hypothetical basis. The quan - tities of property were in the main agreed upon. The engineers were able to get together on almost all differences so that the factors of quantities may be practically eliminated from consideration. The company almost entirely disregarded experience in finding the value of fixed property in place. Its witnesses proposed a hypothesis of the city of Omaha without a street railway system, but with the city built to its present identical extent. It then sought to ascertain by studies, investigations, and estimates what it would cost to build the property through a four-year period, ending August 31, 1919, and what the plant migln be said to be worth at the end of that con - struction period in the light of advancing prices which took place during the period. The company assumed that it would start to buy materials on le first day of the construction period and would buy at an even rate roughout the stated portion of construction assumed to be done ach year. To ascertain the costs of materials letters were written manufacturers, or there was taken from such sources as were vailable the average selling price of raw materials to be used in the onstruction. The plan was to do the building from four hypothetical aterial yards and to use, on the whole, such labor saving machinery the company did use during that same period for such construction was made. All experienced costs of construction during the period nvolved were disregarded as not being the average of the period If </seg>
            <seg id="p197">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 197 purchases had been made daily or weekly. Labor quantities were In part estimated and in part based on experience. A careful resume of the testimony leaves the strong impression with us that one of the prime purposes of the elaborate method set up by the company in attempting to arrive at a value of the property at a given date, and the extent of the hypothesis used was to arrive at over - head expenses. As has been pointed out, the overheads were merged into operating expenses in the construction of this plant and the com - pany had to rely entirely on hypothesis in that respect. It might have secured from its own experience fairly accurate data for presenting a valuation based on price levels of September 1, 1919. We have been unable to disassociate the effort to arrive at the value of such property at the time of the inquiry from the fact that the company was in existence, occupied the streets on which it by hypothe - sis proposed to construct lines, had the same property in each ln - rce, and at the time of its hypothetical reconstruction had a power - organization of foremen, engineers, and executive officers of long experience in the particular field. The company itself in arriving at the fair value of its properties laid claim to large value by reason of the fact that it was in existence at the time of the hypothetical re - construction and had all the advantages of such existence. We might go with the company on its plan of having dropped into a large city without street railway service and having constructed a plant, as was done in imagination by the experts of the company, but it would be difficult to imagine any "going value" as attaching to such a property at the end of the hypothetical construction. We do not, however, understand that in arriving at the fair value of public utility proper- ties, it is essential to depart so far into the field of conjecture and stay so far away from experience. What is being attempted is to as - certain as near as may be the effect on the value of the plant of the higher prices of labor and materials going to make up the existing property. It strains the imagination much less to believe that the company would, in an extensive construction program at the time of the inquiry in this case, have used its organization to the utmost and that it would not have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to others do thai which the organization itself does do, and has always done. We will proceed along the lines here discussed in measuring the conclusions of the company's witnesses. Such procedure will have an effect on assumed overheads. The Commission's engineering staff undertook, after agreeing with the applicant as to quantities of property listed, to reach a his - torical cost of the physical plant. To that end, as near as possible, the books of the company were used. From them it was possible to </seg>
            <seg id="p198">198 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT ascertain the amount the company paid for a very large part of the property listed in hte inventory. Where it was impossible to ascer - tain the cost the ratio plan was used in arriving at a figure for the particular portions on which the records were silent. It was ad - mitted by the witnesses for the state that the books did not account for those portions of costs comprising overheads which were paid out of operating expenses and not charged into plant. Additions were therefore made to book cost for overhead expenses of construction. General Discussion of Overheads. It is found necessary to discuss this subject partially at this time and to refer to the preliminary discussion from time to time when dealing with the values of classes of property as shown in the inven - tory. The total overheads used by the company in making up its valuation on both bases amounted to thirty-seven per cent on the hypothetical bare bones cost. To state it is to challenge the reason - ableness of the method. We know of no valuations on which the approved reasonable loading expenses have approached this total. From the inventory in the company's Exhibit No. 3 it appt-ar* that in arriving at the valuation on a four-year average cost basis th&gt; - company used the following amounts tor overheads: Note (a): This does not include contractor's profits on buildings, $230,000. We will analyze these overheads briefly at this time and apply conclusions later. Purchase Expense Not all the material found In the inventory was recorded under this head as having been purchased by the company. On buildings it was estimated that contractors would do the purchasing. To arrive at the one per cent added for purchasing cost the company took its four-year purchasing experience of materials for maintenance and new construction and applied the cost of running the purchasing depart - ment during that time. This was from actual experience. The re- Purchasing expense % 57,132.00 Store expense 236,824.00 Contingencies 146,133.00 Engineering 762,559.00 Contractor's profit 397,641.00 (a Shop expense 668,286.00 Legal and organization cost 504,374.00 Interest and taxes 2,598.421.00 Total $5,371,370.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p199">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 199 suiting percentage was then applied generally throughout the inven - tory as a loading item for purchase cost. Under this figure the com - pany assumed it would spend as much as $1800 in the purchase of its largest steam turbin, although it was paying a very considerable amount of money at the same time to engineers for ascertaining for the company what types and sizes of turbines should be purchased. No adequate explanations were given by the company how such money would be spent, although it was denied that manifold increased volume of purchases under the hypothesis, as compared with the actual pur - chases used as a basis, would result in any reduction in the purchase cost of each dollar of materials secured. Where contractors do the building and are allowed a profit it seems fair to assume that they will do the purchasing. The company has followed this idea on build - ings, but not on other construction. «&gt;..i. and Yard Expense, Here the company used the same method in arriving at a per - ■ntage. It took the average cost of operating storerooms and yards jring the four years. 1916 to 1919, inclusive, added to this cost an arbitrary figure for depreciation and applied the result to the actual materials and stores which were handled through the stores and yards i that period. By this method it was ascertained that the stores and ird expense during the four-year period averaged 6.61 per cent of valur of the materials going through the stores and yards. These s were incurred jointly between such construction program as was actually carried on and in the maintenance of a large property. If we were to follow the hypothesis of the company that it was reconstructing all this property under forced draft we would have to reject the method of arriving at the cost of handling stores and supplies because a very much greater volume would be handled than was handled in the period taken as a criterion. The percentage would be decidedly less, although the company's witness was not able to see that such would be the case. But we have already said that we have found it impossible to adapt our mental processes to a theory which ignores experience to the degree which the company has ignored it in its plan of putting value to items of property. Undoubtedly there was a decided cost of handling materials through yard and storehouse throughout the history of the company and such costs were absorbed in current operating expenses. They represented investment, however. The company has, we think, erred in taking an estimated percentage for depreciation of yard and storehouse buildings, tracks and machinery, and then in the valuation of those same buildings, tracks and machinery in denying that such depreciation took place in any period. Another error in arriving at the percentage was in as - suming that all materials in certain classifications went through the </seg>
            <seg id="p200">200 yards and the storehouse. Testimony in other parts of the record in - dicated that this was not true. Contingencies This was an arbitrary addition of three per cent to very con - siderable amounts of the property on the theory that there might be strikes or natural catastrophies which would add to the cost of con - struction, but which would not appear in a later inventory of any property and that there would be considerable amounts of property omitted in an inventory or lost during the construction period. No testimony bore out the use of the percentage, although it was evident that contingencies do exist. We are impressed, however, by the fact that none of the departmental superintendents, who appeared as expert witnesses for the company, seemed to have added separately this item in their own computations. There should be some relation between the amount allowed for contingencies and the experience of the com - pany which is making the claim. Such linking up was not done. It is obviously difficult in considering the vast inventory of the company and the elaborate computations to make all corrections of its figures to represent what we deem to have been errors in the principles ap - plied. We will, under the classifications, do what we can clearly and will permit the remaining doubts to be considered in our final summing The hypothesis of the company is that when it contracted work the contractor would run no risk of unforseen added costs, such as strikes and storms, but that the company would promptly post the ad - ditional amount to cover the loss. Under such a theory contractors would rank as our wealthiest citizens. It seems fair to assume that where in compiling their figures witnesses have considered the work as done by contractors the contractor should run the risk of accidents over and above his estimates of costs. Knicinerring This item, totaling in the company's valuation respectively $762,559 under the four-year average basis and $922,000 under the 1919 basis, was arrived at arbitrarily by adding five per cent to the total cost, plus all overhead except organization expense and interest and taxes. It was arbitrary in that it was unrelated to this company's experience. It was based on the assumption that the company had to hire everything in the way of engineering and supervision and that its own organization would have no part in this particular work. In experience almost the entire property was engineered and supervised by employes. The exceptions of record apply solely to buildings and power house machinery. We think the engineering cost, when used </seg>
            <seg id="p201">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 201 as a loading item, should have varied with the class of property con - structed. For example, the company has certain types of straight track and each type of straight track is built the same In one spot as in another except at those points where peculiar topography is met. A cross-section plan for a type of straight track applies at one place as well as at another. The company has four main types of cars and the cars of one type are practically identical. The plans and specifications for the construction of one car of one type apply equally to all other cars of that type. The company engineered with its own employes many of its cars. In arriving at its engineering cost of five per cent on these cars the company apparently overlooked that having engineered one type of car the plans would work on all cars of that type. These matters will be considered in the appropriate classes of property. Contractor's Profit The company estimated that it would hire every building con- structed and would pay a contractor ten per cent; estimated that it would hire constructed two-thirds of its track, roadway, and electric distribution and pay a contractor ten per cent. It would hire no con - tracting done on the power station equipment, equipment of repair shops and car houses, and no contracting in the construction of cars. The sum total of the contractor's profit, appearing in the valuation of the company on the four-year basis, is approximately $627,000 and on the 1919 basis about $100, 000 more than that. Actually, neither this company nor other street railway companies incurred much of such expenses. The contractor's profits paid by this company were con - fined entirely to buildings. We do not think that it was necessary for applicant, in arriving at a reproduction cost, to have departed entirely from its experience and to have injected contractors at various points where they never were used and to have demanded very large ad - ditions to its valuation by reason of these hypothetical individuals. Shop Expense Under this heading the company added overhead expense of 18.53 per cent to the estimated cost of labor and materials in construction of cars, the percentage to represent light, heat, maintenance and de - preciation of buildings and of machinery and tools. It found the per - centage in the same manner that it found the percentage of store and yard expense. The same percentage, but not the same dollars, was accepted by the Commission's engineer on such cars as were con - structed in the shops, the overhead not appearing in the cost figures of such cars on the company's books. The average four-year costs of maintaining the shops was $46,016, as set forth by the company, of which $27,034 was said to represent depreciation of buildings and tools. During the actual four-year period repairs and replacements to </seg>
            <seg id="p202">202 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT iips and equipment were charged as maintenance. The amount led (or depreciation was arbitrarily arrived at. The equipment and ip8, on which this depreciation was figured, averaged several years age. Some of the equipment and most of the buildings had been use ten to twenty years, but in valuing the equipment and the ldings the company found depreciation existing only in amount 1,316. Against this experience, as set forth in one portion of the entory. the company sets up a depreciation allowance of $27,000 1 year in arriving at its shop expense. We are inclined to agree h the company that the exist ine depreciation in shops and equ p - nt is not great, but we must say that where depreciation does inn ur no arbitrary allowance shall be added to shop expense to m,. r t which it is denied exists. It should also be pointed out that under the company's hyp t would be turning out a very much larger amount of property from le shops than ever occured in experience and that actual shop over - ead per dollar of work turned out would, under the hypothesis, be reduced to some extent. Under the Commission's engineer's metnod arriving at the value of the cars the actual period of construction as considered. We have, however, said that these overheads must lave some relation to the experienced methods of the company. \\ •■ 111 reduce the percentage of loading to represent shop overheads to welve. This percentage will leave considerably more money for de- preciation than the company's expert evidence of accuring dt tion warrants and, therefore, is a liberal allowance. b Organization expense, interest and taxes during construction and r concern value will all be dealt with in the latter part of this r. For purposes of inventory and valuation the company's pliys.ca! property is divided into the following classifications: iai real estate: (b) buildings; (c) track and roadway; id I oveihead distribution system; (e) central power station and sub-station equipment; &lt;fi general repair shop equipment; (g) car house equipment; (hi cars: (j) furniture and fixtures; (k) current assets. The lands owned by the company were valued by a competent real estate dealer of Omaha, appearing as the company's -itness. His figures were undisputed by the corporation counsel of t. ■ ci'.y of Omaha, himself well familiar with realty values. The \alue.-5 »!■«&lt; on lands by the company and the Commission's engineering depart - ment were those of the time of the inquiry. The company added five per cent for engineering, which figure is challenged by the Commis- A. Real Estate </seg>
            <seg id="p203">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 203 sion's engineer. The explanation as to the engineering duties in ac - quisition of land indicated that there was an overlap on the engineer - ing of the buildings and a considerable expenditure to secure inform - ation which is on file and blueprinted in the municipal engineer's offices. We will disallow the engineering item. There is also question as to whether there should be included $33,000 as the value of the land on which an obselete power house stands. This power house has not been used as such for many years. It is under long-time lease to private parties. It will never again be used as a power house. While it has property value, it is not used and useful in any sense in arriving at a rate base and will be excluded in the amount at which figured by the company. We thus have land values of $405,400 on which all parties are agreed except as to the exclusions above noted. B. Buildings Most of the buildings have been constructed since 1903. The ledgers of the company and the annual report of the officers to stock - holders show costs to the company of the construction of 91.2 per cent of all buildings now owned. These cost figures do not include certain overheads. Overheads included in the costs as shown by the books, are such engineering and superintendence as was employed, sub-con- tractors 1 profits, contingencies and other incidentals. The book costs do not include interest and taxes during construction, store and yard expense, and the expense of such purchases as were made by the com - pany s organization. Where the records did not show figures the Cora- lission's accountants used a ratio basis in arriving at estimated riginal costs of these older structures, the ratio being the actual ex- piTi«nced costs on other structures compared to the company's hypoth - esis. To secure its value on the buildings the company introduced a contractor who had worked extensively for the company in building its buildings. He made his computations on the basis of a contractor bidding for a job. He had supervised the construction of one large building for the company in 1918 and 1919, but he did not use his experience on this building. He added ten per cent for contractor's profit and for sub-contractor's profit. We think the evidence shows that whether influenced or not by the purposes for which he was engaged, he was very liberal in his es - timates. For example, on one building he bought more than $70,000 worth of lumber for forms in which to pour concrete. He d'd not at - tempt to use any of the lumber a second time, although the foundation covered a very large area of ground. He found no salvage value in the lumber. He paid retail prices for sand and allowed nothing for quantity purchases'. More detailed discussion of his figures requires too much time and space. We must, perforce, take his figures as pre - sented, subject to serious question, in arriving at conclusions as to </seg>
            <seg id="p204">204 what it would have cost to have constructed these buildings in the manner set forth and at the time of the inquiry. I We are not disposed, however, to allow $230,000 under one basis 1 $268,000 under the other basis, as contractor's profits. This com - iy had a thorough organization of its own. The hypothetical plan ler which the buildings were constructed presupposed that the ipany advanced all the money for purchases, stored such portions required storing, hired from the contractor his equipment and kept n repair, paid his workmen's compensation premiums, met all pay- Is, and took care of all unforeseen and contingent costs that arose. i fact was that the hypothesis assumes a cost plus basis of construc - i, giving the contractor ten per cent for buying the materials and a manner getting together the working force. On his ten per cent did not supervise or engineer aa that is allowed for in a separate n. There would be considerable, and undoubtedly was considerable contractors' profits paid, particularly to sub-contractors. In actual experience the company hired by the day its chief supervisor of con - struction on many of the buildings. All jobs let to sub-contractors. of course, would have, buried in the price, a contractor's profit. I We will reduce the figure on the four-year average $100,000 for :essive estimate of contractors' profits and on the 1919 basis 15,000. For the reasons stated in the discussion of land values we will disallow the item representing the reconstruction cost of the old power station. We have stricken out about one-third of the estimated con - tract work as such and we will eliminate contingencies except on the part assumed to be done by the company itself. The Commission's engineer eliminated certain dwelling houses on extra land bought by the company adjacent to its shops and not yet in use on the ground that they were not used and useful. This is a matter of judgment and we are inclined to leave the dwellings in the inventory and will re - store them to the Commission engineer's figures on a ratio basis to the values applied to them by the company's witness and will leave the company figures for the purpose of comparison in its totals. Both company and Commission witnesses added five per cent for engineering and supervision of this class of proper y, this item amounting to $109,550 and $127,739 respectively, under the two methods employed by the company, and $58,657 under the method employed by the Commission's engineer. These figures were not based on any experience of this company, the only item shown tor engineer- Ing and supervision being $23,874 paid in 1903, 1904 and 1905. This </seg>
            <seg id="p205">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 205 engineering firm wrote to the company in reply to an inquiry, the purpose of which was known, that if it did the work over again at this time it would charge five per cent or more for engineering and supervision. We are inclined to believe that the engineering of build- ings and thorough supervision, which would eliminate to a large de- gree the cost plus method of construction, might fairly cost the per- centage used and we do not disturb it in any of the computations ex- cept as to property eliminated. Neither do we disturb the shop ex- pense used because it is a relatively small item. We add a purchase expense of $12,000 to the company's computations and $4,756 to Forbes' computations because the company had a purchasing depart- ment and was doing all other purchasing under the hypothesis, and because we are denying part of a ten per cent contractor's profit which seems, to include only the responsibility of making purchases. The basis in the record for building values under the three com- putations is as follows: Company Forbes' Four-year Historical Line Item basis 1919 basis cost 1 Bare cost $2,128,178 $2,474,540 $1,166,972 2 Store expense 9,154 10,674 4,928 3 Contingencies 40,115 46,774 Included in Line 1 4 Contractor's bonds, etc 19,554 22,800 Included in Line 1 5 Engineering 109,550 127,739 58,657 6 Purchase expense 1,244 Total $2,300,551 $2,682,527 $1,231,801 Adjusted as per the discussion above, we have the following estimates Company Forbes' Four-year 1919 basis Historical basis cost From previous table $2,300,551 $2,682,527 $1,231,801 Deduct: Contingencies on contracts 26,743 31,182 Old power house 52,232 68,762 Excess contractor's profits 100,000 115,000 Adjusted engineering 8,999 10,747 Add: Dwellings 5,520 Purchase expense 12,000 12,000 4,756 Total $2,123,577 $2,468,836 $1,242,077 It must be remembered that the Commission engineer's figures are taken from the books to the extent of ninety-one per cent of the total value used by his witnesses for buildings. Some slight adjust- </seg>
            <seg id="p206">206 meats were made by the Commission's accountants to separate prop - erty more carefully into classifications than the books yeparated them. Actual construction figures were secured from the company's ledgers, totaling $1,063,746.69 for buildings. The Commission's witness on the same buildings used the figure $1,064,637.42. No other costs appear on the records of the company for building construction. C. Tnu-k and Roadway Company experts and Commission engineering departments are agreed so fully on quantities of materials as to eliminate thut subject from serious consideration. They differ very radically on the method employed in putting value on to the physical items and in adding over- Lead expenses.

Fnt. Hypothetically it reproduced the track and roadway under hurry - orders, used such labor-saving machinery as was in general use the time of the inquiry, and added a aeries of assumptions not based on experience. t Because in imagination the property was to be reproduced quickly company elected on paper to hire contractors to construct two— •ds of the track and roadway at a profit of ten per cent. It was ired that these contractors would have to buy machinery and tools, which purchase the applicant would pay eight per cent annual in - jst, five per cent annually for depreciation, and 8 J 4 per cent for rent maintenance. The machinery the contractor was supposed to d consisted largely of dump cars. In making its computations the ipany was liberal to the contractor and while he was presumed to his machinery in 1916 it allowed him advances in prices of his chases on the assumption that lie was entitled to such advances n year to year. We think the hypothetical contract differed from The company used its experience as to quantities of labor and tuantities of materials necessary in this amount of track and roadway. &gt;ut departed from experience as to the method employed in run- itructing the property.

The company presumed that it would build with its present organization one-third of the total trackage in a period of four years with the machinery it now has. The hypothesis made the construction by the contractors very much more expensive than that done by the company itself. While on paper the company allowed $108,000 expense for the hypothetical equipment of a hypothetical contractor, it must be borne in mind that at the same time it had in its yards a large number of car trucks and motors on which it was only necessary to put dump bodies and it would have been getting some use out of otherwise idle equipment which is left in its inventory. The company added 6.61 per cent for store expense, one per cent for purchase, expense, ten per cent on two-thirds of the total work for contractor's profit, three per cent for contingencies, five per cent for a portion of its engineering and superintendence and ten per cent on the remainder. The total overhead and contractor's profits added by the company under its method of setting up computations was, for the four-year period $837,963 which is approximately twenty per cent of the bare bones cost for these particular overheads. The Commission's engineering department differed somewhat from, the company as to labor quantities and applied to the materials and labor quantities the weighted average experienced costs over a series of years. These weighted averages were secured from careful and exhaustive cheeking of the records of the company. For over - heads the Commission's engineer allowed one per cent for purchase cost, four per cent for store expense, nothing for contingencies, five per cent for engineering, and no contractor's profits. The Com - mission's engineer rejected all cost of cinders used in open and closed track, defending it by saying that these cinders are by-products of operation, have an infrequent market, and would, unless used ex - tensively by the company, represent merely cost of disposal. He al - lowed all expense of placing the cinders. In doing so he followed the plan of the Interstate Commerce Commission thus far adopted In valuation of railroads. The company used the price on cinders repre - sented by such sales aa it had had. The purchase expense is agreed upon except that the percentage Is applied to different cost figures dup to differing methods followed. In arriving at store expense the company applied its experience of the movement of materials through yards and storehouse. Other witnesses for the company indictead that in track and roadway very </seg>

It was estimated by the superintendent that wo-thirds of the brick, stone and sand, and a portion of the cement ould go directly to the jobs. In arriving at the store expense the mpany added an arbitrary figure for depreciation which was not in eeping with its allegations elsewhere as to amount of depreciation iich arises. For example, company work-cars were depreciated welve per cent and contractor's hypothetical work-cars were de - ireciated twenty per cent in four years. The company had some dump ork cars and put them in the inventory in ninety-five per cent condi - on, although these cars were twelve years old at the time the inventory as taken. It thus charged as an overhead three per cent for de - reciation and admitted in its inventory only one-half per cent per ear. These were the reasons given by the Commission's engineer for educing the company's overhead storage expense. In the main we gree with his conclusions. We will reduce the company's storage ost by two per cent and increase our engineer's figures to correspond. Contingencies. The company used three per cent and supported t by testimony. Its chief witness, however, in giving the detail of ow he arrived at his quantities, showed clearly that he had allowed or all contingencies on materials. He said, however, that it was safe ngineering to add ten per cent to labor costs because of 'interruptions, ccidents and whatnot, which always added to labor estimates. We re not convinced that an engineer and superintendent making mates of costs, would not in those estimates finally make all necessary llowances for labor by comparing with past experience, but we will, or the purpose of this classification study, accept his statement of ten per cent for labor expense. We will eliminate the three per cent and se in lieu of it the company's statement of ten per cent added to abor only. We will accept the testimony and add similarly to the ommission's engineering department's figures for contingencies, up - lying them, however, to the historical cost. Contractor's Profits. Since 1903 this company has built no ackage under contract. It maintains an organization of its own for his purpose. No testimony was given to indicate that prior to 1903 ackage was built under contract. The only reason the contractor injected in the company's studies is because of its hypothesis of omplete construction in a brief period, a hypothesis, as has hereto - ore been pointed out, not met with in experience anywhere. This ompany has most excellent engineers on track and roadway. It has oremen and experienced workers. It has equipment which could economically be prepared for any emergency. We are unable to see any justification for injecting the contractors and adding to the valu - ation for these theoretical individuals merely because of a hypothesis of rapid construction of an entire plant. We reject the entire item. </seg>
            <seg id="p209">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 209 Kngin&lt;H*riiig. We approved five per cent as a reasonable amount to represent engineering and superintendence in construction of buildings. We think, however, an entirely different situation arises in consideration of track and roadway. This company has twenty - two types of straight trackage. Outside of excavation and fills, the construction in each type is the same for any particular yard. Plans and specifications in cross-section of straight track illustrate fully the method of construction for the entire type of straight track. This company has engineered, with regular employes, at least eighty-five per cent of its trackage at very modest expense. The actual cost is unknown because merged in operating expenses. The company has figured ten per cent for engineering and super - intendence of special work, such as turnouts, wyes, crossovers, switches, guard rails and curves. The same criticism applies there. It is true that the engineering and superintendence of this special work must cost more per dollar invested than on straight track. However, many of the plans are duplicated again and again in use and do not require re-engineering or any specialized supervision. Tue Commission's engineer used five per cent on all the work, just as he in turn used five per cent on every class of property. Insofar as the criticism of the company's method of arriving at engineering is bound it applies to that of the Commission's engineer. The company added in round numbers for engineering $265, 00U under one method and $300,000 under the other v^et hod of computation. The Commis - sion's engineer added $166,361. We will approve the five per cent allowance for engineering on all special work, miscellaneous con - struction, viaducts, and carhouse and yards trackage. We will approve 2 Vs per cent allowance on all straight trackage. This will allow the company about $142,000 for enginereing on one method of computation and about $155,000 under the other method of computation and will use in the Commission engineer's figures $102,728 in place of the amount he did use. .Many of the units used by the company reflect the results of the hypothetical complete reconstruction. It is, however, obviously im - possible for the Commission to readjust all the figures to eliminate what it considers to have been error in theory. It must deal with many of these only in the larger aspects in final conclusion. The tables below will reflect the changes due to concrete objec - tions chiefly on overheads which have been discussed in detail above. </seg>

The Commission's engineer departed on track and roadway from the method followed generally by him of adhering to book Especially on track and roadway the company's property accounts do not reflect actual costs of types of track at the time they were put in. This was because complications existed in so many instances; that is. special work included with straight work, tearing out old track and putting in new track all in one expense bin, and relaying rail from one location to another without charging out the rail at one location and charging it in to the plant at the other lcoation. There were, however, many instances in which the costs to the company of putting down types of track appeared to be unaffected by other factors and really did represent the cost to it at the time the work was done, with the exception of those overhead costs which were paid out of operating expenses and never appeared even on work sheets, such costs includ - ing engineering, use of work cars, store expense, and purchase expense.

This portion of the plant represents the underground and over- head wire system, poles and appurtenances. We have four figures in the record, all bearing on the total value of this property classification. They are as follows : (a) Additions and betterments, as per the books, 1903 to 1920, inclusive $ 389,567.44 (b) Cost, historical estimates by Forbes, includ - ing all overheads except organization, inter - est and taxes 733,293.40 (c) Company reproduction cost, using four-year average prices and including all overheads, except organization expense, interest and taxes during construction 1,311,925.35 (d) Company reproduction cost on 1919 average prices, including overheads mentioned above 1,332,211.79 The first figure above represents only additions and betterments and even these are subject to much criticism because the company followed the general practice discussed regarding track and roadway in making its charges on the books for such construction. It U a wholly unreliable figure and cannot be used by us. The underlying data is valuable, but not the book summaries of additions and betterments. An analysis of the overhead expenses and the so-called bare bones estimated costs is given below for the company's four-year average figures and for the Commission engineers figures.

            <seg id="p213">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 213 Notes: The company's bare reproduction cost includes minor loading items, such as shop expense, difficult to separate. Purchase expense figured at one per cent by each witness but on different bases. Store and yard expense figure at 6.61 per cent by the company's witness and at four per cent by the Commission's witness. Contingencies figured by the Commission's witness at three per cent. Engineering and superintendence figured at five per cent by both witnesses. Contractors' profits figured at ten per cent on two-thirds ot the construction. To these figures the company has added other overhead items for interest and taxes and organization in amount $242,051, and the Com - mission's engineer has added for the same items $113,497. With these included the overheads used by the Commission's engineer amounted to 28.9 per cent and those of the company amounted to 40.5 per cent. The company followed the same general plan in arriving at its values that it did in dealing with track and roadway, explained here - tofore. The units for labor costs and materials costs were furnished as result of quotations secured by the purchasing agent. The quan - tities of labor and materials were estimated by the witness, superin - tendent of the overhead distribution properties. Here, as in track and roadway, the company followed the hypothesis of hiring two-thirds of the work done by contractors, and here, as there, the record furnishes no evidence that any of the actual work was ever contracted. The quantities of materials figured by the witness for the Com - mission's engineering department differed only in minor degree, which can here be disregarded, from the quantities used by the company. Some differences occurred as to the amounts of property, but these were, on the whole, ironed out and adjustments were made. The prices for labor and for materials were secured by the Commission'* engineer from the records of the company, drawn oil by accountants. The prices of materials were the weighted average from 1909 to 1919 inclusive. The prices of labor were the simple average prices. The record shows criticism of the details of the company's wit - ness, some of which may be summed up as follows: For quantities of labor the witness used the experience on one five-block job done in 1921, in which job an injured lineman, temporarily not able to climb a pole, was paid seventy-two cents an hour for digging holes where the ordinary hole digger was paid about fifty cents per hour. The as - sumption running through the compilation was therefore an injured lineman on each construction gang. The company used a lineman to run a truck in hauling materials and paid seventy-two cents per hour because on the particular job this was the most economical thing to do. </seg>
            <seg id="p214">214 Truck drivers" wages are lower than those of electric lineman. The cost of painting poles was seventy-five cents for labor, figured on painting the poles standing. The general experience of the company was to paint one coat in the yard and one coat while standing. The advance construction of conduits is so great that only about twenty-two per cent of the ducts are now in use. No deductions, however, were made on this account. The company figured on using a foreman at seventy-seven cents per hour and sub-foreman at seventy-five cents per hour with each gang of seven men. The methods used in depreciation of property will be duly discussed under the head of depreciation. I Some of the major criticisms of the work of the Commission's .ness were as follows: He figured in setting wooden poles a crew isisted of five groundmen and one lineman, while the company in- Led the proper crew was six linemen and one groundman. The Com - ision's witness used three per cent as a loading item to represent i cost of small tools, while the company used 5 Vi per cent. The ness did not allow for cost of dirt wagons and reel wagons, pre - nably used in construction, but allowed merely a unit price for mov - ; materials. Radical differences occured in the methods of depre - ting, particularly of iron poles. The Commissions witness made extra allowance for digging through sidewalks in the setting of es. The company made an estimated general allowance for this. b company added a percentage of 18.18 OB certain items for shop fThead expense. The Commission s engineer did not. Tin- Com - ision's engineer did not allow enough, in the opinion of the com - ly, for the cost of water used in mixing concrete. The company isted the Commission's engineer required too much work per day men; that the experience was that they could not do that amount. work. Fundamental difference, of course, rested upon the methods of ascertaining unit prices. For example, the company used in its four ear average the price of $41.41 each for thirty foot steel poles and in 8 1919 prices $37.18. The Commission found the weighted average ctual cost of all poles of this kind to have been $15.30. Likewise n thirty-five foot steel poles the company used figures of $5v'j,s and 52.94 each. The Commission's accountants found that the company lad paid an average of $21.90 for such poles. The varying computa - ons were seeking different ends. The method of arriving at the expense of purchasing materials is undisputed for this classification. The difference in dollars represents the different values to which such purchase expense was applied. It seems quite apparent that the store and yard expense would be much higher per dollar of property than on track and roadway because very nearly all the materials would go through either stores or yards. We </seg>
            <seg id="p215">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 215 could accept the company's percentage entire if it were not in part based upon hypothesis of depreciation already discussed and rejected. We will, however, use six per cent in place of 6.61 and will use the same percentage for store and yards in computations of the Commis - sion's engineer, thus increasing that item fifty per cent in the tabula - tion of Mr. Forbes. For reasons already discussed with reference to track and road - way we reject the hypothetical figure of contractors' profits. Approximately the same objections as were made in discussing track and roadway exist in our opinion, to the five per cent allowance for engineering and superintendence. In the main, superintendence was included in the unit labor prices. The company used a foreman and a sub-foreman in each gang. The Commission's engineer used a foreman in each gang. In actual experience the company probably did use a foreman and a sub-foreman, but these are in the units and not in the overhead. For reasons more fully discussed heretofore, and not necessary of repetition, we reduce the engineering allowance to three per cent on this classification. The compilation adjusted to meet these major objections found by us to the figures of the witnesses of both company and the Commission, gives the following results: Note: The company's 1919 totals adjusted as above, would produce a result of $1,221,835. All figures above are exclusive of con - sideration of depreciation, going value, interest and taxes dur - ing construction, and organization expense. This will be dealt with before a final summary is made. K. Central Power Station and Sub-Station Equipment. On this classification of property four gross figures are presented for our consideration. They are exclusive of the consideration of the effect of the organization expense, interest and taxes during construc - tion, going value, and depreciation.

            <seg id="p216">216 (a) Book cost of the power equipment stands on quite a differ - ent footing from the book cost of track and roadway and overhead equipment in that a very large proportion of it is accurately reflected. There is almost no power equipment which antedates 1903. The com - pany charged into its capital account most of the new equipment, but failed to include labor costs of installation when done by the com - pany during the period 1903 to 1909. inclusive. The cost, as per the books, is, therefore, somewhat lower than the actual cost to the com - pany, remaining costs, chiefly labor, having been absorbed in operating expenses. |(b) The Commission's engineer used the results of the careful :stigation of the underlying data in the company's records In arriv - at his estimated historical cost. The figure set forth above as his .1 includes his engineering cost. It also includes approximately 3,200 not accurately reflected or entirely missing from the com - y's records. More than one-half of this is made up of labor costs e by the company; that is, where purchase contracts did not call installation. Freight charges were frequently absorbed in operat - expenses and were secured from computations on the then existing ght rates. On some of the missing data the Commission's engineer i the company's four-year average prices. On other portions where books were silent even on the cost of materials ratios were used. (c) and (d) The company's totals were made up in the aame manner as they were made up on other classifications heretofore dis - cussed except that it has not included anything for contractors' profits. Store and yard expense was much lighter for it was estimated that the heavy units of machinery would, as they did, come direct to the job. The loading items in the three estimates are shown in the computa - tion below. tTwo of the loading items appear to warrant some scrutiny.

The fact is that after the initial installation of machinery in the first part of the present power house in 1903 and 1904 the engineering was dnoe by the company's own experts on regular payroll. It needed no out- side aid, for its chief engineer is a thorough student and an expert in his field. The company's actual experience of engineering was, there- fore, much lower than any of the estimates. It does not, however. appear clear from the testimony that the items should be interfered with or adjusted. The purchase expense rests on the same footing with engineering It is the same percentage used by the company elsewhere and arrived at in the same manner. The Commission's engineer refused to allow a purchase expense on contracted items. It is a matter of common knowledge that in the expensive purchases such as go to make up most of the machinery of this company the manufacturer seeks his market. At least it seems reasonable to say that if there were a purchase ex- pense the item for engineering and superintendence is sufficiently liberal to cover it. We will eliminate the loading item of purchase expense. We thus have the following adjusted totals of the various witnesses Cost as per books 1903 to 1920, inclusive $1,218,160 Forbes' historical cost, with adjustments 1,412,583 Company reproduction cost, four-year average prices with adjustments 2,400,502 Company reproduction cost, 1919 average prices with adjustments 2,790,464 F.

The four total figures on this classification presented by various witnesses for consideration are as follows (a) Cost of additions and betterments shown by the books, 1903 to 1920, inclusive $ 20,950 (b) Forbes' estimated cost 249,576 (c) Company reproduction cost, four-year average prices 306,012 (d) Company reproduction cost, 1919 prices 354,647 (a) It was the practice of the company not to carry into addi- tions and betterments a very large portion of the equipment of the various shops, but to carry the items from time to time into operating expenses. Some of the equipment antedated 1903. It is evident that the figure is wholly useless in the matter of comparisons and it is at once rejected.

There is leas real support for conclusions of the Commission's engineer on this classification than on any of the others. 1(c) and (d) These totals were arrived at in the same manner in other classifications with this difference that there was a con - erable amount more of estimating done because the equipment of : shops was made up of such a large number of small items.

Large numbers of cars were, however, purchased after 1903 and their cost, delivered, was readily ascertainable. Beginning in 1909 the company built most of the cars. It bought sixty cars during the period 1909 to 1911 and aside from that constructed all the remain - der of the equipment now mostly in use. It constructed the last of these cars in 1918. The inventory discloses two hundred ninety-nine cars of three general types, double-trucked, and surmounted by close bodies. These are in regular use or in reserve for ready substitution. It discloses also thirty-seven single truck closed cars of types constructed about twenty years ago and now seldom used, eleven similar cars with no motor equipment, and one hundred eight other cars purchased in the last decade of the preceding century and for many years used little or none. The book cost, therefore, was quite accurately the cost to the company, excluding overhead items, of practically all of the equip - ment actively in service. (b) The Commission's accountants from the company's records were able to find the actual contract price of one hundred forty-four cars purchased from car makers and were able to find also the cost of the improvements added to these cars, such as "pay as you enter ' equipment and altered heating equipment occasionally. They w.re able to find also from the company's records cost to it of one hundred forty-five cars built in its own shops. These figures, however, required considerable readjustment because motors and sometimes trui ks were transferred from older equipment to a considerable number of cars and it was necessary to go farther back in the records to ascertain ti cost of these motors. It was essential also to aggregate the various provements on each of the cars, a record of which was available. Lit was necessary, however, on the old-style single truck equip - nt, very little of which is used nowadays, to reach conclusions from such contracts as were available and occasionally to price certain equip - ment on a ratio basis. The Commission's engineer, however, omitted from his totals ten cars of one type, shown by the records to be used entirely on the leased lines of the company. That is, these cars were loaned to the leased company, which plays no part in this case. He, likewise, omitted sixteen cars of another type upon the showing that twenty of such cars are in constant use on the leased lines, and used not at all on the property here under consideration.

            <seg id="p221">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 221 and in use on this property, $302,800 was arrived at partly by esti - mates. That is, eighty-four per cent of the bare cost of the car equip - ment recognized by the Commission's engineer as subject to valuation was secured accurately from the underlying data in the offices of the company. (c) and (d) The company's witnesses arrived at the value of the oar equipment entirely by computations and went on the assumption that in the hypothetical reproduction it would construct all the present equipment with its own forces. The quantities of labor and materials were arrived at by the company's witness from records kept by him in the construction of fifteen cars and these quantities were adjusted by the witness to fit the different types. To these quantities of labor and materials prices representing the conclusions of the purchasing agent on the four-year average prices and 1919 prices were applied and to that total were added the various loading percentages for pur - chase, store, shop and engineering expense. The experienced cost even of those cars built in 1916, 1917 and 1918 were not used at all be - cause the materials which went into those cars were frequently in store from earlier purchases at prices below the prevailing prices in those years. Overhead Expenses on Cars. The effect of the loading items to r&gt; -present overhead costs, not reflected in the book values of this equip - ment, is shown by the following tabulation. None of the witnesses presented these figures concretely and they are worked up from the te.-timony. we think with substantial accuracy. I'sed and Useful Property. There arises in consideration of this &lt; hissitication a problem not strongly presented in any other classifica - tion, viz.: the inclusion in the inventory of cars no longer in service and with not the slightest probability of ever again being used. The company has forty "1000" type cars, which are its newest and largest cars, all of which are in active service. It has one hundred sixty-five cars of types known as "800's" and "900's", also all in active service and none older than ten years at the time of the inquiry. It had ninety-four cars of the "200" type purchased between 1903 and 1909. I 1 I I 1 r, .1111- lla-lll i. Approximate bare cost &gt;. 1'urchase expense I MSM expense I. Shop expense i.

Ten of these cars, as heretofore stated, are used on leased lines exclusively and we think are properly excluded by the engineering department of the Commission. They are, to be sure, valuable property and might readily be counted an asset, but are not used and useful, nor is rent paid by the leased lines for these cars. We will exclude the ten cars from the rate base. Most of this type of cars are held in reserve and are used to some extent as "trippers" in peak-load periods. The inventory shows forty-eight single truck closed cars of type known as "100's". These cars averaged almost twenty years old at the time of the inquiry. Twenty of tlifra had for some years been loaned to the leased lines in Council Bluffs and earned the company nothing. Of the remaining twenty-eight eleven had been stripped of motor equipment for use in work cars and other miscellaneous service and only four of the remainder were used as substitutes for "one man" safety cars on stub lines. We will eliminate the twenty cars of this type used in Council Bluffs and recommend that they lie sold to the company which has the exclusive use of them and the proceeds ! for any legitimate purpose. The remainder of these cars we w\ Include in the rate base for additional reserve equipmen we are doubtful if they will ever be so u Of the fifty-six single track open rats, type known as Enow in use, or have been for some years. They probably average 1 more than twenty years in age. They are carried in the inventory reserve equipment on the theory that fires might break out in car ises and these cars stored in the open at the shops would be avail- aid be aval ble for emergency use. Since all but one of the carhouses are tire - roof and perfectly equipped with sprinkler system it is to use a far - etched reason for the retention of thM ■ obsolete cars, one fire did estroy a considerable number of cars in 19ul. but the carhouse then as an old building, not protected against tire and not tire proof, nly one car has been accidentally burned in the last twenty years. ''or additional reserve purposes we retain sixteen of these cars in the nventory. The remaining cars have value as scrap, but there is no estimony as to what the scrap is worth, nothing of that kind ever laving been sold by this company and no witness having any knowl - dge of quotations for scrap. There are also fifty-two single truck open cars of this earliest existing type, known as "400's". These cars are without motors, many of them without controllers, and other necessary equipment. They are listed by the company for repair value only, but the company's witness was not able to justify their use lor that purpose. It was ad - mitted that the trucks might be used as repairs of the "100" type cars, but these cars are also obsolete and almost entirely out of service. In </seg>
            <seg id="p223">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 223 &lt; our opinion, these cars should long since have been retired from the book accounts. There are additional to the above classes of cars, five miscel - laneous single truck open cars without motors, without other equip - ment, and some of them not even with trucks under them. One of ifni is a horsecar and one has been reconstructed as a bunk car and ; not even on tracks although it still retains an old-style motor. We liink it requires no further statement to justify the elimination of IMM iars from the inventory. We thus tind that there should be eliminated as not used and use - nl the equipment set forth below. We do not find that it is without valve, but that it has no place in a rate base. The amount of property we have thus found not used and useful hot properly included in the rate base in a proceeding such as this unts to 12 '« per cent of the total value carried by the company for this classification as representing the two methods of pricing and i hi' additional properties stricken by us from the Inventory of the Commissions engineer amounts to 7 Vi per cent of the total value lound by him tor this classification of property.

Trurks and motors were purchased outright and such equip - ment as controllers, fare boxes, and heating devices were purchased from manufacturers and assembled. The engineering consisted of the designing of the bodies and the determination of the kind of trucks and motors and other accessories necessary for the best operation of the cars. Of the cars which we have found to properly be in the rate base there are but four types. With minor exceptions all the cars In one type are exactly alike and the engineering of one is the engineering of them all. Almost half the value of each car represents material not engineered but bought outright. I Superintendence of construction is included in the unit prices, ept such superintendence as is represented in the general over - ing by the superintendent of shops That the determination of les of bodies and the conclusions as to what types of motors and er accessories should be used would cost any such sum as is repre - ted in the overhead for this item taxes the imagination too much. .■ superintendent of shops testified that he could supervise and ;ineer the construction of one-hundred fifty of these cars in one r. At the allowance made for engineering he should receive for services anywhere from $35,000 to $75,000 per year, in plac .■ of what he does get. tWe find that an allowance of 2 V4 per cent on the full value of cars under any method of computing it, covering not only what was It in the shops, but what was purchased and merely installed, is an pie and liberal allowance. kWV have below in a tabulation made reductions to represent the perty eliminated from the rate base, which applies to the loading as as weli, and for the adjustments in the loading items just dis- cussed above. The results are: Note: The very much smaller amounts allowed for purchase and store expense by the Commission's engineer was not due ::o much to different values to which the percentages were applied as to the fact that he was following the company's experience in which a very large number of cars were bought outright and no store expense would be experienced and but tittle purchase Company ( &lt;&gt;iii|&gt;aii.Y Foup-jciir IU10 Forlx-*' Average Average Hi-tom .il Line Item Mm Mot n*»i I.

The company was in hypothesis constructing all the cars, under which assumption, of course, purchases and stores expense would apply to practically everything. J. Working Capital In its testimony the company lays claim to working capital, which it denominates "current assets," somewhere between $1,028,448 and $1,223,794. It arrives at this addition to the fixed property by the use of three items of current assets, vli. : materials and supplies, cash on hand, and accounts receivable. The minimum figure represents the four-year average of the book accounts as of date August 31, and the maximum figure represents an adjustment of the four-year average figure to represent an estimated higher cost of doing business. This latter figure was not urged in testimony. The chief engineer of the Commission used a total of $469,528.90, which he arrived at by taking the materials and supplies shown by the books on December 31, 1919, and adding thereto an item for purchase expense and then for quick assets using five per cent of the fixed property, less his allowance for materials and supplies. Material and Supplies. The average figure used by the company for materials and supplies was $315,541 and on this figure it appar - ently stood most firmly. The average amount of materials and supplies on hands as of June 30, for the four years ended 1916, was $184,504 as shown by the books and as of December 31 for the four years ended 1919 was $270,400. It would thus appear that on August 31 each year materials and supplies exceeded the amount later in the year, probably due to more active construction and re-construction programs in the summer months. No doubt exists but that the materials and supplies necessary for this concern must require greater capital now limn under pre-war operating conditions. We see no objection to the W of the figure presented by the company and will so use it, sub - ject to certain corrections. The company did not assume that any of its materials and sup - plies on hand was for construction purposes, or at least made no al - lowance for such situations. During the time materials are on hand for construction interest is allowed as an element in book values. We have so treated them in all past construction, and proper bookkeeping will so show in the future. Any such materials and supplies cannot, therefore, be treated as working capital entitled to earn a fair return. The average cost of materials and supplies going through that account for construction purposes, and the labor of installing, was for the four-year period $129,000, in round numbers. The testimony showed that eighty-five per cent of such material actually did go </seg>
            <seg id="p226">226 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT through the account. The labor cost was less than one-half the total cost of such construction. In the valuation consideration of the fixed property it was estimated as a minimum that material remained on hands six months and interest for that period should be added to construction cost. Assuming the same conclusion here, it would appear that not legs than $30,000 of the average materials and supplies on hand was for construction purposes and should not be included in working capital. Neither did the company charge against the Iowa properties under lease their share of the materials and supplies, and, so far as we can find, no adjustments were made to compensate. Hence, it would appear that some portion of materials and supplies should be deducted and charged against the Iowa properties. In its allocations between the Iowa and Nebraska properties, where allocations were necessary, the company used a percentage 85.23 as representing the Nebraska share. We use the same percentage here. By simple com - putations covering the above facts the materials and supplies properly chargeable as working capital against the Nebraska properties will amount to $243,365. Working Cash. The average cash on hand on August 31. for the four years, included in all the valuation computations, was $686,613 which the company, to secure a 1919 figure, raised on an arbitrary basis to $817,501. As in the discussion of materials and supplies. chief reliance was placed on the average figure. The Commission's engineer in the manner before stated used $170,854. The average cash on hand as of June 30 for the four years ended 1916 was $22vL'!*t&gt; and on December 31, for the four years ended 1919. was |Slt,41S. The company is unwilling to say that any of this cash on hand is unnecessary as working capital, or does not represent working capital which is entitled to be considered investment. The city of Omaha, through its corporation counsel, urges that no cash is essential as a part of the investment. The testimony of the company is not con - vincing. Ready cash as a part of the investment is essential to a public utility for the purpose of meeting expenses of operation prior to the receipt of revenues earned by reason of the expenditures. The street railway company does approximately no credit business. Its earnings are, except in negligible quantity, secured on its strict cars and the money is turned in daily by employes and is available tor the payment of bills not later than twenty-four hours after collection. Materials are purchased to most desirable effect on not more than thirty days time after receipt. Wages are paid weekly, semi-monthly, and monthly and by far the largest amount semi-monthly. This is un - like any other public utility business and the requirements of cash are, therefore, less than that of railroads or in those utilities which measure the quantity of product or service sold. Telephone companies collert </seg>
            <seg id="p227">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 227 largely in advance, but not entirely. Eighty per cent of railroad service is paid (or some time after the service is rendered. The statistical de - partment of the Interstate Commerce Commission has figured out that an allowance for working capital in valuation proceedings of railroads should be 13.6 per cent of one year's operating expenses. The amount thus arrived at includes materials and supplies for operating pur - poses. It would appear conclusively that a street railway company needs less working capital than a railroad. An analysis of the statements of this applicant company shows that cash is accrued from revenues for various expenditures not reg - ularly met in order that a daily or monthly charge show for the proper amount of such expenditures for that month, even though the money Is not yet paid out. Among these items is the rent tor the leased properties in Iowa; audited vouchers for services and other expenses not yet paid; taxes accrued on an estimated basis to produce a suffic - ient amount to pay those taxes due once a year; accrual for injuries and damages in order that funds will be on hand at all time to meet these legitimate expenditures when they arise; and accruals to meet insurance premiums when they fall due. These payments are not made in advance and .since the cash can be set aside daily on a regular plan from revenues to meet the expenditures when it does arise, and since this is without question the policy followed by the company, it is difficult to see why it should be necessary to provide cash working capital 10 the amount carried regularly. To illustrate the point: On December II, 1919, cash on hand was $655,441, aside from the accrual to meet interest payments. This cash was made up largely of $25,000 accru.'d on a monthly basis to pay the annual rental of the Iowa lease** [properties, $15:{,7O6 with which to pay accounts approved and wages dm- but not yet paid, $207,967 accrued from revenues to meet the annual payments of taxes, and $258,000 accrued from revenues as a t-ii.-hion Hind to meet payments of injuries and damages or settle - ments tor such demands where necessary. These accruals represent practically the entire cash on hand. Howcrer, a prudent company would probably want to rtart its business with enough cash on hand to take advantage of opportunities for economical purchase for future use beyond the current needs, both the materials for maintenance and for fuel supplies. It might borrow these funds at banks as needed and pay them off from revenues as materials are used, but higher financial solidity would result from the maintenance of a cash fund for such purposes. To be sure, there are the other accruals not presently needed to meet obligations which might in an emergency be used for such purposes and this fact would somewhat reduce the requirements, although in our judgment not eliminating them. </seg>
            <seg id="p228">228 We, therefore, consider that to the amount of materials and supplies found above to be reasonable investment enough cash be considered as supplied by investors to raise the total working capital to $400,000 to represent the Nebraska properties alone. Organization, Legal anil General Offline K\|&gt;&lt;-n«&lt;-&gt; Under this heading the company added a flat three per cent under its two methods of setting forth the valuation and subjected such total to depreciation as a part of the physical property. The Commission's engineer followed the same method but used one per cent on his total of the physical items. The testimony on this classi - fication was far from convincing. There is nothing in the experience of the company to point to. Any such expenditures that was incurred was merged into operating expenses unless there were exceptions at so early a date that no record is available. W. J. Hagenah, an engineer of very wide experience, used one er cent in the valuation proceedings of the Lincoln Traction Company te federal master in Pacific Has &amp; Kle&lt;-tric Co. v. City of San Fran - •*■&lt;&gt;, -2T.I Ke&lt;l. !»:»7. used two per cent but in that figure included taxes uring construction. In railroad valuation work the Interstate Com - erce Commission has used 1 V% per cent, but includes taxes in that gure. In Utah I.. &amp; T. Co. Valuation ea.se the company claimed two er cent and was allowed something less than that. The federal circuit ro«rt in City of Minneapolis v. Kami et al., 3H5 Keel. KIM. used the re - arkable small amount of $10,000 on a property valued by the com - any at 1920 reproduction figures at more than $13.imiii.&lt;hmi It appears to us that there is error in arriving at these overhead osts on a percentage basis of the physical property. Such method ncreases the general costs in the same ratio that labor and materials crease on the market. It is a matter of common knowledge that egal expenses and officers' salaries have noi shown the increases that lave come in other lines of business. In fact the general counsel of his company gets the same salary he has been paid for many yarn. he general officers' salaries as a whole were actually decreased in otal between 1917 and 1922. We will use the figure of $200,000 as eprerenting reasonable cost of these overheads under this classiflca - on and will apply that amount to the three computations. This will materially reduce the company's figures and increase the estimate of he Commission's engineer. Interest and Taxes During Construction LTo arrive at a figure to be added for interest during construction company set up a hypothetical table of construction in which it osed to invest nearly forty per cent of its hypothetical total in- </seg>
            <seg id="p229">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 229 vestment during the first year and assumed that this money would be needed for an average of eight months of the year. It invested ad - ditional amounts from year to year until the hypothetical job was com - pleted. It then assumed that the money was costing eight per cent and that it would be using the property in part during a portion of the four-year hypothetical construction period. It analyzed the revenue which it was assumed would be earned net during the period and sub - tracted such net earnings from the sum total of the interest accrued. It thus arrived at a total for interest of 14.45 per cent. The assumption is, however, entirely out of line with the ex - perience of the construction of street railways. The company's wit - ness, Mr. Powell, assumed that the entire first year would pass with no property in operation. It might require that long a time before any of the power house was available, but immediately adjacent to the power house is a large manufacturer of electric current, ready and able to sell current as cheaply as the company can make it. In actual practice the company would no doubt buy its first cars and would put each mile of track into operation as soon as constructed. The Commission's engineer followed a different method of com - puting interest and to our minds a method more in keeping with any practical construction. He assumed different preiods of construction of units ranging from six months to two years and used an interest rate of six per cent. His weighted average interest was approximately n per cent as opposed to the company's figure of 14.45. The Interstate Commerce Commission used 5 per cent for interest during construction in the valuation of the Texas Midland on three - fourths of the property and 1 ' 2 per cent on the remainder. It has varit-d this to as much as 10 per cent average on three-fourths of the property and 1 per cent on the remainder. In Pacific Gas ft Klertric (ii.. supra, 3 per cent was agreed upon for interest in the construction of a $13,000,000 property. Likewise, in the appraisal by Bion J. Arnold of the Kansas City railways for the city in 1913 three per cent was used. In the Minneapolis (ias cam', supra, the United States cir - cuit court approved the master's findings of 3.8 per cent. In Utah L. ft T. t"o. the company asked 5.3 per cent and was allowed approxi - mately that amount. Under the most unfavorable market that has developed all the money a company would have required would not have borne 8 per cent interest per annum. A part of it would have been that expensive. Under the company's hypothesis of building in 1916 to 1919 money would have cost more than it did cost as an average during the actual construction of the plant. We consider that the Commission's engineer was much more convincing in his method of figuring the time interest should be paid during construction. This element in valuation should </seg>

It is generally considered as ching itself to the property and to increase or to shrink with the f elements of value. (We will use 8 per cent as the full amount to add for interest dur - ; construction, under the hypothetical period of reconstruction, and per cent under the Commission engineer's estimates of the com - ny's actual experience. This is not an annual rate but covers the II period of construction. It is intended to cover also all costs of taining money not allowed for in general expenses, and not subject amortization. tFor taxes during construction the company used 56-100 of one ■ cent. The Commission's engineer's figure approximated 1.7 per it. Consideration should be given to the practice in assessments taxes to go lightly on property in process of construction and to the t that as property is inducted into service it ceases to be in process construction even though the entire plant is not completed.

After omitting that property which is not depreciated by either company or Commission witnesses, the company has reached a con - dition per cent of 90.13. Forbes, for the Commission's engineering de - partment, on the same property finds a condition per cent of 73.98. This variation is due to an entirely different method of approach - ing the subject of depreciation. The company denied the existence of obsolescence or inadequacy as a factor detracting from Value and arrived at its conclusions as to the amount of depreciation by estimat - ing ixrefully and elaborately the necessary amount of money to take care of all deferred maintenance. That is, it would attempt by this pro - cess to make the property as good as new for operation. Some of the witnesses for the company departed slightly from this method, particu - larly on track and roadway and electric distribution, by switching to an estimate of the remaining active life of elements of property, old enough so that such an estimate might be made with reasonable ac - curacy. On property relatively young no such life base was considered. The Commission's engineer used a rigid life base in arriving at the amount of depreciation claimed by him to exist in the property. He first computed the salvage which might reasonably be expected from property as retired and from the consideration of many author - ities found the average service life which might be expected from dif - fering elements of the property, applying to that the time the property had been in service, and to his total adding the salvage he arrived at its present worth. The method followed by the company has been advocated by public utilities very much in recent years. The method adopted by the Commission's engineer has the support of a large majority of the authorities. The Commission's engineer was not so much concerned with the vigor with which the property had been maintained as was the company under its theories. It is not our purpose, in an opinion already too long, to enter upon an extensive discussion of these two theories of depreciation. We only say that both methods are somewhat extreme One dis - regards life tables entirely. The other uses them exclusively as a basis, with slight modifications for varying circumstances. Our own opinion is that elapsed life is an element for which allowance must be made in finding fair value. This element is by no means controlling if the unit is functioning to one hundred per cent efficiency, as it may readily be. In such case it serves only as one of the general factors entering into the final conclusion, of no importance if the property on the whole is new, but shading the value downward as the age ad- </seg>
            <seg id="p232">232 vances. Service life, based upon past experience and estimates, takes into account the effect of inadequacy and obsolescence as they have factored in the past. It assumes the future effect of these factors will be as great and assumes further that obsolescence and inadequacy In fact exist in property where they cannot be pointed out. Our opinion is that such an assumption is too broad and that weight should be ac - corded these factors in a valuation proceeding only as they can be definitely identified and measured. Mere speculation as to changes in the art does not produce obsolescence, particularly when the unit is rendering satisfactory service at a reasonable cost. When substitute* and tested Improvements have been perfected, however, the old unit is less valuable and this falling in worth is readily meatureable. I In the paragraphs below we will point out some of the evidence* obsolescence shown by the record, and will apply the rule on de - ciation set forth above. L Buildings. On buildings we find a degree of obsolescence in the house not fire proof and in the maintenance of way car house. We find a percentage of 91 as present condition. Track and Roadway. We find obsolescence in the granite block pavement which the city is rapidly requiring to be replaced and also obsolescence in some of the oldest type of track. These factors have caused the replacement before the end of life of stone pavement and of various amounts of trackage. We find a per cent condition of M where the company used 84.28 and the Commission's engineer used ~&lt;&gt; Electric Distribution. We know of no particular obsolescence in this classification of property. The company's witness used a faulty method of determining the salvage value in wooden poles and greatly added to their net value through that error. We think the Commis - sion's engineering witness on trolley wire gave the more convincing testimony as to the amount worn away. We reach the conclusion that this property should be considered in 91 per cent condition as opposed to the figure presented by the Commissions; engineer of ■&gt;5 per cent and by the Company's witness of 93.82. Central Power and Sub-Station K&lt;|uipm&lt;-nt. Some obsolesi .-me exists, in our opinion, in the boiler equipment, to a small degree in the oldest type.s of prime movers, to a considerable degree in a vertical turbine and in generators more than twenty years old, all of which was ignored by the company's witnesses. We have made computations on this theory and have arrived at the conclusion that this classification of property shall be considered in 85 per cent condition. This com - pares with the Commission's engineer figure of 74.3 per cent and with that of the company of 89.68 per cent. </seg>
            <seg id="p233">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 233 General Repair Shop Equipment. Finding the element of ob - solescence actually existing In a portion of the shop equipment, together with other elements discussed, we arrive at the conclusion that it may be fairly said to be in 90 per cent condition. This contrasts with the company's estimate of 94.79 per cent and with the Commission's engineer's figure of 84 per cent. Car House Equipment. On this classification we arrive at the conclusion of 92 per cent condition, which contrasts with the com - pany's figure of 94.76 and the Commission's engineer's figure of 89. Car Equipment. On this classification the company used a per ceni condition of 94.08 and the Commission's engineer the figure of 71. Extensive computations were necessary to arrive at conclusions of a fair per cent condition because we have eliminated entirely from the rate base certain of the property which was carried in the figures of all the witnesses at a low per cent condition. The effect of this elimination would be to raise somewhat the per cent condition of the remaining car equipment under the methods followed by the different witnesses. We recognize a very considerable element of obsolescence and inadequacy in the retained "100" and "400" types of cars and to a much less degree in the "200" type cars, as well as deterioration by age and use. We have arrived at the conclusion that this property is in ;iii per cent condition. Furniture and Fixtures. This property is found by us to be in 92 per cent condition, which compares with 97.23 the figure arrived at by the company and 80 per cent condition used by the Commission's witness. On items 11, 12 and 13 of the preceding table, viz.: organization, legal and general expense, interest during construction, and taxes dur - ing construction, we have applied the composite weighted per cent condition of the preceding classifications excepting real estate and working capital. It might be said with good reason that interest and taxes during construction should neither appreciate nor depreciate. The company has appreciated but has refused to recognize depreci - ation. Unless these overhead items are attached to the property and made a part of the valuation of each element there is no reason for concluding that they depreciate. In general, they are not repeated expenses. Nor is there good reason for concluding that they are sub - ject to appreciation. Appreciation attaches to physical units, except under the hypothesis that the overheads become part of the unit cost. The company carries no accounts in its books for any of these three elements of property investment. They have been paid from operating expenses and have, therefore, been merged with the units. </seg>
            <seg id="p234">234 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The weight of authority would approve the practice followed by the Commission's engineer of considering these as elements attaching to the physical property and affecting the value of each item and under such conclusion it Is necessary to say that these overheads are subject to the same depreciation and appreciation that occurs in physical units. We have followed that plan. thus arrive at a condition per cent as applicable to the com - jy's four-year average prices of 86.04, to the company's 1919 prices 95, and on the computations of the Commission's engineer 8S.65 contrasted with the company's estimated per cent condition of 90.13 and of the Commission's engineer's percentage of 73.98. These per - centages are applied only to depreciable property. Expressed in dol - lars, the percentage found by us is as follows: On four-year average pricei On 1919 prices $2,140,966 493.063 On historical cost prices 1 . 4 T, 1 1 . 4 1 6 These conclusions on depreciation compare with the depreciation expressed in dollars by the witnesses as follows: Company witnesses. Commission engineer $l.-834,405 671.88 The company had in its depreciation reserve on Omaha properties alone on December 31, 1919. $1,571,835. The company contended, though not vigorously, that the present reserve is entirely insufficient. On Ik* line of reasoning followed by its witnesses this contention will have more force since we are eliminating a considerable amount of equipment. It is true that the depreciation reserve should be called upon to meet the loss when property is displaced, for the reasons assigned by us in rejecting cer - tain car equipment. tWe think the proper rule is that revenues shall be called upon in hunting for displaced property to meet the loss represented by the erence between book cost and salvage, and that the contention is jneous that the loss to be met is the application of a percentage to a value which includes the effect of changing price levels. If this position is correct, the depreciation reserve now in the company's liability statement should be reduced by $166,412 plus the difference in the book value of the cars now used solely by the leased lines, and the fair sale value at the time the oars were assigned to the leased This may reduce the reserve below the amount of accrued deprec - iation found by us. Ordinarily this would not be equitable. However, </seg>
            <seg id="p235">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 235 In the instant case, as abundantly shown in the record, and referred to heretofore in this finding, the company has so used Its reserve in the past as to produce additions and betterments in unknown quantity, but certainly totalling several hundred thousands of dollars, now in the valuation figures. Had a different practice been followed the re - serve would have been much higher than it now appears on the books. W« thus have the following conclusions to deal with further: Company Company Four-year 1919 Forbes' Average Historical Prices Prices Cost Present value depreciable property $13,195,465 J15.251.155 $8,657,499 Real estate and working capital.. 805,400 805,400 805,400 Total &lt;l. -predated values $14,000,865 {16,056,555 $9,462,899 MM of Present-Day Price Levels. Many state regulatory bodies and some courts have during the period of the war and subsequent unusual price level period, refused in recognize these in arriving at fair value of property of public util - ities for rate-making purposes. Generally speaking representatives of the public have insisted that no consideration should be given to what has been called abnormal war-time prices as attaching to property constructed under pre-war costs. On the other hand the utilities have, in the main, insisted that there is but one price factor in arriving at fair value and that is the prices existing at the moment of the inquiry. This latter was the position taken by this company. The record la full of formal exceptions on the part of the counsel for the company to the receiving of evidence by the Commission on what the books show to have been the cost of elements of property as experienced by the company at the timeMhe construction was made. In its decision on Application 4575, Platte County Independent Telephone Company, 15 N. S. R. C. 294, dated April 10. 1922, the Commission said: "This Commission is fully persuaded that the fairest method of ascertaining the valuation of public utility properties is the in - vestment cost without regard to the source of the funds, based on historical cost new methods, less the investment of those reserves created from revenues for the protection of property already in existence and invested by the company in additions and better - ments in order that the funds may not be idle. To say otherwise is, in our opinion, ultimately to the disadvantage of the utilities themselves and presently to the serious disadvantage of the public. Much of the improvements made by public utilities are required by public authority. These improvements may be ordered in a </seg>
            <seg id="p236">236 period of high labor and material costs, the company having no other option than to make the investment. If the theory ad - vanced by applicant is correct, then later when prices drop sub - stantially these Investments which have been made on order of the public authorities will depreciate. "However, it is very apparent that these conclusions are not borne out by the weight of decisions of the courts and that if this Commission gives the ocnsideration to those decisions which it U in honor bound to give it cannot stop with a conclusion on value based upon investment." Our conclusion then, after most careful consideration of the de - cisions, was that investment is one of the elements which must be con - sidered and present prices another element. We need not review the authorities there cited. The law has since been very definitely set forth in four opinions of the United States Supreme Court and one opinion by the Federal Circuit Court of this district. Galventon K!« - trie Co. v. City of Galveston, et al., 66 U. S. Court Reports, L. ed. 382. Georgia Railway A Power Co. v. RallrotMl Commission of Georgia, et al., 67 U. S. Court Reports, L. ed. 728. South West RH1 Telephone Co. v. Public Utilities Commiaataa (Mo.) 262 U. S. 276. Bluefleld Wafer Works Improvement Co., v. Public Service Commission of Wi-m Virginia, 67 U. S. Court Reports, L. ed. 715. City of Minneapolis v. Rand, et al. 285 Fed. 818. The record did not disclose any reliable original cost of the property as a whole. As has been pointed out at length the original cost of a very large proportion of the property has been found in the underlying data of the company. The Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the historical cost, as set forth under computations made by Forbes, and readjusted by us. represents a fair maximum cost to which the company was subjected in the con - struction of the existing property which we find properly belonging in the rate base. The company's figures were put forth in a most painstaking manner. We have, after consideration of all the testimony, one addi - tional doubt other than those already resolved by us concerning these computations. To secure materials prices the company, as we have already stated, sent out many hundreds of letters asking for quotations and setting forth the reasons for the inquiry. The manufacturers and jobbers, answering such inquiries, were well aware that there were no prospective sales in view. Most manufacturers maintain list prices and cash prices. With no competition actually in sight and no pos - sibility of making the sales on which the quotations were asked there was every inducement for the manufacturers to quote liberal prices. It is a matter of common knowledge that in valuation proceedings tne owners of property desire to make as favorable a showing as po.--il.l- It is not a matter of criticism of either company or manufacturer that we retain the idea that the prices quoted would have been consider - ably different if this company had been a prospective purchaser of </seg>
            <seg id="p237">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 237 such vast amounts of materials about which it was making inquiries. Then, too, manufacturers were asked to quote figures on considerable amounts of property no longer being manufactured. We do not know how they arrived at their conclusions and only know that if this hypo - thesis of the company had been reality no manufacturer would have have been asked to quote prices on obsolete equipment. This observa - tion is only one of many that might be made showing the weaknesses which are bound to creep into elaborate analysis of reproduction. If this company had been, as its hypothesis sets forth, just starting in to construct its immense properties it would never, at the conclusion of the reconstruction have had the identical properties it now possesses. No more difficult question is presented in this case than the de - termination of the intangible element of value which has come to be known as "going concern." The only evidence on the subject was pre - »ented by the company. On brief counsel for the city of Omaha, who rendered valuable assistance to the Commission throughout the case and in not an especially hostile manner to applicant, was inclined to the view that no special allowance for going value should be made. The company presented a figure of $1,825,000 as representing the fair value of this element in the property under consideration. This was computed by witness Powell on the basis of compensation for past losses. His conclusion was that the total deficit below seven per cent an - nual return. 1903 to 1920, inclusive, was $5,386,772 and that the company was fairly entitled to ask for capitalization of the deficits during the first six years of this time as representing the period of development. We think the errors of his reasoning were fundamental. His detuits were boltomed on the assumption that the fair value of the property on January 1. 1903, was $11,350,000. We have already shown that there was no reasonable basis for using such starting point. His computations also ignore what the record shows in a large number of places and what this opinion has recognized to be true that very large amounts of property, chiefly represented by overhead costs, were paid from current earnings. If these property costs had been paid from funds secured through the sale of securities net income available for dividends would have been that much greater. This fact the witness admitted. For that reason, if for no other, we would have to reject the computation. There is, however, a more cogent reason for rejecting the figure. Confirming the view of several of the lower courts, the Supreme Court &lt;.&lt;ihiK Concern Value. </seg>
            <seg id="p238">238 of the United States has said that this is no proper method of ascer - taining the value of going concern. Galvreton Electric Co. v. City of Galveston, et al. supra, (ieorgia Railway A Power Co. t. Railroad Com - miHsion, et al., supra. We are thus left without anything in the record on which to pin conclusions. That, however, may not be a defect of the record, as. after all, conclusions on this subject are matters for the judgment of the Commission. We do not agree with the learned counsel for tbe city of Omaha that the law justifies us in the conclusion that there is no added element of value over and above those already found by us. So far as going concern value is affected by the fact that the prop - erty is coordinated, with its parts working together for a common pur - pose, we think that element is already represented by the unit values found by us. Certainly, tbe elements going to make up this property would not have such value as we have ascribed if they were separate one from the other. So far as going value may be arrived at by consideration of what willing buyer would pay to a willing se :ier over and above the actual ost of constructing the property we think street railway companies and in a peculiar position. They are essential industries and yet they lave been so affected by a multitude of private conveyances as to iom - etely offset the effects of normal growth of communities. It might eadily be that this element is a liability in place of an asset. Most ertainly no such recognition can be given to it when considering ailway properties as would be given in the consideration of a rapidly eveloping electric industry. However, this company has a property so located that its oper - ions can be had with economies already proven. It has cost money o ascertain that the best method of locating lines is that used by this ompany and it would cost money again to learn that fact if it were ot already known. It has an organization of very competent superin - endents and officials which it has only acquired after expensive ex - periences. Omaha has a splendid street car system. Its economies in peration, as a result of its working organization, are not matters of uess work. The company is doing business at a rate appreciably lower lan the average for companies of like size. To ignore these facts is to iscount the results which have been obtained, all advantages to the tizens of the city of Omaha. tTo say what this value is in dollars is most difficult. We can I express it only in our final conclusions as to the fair value of the perty as a whole. We do not understand that the courts require i element to be set forth separately and independently. We do </seg>
            <seg id="p239">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 239 Dot Bay this in order that our conclusions that there is a going con - cern value may be lip service only. Conclusions as to Fair Value. We have, therefore, for consideration in reaching conclusions as to fair value of applicant's property for rate-making purposes, three figures representing adjusted depreciated values of depreciable prop - erty, under the various plans used by witnesses during testimony. They are: To whatever conclusion we reach from giving proper weight to each of these divergent totals in the light of the supporting testimony we must add $805,400 to represent working capital and real estate. These two items are subject neither to appreciation nor depreciation beyond the consideration already given in arriving at the figures stated. We must also give due weight to the element of going value. From a consideration of all the facts in this case, giving due weight to experienced costs of construction, as compared to costs at the time of the inquiry, at the present time, and probable cost trends for the not-distant future; and giving proper weight to the fact that applicant is a going concern, we flnd the fair value as of December 31, 1919, to have been $13,800,000. It must be recognized that the conclusions arrived at by us ire not necessarily the value of the entire property to which this company has legal claim. We have eliminated a small percentage of the total on the ground that it is not used and useful as a rate base. That pare which has been eliminated is, of course, available to the company to do with whatever it pleases. Additions and BetWrraeiits Subsequent to December 31, 1919. The annual reports of the company on file with the Commission show that there has been added to the properties in the years 1920, 1921 and 1922, $347,903 in additions and betterments. This figure is faulty for the same reason that the figure of total additions and bet - terments, 1903 to 1919, inclusive, was faulty. Under the company's 1. 2. 3.

            <seg id="p240">240 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT practices additions and betterments as actually made are not so record - ed in the books. During the years mentioned the company has not ■old other securities. It has charged against current revenues in those same years $608,314, and accrued the amount in its depreciation re serve account. These were actually earned dollars which were thus separated from current revenues and recorded as an operating expense affecting the final net return. The conclusion would not be violent that the additions and betterments had been made from this fund. If the company's property has depreciated as much in this period as the books indicate it is fair to say that there has been no increase in value to the plant to the end of 1922. We said in order dated Sep - tember 6, 1921, under this proceeding that in our opinion the amount charged against revenues for accruing and unrealized depreciation was more than essential. To the extent this is true the accounts call certain funds "depreciation reserve" which are actually "surplus," and to the extent the actual depreciation of property in existence in August, 1919, and not since retired^is less than the additions made since that Ete, the properties may now be of higher value than we have found - the earlier date. The record is insufficient for us to pass now on Is matter. Revenues and Kx|M-mlituree. This is a rate case. Applicant company has been operating on emporary rates since August 6, 1919, pursuant to the order of the uprenie court. It now becomes necessary to measure against net evenues as they have been earned in the past three years the rights '. the company to a fair return on the value which we have found, 'estimony of the company was that it should earn eight per cent in rder to attract capital. It has outstanding $4,000,000 of preferred tock which bears five per cent and the owners of that stock are power - ess to change the rate of return. It has also outstanding $9,619,000 [ bonds which bear five per cent interest. These bonds fall due In 928 and the rate of return on this portion of the property of this com - any must be at least equal to what it will have to pay in its rennanc - ng. In our subsequent computations we will consider as legitimate jerating expenses all taxes, including federal income taxes. Taking hat fact into account, Galveston Electric Co. v. City of Galveeton et 1., supra, together with the permanent existence of low rate preferred tock, as influencing our conclusions on the rate of return, we will use seven per cent as representing the necessary annual return on the air value. </seg>
            <seg id="p241">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 241 Below is a computation for the years 1920, 2921, and 1922 of earnings and expenses of the Nebraska properties: * We have followed entirely the company's method of allocating expenses between the leased properties and those here under consider - ation. The gross operating earnings would be reduced by the amount now currently earned from the rental of the old power house which we have excluded from the rate base. That rental, amounting to $4500 a year, is probably offset by the taxes which would accrue and be charged against the applicant on the building and land and on the cars which are owned in Omaha but used in Council Bluffs without compensation. It will be seen, however, from the tabulation that the company's net earnings have fallen considerably below a fair return on a fair value of the property. That deficit in 1922 was less than in 1921 and 1920 because the company reduced expenses by certain reductions In wages and in fuel costs. The main problem this company faces is that there is a steady decline in volume of traffic in place of the increase which might be looked for in a steadily growing city. This is, we think, almost en - tirely the influence of private motor conveyances. No end to the small but steady shrink in volume of traffic has yet appeared. However, the company has taken a generous view of the situation. In its brief in support of its application it said: "The factors justifying ceonomlc rates are present at the time of filing this brief. The company is not pressing for the In - crease in rates necessary to yield a reasonable return upon the value of the property, and is of the opinion that the existing rates 1W22 Gross operating earnings 13,667,424 Operating expenses 2,698,260 1»2I $3,735,037 2,903,167 lvau $3,939,570 3,015,982 Operating income $ 969,164 Other income 39,446 $ 831,870 17,244 $ 923,588 16,093 Total income $1,008,610 Less taxes, etc 382,536 * 849,114 377,220 $ 939,681 363,207 $ 626,074 Plus P. &amp; L. adjustment 4,454 $ 471,894 3.255 $ 576,474 6,060 Available for returns $ 630,528 7 % on (air value minus Iowa proportion for use Nebraska property $ 928,905 $ 475,149 $ 928,905 $ 582,534 $ 928,905 Deficit I 298,377 I 453,756 $ 346,371 </seg>
            <seg id="p242">242 should be continued in effect temporarily and until such time as the company may hereafter formally apply to the Commission for an increase in the rates. The company's business indicates some improvement and some reduction in operating costs is being effected. An improvement is also taking place in industry in gen - eral, which, it is hoped, will be reflected in due time in greater operating revenues to the company. It may be that the country is in the way of a general recovery from the existing depression and that the restoration of normal conditions will enable the com - pany to recoup its losses and earn a reasonable compensation for its service without an increase of rates. The prevailing purpose in industry is to assist this movement in a general way as much as possible, and particularly in the acceptance of lower incomes, and the company shares in this purpose. The company is also actuated by its traditional desire for a satisfied patronage and a greater Omaha, and it intends to do everything in its power to achieve those ends. Consequently, and inasmuch as the return now received by the company is considerably below the compen - sation to which the company is lawfully entitled on the basis of any finding as to value based upon the record, the Commission should disregard the question of rates in arriving at the value of the property." tWe are thus temporarily relieved of the necessity of passing on :hods by which the company can add to its net return that amount which it is entitled in law. A mere statement of the results of operation makes perfectly clear that we must approve in this our final order the temporary rate base under which the company is now operating. It is, of course, sub - ject to review at any time when operating conditions change, on our motion, complaint, or on application of the company in proper pro - ceedings. Reference has been made from time to time in this opinion to ertain of the accounting methods of the company which we have ndicated appear to us to lead to undesirable conclusions on the books, his has particular reference to the rules which have been followed or many years in making charges against depreciation reserve.

BY THK COMMISSION This matter came on to be heard by the Commission on the application of the Lincoln Traction Company for authority to increase its rates of fares. It originated on Application Nos. 3066, 3298 and 3461, which were consolidated by motion of the Commission and heard jointly. An order was entered accordingly June 17, 1918, (11 N. S. R. C. 261). from which applicant appealed to the supreme court of this state, by which it was remanded to the Commission with instructions to proceed "de novo." ( 12 N. S. R. C. 415). The Commission issued a resolution under Application No. 3933, which directed applicant to make and submit a valuation. Applicant filed a new petition which was jointed with the resolution by motion of the Commission when the hearing was held. </seg>
            <seg id="p244">244 I A number of street railway properties, under separate ownerships, re operated with horse-power in Lincoln as early as 1880. Some of se companies were consolidated in 1891 in the name of The Lincoln eet Railway Company, and its lines were electrified shortly there - er. Important changes in track and roadway took place at this le. Some lines were sold, others were removed, and new lines and mections constructed for operating purposes. Important additions the power plant were also made, and when these changes were torn - ted the company owned and operated a modern street railway tern as of that time, which included about forty-two miles of track 1 the necessary equipment. This company, which was the largest the field, and certain others, went into receiverships about this time. ere they remained in the years of 1895, 1896 and 1897. The Lincoln Traction Company was organized in 1898 for the pur - pose of purchasing these properties. This company also made changes in the arrangements of its tracks, and an additional track was provided for certain lines. An exact record of all these changes, as each one may have affected the net investment in plant, is not available. In 1901 the company began the construction of a distribution stem for electric light and power service. About the same time the ncoln Heat, Light and Power company was organized, and a - as constructed for the distribution of steam for heating purposes in le business district. This was a separate corporation but the as owned by the Lincoln Traction company. Tiiese auxiliaries are ill operated by applicant and receive their supply of electric energy nd steam from its power station. Therefore, this situation will equire a separation of the operating costs of the power plant between e street railway, electric and heating service. Applicant has tempted to keep separate construction costs ;tn&lt;l operating records r these utilities. The Lincoln Traction company was consolidated with the Citizens treet Railway company, and the Citizens lnterurban company la 909, in the name of The Lincoln Traction company. These latter roperties had been constructed since lXHs. The construction cost of le new companies is available and a comparison of the capital liabili - es of the old and new companies shows that stock was liberally ssued in connection with this consolidation. Tins' is the last import - nt change in the ownership and operation of the properties with the exception that at this time the Commission ordered applicant to keep ■ accounts under certain rules, prescribed by the Commission, for the urpose of regulating the company's controlling accounts and to insure hat the operation of the auxiliaries would not be a burden on the reet railway property. </seg>
            <seg id="p245">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 245 At the time of the hearing, applicant offered two statements pre - pared by different accounting experts, which showed the ledger costs of the property from 188 7 to date, including the electric distribution system. These were described as bare-bones costs, in so far as they did not include any sum for intangibles, such as franchises and going concern. Such general expenses as were charged on the books of the company were accepted, but they included all charges to plant with - out regard to the fact that the funds may have come from the deprecia - tion reserve, operating revenues or new capital. The preparation of these exhibits required a careful review of charges to plant through a period of thirty years in which many important entries were made. In general, the experts assumed that the bonds issued Ly the com - pany were represented by property, but the ledger costs were care - fully examined to determine the actual investment, and for the pur - poses of comparison with the bonds outstanding at important periods in the history of the company. Both experts excluded certain charges to capital which, in their judgment, were not fully supported by the accounts. The two results derived in this manner, differ in the sum of approximately $280,000. This may be accounted for by the differ - ence in judgment between experts in handling certain items. Expert Powell has had a long acquaintance with the property, and has been quite familiar with the accounts of the company for a number of years. Therefore, his book cost of $2, 934, 144 is the more acceptable. He al.-o found the cost of the company's electric distribution system, which is included in the above total in the sum of $390,142. When this sum is deducted, his cost for the street railway property, includ - ing the depreciation reserve invested in plant, is $2,544,002. Much of the testimony of the accounting experts related to fixed capital issued at times of consolidations, to show their relation to p'ant investment. In the same way, charges to operating revenues and credits to the depreciation reserve were developed to show their rela - tion to new property and operating deficits claimed by the applicant in the early days of operation. The Commission has before it two com - plete inventories and appraisals of applicant's property, and will not attempt to trace the source of funds which were used for construction or the purchases of new property, as to whether they came from earn - ings, the reserve or new capital, in the period prior to regulation by the Commission. Applicant cannot complain if its rates of fares were insufficient at that time, or if its profits were invested in new plant, which procedure may be reflected in operating deficits. The company was free to invest its profits in new plant or spread them among the stockholders as it may have pleased the directors. As far as operating results are material to the issues herein, the Commission will use a later period in which uniform accounts have been kept, as prescribed by the Commission. </seg>
            <seg id="p246">246 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT CThe city of Lincoln, by its expert, also presented a book cost of property covering a period from 1898 to September 1, 1919. He attempted to accumulate the entire cost from the records of the com - pany, showing expenditures for replacements and additions and better - ments, with the exception of real estate owned by the company in 1898. which he added to his final figure. This involves the assumption that mil of applicant's property in service in 1898 has been replaced or re - moved, and that all ot the cost of the property now in existence could be found in the records of additions' and betterments and replace - ments. The company's records show that when a replacement of track was made, the cost of the new material and labor was accounted for. but the old material reused and the grading or excavation, which had been originally charged to plant investment, were not followed up on the hooks. Further, if old rails and ties were not reused in the same location or returned to the store yard for credit, they may have been used immediately in a track extension, and in this case also the old material wag not recharged. Again, if a section of track in any loca - tion had not been replaced or reconstructed in this period, no reroril of its original cost could appear in his insults. In fact, the company's records of replacements and net additions and betterments were m&gt;t kept in a manner to reflect the historical development of the property and changes in plant, but were made for the purpose of finding the net cost in dollars, in order that proper charges to depreciati 1 capital investment might be made; and all records of r were carried forward on the assumption that existing property properly charged at the time of its original construction. The expert attempted to show that the company had purchased as much, if not more, property since 18&amp;S. with the exception ■ I estate, than it had reported in the invertory: and in support of his l contention, he found the costs and quantities of all the materials and equipment purchased by the company after 1898, and these apparently exceeded the corresponding quantities listed. As to power station, equipment and street cars, a direct comparison with the- inventory could be made, but as to track and distribution, where the materials could not be identified, his results are not convincing, for the v - that poles, ties, wire and rail in plant are subject to frequent rc\ ment. It is also clear that the materials purchased since 1898 niig'it exceed the corresponding quantities as listed, on account of replace - ments and changes in plant, and still fail to account for property in place prior to this time. We are convinced that the toti.l materials purchased in the period will not bear a fixed relation to the property in place; and conclusions drawn from such a comparison are confus - ing. A number of his charges to plant were plainly incomplete. Although correct for accounting purposes, as they involve property in </seg>
            <seg id="p247">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 247 place when the charge was made. In view of the tact that the Com - mission has before it a definite measure of the quantities of the property in place at the time of the appraisement, the Commission does not find his results of much assistance in arriving at a con - clusion. Applicant's showing also included an inventory and appraisal of its physical property devoted to street railway services prepared by an appraisal engineer on the basis of the cost of replacing it new as of September 1, 1919, in the sum of $4,289,380, and less depreciation in the amount of $3,727,759. The information as to the value of real estate included in the engineer's exhibit, was supplied by officers of the company, and the quantities of the other classes of property were determined by the engineer by count and measurement in the field. The cost new and present value of the property was divided as follows: Reproduction Present Way and structures includes right of way and real estate in the sum of $157,000. This comprises all the land owned by the company. Some of the parcels are not entirely devoted to carrier purposes, but it was necessary to acquire them in order to get the parts serviceable to the Company. More lots were purchased in the vicinity of the power station than are in use for carrier purposes at this time, but they were purchased to provide room for growth in the plant, which the Commission cannot say will not take place. However, they were undoubtedly purchased at prices considerably lower than they have been listed here. One small tract located in Belmont, valued at $500, is dearly separated from the present and future operations of the company. This will be excluded as non-carrier land. Ornamental steel poles to the extent of one hundred and thirty-eight will also be excluded for the reason that they are the property of the lot owners where they are located. Miscellaneous and general expenditures are based on the fo'.low - ing percentages, which were applied to the entire property, including right of way and real estate: Cost. New Way and Structures $2,046,921 Equipment 685, BS9 Power 814,817 Miscellaneous and General ,. 393,083 Working Capital 125,000 Going Concern Value 326,000 Value $1,773,02 456,17 713,981 335,68 125,00 325,00 $4,289,380 $3,727,75 3,727,75 </seg>
            <seg id="p248">248 The Commission will not disturb these percentages. However, it does not entirely agree with their application. In the Minnesota rate cases, the supreme court of the United States has said that. "It was error to add to the amount taken as a present value of the land, the further sums calculated on that value, which were embraced in the items of engineering, superintendence, legal expenses, contingencies and interest during construction." The Commission will exclude the amount of general expenses which were computed on right of way and real estate. The miscellaneous expenses, in the amount of 2 per cent, have been described as in - corporation fees and other expenses incidental to organizing the corporation, cost of soliciting subscriptions tor stock and cost of secur - ing capital, and salaries and expenses of general officers and their clerks. This will be allowed, as it includes the cost of financing. Working capital was computed by using a percentage of the estimated coat of the fixed property and equipment as of the time of the inventory. The company's records show that the average amount invested in materials and supplies in the recent past was approximate - ly $75,000. This includes coal and oil at current prices, and as the remaining items in this account are sensitive to changes in market prices, the average investment of the company will be preferred to an arbitrary percentage. To this amount the Commission will add $25. - 000 to provide for cash requirements. The sum of $325,000 for going concern value was included in the engineer's estimate. This amount represents accumulated deficits which were found, from a study of the book cost of the property with relation to net earnings over a period of years, and was used as m measure of the cost of developing the business. Early deficits relate to historical costs and not to the cost of replacement at a later time. When a utility elects to present its property for a new rate base dur - ing a period of inflated costs, and claims the advantages resulting from their application, it must also assume the existence of all the condi - tions surrounding the property, such as the market for its service. This element of value will be considered later in this opinion. When the above corrections have been made, the cost new of the property appears as follow*: Engineering .......«». 3.0 Legal Expenses ,. „.„.

            <seg id="p249">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 249 Applicant's engineer testified that the average price level of his appraisal was approximately sixty per cent above the pre-war plane, and he believed that this percentage was conservative, in view of the fact that he had disregarded extreme prices which were apparently erratic. A comparison of the actual cost of a number of items of plant purchased in the years 1918 and 1919 inclusive, indicate that the engineer's costs in these instances were higher than the sixty per cent advance, and were, therefore, liberal rather than conservative. This is noted in connection with power station equipment and street cars. He used the reproduction theory, notwithstanding the fact that building of this character was restricted by the government at this time, and he admitted that it would have been impossible to buy the materials and equipment, even if the construction had not been prohibited by law. He also testified that the financing of a project of this magnitude would have been extremely difficult under these condi - tions. He did not maintain, however, that his results were a final measure of fair value, but merely reflected what the property would have cost if it had been possible to build it. He further testified that the costs used in the inventory would not be lower for some time to come. Graphs were offered in evidence, which were made from the average commodity prices compiled by the United States Bureau of Labor statistics for the years 1913 to 1921 inclusive. They show that prices rose abruptly, beginning in 1914 and reached a peak of 270 per cent on May 1, 1920, compared with the year 1913. Prices were mounting rapidly at the time the appraisement was offered in evi - dence, but they dropped abruptly after May 1, 1920; and before the hearing was completed had declined to 142 per cent or eighteen points below the average used in the appraisement. These facts plainly indicate the extremely unstable and transitory nature of the costs used. The theoretical construction period included the years 1918 and 1919. In appraising property of this magnitude under the reproduction theory, it has been customary to use a period of sufficient length to afford a fair average of the experienced costs in the con - struction of the property. Five-year, and in some instances ten-year periods have been used, over which prices were averaged, notwith - standing the fact that the time actually required to replace the property may be considerably less than this.

            <seg id="p250">250 prices is unfair, even aa a matter of theory. It is always difficult to entertain the reproduction theory with all its assumptions as applied to existing property, for the reason that plants of this character do not come into existence suddenly, but require a long period of years for their development. However, the Commission recognizes the fact that appreciation has affected the value of the property, due to the rise in price levels, in so far as they appear to be sustained and con - ditions indicate that they may continue. This will be considered in the final conclusion. The record also includes an estimated historical cost of appli - cant's propeFty, prepared by the Commission's engineer. The quanti - ties of the various classes were carefully compiled from an actual count and inspection in the field in connection with the uses of reli - able data which was verified as far as practicable. His estimated historical cost new was $2,504,102, which he de - preciated to $1,861,124. These results included the depreciation reserve invested in plant. The cost of certain items, particularly in the power plant, where they could be identified, were taken directly from the company's records. — also a number of cars which had been purchased in recent years. Material costs of the tract structure were based on weighted averages of actual purchases by the company over a ten-year period prior to the hearing. The quantities of labor were estimated, and the rates of pay applied were those experienced by the company in the same period. When the records of purchases did not supply the data required, reliable sources of information were used and the labor was estimated. The cost of poles in place in the distri - bution system was computed in the same manner prior to the year 1916. Poles installed after this date were included at the estimated cost as of the time of installation. The element of uncertainty in his estimate was largely restricted to the cost of the labor, where it could not be obtained from the applicant's records. The cost of property affected by rising prices prior to the year 1919 has been included in his figures. Right of way and real estate included in the cost statement of the Commission's engineer, was estimated by three real estate men acquainted with the property, as of the year 1914, as the cost of these tracts could not be found in applicant's records. The figure he has used probably exceeds the price paid by the company, as much of it was acquired many years ago, and it is not far from the fact to aay that the same degree of appreciation has taken place in real estate since 1914 as disclosed by the record that has accrued in the other Kof plant. The lot in Belmont will be excluded here for the stated above. The ornamental poles referred to were not in - in his inventory. As to general expense, the Commission's </seg>
            <seg id="p251">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 251 engineer used the reproduction theory, and erred also in the applica - tion of these percentages to right of way and real estate. He used five per cent for engineering and superintendence and six per cent for interest during construction, based on a three year program. The engineering of the different types of track certainly cannot amount to this percentage of its cost, and the cost of direct supervision is in - cluded in the units. The street cars were purchased ready for opera - tion, with the exception of a few which were reconstructed. Six per cent for interest during construction, when applied to one-half of a three year period is excessive in that it does not reflect the experience of the company in growth of its property, much of which has been added under operation. The Commission will use the percentage? found in applicant's inventory, and apply them here in the same manner. The historical cost includes working capital to the extent of stores and supplies, which is taken from the experience of the com - pany as of the time of the investigation. Twenty-five thousand dollars will be added for applicant's cash requirements. No allowance was made for the cost of financing; but in the use of applicant's per cent - age for general expenses, this has been provided for. When these adjustments have been made, the estimated historical cost new figure becomes $2,462,851 and is comparable with applicant's reproduction cost new of $3,916,553, exclusive of going value, and its book cost in the sum of $2,544,002. I&gt;Kl*KEtlATlON The accounting experts for the company did not deduct any rum from their final figures as a measure of the loss of value in tilt prop - erty, resulting from wear and tear and other elements of deprecia - tion. The expert for the city testified that he found a loss in size anl weight of materials in the track structure and electric distribution system, for which he made a deduction. His conclusion was based on a number of measurements and a more extended inspection. The methods he applied in depreciating the other classes of plant are not explained further than the statement that his results represented his judgment based on experience. The exact relationship between loss in size and weight and condition new as a measure of depreciation in certain classes of plant is not clear, and if inadequacy and obsolescence were reflected in his conclusions, he did not say to what extent. Applicant's engineer measured the amount of depreciation in t'ue property by inspection, and was emphatic in his refusal lo recognize depreciation beyond the extent disclosed by observation, with the ex - ception that inadequacy and obsolescence as elements of depreciation may have unconsciously influenced the mind of the inspector. In his computations on track and overhead, he used thirty to forty-five as a minimum per cent of the cost now remaining in the property, and </seg>
            <seg id="p252">252 treated it as non-depreciable, regardless of its apparent worth. He justified this practice by the statement that various classes of plant have a value in service which exceeds their cost new less their appar - ent depreciation, because they are a part of an operated property. The Commission recognizes the principle as sound but the application of it here is too liberal. Further, this method fails to Include a meas - ure of inadequacy and obsolescence in the unit when it is apparent. The Commission believes that this method of calculating depreciation fails to include all the factors which affect the value of the property and includes an intangible element in the depreciated coat which may result from the fart that its component parts are connected in a going plant. The Commission's engineer uxed life tables in his measure of depreciation in the power station equipment, which were modified to some extent as his judgment indicated that values had disappeared. He depreciated poles and wire in the distribution system on the in - spection basis with the exception of trolley wire which was measured. The condition of cars and buildings was found by combining life tables with the results of inspection having in mind the effect of ohsol. - and inadequacy. Much testimony turned about the different methods of depreda - tion used by the engineers as applied to the various classes of prop - perty. The track structure and rails in particular, received much attention. The possibility of finding the per cent condition of rails, ties and concrete in closed track by the inspection method, was the object of particular attack. The testimony shows that it is net. to reconstruct closed track at certain intervals of time, because the ties are no longer serviceable. This requires the removal of the rails, including the concrete in which the ties are buried. This is necessary. in addition to minor replacements which are made from iii:.e to time as operating conditions require. The testimony shows that the in - spection and measurement of rails will disclose evidence of wear, in - cluding the effects of rust and the condition of the base. These things affect volume and weight. Moreover, rails that have been in service for long periods of time may be expected to break, because of eh that take place in the metal itself. The inspection method fails to in - clude a measure of inherent depreciation. Applicant's engineer in - creased his allowance for depreciation in rails, following a second in - spection at the time of the hearing. As to power plant equipment, applicant's allowance for deprecia - tion, disclosed by inspection, was computed on the cost of repairs, i. e., the replacement of flues, grates, fire bricks, etc., in boilers. The same method was applied to engines, pumps and station piping. How. ever, it failed to recognize the obsolescence apparent in the vertical </seg>
            <seg id="p253">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 253 turbine and the low pressure boiler which is used in connection with the heating service. Here, also, applicant's engineer used an arbitrary minimum per cent condition, without relation to salvage, below which he refused to recognize depreciation, because the item was still in rvice The testimony with reference to inadequacy and obsolescence aa factors of depreciation was directed largely to the power plant and passenger cars. Applicant maintained that an old engine may be operated with the same degree of efficiency as when new, if it has been kept in repair. This was opposed with the argument that a new engine of the same capacity can be operated at less cost per unit of work done, by reason of improvements in the design, and that this fleets a loss in the value of the old machine. A&gt; tu cars, applicant measured the cost of making the necessary repairs to put them in good as new operating condition. The Com- mission's engineer depreciated them on a life basis, with some modi - fications in its' application to certain types which were old and still in service. The inspection method covers the cost of deferred mainten - ance, while the life tables, as they were modified, assume a fair operat - ing condition. Inadequacy and obsolescence have plainly overtaken the old double-end operated cars and others which have been recon - structed to provide for one-man operation. It is also true that the motors in the old cars are more expensive to operate than later types. This is made apparent by comparison of the old cars with the new light-weight Birneys, which have been designed for one-man operation and equipped with air brakes, safety appliances and more efficient in The average per cent condition of the depreciable property, as by applicant'! engineer, is 85. The Commission's engineer's percentage for the same property is 72. These results reflect the two extremes. The Commission is convinced that the use of inspection method exclusively, as applied to all classes of plant, does not result in a full measure of the depreciation existing in the property. Mortality arc averages based on past experience and include a measure of inadequacy and obsolescence where it has occurred. Their applica - tion to existing property assumes that inadequacy and obsolescence will occur in the future in the same degree that it has in the past. Tin- Commission does not believe that this is always true. A unit of plant may serve its purpose before progress in the art will require Us rottn in-^nt. Age in service, however, does affect the value of property as time advances. The Commission believes and so finds that the average condition per cent of applicant's property, exclusive of land and working capital, is 76. In finding this percentage, the Commis - sion has in mind that it will include any intangible value which may </seg>
            <seg id="p254">254 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT result from the (act that its various units are connected with an operated plant. When this percentage is applied it results in a repro - duction cost new, less depreciation, of $3,038,140, and a depreciated historical cost in the sum of $1,911,107. If the same treatment is applied to applicant's book cost, we would have a depreciated book value of $1,973,762. (rOING CONCERN VA1AE The supreme court of the United States has rejected the use of early deficits as a measure of going concern as an element of value in public utility properties. The price a willing buyer would pay for this property must be affected by the abnormal operating costs which have prevailed in recent years in connection with the general use of auto - motor transportation which has proved to be a serious competitor. The service supplied by this utility is much needed by the public unit will be demanded (or a long time U&gt; come, but the competitive -it na - tion has an important bearing on the present earning power of the property as well as the future. In fixing the per cent cond the depreciable property the rommission has given consider; all the going value that it finds in the property and no funli ure of this element will be added.

This also prevents comparison of revenues by years, of thesi- departments, prior to 1919. The volume .&gt;f business, however, of each department may be obtained from the following statement of revenue passengers carried by years, and current and steam sold by thf company. 1917 I'll* 1010 Passengers Carried 11,584,566 11,238,235 12,430,593 Kilowatt Hours Kilowatt Hours 6,433,218 6,831,194 8,027,706 Steam, 1000 pounds 92,728 75,643 93.284 1020 1021 1022 Passengers Carried 11,386,145 8,869,888 7,903,316 Kilowatt Hours Kilowatt Hours 9,158,543 8,340,637 9,422,815 Steam, 1000 pounds 82,359 68,382 80,993 </seg>
            <seg id="p257">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 257 Prom the above it appears that revenue passengers carried by the company have declined steadily since 1919, and current sold has increased continuously since 1917. In fact, the growth in the volume of current sold has been more than 100 per cent since 1915. The volume of steam sold has remained fairly constant. In previous years, the Commission has fixed the charges for current and steam sold to the company's light and heat departments, with the idea that the net traction revenues should not suffer by reason of these auxiliary activ - ities of the company. During the period of emergency rates since 1919, the Commission has considered all the revenues of the company which included the earnings of the heat and light departments. The company's generating plant consists of five steam and three internal combustion engines, with the necessary boilers for steam operation, circulating pumps, piping, etc., common to both. Three of the steam engines are connected with alternating current generators, and two with direct. Two of the oil engines are connected with direct current generators and one with an alternating current machine. These engines are used in different combinations at different times as the lead from the traction service, light and heat require. One low pressure boil - er is used at times for producing steam only. In general, direct current is um-cI for street railway operation and alternating current for light and power. It is also true that a part of thealternatingcurrent is trans - formed to direct for traction service. In the winter season, exhaust steam from the engines ia sold for heating purposes. The pro!. km is to determine the cost to the traction company of the electric current to the light and power division and steam supplied fur heat. The n is extremely complicated. Mr. Powell, expert for the company, made a very careful analysis of :he power house operating costs, in which he attempted to allocate eta) si's of service, all the expenses incidental to the p:udui-tion of current sold, in term:' of kilowatt hours on the switch - board, and steam per 1,000 pounds of water delivered to the meters. In making the extended calculation, It was necessary to d vide general expenses on a more or less arbitrary basis, which was suggested by the investment in the different classes of property involved, and the ex - perience of the company in the use of coal and oil. However, the actual costs to the company were used wherever these were available. He reached the conclusion that the cost per kilowatt hour on the switchboard was 3.05 cents and steam 75.02 cents per 1,000 pounds. These figures are based on the expenses of the company for the year 1920, and constitute the only information on this subject In the record, but operating costs have been reduced as indicated since this exhibit was prepared and it would be unfair to fix these charges at the rates found by the company's expert when the casts and assumption involved are rejected for other purposes.

OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Chairman This application was filed on December 17, 1919. Hearings were ad at various times in 1920 and following a hearing In July, 1920. le matter was taken under advisement but later the company re - nested permission to submit additional data with particular reference o the physical condition of the property and the amount required for aintenance and depreciation. On September 29. 1922, further hear - ng was had at which time the company submitted an amended applica - on. At the conclusion of that hearing applicant was advised that ertain improvements in the property should be made before any tn - rease in rates would be allowed. It was stated by those representing le Commercial Club and the business interests of the city that if lra - rovements were made in the central office equipment such as were utlined by the representative of the company there would he no ob - ection to an increase of rates. The two representatives of the rural patrons of the company Indicated that there would he objection to an ncrease in the farm rates although one stated that this might not be erious if the service were improved. It was apparent from the testimony of patrons and from admis - sions from the secretary and manager of the company that a new switchboard was required. Under dale ut Juiie 1ft, Ittt, Mr. B. G. Miller, manager of the company, advises that a new switchboard has been installed and that it is proposed to have the same in service by July 1, 1923. The company has expended several thousand dollars in making these improvements to its plant. Without doubi, the service will be greatly improved as a consequence. While the Commission has made an exhaustive analysis of the record in this case sufficient to justify the conclusion that the in - creased rates as now applied for are reasonable and necessary, it has not had time, nor will it have time prior to July 1, to present written findings to that effect.

SIPPLEMKXTAL ORDER TAYLOR, Chairman On November 4, 1921, this Commission Issued an order readjust* ing the rates of this company. One of the provisions of that order required the company to set up for the purpose of maintenance and depreciation twelve per cent on the original cost of the property plus additions and betterments. The company now submits an application for authority to reduce this allowance from twelve per cent to ten per cent. In support of its application It represents that in 1922 the effect of the order was to require it to charge against earnings the </seg>
            <seg id="p262">262 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT amount of $8,546.04. Of this amount $5,164.23 was expended, leaving a balance for the reserve of $3,381.81. It is alleged that the main - tenance for 1922 was practically normal and that the plant is now In as good, or better, condition than it was at the beginning of 1921. It in urged that maintenance for the years 1921 and 1922 together repre - sent a normal condition of the property. In 1920, the year prior to the investigation in this case, and the gures of which were used as a basis for determining the rates ap - roved, the expenditures for maintenance and depreciation amounted o fourteen per cent of the cost of the property. It was urged, how - ver, that this was an abnormal year and should not be used aa a easure for determining the allowance. It was charged by subscribers the time of the bearnig, however, and admitted by the company, tat certain portions of the plant were in poor condition and not in lape to render efficient service. The farm lines cover a wide area nd are expensive to maintain because of that fact. It is apparent that te company since the order has not made any extensive reconstruc - on. There must yet remain considerable to do to restore the property o a proper standard. The mere fact that the company did not in 922 expend the full allowance required by the Commission does not emonstrate that the amount is excessive. The allowances are in - nded to cover not only current replacement but a reserve for future eplacements and no reserve could ever be accumulated if the full mount was expended each year. In 1922, the company had a net Income of {1,874. 18 after paying all operating expenses and taxes. Out of this it paid interest at the rate of eight pur cent on current indebtedness of $13,700, and also declared a dividend of four per cent on the $30,000 of capital stock. This left a deficit of $424.62. I The Commission is still of the opinion that a very considerable punt of replacement should yet be made in this property. If the awance for maintenance and depreciation is reduced from twelve eleven per cent it will give the company a little over $700 to add to net. Under the circumstances we think this should suffice for the «ent year at least. If at a later time the showing becomes more orable a further readjustment downward in the maintenance and jreciation allowance may be made. ORDER tIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the original order in this e be amended so as to provide that the annual allowance for main - ance and depreciation shall be eleven per cent on the original coat the property instead of twelve per cent. </seg>

            <seg id="p265">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 265 OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: Applicant company was organized in January, 1904. At that time {6.000 of stock was issued, all of which was purchased for cash, the par value being $10 per share. Subsequently stock in the amount of $4,750 was issued, )2,577 of which was issued as stock dividends. One thousand dollars of stock was sold at a premium of $150. During its history the company has paid cash dividends of an average of 9 1-3 per rent on the stock outstanding. The stock has always been closely held. As in most independent companies of this size and character a large amount of work has been done by stockholders and officers with - out immediate compensation, the plan being to put the services and ttiH surplus income into property with the expectation of ultimately realizing on the same through the increased value of the property. The owners are now desirous, however, of increasing the amount of outstanding stork so that it will more nearly represent the fair value of their property. This is an application to issue an additional $20,000 of common stork and distribute the same among the stockholders In proportion to their existing holdings with the idea that the total out - standing issue of $30,750 will then more nearly reflect the actual investment in the property. The book value of the property at the present time is $22,171.96. It does not represent, however, the actual investment in the property for the reason that for several years the company followed the practice of writing ten per cent out of its prop - erty account to take care of depreciation. It was not until within recent years that they adopted the Commission's plan of setting up an allowance out of earnings to represent the depreciation in the property. At the time of the hearing no valuation had been made of the property by the Commission nor by the company. Subsequent to the hearing such valuation was made by our engineering department on the basis of historical or original cost. The Commission's engineers And an original cost of $40,990.26 and a depreciated cost of $26,901.39. The company accepts this as a fairly accurate inventory of its physical properties. As stated it is made on the basis of the original cost of the property, and includes at war prices only such portions of the property as may have been installed during the war period. There has been but a small portion of such property placed. The difference between the Commission's figure of gross cost of $40,990.26 and the company's book cost at the time of the bearing of $22,171.96, was due, first, to the fact that considerable costs which the engineers found were in fact donated and, second, to the practice of the company, through a period of its existence, in writing off esti- </seg>
            <seg id="p266">266 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT mated depreciation rather than in leaving the assets at full cost amount and carrying as a liability the estimated depreciation. The application of the company would result in stock outstand - g after the stock dividend of $30,750. There is no indebtedness, t is probable that the fair value of the company as a rate base would mount to this much, or more. This company has, through unusually irudent and successful management, succeeded in building up a prop - rty, at rates which are at least relatively reasonable, very much in xcess of the outstanding securities. It is entitled to have the property uilt by reason of that prudent management represented in securities, n order that at any future time that it is necessary to sell stock the ew stockholders will not share in that portion of the property built trough the sacrifice of time and effort and money by those now wnlng it. However, the assets of a company under all accounting rules of which we are familiar are presumed to represent cost as near as may be. If the assets of this company are to continue to represent cost and if the application is to be approved the balance sheet would show an excess of capital liabilities over and above the assets.

So far as the books are concerned it would indicate that a ock dividend had been paid in excess of the property. This could be iminated only by abandoning the accounting principle that the i tatement should represent costs, or the writing into the assets of an tern to represent accretions due to higher prices of units of property. n the latter instance there would be clearly reflected that the company tad paid a stock dividend representing a writing up of its property alues. This practice was much used by private business during the ar and post-war periods of unusual price levels ar.c!, generally speak - ng, it resulted In later embarrassment where concerns had gone on le assumption that this added value due to reinventory was in fact arned and dividends had been distributed.

We hare not, however, gone beyond the point of permitting stock dividends up to the de - preciated cost or, in the absence of actual figures, carefully esti - mated costs. There appear also to be constitutional objections to the approval of the application to the extent that it would result in a stock dividend in excess of depreciated cost.

Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this sixth day of October. 1923. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION H. O. Taylor. Chairman Attest: John E. Curtiss. Secretary (SEAL) TAYLOR, dissenting I find myself out of accord with the majority on the final con - clusions adopted in this case. In my opinion the full amount of stock applied for by the company might be allowed without injury la the public, either present or future. As stated in the majority opinion, the value of the property as determined by the engineer is based oc historical or original cost and makes no allowance (or present worth of the property due to enhanced prices. No attempt is made by my colleagues to ascertain the present fair value of this property, but ad - mittedly it is in excess of the depreciated value found on the basis used by the engineer. One of the prime reasons given for disallowing the claim for increment in the property is that it would conflict with present methods of accounting. As to that, my own opinion is that a mere method of bookkeeping should not be paramount to the rights of the parties at interest. The balance sheet even as shown would clearly disclose the nature of the transaction and would leave no one In doubt as to what had taken place. The depreciated value found by the engineer, of course, contains nothing for working capital or going concern value. It is impossible to determine definitely what the final plane of material and labor costs will be. If, however, we were to use an increase of 33 1-3 per cent over original cost, as was approved by the .supreme court of the United States in Ualvc*ton Electric Co. v. City of Oalvoton, 66 U. S. Court Reports, 66 L. ed., 362, we would have a present physical value of a little less than $36,000, or if we were to make an allowance of 25 per cent as did the same court in a more recent case (the State of Missouri ex rel, Southwestern Bell Telephone Company v. Public Service Com - mission of Missouri 262 U. S. 276) we would have a figure represent - ing present physical value of {33,626. The present level of prices is Still from 50 per cent to 80 per cent above the pre war plane of 1914. It is probably not within the human mind to know definitely when the return to the normal will take place. It seems quite probable, how- </seg>
            <seg id="p269">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 269 ever, that for many years it may not return to the lower basis that existed in the early days of the development of this company. As the learned justice remarks in the Missouri case just referred to "An honest and intelligent forecast of probable future values made upon a view of all the relevant circumstances, is essential." This would indicate that the court had in mind a reasonably permanent level, eliminating as tar as is humanly possible both the high and the low points. As stated, the court in that case considered that an increase of twenty-five per cent over the original cost of the property repre - sented an honest and intelligent forecast. It may be urged that it is unwise to issue stock to represent any portion of the so-called unearned increment in a property. The courts have indicated conclusivley, however, that the fair value of a property cannot be ascertained without taking this element into consideration. It appears illogical that a corporation may be allowed to earn a return upon the fair value of its property and at the same time the stock - holders of the company be denied evidence of their ownership in such fair value. Payment of dividends on capital stock representing only a small portion of the fair value greatly distorts the financial showing of the company and makes it appear to be much more prosperous than it actually is. In the case of a public utility such misleading showing prompts the public to believe that the rates are grossly excessive. It goes without saying that it would be the heighth of folly to authorize an issue of stock based on abnormally high costs. In event of the inevitable shrinkage in value the outstanding securities would then exceed the value of the property. Caution should be exercised to see that when the stock is issued there is a reasonable margin of safety between the stock issue and the value of the property. This margin of safety, however, is necessarily determined when the fair value of the property is established, since the very term "fair value" involves the avoidance of adopting the abnormal in any form. While in the present case the requirement does not exist, it might very readily be the case that the company, finding it necessary to issue new securities for additions and betterments, might be deterred from doing so through the inequity to existing stockholders created through denial to them of evidence of their ownership in the fair value of the property. In other words new purchasers of stock would thus come in to share in the surplus rightfully belonging to the old stock - holders. This could not be equalized except by the use of the doubtful alternative of selling the stock at a premium. The sale of stock at a premium is always more or less difficult except in old established com - panies of unquestioned credit, and the problem of financing small utilities like the one in the instant case would be very greatly intensi - fied. Moreover, it is doubtful whether the premium could be made adequate to equalize the equities as between the old and the new stock- </seg>
            <seg id="p270">270 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Kders. In such case it would seem that the old stockholders could land as a matter of right and of law that the matter be adjusted by the issuance to them of sufficient stock to represent their full equity in the property. We have shown that in this case the proposed issue of stock will be well within the present physical value of the property without making an allowance for working capital and going concern value. It needs no argument to show that money necessary as a working fund is as essential a part of the capital as the money invested in the physi - cal property. In small properties of this size the Commission has held that from three per cent to five pre cent is not excessive for this pur - pose. The element of going concern is regarded by our courts as necessary to be taken into consideration in determining fair value. In my opinion it is not necessary for the purposes of this case to attempt to fix the amount of going concern. Whatever the amount, as I have shown, it will be in excess of the amount of stock authorized.

It also has a large develop - ment of (arm business. To date the method of financing, over and above the first issue of $100,000 of stock, has been through short-time notes and through open account borrowings, these latter being the main source of funds for construction purposes. Applicant is a close corporation, the con - trolling interest being in the hands of a former resident of Seward, now a wealthy businessman of Chicago.

            <seg id="p272">272 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT I The company believed that its statement of physical property in error, basing such conclusion on facts of record but not neces - r to mention here. For that reason a careful inventory and valu - &gt;n of all the properties was made by it and submitted in evidence. 9 data has been carefully checked by the Commission's engineering artment and in testimony the Commission's engineer agreed that original cost of the hydro-electric plants was not overstated in books of the company. Some differences existed between the ipany's engineers and those of the Commission relative to the prob - ! cost of the transmission lines, but these differences were not large, ire is a very considerable difference of opinion as to the extent of reciation in the properties and also a difference between the emission's engineers and those of the company with regard to so - ed "general expenses of construction", which may be summarized engineering and superintendence and interest and taxes during Btruction. In its showing to the Commission the company laid no claim to going concern value and contented itself with making no claim at this time for any value in capitalization on its water power rights. There does not appear to have been any stock issued or any liabil - ities incurred which do not represent dollars actually expended for construction purposes. This preliminary order is being entered as a matter of con - venience to applicant. While the extent of the application would not require a further scrutiny than that neces: ary to reach a positive . &lt;&gt;n - clusion, the amount of stock which the company desires tu tam iu its re-financing plan does not exceed the present value of the properties. plus a reasonable working capital. However, the nature of the case made by the company and the very great care with which it lias pre - sented its evidence warrants the Commission in going further and de - termining the fair value of those properties as of August 31, 1922. The company has urged the high desirability of having the re - financing show on the books as of December 31, 1922, in order to clear up certain interest-bearing short-time obligations as of that date. This contention of the company has so appealed to the Commission that a preliminary order Is being entered, although the record will be more carefully analyzed in a subsequent order. It is shown in the statement above that the company claims gross book assets of $339,420. Its inventory, presented as Exhibit No. 1 in the case, lays claim to gross assets of $954,766.65. The difference here is due in part to a re-writing of the value of the transmission lines following an inventory and valuation, in part to an arbitrary set-up of working capital of five per cent of the physical properties. </seg>
            <seg id="p273">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 273 and in part to the inclusion of engineering and superintendence at an arbitrary ten per cent of the cost shown by the books and to the inclu - sion of interest and taxes on an estimated rather than an actual basis. In fact, the inventory and valuation presented by the company Is a mixture of actual expenditures and of certain theoretical items. \\&gt; are not going fully into this at this time, but in order to measure whether it is safe to authorize the company to proceed at this time with its re-financing of liabilities we have setup the "bare bones" cost of the power plants, as shown by the company and as accepted by our engineers, the company's "bare bones" cost of the transmission lines, which varies a few thousand dollars only from the figure arrived at by the Commission's engineers, and inclusive of working capital sufficient to meet the expenditures of the company for operation for one-third of a year. We can thus arrive at skeleton assets, excluding certain liquid assets and likewise excluding certain corresponding liabilities. Then we have the following computation: August 81, 1922. Assets Operating plants $492,017.01 Transmission lines, etc 295,003.50 Utility equipment and office furniture.... 8, 434. 81 Working capital 15,000.00 Total $810,455.32 Liabilities.

It is not intended to indicate that the Commission has excluded denniely any items of value claimed by the company. As before stated, the Commission's engineers are not agreed that the depreciation reserve shown on the books covers the actual deprecia - tion, although that is claimed by the company. The statement does show that there is reasonably, in the most conservative view of the property, a surplus of considerable magnitude, ample to cover any adjustments in conclusions which the Commission may arrive at in its more comprehensive review of the record in a final order yet to be entered. The authority to issue the capital stock will be entered. </seg>

            <seg id="p275">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 275 poned from time to time but is bow taken up for the reason that the company has exhausted a previous issue of securities and finds it neces - sary to hare additional stock available for sale. The company has an authorized capital of $11,000,000 — $3,500, - 000 of which is common stock, $100,000 preferred stock and $7,500,000 special preferred stock. Of this amount there is issued and outstand - ing at the present time $2,823,032 of common stock, $34,581 of pre - ferred stock and $3,926,500 of special preferred stock. In addition thereto there is outstanding $1,500,000 of bonds. This makes the total capital liabilities $8,284,113. The company, as of December 31, 1921, had gross assets of $10,263,488. The book value of its physical plant as of October, 1922, amounts to $9,243,033. It is apparent, therefore, that an additional issue of $500,000 of securities would leave a safe margin between the total outstanding securities and the book value of the fixed property. The margin between the securities and the gross assets would be considerably greater. The company has submitted a statement showing the net addi - tions to its plant for the years 1920, 1921 and the eight months of 1922. These aggregate $1,423,405.19. The books of the company are kept according to the Interstate Commerce Commission's system of uniform accounting and make careful separation between expenditures tor operating expenses, replacements and additions to plant. The figures submitted by the company have been checked by the telephone accountant of the Commission and are found to be correct. In 1920, the company was authorized to issue $300,000 of bonds. This money was used for the sole purpose of defraying the cost of additions and betterments to the property. Deducting this amount from the net additions in the two years and eight months leaves $1,123,000, which is over twice the amount of the issue herein prayed for. This company has been so fortunate in recent years as to be able to place a very considerable portion of its securities in the form of its common stock in the territory which it serves. It has sold this a'ock at par and at a minimum of cost. The common stock has earned seven per cent interest so that the financing of additions and betterments on this basis is at a comparatively moderate cost. The company is to be commended for its efforts to place its securities among its own patrons and in the territory which it serves. It follows from the foregoing that the issue as asked for should be approved.

            <seg id="p279">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 279 The Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company traverses a stock feeding territory In northeastern Nebraska and handles a considerable amount of livestock, destination Union Stock Yards Company, South Omaha, but the carrier does not make direct connections with the Union Stock Yards Company's switching rail - road. It has always handled the traffic in conjunction with the Mis - souri Pacific which accepts the shipments near the Illinois Central bridge in the northern part of Omaha proper and delivers them at its connections with the Union Stock Yards switching railroad. For many years the Missouri Pacific made a charge of $3.00 per car for what it did on switching livestock and billed its connection, the M. &amp; ()., for that amount less certain absorptions. The Union Stock Yards Company for a period of almost 20 years charged 75 cents a car for its switching movement. It is clear, both from the tariffs presented in evidence and from the testimony, that the Missouri Pacific published on these shipments the joint charges of the Union Stock Yards Company and the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company in total amount $3.75 per car. By order of the Nebraska Commission on Ap - plication No. 144, dated October 29, 1910, the switching charges of the Union Stock Yards Company were increased to $1.00 per car. The Missouri Pacific tariffs were amended to conform, showing total charges of $4.00 per car. In June, 1918, on order on Application No. 3437, the Commission, after extensive hearing, authorized the Union Stock Yards Company to increase its switching rate to $1.50 per car and at the same time cited the various carriers having connections with the Union Stock Yards Company to appear and show cause why they should not be required to amend their absorption rules to cover the increase of 50 cents per car which the Union Stock Yards Company was authorized to impose. This was during the period of federal control of railroads. The carriers appeared and denied the jurisdiction of the Commission to impose upon them any changes in rates. As a result of the complicated litigation and orders built up around the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission in Ex Parte 74, the Union Stock Yards Company was authorized to increase its switch - ing charges to $2.00 per car. Neither of the changes in the Union Stock Yards Company's rates resulting in the increase in switching charges from $1.00 to $2.00 per car was reflected by changes in the intrastate switching tariffs of the Missouri Pacific here under discussion. These tariffs only refleat the later changes in the charges of the Missouri Pacific itself. General Order No. 28 of the director general did not increase the switching charges. As a result of Kx l'arte 74, and attendant litigation, the $3.00 rate per car was increased to $4.00 per car. That amount, plus the $1.00 of the Union Stock Yards Company, approved in order on Application No. 144, was reflected in the combined rate of $5.00 per </seg>

Hence, the shipper pays the switching movement from North Omaha to the Union Stock Yards Company on hay $8.55 per car. The movement is not extensive. The hay interests allege that this is because of the high level of the charge. It is also alleged that on such movements as have occurred there has been an overcharge because of the complicated condition of the tariff. The provisions of the interstate tariff, M. P. Nebraska 4-B, show witching charges of Missouri Pacific $3.60, of the Union Stock Yards ompany $1.80, separately, a total of $5.40. This differs from the intra - tate gross charges by 90 cents. The difference appears to have come o pass in this manner; The amendments to the Missouri Pacific switch - ng tariff as a result of the order of the Commission in 1910 included n the stated rate $1.00 of the Union Stock Yards Company. That 1.00 per car continued in the Yards Company's rate down to the ten per cent reduction early in 1922 and was by that reduction reduced to </seg>
            <seg id="p281">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 281 90 cents. This difference is offset by an absorption by the Missouri Pacific of 91 Vj cents on intrastate traffic. The proposals of the Missouri Pacific in this application, as set forth on page 2 of the opinion, modified to represent the ten per cent subsequent reduction, represent accurately the adjustment of the Mis - souri Pacific's portions of the switching charges from M. &amp; O. con - nections, increased thirty-five per cent and decreased ten per cent, with all reference to the Union Slock Yards Company's charges elimin - ated. The record does not show Just when the Missouri Pacific merged the charges of that road and the Union Stock Yards company in one publication. Between 1910 and 1917 the tariffs indicate that they were published in separate columns in the Missouri Pacific tariffs, the totals equalling the totals later appearing in column A, item 120, M. P. tariff 1973-B, omitting, however, certain additional increases made to the Union Stock Yards company by the Commission, as here - tofore mentioned. The application of the Missouri Pacific makes reference only to changes in item 120. Item 140 of M. P. tariff 1973-B and the same item in M. P. tariff Nebraska No. 7 show absorptions. On page 39 of the transcript of evidence, Mr. Thompson, representing the Missouri Pacific, indicated it was the purpose of the Missouri Pacific by the application to cancel item 140 and this is borne out by other portions of the testimony. In earlier tariffs of the Missouri Pacific, with specific reference to supplement No. 9 of the M. P. tariff 1973, dated October 5, 1911, the Missouri Pacific absorbed out of the $3.00 received for switching livestock for the Omaha road, the seventy-five cents switching charges of the U. S. yards and the $1.00 switching charges on interstate traffic. The net effect of what is proposed, according to the testimony of the assistant general freight agent of the Missouri Pacific, is on all this traffic to eliminate absorptions by the Missouri Pacific of Union Stock Yards company's charges and at the same time to eliminate all refer - ence to Union Stock Yards charges from its item 120, M. P. tariff Nebraska No. 7. This would have no effect on the charges now being passed on. whether legally or otherwise, to the shippers on movements of livestock from Omaha road origins and would increase the rate on general freight, including hay, niuety cents a carload. It would ap - parently increase the net charges on packing house products thirty - five cents per carload. Assuming that the company's witness intended to amend the application orally to provide for the cancellation of its absorptions on traffic where no road haul is enjoyed by it, we arrive at the ques - tion whether on a purely switching movement of this nature the road </seg>
            <seg id="p282">282 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT tng the switching should absorb part of the charges of another tching company jointly operating with it. On livestock, as shown. Missouri Pacific would receive by its application $3.60 for switch - from Sprague street to South Omaha, a distance of approximately e miles. On outbound packing house products it would receive 25. This applicant bills the road haul railroad for the entire irge made by it for switching, which railroad absorbs $2.70 of the ount and passes the remainder on to the shipper. Respondent, Omaha Live Stock Exchange, filed a motion that the Omaha road be made a party to the proceeding and be called upon to respond in testimony before the conclusion of this case because of the question of absorptions. That road's tariffs now provide for certain absorptions on intrastate business, which provisions cannot be changed without the authority of law. Whether it should absorb more than it now absorbs appears to us to be a question for another proceeding. We do not think that the proposed tariff change by the Missouri Pacific results in its receiving from the Omaha road more than proper compensation for the work done and we do not pass in this proceed - ing on whether the road haul carrier should make more extensive absorptions than it does. The application will be approved. Some testimony was presented by representatives of the Omaha ay Exchange that the tariff has been wrongly interpreted in aaMW - ng charges on movements of hay to South Omaha and in testimony be carrier's representative admitted that this was fact if the testimony ere correct. This matter should be investigated and correction made f any errors. The failure of the Missouri Pacific to reflect in its ariffs all the increases in switching charges of the Union Stock Yards ompany, which were properly approved in other tariffs, ought not to penalize it beyond what would be reflected by a proper consideration f both the tariffs of the Missouri Pacific and of the Union Stock ards Company.

Rule Circular 17-C and in - dividual issues of all Nebraska lines, to provide that mixed carloads of cement (except mortar color cement), lime, stucco, plaster, includ - ing adamant and zenith wall plaster, soap stone finish for plastering, silicon and roofing pitch, shall move between all stations in Nebraska upon the basis of the highest carload rating and minimum weight applicable on any article included in the carload. commodities covered by this application now generally move ween all points in this state upon the basis of the lime rates and a carload minimum weight of 24,000 pounds. Straight carloads of plaster are subject to a minimum weight of 30,000 pounds and straight carloads of cement were subject to a minimum weight of 30.000 pounds upon the date this application was filed with us: but since that time, under the authority contained in our order in Resolu - tion No. 70 establishing cement rates applicable between all points in Nebraska, which generally resulted in reductions in charges the minimum carload weight on cement was increased to 50,000 pounds, which is in harmony with the carload minimum governing interstate shipments to Nebraska destinations. </seg>
            <seg id="p285">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 285 Upon informal inquiry directed to chambers of commerce, some opposition to the carriers' proposal developed, but upon further con - sideration, this opposition was withdrawn by certain important jobbing cities which had found that very tew mixed rarloads of the commodi - ties here involved were being shipped from those cities. The matter was set down tor hearing at Lincoln, January 26, 1923, and was thoroughly discussed. Witnesses on behalf of the carriers urged that the rule here proposed is now applicable on interstate shipments moving to Ne - braska destinations, and that the existing lime rates, subject to a minimum weight of 24,000 pounds, when applied to mixed carloads of NMH lime and plaster, resulted in lower charges than the minimum carload charge applicable on a straight carload of plaster or a straight carload of cement moving between points in this state generally. The carriers urged that, since the cement rates and minimum weights now applicable between Nebraska stations and upon interstate commerce affecting Nebraska, have been approved by both the Nebraska Com - mission and the Interstate Commerce Commission, no rule should be permitted to exist in the carriers' tariffs which would result in the application of a lower charge per car on that commodity, by including a few barrels of lime, making a mixed carload of lime and cement, subject to a 24,000 pound minimum instead of the 50.000 pound minimum applied on straight carloads of cement. A representative of the Sunderland Brothers Company of Omaha and a representative of the Iota Cement Mills Traffic Association (representing the cement mills located in the so-called Gas Belt dis - trict of Kansas), appeared and expressed their approval of the pro - posed mixed carload rule. The representative of Sunderland Brothers Company stated that, some years prior to 1918, his company had reshipped many carloads of cement, lime and plaster from Omaha to stations in Nebraska, but that since the rates on cement were changed by the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1918, the through rate from cement producing points to Nebraska consuming destination is in all cases substantially lets than the rate to Omaba, plus the rate from Omaha to destination, and that therefore cement is now sold by his company upon the basis of through movement from the mill to con - sumer, with a resulting saving in freight charges. A similar situa - tion exists as to plaster, which also moves largely direct from the plaster milling point to consuming destinations in this state. It appears that, at the present time, not over one or two per cent of the total business of the Sunderland Brothers Company, involving carload shipments of cement, lime and plaster consumed in Nebraska, is shipped from Omaha on the basis of the mixed carload rule here under consideration. </seg>
            <seg id="p286">286 Both the carriers' representatives and shippers who approve the proposed mixed carload rule, drew attention to the fact that carload mixtures generally are on the same basis between substantially all parts of the United States, as shown by rule 10 of the Consolidated Classification, which is in effect throughout the entire United States, with minor local exceptions. In opposition to the carriers' proposal, testimony was submitted v the Nebraska Cement company, which operates a cement mill at uperior, Nebraska, and operates plaster mills at points in Colorado nd Montana, under the management and direction of the same corporate interests. It clearly appears of record in this proceeding tat the Nebraska Cement company wishes to ship cement produced its Superior plant, in mixed carloads with plaster produced by its wn mills elsewhere, with a view to securing the proper competitive dvantages of its productive organization and affording mom in - dental advantages to its customers. The Nebraska Cement com- pany alleges that the rates' now applicable on plaster between Superior and consuming points in this state are higher than the lime rataa, ami that their company is handicapped in its desire to ship mixed car - loads of plaster and cement, by the absence of favorable plast. r r;it&lt;-s applicable from Superior to the same destinations to which cement rates are now in effect from that point. The opposition of the Ne- braska Cement company is founded entirely upon the allef reasonableness of rates on plaster from Superior, and not u merits of the rule itself. In fact, the representative of the N Cement company stated that he would have no objection to tli Kload rule here involved, if reasonable rates governing the move it of plaster from Superior were established. Tin record in thi E;e shows that there have been ext.-nsive negotiation-.- bctwaea th. - braska Cement company and interested lines, looking toward the ablishment of a new scale of plaster rates from Superior to con - ning points in this state. t Certain definite proposals for a new basis of plaster rates' were ussed, as an incident of this hearing, although no agreement be - in the interested parties resulted. II the Nebraska Cement company and interested lines are unable to agree as to a proper basis of rates on plaster from Superior to points in this state, the cement company can file its formal complaint with us, and the issues thus tendered will be disposed of in due course. tit seems clear, however, that any question now existing as to the &gt;nableness of rates on plaster from Superior, should not prevent establishment of what would otherwise be a reasonable rule </seg>

Curtiss, Secretary APPLICATION NO. 4785 In the Matter of the Application of the Holbrook Central Telephone Association for Authority to Increase Rates. SI IM-LKMKNTAL ORDER BROWNE. Commissioner Effective June 1. 1922, to extend for a trial period of one year, this Commission authorized applicant to publish the following schedule of rates: </seg>
            <seg id="p288">288 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Net monthly The company sets forth at that time that it had suffered very serious reverses due to a sleet storm and had been compelled to borrow at a bank in amount of $1670 because it had accrued no reserve which was available and that it was necessary to earn the cost of the replacements from future revenues. This was the basis of the rate increase. The company's annual report for 1922, which included MVM months, under the schedule shows that the cost of replacements was 11700 in excess of the earnings currently available for upkeep of the property. Without making any allowance for this excess expenditure. which in part at least must be amortized in the future, the company's net earnings after paying taxes and interest on borrowed money was $108.60. This net would have been somewhat larger had the u run for the entire year. There is outstanding only $1180 worth of stock in addition to the notes payable. The liabilities statement shows a very decided surplus earned through the life of the company, which has practically followed the practice of not paying dividents. This surplus is probably partly owing to the depreciation reserve. Enough we have no accurate data on that subject without a physical uation. Lit is apparent, however, that the company must continue undt present schedule of rates for a considerable period in order t •come, in part at least, the disastrous effects Of the sleet storm. An emergency exists to the extent that the present rates termin - ate at the close of business May 31 and without an order extending the present schedule effective at once the rates would revert to the scale theretofore in existence, which is clearly inadequate under present conditions.

E. Becker, secretary and general manager. For respondents: J. L. Stewart, W. W. Cornell, Dr. F. H. Burton. OIMMOX AXD FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This: application was filed in June last. It asks that individual and two-party business rates be increased $1.00 per month and that the rates for business extension sets be increased fifty cents per month each. The services and present rates involved in this applica - tion are: Gross Net Individual business $ 2.75 $ 2.50 per month Two-party business 2.50 2.25 per month Extension sets 1.00 per month In a; plication and in testimony representatives of the company urged that during the past three or four years the company had been unable to earn a reasonable return on its property, in consequence of which it had been at a great disadvantage in financing improvements and that at the urgent request and demand of business interests and city officials the company had undertaken to spend approximately $4.(ioo to put certain of its overhead distribution system in under - ground conduits, the work being done at the same time as the exten - sive pa &gt; ing operations. </seg>
            <seg id="p290">290 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT LThe books of the company and reports to the Commission show t during the past three years the net earnings available for divi - dends and interest on borrowed money have been as follows: This is a return of slightly less than seven per cent on the fair value of the property found by the Commission in proceedings here - tofore under Application 3T46 and improvements installed since that date. The company is paying between seven and eight per cent on its borrowed money, although it is probable that vigorous refinancing would enable it to borrow money at seven per cent. In the past three ▼ears only one dividend of three per cent has been paid to stock - holders, but it is evident from the figures above that this has not been due to failure to earn but rather to the policy of the company to use the dividends for improvements and thereby reduce the amount of outstanding stock which we heretofore found was in excess of fair value. L Since the previous finding of the Commission as to the value .&gt;f property the gross fixed assets have increased approximately $9,100. The books of the company show that the improvement brought about by putting the distribution plant in the main bu~ section underground cost $4,217.85. There has been certain prop - erty displaced in this process. We asked the company for a careful estimate on the reduction in plant account by reason of the displaced property and received such estimate, which we found to contain certain errors. Much of the displaced property went into the material yard and storehouse for reuse and some of it was immediately reused. With due allowance for the errors in nnit prices it is our conclusion that the improvement cost approximately $4,000 net. The funds with which the $9,100 of improvements made in .he past three years were financed apparently came from the use of approximately $2,000 which was added to the depreciation reserve fund and from the use of net earnings available for dividends. We therefore conclude that the fair value of the property at the present time on which the company is entitled to earn a reasonable return is approximately $68,000. This figure is not exactly accurate, but close enough in measuring revenue necessities. During the year 1921, the company was setting up the expense item for the retirement of outstanding capital. We have eliminated that item of expense in reaching conclusions as to the net earnings for 1 9«V 1921 1922 (December estimated)... ::::::::::::::::: tSS $ : «« Total for three years </seg>
            <seg id="p291">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 291 the year 1921. This same practice was followed the first few months of 1922, but at our suggestion has been corrected on the books for 1922. In correspondence the company has asked that we express an opinion as to this retirement fund. There can be no objection to the purchase and retirement of capital stock out of reasonable net earn - ings in order to decrease the amount by which the capital stock exceeds the fair value of the equity in the property over and above that represented by senior indebtedness. It is not, however, an ••xpenae item. The company has been setting up 2 Vi per cent approximately into a fund for the cancellation of bad accounts. This company has a large amount of slow and worthless accounts that should be written off from its assets. However, this cannot be done at the expense of the present rate-payer except in such degree as current accounts under prudent management may be found to be bad. We have considered 1 Vi per cent of the gross receipts sufficient for this purpose. Respondents criticize the accumulation of slow and bad accounts and the management which permitted such accrual. The criticism is no doubt justified, but inasmuch as the Commission assumes that all bills are collected to the extent of 98% per cent such accrual of bad ounts is more subject to the criticism of the stockholder than of ■ subscriber since losses in such accounts in excess of 1 M&gt; per cent jnder our finding, be at the expense of net earnings. Respondents also suggested that the general manager was draw - inp more pay than the size of the business warranted. We have made careful investigation of this contention, with full recognition of the fact that it is easy to criticize the management of some one's else business. I'art of the delay in reaching conclusions in this case has been due to the negligence of the company in supplying data asked for by the Commission. Our conclusion with regard to this matter is that there has been more duplication in payment of services to the chief officer of the company than can be fully justified, although in a less degree th:m respondents believed. There has also been a certain amount of carelessness on the part of the manager in paying help out of his own pocket and allowing the books to show that in recovering such payments it was for personal services. The manager of the company is on the pay-roll at $150 per month. He testified because of inability to secure proper accountant help it was necessary for him to do much overtime labor, for which he made charges. This is legiti - mate. It does not appear proper, however, to charge additionally for maintenance work done by the manager, although proper to let such work appear as a maintenance charge. Rather the salary should be allocated so as to reflect a proper proportion charged into maintenance where maintenance work is done by the manager. </seg>
            <seg id="p292">292 ' We recognize that the Commission should be cautious in attempt - ing to pass on levels of wages and officers' salaries. No order will be entered in this respect in this case. It is our conclusion, however. that the manager should be content with a maximum payment for services from all departments of $200 per month. We will require in the order that quarterly throughout the next year the company report to the Commission the total amounts paid for wages and compensa - tion, directly and indirectly, to each employe and officer. The rates which this company is now charging were fixed by the Commission in 1919 when there were 789 subscribers. The number of subscribers has increased only seven since that date. A readjust - ment of values was made after the fixing of the rates which added $S, 000 to the fair value of the property. There has also been added about $7,000 which can be claimed to be a net addition to fair value. The company has made some ecenomies resulting in increased net earnings. Certain additional economies will result from what we have Indicated above. However, it would appear necessary that such additional revenue &gt;e secured as will represent a fair return on the net additions to plant rom the underground construction and maintenance of such addi - onal property. This would appear to require between $400 and 500 additional revenue, with due allowance being made for other matters which will bring about small economies. The company asks additional revenues of approximately $1,300 per annum. The full mount is unnecessary.

CurtisB, Secretary (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4»4O In the Matter of the Application of the Cozad Mutual Telephone Com - pany for Authority to Increase Rates. Appearances: For applicant: Cook &amp; Cook, attorneys. For protestants: N. M. York, attorney. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner -. Hearing was held at Cozad, upon the application of this company for authority to publish and collect the following scale of rates: the following scale of rates: This applicant began business purely as a mutual, serving resi - dents of Cozad, and almost contemporaneously undertook the switch - ing service for a very large number of independent telephone asso - ciations in surrounding territory. The mutual nature of the company was soon abandoned because of necessities of the situation. The testimony is that opportunity was always open to any subscriber to become a stockholder but many were of too transient a residence or for other reasons did not desire to become stockholders. In the early years the company did not pay dividends directly but furnished service to stockholders at a lower rate than to renters. After 1909 this practice was abandoned and dividends were paid. 1-party business metallic $3.10 per month 2-party business metallic 2.75 per month 1-party residence metallic 1.75 per month 2-party residence metallic 1.25 per month 1-party residence grounded 1.25 per month Extension sets or bells 50 per month Switching charge 40 per month </seg>
            <seg id="p294">294 The dividend record of the company haa been modest. The total of cash dividends paid between 1909 and date are 176 per share. The original capital stock consisted of one hundred shares of $25 each. Various assessments were made from time to time. In 1909, Just before the effective date of the statute regulating issues of secur - ities by public utilities, the articles of incorporation were amended and the eighty-nine shares then outstanding were called in and re - issued at $100 par value each. From the subsequent history of the company it is fairly clear that this reorganization resulted in stock outstanding in excess oC the value of the property. The company operated at $1.75 per month net for business service. $1.25 per month net for residence service, and for switching service charges ranging from 25c to 40c per month. The plant was entirely grounded. In 1921, a large improvement program was undertaken by the town, a considerable portion of which was extensive paving of str&gt;ei&gt; The city council ordered the telephone company to remove its poles and wires from the main streets. A group of businessmen then under - took to improve the quality of telephone service and succeeded in carrying at the annual meeting a resolution to assess all stockholders $50 per share to secure funds with which to carry out the program. This consisted in making the town plant practically entirely metallic and the putting of a very considerable portion in the central part of the town in underground condutt. The amount of cable installed was relatively large. That program is now complete. Besides the assessment of $4,450 the company borrowed on notes payable and had outstanding December 31, 1922, $7,843 of those liabilities. The application was for the purpose of readjusting rates to repre - sent the higher class of service hereafter to be furnished on the metallic system and to enable the company to earn reasonable returns on the investment. The record of stock issues was faulty to the degree that an issue of $55 per share was made in 1909 with no other consideration than the additions and extensions made during the seven years prior thereto from "earnings. It was impossible to ascertain the value of the property at the time of the reissue of the stock. The Commission's engineer, therefore, checked the entire property prior to the hearing on January 11, 1923, and found the reasonable cost of the property in its depre - ciated condition to be $18,600. The prices applied in arriving at this conclusion were the approximate prices paid by the company. One - half of the existing property was built at pre-war prices and the other </seg>
            <seg id="p295">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 295 half at present day prices, or higher. The figure arrived at by the Commission's engineer included nothing for working capital. Although citizens were represented by counsel at the hearing no protest was filed against such an increase in rates as would represent a net return sufficient to pay dividends on outstanding stock and in - terest on borrowed funds. Various businessmen of the town supported the application. The switched lines were not affected and entered no appearance. The Commission's accountant testified that the rates requested in the application would, on the basis of expenditures for the last year or two, enable the company to earn twenty per cent on the capital stock plus the assessments. The company agreed of record that it wanted rates no higher than would provide for efficient oper - ation, ample maintenance funds, and a fair return on a fair value. We find for purposes of this case that the fair value of the property, plus an allowance for working capital, is $19,000. Under present rates the company can reasonably expect to earn $8,400 gross in 1923. We find that a reasonable estimate of expenditures for 1923 will be $7,450, exclusive of the return on the investment. We find further that eight per cent is a fair return at this time in the portion of the state where applicant's property is located. It appears, therefore, that applicant does not need the increases in revenues which would bring a maximum increase of $2,337 but that increases should be granted which will pro - duce a minimum of $600 additional and a maximum of $1,000. The rates approved below will produce such additional revenue. The rates which we will here approve are lower than the average of companies with like plants. Probably no other company in the state is more happily situated, having all of its property within the confines of the municipality and furnishing switching service for a very large number of independently owned farm associations, having in the aggregate 52 5 stations. Applicant has 65 business stations and 237 resident stations. Part of the favorable results from the location of the property should be reflected in the level of the rates. At the same time the attitude of the regulatory authorities to the company should be more liberal than as if the rates approved were relatively - higher than the average.

Since the passage of article 17, chapter 12, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, enacted in 1909, the company has from time to time sold shares of stock to prospective subscribers without complying with the terms of that law. Ignorance of the law does not excuse its violation, but in the present instance it appears that the pur - poses of the law have not been jeopardized. Applicant desires a validation of this stock which was technically illegally issued and asks authority to issue and hold in its treasury the remaining stock authorized by its articles, approximately 13200, in order that it may from time to time sell shares to new subscribers. Revenues are obtained annually by assessment, such assessment varying with the needs of the company. Improvements are made via the assessment route. Stockholders are permitted to transfer their stock and rights as subscribers go with the stock. Future issues of .stock will only be made as the number of subscribers increases. The Commission, through its engineering department, made an inventory of the property and attached thereto figures representing estimated reasonable costs at the time construction was made. It allowed the usual general expenditures and found the reasonable original construction cost to have been $21,722.73 and attached the average condition per cent of 88. To this inventory and cost valu - ation the company offered no objection. It approximates the figures carried in the book accounts, although differing somewhat in detail. We are not called upon to fix the fair value of these properties. The company's plant accounts do not entirely reflect the testi - mony.

It had a magneto equipment at Beemer which it has now converted to common battery. The net increase in the cost of the plant as a result of these improvements amounts to $1,632.

Applicant has submitted a detailed statement showing the gross cost of the new switchboard and other equipment, the property re - placed and the salvage value thereof. The company keeps its books according to the Commission's uniform accounting system and makes careful separation between new construction and replacement items so that the figures submitted by it should accurately reflect the true conditions as to the improvements. </seg>

White, secretary; Chas. Wilson, treas- urer; E. H. Wagner and R. L. Wildman, directors OPINION AND FINDING (On Rehearing) RANDALL, Commissioner The Beaver City Telephone company made application to the Nebraska State Railway Commission for authority to increase switch- Ing rates between the Farmers Union Telephone company, a farm line company consisting of thirty-seven subscribers, and its main line connecting with the Edison telephone exchange. For several years the Beaver City Telephone company had been charging the Farmers Union Telephone company a nominal sum of twenty-five cents per month for switching. The Edison plant had been doing this at a loss for a number of years and for the purpose of in - creasing the switching rate to a reasonable amount it made applica - tion to the Commission for an increase from twenty-five cents per month to fifty cents per month. Upon investigation the Nebraska State Railway Commission issued an order, dated December 30, 1922. to take effect January 1, 1923. (15 N. S. R. C. 406) authorizing the Beaver City Telephone company to collect fifty cents per month for switching charges from the Farmers Union Telephone company of Edison. After the order was issued and put into effect the Farmers Union Telephone company made application to the Commission for a hearing to give it an opportunity to introduce testimony that would show that the fifty cents switching charge was unreasonable and that the rate should not be changed from twenty-five cents per month to fifty cents per month. The Commission granted the prayer of the Farmers Union Telephone company of Edison and on June 27. 1923. Commissioner Randall held a hearing at the bank of Edison where testimony was introduced by both the Farmers Union Telephone com - pany and the Beaver City Telephone company of Edison. The appear - ances were as above set forth. </seg>
            <seg id="p301">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 301 A large amount of testimony was introduced and it was shown that the expense of switching at the Edison exchange was $6.60 per annum per phone, including 197 phones of the Beaver City company and 37 phones of the Farmers Union company. It was also shown that the Farmers Union company was receiving free toll to the town of Oxford and had access to the entire exchange at Oxford, as well an to the 197 phones of the Edison exchange, while the Edison Tele - phone company and the Oxford Telephone company only had access to 37 phones of the Farmers Union company, which gave the Farmers Union Telephone company a very decided advantage in percentage of service over the other lines. The names and numbers of all the Farmers Union Telephone company's subscribers were printed in the directory the same as though they were part of the Edison company, without any charge. It was shown by the testimony that with all the expense of upkeep, interest on phones, the supplying of two sets of batteries a year by the Farmers Union Telephone company, and switching charges to the Beaver City company at Edison at fifty cents per month, it made the expense of its phones approximately $1.06 per month, or $12.75 per year, while the subscribers of the Beaver City Telephone company were paying for the same kind of service $16.00 per year. This is after allowing the Farmers Union Telephone com - pany seven per cent on its investment, but without allowing the Beaver City Telephone company any interest on its investment or any per - centage for betterments and upkeep and no salaries to its officers. The representatives of the Farmers Union Telephone company spoke in the highest praise of the service they were receiving from the Beaver City Telephone company and they admitted, after the figures were shown and computation made, that the rate of fifty cents per month for switching charges by the Beaver City Telephone company was not unreasonable. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the order Issued by the Nebraska State Railway Commission on December 30, 1922, effective January 1, 1923, (15 N. S. R. C. 406) providing that the switching charges by the Beaver City Telephone company of Edison, Nebraska, to the Farmers Union Telephone company of Edison, Nebrsaka. be sustained, and that the complaint of the Farmers Union Telephone company of Edison as to unreasonable switching charges be and the same is hereby dismissed.

In most cases the amount of business done is not lart-e Frequent changes have to be made in the rates paid for this service because the railroad company invariably hires local draymen as com - tn carrier agents in this transportation function. We have acted on ny applications to change these rates. The carriers followed the practice of publishing transfer charges at rates which it is necessary that they pay local draymen tor doing the work. The present cfellfN for most freight transferred range from five to ten cents per hundred weight, with minimum charu fifteen to twenty-five cents per shipment. Most of these rates v,&lt; vanced during the high cost period and adjustments wil frequently made in the future.

OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This applicant operates an electric light plant at Scribner, Ne - braska, and furnishes generally light and power in that community. It manufacturers ice as a subsidiary enterprise. It is a Nebraska corporation with an authorized capital of $100,000, divided into shares of $10(1 par each. The company has outstanding stock in amount of $63,100 of com - mon stock and $6,900 additional common stock in the treasury for purposes of sale from time to time for improvements. The outstand - ing securities were authorized by us on Application No. 4519, under order dated July 23, 1921. It was also authorized by us to issue and sell $28,000 of notes to run from two to five years. The financial statement of the company under date of November 20 shows bills and notes payable in amount of $32,000 and a small amount of accounts payable. We are here asked to authorize the issuance of long, term notes in amount of $4,000 to refund certain short time obligations and to authorize a further Issue of notes in amount of $10,000 for the pur - pose of paying for the construction of a high tension transmission line from Dodge, Nebraska, to Clarkson, Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p304">304 Under Nebraska statutes the total indebtedness of a corporation must not exceed two-thirds of the capital stock issued and outstanding. This applicant has $32,000 outstanding. It is desired to increase the indebtedness in net amount $10,000. This is the maximum amount of indebtedness under the statutory provisions so long as the outstand - ing stock is not increased. The transmission line to be constructed will extend thirteen and one-half miles and will transmit electric cur - rent at a pressure of twelve-thousand volts. The construction will consist of thirty-six poles to the mile, the poles to be thirty to forty feet in length. No statement is filed as to the estimate of cost but from a very considerable knowledge upon the subject the Commission recognizes it will probably take all the proceeds of the proposed issue of notes over and above the amount for refunding purposes to pay for the construction. It will be necessary to refund an amount of $4,000 in order to comply with the law on limitation of indebtedness. No statement is made in the application as to the length of time these notes are to run, or as to the rate of interest which it is pro - posed they shall draw. We find that the proposed issue of notes is reasonably required for the purposes of the corporation. Order to that effect will be en - tered and it will be provided that the notes shall be sold at not less than par and to bear such rate of interest as will enable them to be sold at par, but not to exceed eight per cent per annum. If market conditions are unfavorable that fact may be brought out on supple - mental showing by the company.

            <seg id="p306">306 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Company, seeks authority to cancel the less than carload commodity rates on cured and fresh meats, applicable between Omaha and Lin - coln, as shown in item 2835-C of that line's tariff 25000-E. When this question first came before the Commission for con - sideration, verbal complaints had been filed by representatives of a Lincoln retail organization, and a hearing upon the protest was held February 6. 1923. The original protestant did not appear and participate in the hearing, nor did representatives of any packer except Morris &amp; Co. As a matter of fact, the record affirmatively shows that Omaha packers generally and the Omaha Chamber of Commerce have no objection to he cancellation of the less than carload commodity rates here in - volved, subject only to the proposition that the change should not be made effective until the mixed carload minimum weight then govern - ng shipments of packing house products and fresh meats should be educed to 21,000 pounds, which at that time had already been authorized in our application No. 5015. The tariffs governing these mixed carload minimum weights have been amended, effective March 8, so that the objection of Omaha packers generally and the Omaha Chamber of Commerce, has been met. Before considering the rates involved, it seems desirable uss certain general features of this case. The testimony in this case hows that all of the Omaha packers excepting Morris it. Co. now maintain cold storage warehouses at Lincoln, at which they receive carloads of fresh meats and supply the Lincoln trade. Morris &amp; Co. loes not maintain such a warehouse, and it therefore finds it ad - vantageous to load comparatively small quantities of parking house products and fresh meats into a refrigerator car. upon which it m*ts Ee freight movement from Omaha to Lincoln and exclusive use of car to the same extent as its competitors who load a carload of the le commodities into the same type of car. It is admitted by Morris &amp; Co. that, generally speaking, the prices of the corresponding grades of meat which it sells at Lincoln are no ower than the price of similar grades made by competing packers. As a matter of fact, Morris &amp; Co. assert that other packers at Omaha lave a freight advantage, based on the difference between the less han carload rate of 23 cents and the carload commodity rate of 15.5 cents. It is, therefore, clear that, so far as the freight element of cost is concerned, Morris &amp; Co. could not possibly undersell other packers on the Lincoln retail market and reduce the price of meat to the consumer. A rather careful investigation of tariffs in effect in Nebraska and surrounding territory and the evidence in this case, indicates that, </seg>
            <seg id="p307">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 307 &gt;.' I \ I I i. :enerally speaking, there are no less than carload commodity rates on lacking house products and fresh meats in effect in this territory. 3 rotestant, Morris &amp; Co., have not pointed to any transportation eason why a less than carload commodity rate on packing house inxliirts and fresh meats should be maintained between Omaha and .incoln. except the disability of that company arising by reason of its ot having warehouse facilities at Lincoln the same as competing lackers. The record does not show just why the applicant originally estab - shed the rates here involved. Under the current Consolidated Classi- ication, fresh meats are classified as first class and a rate of 50.5 I'nts per cwt. is in effect between Omaha and Lincoln. Other packing louse products are variously classified, with smoked or salted meats ind lard taking the fourth class rate, which is 30.5 cents per cwt. as ompared with the commodity rate of 23 cents per hundred pounds re involved. With the exception of a few jobbing points such as ncoln, packing house products in carloads, moving between points this state, are on the basis of the fifth class rate. The fifth class Uc between Omaha and Lincoln is 22.5 cents per hundred pounds, as imipared with the 23-cent rate here under review, which, it will be iiieinbered, covers fresh meat as well as packing house products. xcd carloads of fresh meat and packing house products, which are bject to a minimum weight of 21,000 pounds, move generally on e basis of the third class rate. The third class rate, applicable be - ■ ■•■II Lincoln and Omaha, is 35 cents per cwt. and, in comparing the m rate on less than carload shipments of packing house products rish meat, it should be remembered that less than carload ship- ■ generally are not loaded in excess of 10,000 pounds to the car, &gt;mpared with the minimum carload of 21,000 pounds applicable where the third class rate is assessed on such shipments. Having carefully considered the testimony in this case and all relevant facts pertaining to this question, we are of the opinion and find that the applicant has justified the proposed cancellation of less than carload commodity rates on packing house products and fresh tm-ats now carried in item. 2835-C of C. R. I. &amp; P. tariff 25000-E. An order permitting the cancellation of this rate on statutory notice will, therefore, be issued.

O. 26-E, which refers to the absorption ol cents per car made by the Nebraska City Stock Yards company for weighing livestock destined for use at Morton-Gregson company, packers of Nebraska City. In support of this contention applicant states that the payment for weighing livestock by railroads at this point became a part of the tariffs in 1911; that during the period of federal control by freight rate authority 15766 the United States railroad administration ordered the cancellation of this provision, as well as similar provisions of various stockyards throughout the country, that through oversight the Burlington failed to cancel at Nebraska City, that its competitor, the Missouri Pacific, did so cancel, and that at the present time it is paying to the Nebraska City Stock Yards company 22V4 cents per car on all cars of livestock weighed over the scales of the stockyards company. It is alleged by applicant that this provision does not </seg>
            <seg id="p309">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 309 properly belong in the tariff and that it should not be required to pay the amount in order to ascertain the net weight of livestock with destination at Nebraska City when it is in position to track scale, if necessary, all such livestock for the purpose of ascertaining the net weight in applying freight charges. It is deemed by applicant that it is its duty to secure in some manner the proper net weight of livestock for use in making out its freight bills and that such an expense cannot by it be passed on as a charge to the shipper. Respondents, Wilson &amp; company, packers, own the Morton-Greg - son company of Nebraska City, which in turn is the owner of the Nebraska City Stock Yards company. It alleges that it does the weighing of this livestock and furnishes the net weight to the railroad company for the purpose of making out expense bills; that the service is valuable to applicant; that the cost thus far paid of 22V4 cents per car is less than the out-of-pocket cost to which the railroad will be put if it weighed its own livestock, and that the hoof weights are more accurate for the purpose of the payment of freight than track weights could possibly be. It is further alleged, although no proof was pre - sented of the fact, that private agreements between the railroad com - panies and the stockyards companies at Omaha, Kansas City, St. Joseph, South St. Paul, and other points result in payments for this service and that if the carrier is permitted to cease paying at Nebraska City that point will be at an unfair disadvantage in the competition in purchase of livestock. It is admitted by applicant and respondents that the railroad (impany must have the net weights in making out the expense bills and that the packing company must have net weights in making out the account sales to the owner of the stock purchased by the packing company at the stockyards owned by it. It is admitted, also, that direct advantage results from the net weight on account sales corres - ponding to the net weight shown on the expense bill submitted by the railroad company to the shipper. It is also advantageous to the rail - road company to have the freight bill deducted, together with other expenses in making remittance to the shipper by the packing company. Bach party to this application appears to desire to get the weighing done free of charge to it, although it is not clear whether a weighing charge would be included among other expenses on the account sales submitted to the shipper. The case appears to us to resolve itself into a question of whether this Commission should, by insistence on a tariff provision, require the railroad company to pay private parties for weighing loads of live - stock in arriving at freight charges when the railroad company has facilities of its own on which such weights can be obtained. It is not a question of what is the most advisable thing to do. At the South Omaha stockyards the weighing of livestock appears to be paid for in </seg>
            <seg id="p310">310 the yardage charge. Whether a corresponding charge is made at Nebraska City does not appear of record.

As result of these negotiations the state constructed a railroad from 8th and H streets to the capitol grounds over which all carload building material is being moved. The Burlington, applicant herein, agreed to collect and pay the capitol commission $2.50 per car (or the delivery of the freight from 8th and H. streets to its final location on the capitol grounds. The Burlington so published its tariffs, with our ap - proval and that of the Interstate Commerce Commission, as to indicate that it undertook to make the collections of the charge of the H street railroad and make settlement with the state. It was verbally agreed by other carriers, who would secure roadhauls on portions of the materials to Lincoln, that the charge from the transfer track, to be paid to the Burlington, should be $5.00 per car , out of which the Burlington would make settlement with the state capitol commission on the basis of the contract. Subsequently all freight rates were reduced ten per cent. This had the effect of changing the $5.00 switching charge from the transfer track to $4.50 and changed also note 4 of item 1225 G. F. O. 26-F to read $2.25 in place of $2.50. The Nebraska Commission, in its order on Application No. 4940, authorized the capitol commission to continue to charge $2.50 for its services on account of the cost to of the services. This leaves the applicant herein in this peculiar position: (a) On carload freight received by it from connections it receives $4.50, which is absorbed by the connecting lines. The Burlington pays $2.50 from this amount to capitol commission and hag for its switching service a net amount of $2.00 where on other switch movements it gets $2.50 per car. (b) On movements from points of origin on the Burlington within the Lincoln switching districts, destination the capitol grounds, the Burlington makes an additional charge under its present tariffs of $2.25 per car pays out $2.50 per car, leaving it net twenty-five cents per car less than it receives on switching movements from same points of origin to other destinations in the neighborhood of the interchange track at 8th and H streets. Certainly applicant is entitled to collect in addition to its regular switching charges the amount it is under necessity of paying to the state for the special handling to the state capitol grounds. It is, we think, properly entitled to collect even more. It has been to the expense of constructing the interchange track at point of connection with the state's railroad and is under certain unnamed obligations in final settlement with the capitol commission regarding the expense of constructing the railroad owned by the state. If the first portion of the application is granted the Burlington will be securing $2.50 for the movement from the transfer track to the interchange track with </seg>

Applicant, in defense of this difference, explained that a very large amount of the material used in the con - struction of the capitol building is being handled by connecting lines and that in its opinion the additional twenty-five cents per car would no more than compensate ultimately on business volume basis among the various carriers for the final expense involved on capitol building materials alone. On such a statement we consider the application justified. At the time of the hearing we suggested that the matter of the creased charge from the transfer track should be taken up with the carriers interested inasmuch as it was apparently only a matter of ivisions rather than a question of rates. The Rock Island and the orth Western will not agree to the change voluntarily. It does not. towever, from a study of the tariffs of these two roads, appear to be ecessary that they be beard before acting upon the application. The mount of interstate business handled through the transfer track will ot be large. This matter has been under negotiations among the arriers for some time and we have received no indication on the part ! the adverse roads of a desire to be heard. The charge of twenty-five cents in the wording of note 4, item 1225, affects almost entirely brick from Yankee Hill and the Lincoln Brick Works. The contractor who supplies the brick has indicated in writing that he considers the application of the Burlington fair and offers no objections. these various reasons we consider the entire application a ifled and it will be approved. This matter has been pending for considerable time while negotiations have been carried on among the carriers. The move - ment of freight is constant and in considerable volume. We consider the emergency such as to warrant a departure from the regular period of publication of thirty days.

It has at this time approxi - mately 600 subscribers. The property is locally owned by more than 200 stockholders. At the last annual meeting when approximately seventy stockholder? were present, it was proposed that rates should be increased. The present and the proposed rates are as follows The early history of this company is set forth in the order on Application No. 4158, dated May 1, 1920 (13 N. S. R.

The financ- ing for this consolidation was approved by us on Application No. 4 77l' order dated July 14. 1922. (15 N. S. R. C. 386). The consolidation of the properties was concluded in the latter part of 1922. In the process of consolidation the company expended a considerable amount of money in improving properties. It installed a large amount cable, put in new switchboard, and generally bettered the plant At the time of this application the company was serving almut 600 subscribers. It hud properties which our engineer inventoried as having been of a fair cost of $52,066 and that a fair depreciated cost would be $36.56n. To this inventory and the prices attached the company offered no objections. Against this property there was and is outstanding $19,750 par rue of common stock and note indebtedness of $11,230. There an er debts but these are fully offset by receivables. The i-ompany therefore, has property, the fair depreciated cost of which u liabilities, giving a snug amount of surplus The revenues and disbursements of 1922 are not a la:r index the necessities for 1923, first, because 1922 involved desirurti gleet and an extensive building and rebuilding program, and second because the results on expenditures and revenues from the consulida tion were not realized. The accounts for the first six montl are available and in the evidence. That six months shows ■ profit and loss available for dividends of $852. The account u certain corrections. The company had been, during the period, setting up for maintenance and a reserve approximately $SM a month. Thi amount was entirely insufficient, being a hang-over from a period when there was much less property. On the other hand, the six months expenditures include about $1200 back wages paid to the manager and charged to the expenses of the six months period. It also included a considerable amount written off for bad accounts which should have been spread over a much longer period. A reasonable estimate of the probable revenues under present rates and expendi- tures during the 12 months succeeding the date of this finding is made by us as follows: REVENUES: Town exchange service $ 4870.00 Rural exchange service 5535.00 Net toll revenues 1825.00 Miscellaneous revenues 100.00 Total operating revenues $12,330.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p315">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 315 EXPENSES Maintenance and reserve for depreciation..! 4680.00 TRAFFIC : 5 operators at $40 per month $ 2400.00 Power, including lighting 110.00 Total Traffic % 2,510.00 COMMERCIAL: Secretary, manager and bookkeeper $ 1500.00 President and directors 200.00 On incidentals, including heat, water. office supplies, drayage, etc 400.00 Total Commercial % 2,100.00 Total operating expenses $ 9,290.00 Telephone operating income $ 3,040.00 DEnccnoxs: Taxes $ 316.00 Interest (TH and 8%) 880.00 For bad debts (1% of income) 125.00 Total deductions $ 1,320.00 Profit and loss $ 1,720.00 The above profit and loss results from what we consider fairly nil estimates. For example, we have allowed more in commercial xpenses than the company is now spending but not more than like &gt;mpanies generally are finding it essential to spend. It does not mean the company must spend this amount but it would not be un- reasonable if the expenditure were this amount. We have very greatly increased the maintenance allowance because of evident necessities. There is still left more than 9 per cent for dividends on the outstand- ing stock and more for interest and dividends than 7 per cent on reasonable value of the property. Yet the company desires rate increases and none of the sub- scribers ,-ippeared in objection. The business men have been for years paying for two telephones. It was alleged of record that they are perfectly willing to pay fifty cents more than they are now paying. Even with this increase their telephone bills would be less than they were accustomed to before the war. The rates asked for are relatively, for most of the classes of service, lower than are currently being charged by the large operat- ing companies of the state, and this fact was advanced by the officers </seg>
            <seg id="p316">316 as one reason justifying an increase. The independent telephone com - panies invariably serve at much lower rates than the large operating companies, particularly the Northwestern Bell in Nebraska. They apparently secure higher results from a dollar of expenditure. There is an element of justice In the contentions of this applicant when it points to the rates of its contemporaries. It would be unfortunate. Indeed, for the public, if the rates of this large company, due to its levels' of costs, were the measure of all telephone rates in the state. This applicant wants the rate increase, first, in order to pay dividends to its stockholders and, second, in order to pay off its in - debtedness due to improvements and replacements. If the rates asked for were granted, and the expenditures are on the level estimated by us, the company would earn more than 20 per cent per annum and could pay a good dividend and still rapidly extinguish Us debt. Its officers say that they do not desire them to increase the stock by a stock dividend and, no doubt, this is true. However, the property may not always belong to these stockholders and in law the company is entitled to a fair return on all of the property. It would, in such circumstances, be entitled to earn on a large surplus created mostly through this rate increase. We must deny the application. This community is getting the benefit of modest rates by reason of the very careful management by some of Its citizens of this public enterprise. It is entitled to a liberal dividend. We would not consider 10 per cent on the outstanding stock as too much under the circumstances. The experience of the next years may show an under estimate of necessary operating expenses and it may not earn the 10 per cent. If the estimate is correct it will be able to earn about that amount under present rates. We IM» mend that to care for its indebtedness the company ask authority to, and sell stock, or that it continue to carry the indebtedness on notes of longer time than the present notes. It may at its option use its net earnings, or even a portion of them, to extinguish the debt and is entitled to stock dividends from time to time to all the stockholders in equal amount that the debt is reduced. By reason of the reconstruction program, the consolidation and the early methods of keeping the books, the company's plant account does not fully represent the property and the liability statement carries in surplus certain amounts which should be in depreciation reserve. By the proper entries the company should amend its basic accounts to show the following assets and liabilities as of May 1, 1923, subject to whatever changes have resulted since that date. </seg>

Forbes, chief engineer OPINION AM) FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: L Applicant company was organized in 1904 with an authorised ital stock of $20,000, divided into two hundred shares, par value $100 each. During the succeeding three years the company disposed of all this stock to local people, selling the shares at very substantially less than par. The lowest price paid was $25.00 per share and Um highest price $50.00 per share. This stock has been all outstanding </seg>
            <seg id="p319">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 319 since January, 1907, and is counted full paid stock, although the books of the company have shown only the amount actually paid for th* stock. In April. 1923. applicant amended its articles to provide tor issuance and sale of additional shares as necessity presented itself. In this application it asks authority to sell at par $7 500 in additional shares of common stock, with the proceeds of which to retire bank ndehiedness in approximately that sum. This indebtedness was incurred in the construction of an exchange building, the cabling of the main leads, an almost complete recon - struction of city properties, and to a certain extent the reconstruction farm lines destroyed by a serious sleet storm. Much of the work, therefore, takes the place of property which was in existence prior to this construction program and there is a proper charge against revenues in amount equal to the cost of the displaced property. Prior to the reconstruction the company had $1500 laid aside and invested in liquid securities and had a substantial cash reserve. This was all spent on the reconstruction and the borrowed money as well. Probably not all the displaced property was cancelled out against the reserves because the record is substantially clear that the company invested its reserves heavily in additional plant. It is the purpose of the company to issue and sell the additional si oik on a parity with the stock now outstanding, which was originally sold at such a large discount below par. It desires to secure par for its n.w sales. The question at once arose as to whether this would be a substantial equity to the new stockholder who might buy the stock which the company now desires to issue and sell. For that reason an inventory of the property was taken, both by the company and by the Commission's engineering staff, and a hearing was held. This hearing disclosed that the company since origin maintained rates of $2.00 per month for business phones, $1.00 per month for town residence service, $1.25 per month for rural residence service, and twenty-five cents per month for switching service. It has a full metallic plant. The history of the company, outlined at the hearing, presents a record of remarkable efficiency in financial management. The rates just quoted are at least as low as the average telephone com - pany of like conditions prior to the war-time advances. Many of these other companies were not able to successfully weather the financial demands and disposed of their properties at heavy discount because of their deteriorated condition. This company shows that it hag paid dividends on an average not much below ten per cent on the real price paid for the stock. It has at the same time accumulated a very con - siderable amount of property, as is shown by the Inventories of what </seg>
            <seg id="p320">320 la now owned. It has at this time a full metallic plant, In very fair condition, and Is giving service at rates probably lower than the average for like service throughout the state. This case does not pre - sent a rate question and the results of nineteen years of operation, on which we have commented, are incidental to the issues herein involved. Applicant contends that its property at the present time is ex - tensive enough to make its stock worth par and that additional Issues sold for cash at par will not be at a disadvantage. It asks also that because of the inaccurate nature of its property statement that the Commission find what property statement ought to be put upon the books to represent a reasonable cost of the properties at the time they were constructed. As before stated, much of the property is of recent construction at relatively high cost. Two inventories are before us, with testimony in support of each. From a full consideration of that testimony and of the inventories we find that a reasonable cost of the fixed property at the time constructed and a reasonable statement of such gross cost to the company is ma follows: The above figures include all reasonable overheads which the com - pany should not have exceeded in its construction program if such overheads had been paid from capital account. From all the evidence we find that the above property is depreciated in the sum of MISS.tt, which should on the books of the company stand as a liability in favor of the property. Accepting the working assets as they appear in the annual report of the company of December 31, 1922, and the liabilities that appear in that same report, and listing the outstanding stock at its face value, we have the following statement of liabi'.ities: Intangibles Land Central station building All other buildings Switchboard and accessories Office furniture City subscribers station equipment.

Appearance For the company. W. E. Bell, general manager; Win. L. Lemon, auditor. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: In our final order on Application No. 4575, (15 N. S. R. C. 294), affecring the valuation and rates of this applicant, we set forth a chedule of charges permissible after May 1, 1922, and to continue in fleet for a period of one year only, in order that the Commission might tudy the effects of the schedules which it had approved. These schedules were considerably below those asked for by the company and ii was alleged on the part of the company that they would not provide adequate revenues. nre the date of that order the property has changed hands. Us new owners have tiled application to continue the present scale of rates with the exception only that in place of gross charges five per •vn t in we— ■ of net charges it is proposed that the spread between grama and net charges shall be twenty-five cents per month on each class nf fown and city service and seventy-five cents per quarter where After taxes, interest, and miscellaneous charges have been deducted the net profit and loss was $l,3S8.70, available for dividends on out - standing stock of $55,675.00. The scale proposed by the Commission should have earned for the year, if the existing rates had been in effect a year in place of eight months, slightly more than $40,000. The Commission estimated the revenue necessities at $39,240, including ". l 2 per cent return on a fair value of $117,000. It estimated the operating expense necessities at $29,416. The company's experience was slightly in excess of that. Traffic expenses were lower than, the chargei are collected quarterly in advance on rural service. The annual report of this company for the year 1922, eight i;.outh.s of which were under the new schedule of rates, shows total telephone operating revenues of $35,621.87; operating expenses of 29,650.93 The net telephone operating income was, therefore, 9 5,870.94. ...» 5,870.94. </seg>
            <seg id="p324">SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 324 Emate and commercial expenses were somewhat higher. Taxes were her than the estimate. The annual report does not probably truly reflect the results of the rates approved because the company's books were lost or stolen and the records had to be reconstructed. The revenues from exchange service should have been several thousand dollars higher than the re - port shows. The estimate of expenditures was reasonably accurate. The first three months of 1923, which reflect accurately the receipts and expenditures, are approximately on the levels which the order previously entered in this matter indicated they should be. If the year 1923 continues on the basis of the first three months the company will earn 6 2-3 per cent return on the fair value of the property. tit follows that we must approve the continuation of the present le. No reason exists for refusal to grant the gross and net rates ed for by this applicant, which are the standard net and gross rates •roved by us in many scores of cases. ORDKR CIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway mmission that the Platte County Independent Telephone company be and it hereby is authorized to continue from and after May 1, 1923. the schedule of rates and charges authorized in order dated April 10, 1922, effective May 1, 1922, with the following change regarding pub - lication of net and gross rates: "The rates quoted above are net rates.

Attest: John E. Curtiss. Secretary. (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 5142 In the Matter of the Application of the Daykin Telephone Company of Daykin, Nebraska, for Authority to Increase its Exchange Rates. Appearance For applicant: H. F. Apking, manager; William Jacobs, president; Louis Jarchow, vice-president. For protestants: H. H. Tappon; H. W. Strouck; S. C. Hoensee; H. T. Whittaker; J. O. Greenavalt. BY THE COMMISSION This matter arises on the petition of the applicant for authority to increase its exchange rates. It is alleged that the revenues are not sufficient to pay operating expenses and a fair return to stockholders on their investment. A hearing was held in the village of Daykin on July 30, 1923. Testimony was taken and the matter was submitted to the Commission. The company was incorporated and began business in 1905. Common stock in the amount of $10,000 divided into two hundred shares with a par value of $50 each was issued and sold at par. The testimony shows that the stockholders also contributed much labor in the construction of the property. Since that time additions and better - ments have been made in the same manner. Stockholders and others desiring service have hauled poles, dug holes and otherwise assisted in the construction of extensions. At this time the exchange consists of plant necessary for the operation of twenty business, forty town residence and two hundred eleven farm telephones. The village por - tion of the exchange is metallic and the farm lines are grounded. Applicant has had no increase in rates during the period of high operating costs. The engineering department of the Commission made an in - ventory and appraisal of applicant's physical property. This was </seg>
            <seg id="p326">326 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT tased on a count and inspection in the field. The results were in - nded to show ita estimated original cost which was depreciated to nform with its physical condition as found by inspection and the age the various classes of plant in service. Actual costs were used when ley could be obtained from applicant's records; however, it was ecessary to estimate much of the labor as detailed records of the xpenditures for service had not been kept and much of the labor tad been donated. The estimated cost new was found to be $26,989.54 nd this was depreciated to $18. 238. 44. These figures include stores nd supplies in the sum of $1,238.64. The cost of a carload of new toles as well as other items have been included in this sum which 111 be used for additions and betterments in the near future. The um of $400 will be taken to represent the cost of stores and supplies hich the company might be expected to have on hand under normal perating conditions. When the proper adjustments have been made e estimated cost new is $25,889.10 and less depreciation $17,138.00. tThe accounting department of the Commission has made a state - it of the assets and liabilitise. and operating revenues and ex - ses of the company based on averages for four and one-half yearn :eding July 1, 1923, with the exceptions of the physical property Eich was taken from the engineer's report. When the sto &gt;plies have been adjusted as noted above, the statemen lows: In this statement we note the amount due from subscribers and agents in the sum of $1,079.93. The accountant's report shows that this has amounted to as much as $1,593.55 in the year 1919, while in •ucceeding years it has approximated $750.00. A small business should not be required to carry this burden.

The condition of the rural distribution was found to be 62% of its cost new, and the company finds it necessary to replace and repair many of the rural lines as soon as the funds are available. Applicant also plans additions and betterments to plant in the near future, which will cost approximately $3,000,00. In estimating the sum to be set aside as a maintenance and depreciation reserve fund, the Commission will include the proposed additions and betterments in the fixed property. The Commission has tound from extended investigations that at least 9% computed annually on the cost new of telephone property, less stores and supplies, is required for main - tenance and depreciation and in the following statement of revenues and expenses the Commission will use 9% of $28,489.00. * 4.541.36 I red) 1,762.20 18.64 $ 1.743.56 * 1,210.00 787.45 ....% 3.741.01 800.35 I 143.16 1.86 13.19 666.67 Total Deductions ■ U1.99 J roflt and Loss red 24.53 </seg>

It is assumed that the allowance for maintenance and depreciation will be sufficient to absorb this sum and if not the salary of the manager, who also acts as secretary with an additional compensation of $100 per year, which has been included in the expenses, should serve to balance this item.

            <seg id="p330">330 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT uincy Railroad Company makes application (or authority to modify lghtly the service of some of its intrastate trains. Last fall the Com - ission authorized the discontinuance during the winter months of cal trains Nos. 37 and 38, operating between Lincoln and Ravenna, s a substitute for the service performed by those local trains the corn - any put in additional stops on Nos. 41 and 42. trains operating over le same route but running between Lincoln and Billings. It was the an of the company at the time these trains were discontinued to re - ore them to service about June 1. Prospects for heavy tourist travel his summer, however, have prompted a change of plan. It is now pro - osed to rub two sections of Nos. 41 and 4 2. The second section of o. 41 will continue to make the local stops on flag now being made by lo. 41, and the first section of No. 42 will perform a like service in the everse direction. This service has proven quite satisfactory to the people between Lincoln and Kavenna and there appears to be no ob - ction to its being continued. The company also discontinued, with the consent of the Commis - on, last fall, trains Nos. 39 and 40, operating between Broken Bow nd Seneca. A substitute for thin service was likewise furnished by ag stops of trains Nos. 41 and 42, and Nos. 43 and 44. It is now &gt;roposed to continue the service as at present with flag stops by the trough trains. Heretofore this has been impossible because of the eavy work done by Nos. 41 and 42. With the installation of a second ection of these trains it will be possible for local flag stops to be made, hus taking care of the local territory affected. The application in this rsepect will, therefore, be approved. Numerous changes with reference to the elimination of stops by Nos. 1 and 10, and the speeding up of service between Lincoln and Omaha, are proposed. It is unnecessary to discuss them in detail in this report. They appear in full in the applications submitted by the company. On the whole the changes promise to give as good service as is now being rendered. At some points the service will be improved. At others, where stops are eliminated, other trains will furnish adequate service. OKltKK tIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that orders issued in Application 5027 and 4943, be and the same are hereby modilied so M in it the company to substitute flat; stops of trains Nos. 41 and 42 for the service previously performed by trains Nos. 37 and 3H, be - tween Lincoln and Ravenna, and trains Nos. 39 and 40. between Kenna and Seneca.

(SEAL) APPLICATION' NO. 51HO In the Matter of the Application of the Southern Nebraska Power Company for Authority to Issue Securities. Appearam For applicant. J. H. Agee, attorney. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner The applicant is a Nebraska corporation manufacturing and sell - ing elei trie current for heat, light, and power purposes, wholesale and ail. It owns and operates water power plants, transmission lines, am manufacturing plants, and distribution systems, and through present property serves the following villages and cities: Superior, Q«ide Rock. Cowles, Nora, Nelson, Abdal, Lawrence, Deweese, Fair - field, Clay Center, Glenvil, Hardy, Byron, Deshler, Chester, Hubbell, Hebron, Oak, Ruskin, Edgar, Davenport, Ong, Shickley, Carleton, limning. Belvidere, and at Mahaska, Kansas. At some of these points it owns the distribution systems within the municipalities. To others sells wholesale The applicant has on file its petition for authority under the pro - visions of Nebraska statutes to issue and sell additional securities as follows: $135, 000 of common stock, |450,000 of cumulative seven per cent preferred stock. With the proceeds it desires to liquidate its hort-time and current indebtedness for extensive construction In response to the request of the Commission the company has submitted a complete inventory and valuation of all its property with the exception of the property heretofore valued by the Commission. </seg>
            <seg id="p332">332 The applicant now owes to banks $127,000 on short-time notes, most of which are due and payable during September. It owes ap - proximately $175,000 to the Pioneer Engineering and Developing com - pany of Kansas, which concern is pressing for payment of a portion of the obligations. Some time will still elapse before the Commission can complete its check of the inventory submitted by the company. Hence, the applicant has submitted a supplemental application asking for authority to issue a portion of the securities prayed for in the original application in order that it may, pending the final outcome of the case, liquidate a portion of its indebtedness. The market for securities is a meager one and the applicant does not know at this time what class of securities will sell to best advan - tage. It has therefore requested authority to exercise one of three rons: (1) to issue long-time bonds bearing interest not in excess of per rent; ( 2 ) to issue seven per rent preferred stock on a parity with the stock authorized June 8, 1923, under Application No. 4460; (3) to issue and sell $150,000 of said preferred stock and $50,000 of common stock.

Financing of public utilities engaged in extensive and expensive construction presents an ever present problem. It is not always a simple matter to secure funds. We have long recognized that in a proceeding involving much engineering investigation it is often neces - sary to authorize preliminary sales of securities against existing prop - erty on a margin safely within the value of the property, leaving for more careful investigation conclusion on the remanider of capitaliza - tion. This presents one such case. The company has been rapidly expanding.

The present request is (or a preliminary order totalling only forty per cent of the amount prayed for when we shall have reached final conclusions. We will approve such preliminary financing. If the company elects to sell preferred stock, such stock shall conform in all respects to the issue authorized in our order on Application No. 4460, dated June 8, 1923,(16 N. S. R. C. 263-264). If the company elects to sell any common stock in the $200,000 total, such stock shall be sold at not less than par. If it is determined to sell bonds to meet a portion of the indebtedness, it shall, when it has worked out a scheme of selling bonds, submit to the Commission, prior to the issue, the details, includ - ing the rate of interest, the date of maturity, the provisions relative to retirement before due, and the nature of the mortgage security with particular relationship to the mortgage already supporting a small issue of bonds. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Southern Nebraska Power company be and it is hereby authorized to issue and sell securities of face value not exceed - ing $2Oii,oui&gt;. said issues to be over and above all securities heretofore authorized by this Commission. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that in disposing of securities in maximum amount stated above, the company may exercise one of three options, namely: (a) to issue and sell bonds bearing not in excess of six per cent interest and in total amount not exceeding $200,000; provided, that prior to said issue the details of the indenture shall be submitted to the Commission for its approval in accordance with the finding above; (b) to issue and sell seven per cent cumulative pre - ferred stock in gross amount $200,000, or less, same to be of the same general issue and with the same provisions as preferred stock author - ized in supplemental order on Application No. 4460, dated June 8, 1923 (16 N.

Taylor, Chairman Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 5187 In the Matter of Readjustment of Grain Rates from Eastern Nebraska Points of Origin. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This order will dispose of several pending grain rate matters which can be consolidated. The proceedings outlined above consist of the following: Application No. 4897, filed August It, l!t:!2, by the I fi. Railroad company, seeking to readjust grain rates between Papillion and Omaha so that the former would not be under so serious a com - petitive rate handicap. In attempting to dispose of this matter it was recognized that unless considered more widely the difficulty at the one point would be merely spread by approving the api Resolution No. 75, initiated by the Commission October 4. 1921 called upon the Burlington. Missouri Pacific, Rock Island and l"niou Pacific railroads to appear at a hearing tor the pur[ n* to readjust rates on some points of orifln immediately ad Omaha, with particular reference to Ralston and Papillion. Hearing on this case was held October 2:&gt;, l'J22. and was followed by confer- ences in November. The difficulti the application of the Union Pacific and no order was entered because to broaden the issues. ■ which arose in consideration of were at once apparent in this case the Commission found it essential Resolution No. 77, initiated by the Commission January 13, 1923, called upon all carriers of Nebraska to appear for hearing March 2, 1923, to consider in general the rate situation to the intrastate markets from eastern Nebraska points of origin and to discuss for the purpose of united effort the elimination of certain discrepancies in rates to interstate markets. The resolution was made more specific by Kendment and hearing was postponed to March 26, 1923. For reasons tearing later on hearing was held. </seg>
            <seg id="p335">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 335 Application No. 5187, by all Nebraska lines through F. Mont - morency. chairman, asked authority to publish a scale of revised grain rates from one hundred ninety-one points of origin in eastern Nebraska to the Omaha market. With the disposition of these matters will go the following 1-6228. \V J. Holtz v. Chicago. Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Co..

B. Bline, et al. against the Union Pacific Railroad company, involving rates on grain from Gilmore to Omaha. This order is issued pro forma in keeping with agreements be - tween the Nebraska Commission and the various Nebraska carriers at I scries of conferences held in March and April. As indicated, certain hearings were held but, the results embodied herein, of much wider extent than the cases heard, were developed at conferences rather than at hearing. The grain rate situation in eastern Nebraska, which gave rise to the investigations, applications, and complaints, set forth above, should he briefly explained. During the period of government control the director general, in his General Order No. 28. advanced the rates on coarse grains to the general wheat rate level and advanced that rate level twenty-five per cent, with a maximum increase of six cents per hundred pounds. Certain difficulties arose immediately in the relationship of rates to various markets, particularly the Missouri river markets compared with the Chicago market. After conferences the railroad administra - tion amended its General Order No. 28 by the issuance of Freight Rate Authority T9U8 applying to shipments from Nebraska to Missouri river markets a flat increase of three cents per hundred weight, regardless of the rate in effect June 24, 1918. This had the effect of increasing grain rates from certain eastern Nebraska points to the Missouri river markets, and consequently to all markets, much more than twenty-five per cent. At the same time it kept the rates from certain western Nebraska territory from being increased as much as they would have &lt;-&lt;&gt;mplaint </seg>
            <seg id="p336">336 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT been increased under the original G. O. No. 28 of the director general in so far as Omaha and Kansas City were concerned but the full in - crease was realized on movements to or through Chicago. For example: If the rate to Omaha on June 24, 1918, were Are cents per hundred weight on wheat from a certain point of origin to Omaha that rate finally became eleven cents and then dropped back to ten cents per hundred weight and is today one hundred per cent higher than the so-called pre-war rate. From a more distant station, where the rate was twenty-four cents per hundred weight on wheat, it finally became 36 cents and dropped back under the ten per cent reduction to thirty-three cents per hundred weight, or 37 4 per cent above the so-called pre-war rate. The net effect was to increase the rate to .Omaha more than twenty-five per cent on wheat which had been lew* than twelve cents per hundred weight, and vice versa to reduce the increases from all points where the rate had been twelve or more cents per hundred weight. When prices of grain reduced sharply and dealers in grain at country stations began to buy on close margins the adjustments in eastern Nebraska showed discrepancies ii comparative territory which handicapped many of the dealers and consequently market points. This gave rise to frequent complaints. The unusual and peculiar ad - justments in the eastern part of the state also placed grain rates from that portion of the state somewhat higher than comparative rates from the great portion of the grain producing territory, mileage considered. The Commission attempted from time to time to adjust rates in single localities to meet indefensible inequalities and had the support of the carriers themselves in this effort. It was found very difficult to make adjustments, for such adjustments merely changed tthe locus of the complaint. Resolution No. 75 of the Commission was found to be too narrow in its scope, and failed to meet the situation. This gave rise to the promulgation by the Commission of its Resolution No. 77, which called upon all the carriers to appear at a general hearing on the eastern Nebraska grain rate fabric. A conference was held in March at Kansas City between repre - sentatives of all Nebraska lines, save one, and a member of the Ne - braska Commission and arrangements were there made for another conference, which was held in Lincoln on April 13 of this year. Vari - ous rate exhibits were gone over and careful consideration was given to the fact that because of the peculiar readjustments outlined above rates on grain to the primary markets, which included the vast major - ity of all grain movement, were higher than rates for the incidental movement of grain between country points. </seg>
            <seg id="p337">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 337 The carriers met the Commission in a very frank way and united in expressing the opinion that the rate fabric in eastern Nebraska Was not readily defensible. It was finally agreed that the carriers would check out rate readjustments in eastern Nebraska, providing for maximum rates to the primary markets not higher than the distance rates applicable on movements between points not involving primary markets. The carriers thus met fully one point presented by the Com - mission in Resolution No. 77. This agreement also took care of all the complaints then pending from points nearby Omaha to that market. The carriers voluntarily offered to include in the readjustment similar adjustments to the markets beyond the Missouri river. With - out such readjustments difficulty might have arisen in the relation - ship of rates to other markets. With this voluntary action on the part of the carriers such problems were immediately eliminated. The matter of the interstate maladjustments, which were local in character, was handled by the carriers in conjunction with the rate department of the Commission and satisfactorily adjusted. The cordial agreement arrived at on all points raised in the Com - mission's resolution enabled us to postpone indefinitely hearing on the subject matter. The checking in of the rates has been delayed by the amount of work involved in carefully measuring the cross-country competition and the short-line competition. There has now been filed with the Commission the application of the carriers, based upon the agreement entered into in April. This application is accompanied by a full showing of the proposed rates and the stations affected. The reductions range from three to thirty per cent and are on the average between ten and twelve per cent and affect 191 producing points in the state. They affect towns on the North Western as far as Seward and David City on the lines south and Beemer and West Point on the lines north; on the Burlington, as far west as Prague, Schuyler, Milford, Ulysses, David City, and as far south as Nemaha City; on the Rock Island, as far out as Lincoln; on the Omaha road, to Herman; on the Missouri Pacific, to Lincoln on the west, and Brook on the south; and on the Union Pacific, as far west as Richland and certain incidental points beyond.

Marshall, treasurer, for applicant company Fl\l»l\«. AM) OR1&gt;KR BY THE COMMISSION: This is an application for authority to issue the common capital stock of this company in the amount of $6161.66 par value to be dis - tributed as a dividend to stockholders of record in proportion to their holdings. A hearing was held in the offices of the Commission and testimony taken September 15, 1923. f Petitioner also appeared before the Commission in December, 918. in support of an application for authority to issue stock in the amount of $6515 par value, under Application No. 316$. Testimony Cs taken and the order entered May 29, 1919, contains the following lenient: </seg>
            <seg id="p341">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 341 "Applicant owns and operates a telephone system located in the village of Arlington and vicinity. It is of the magneto-metal - lic type and serves approximately five hundred subscribers. The plant is in excellent condition and there is no complaint as to the character of the service. The stock is practically all owned locally and the stockholders pride themselves on the success of the enter - prise, from a service as well as a financial standpoint. "The plant was first established in 1901 and developed gradually for a period of about eight years to approximately its present sise. The principal motive in erecting the plant was to prevent telephone companies located in adjoining towns from establishing connections with farmers tributary in the way of trade to Arlington. A return upon the investment was secondary. As a result there was a considerable contribution of time and labor in the early building of the plant for which no compensation was given. It was estimated that more than one-half of the ma - terial used during the first three years was free and that quite a proportion of the poles were set without cost. The stockholders and directors gave freely of time in soliciting subscribers and no salaries were paid to officers or directors for a number of years. Directors were paid nothing until the year 1915 and the manager was paid only $60 per month as late as 1917. Directors now re - ceive $3 for attending meetings monthly, the manager $100 per month, and a bookkeeper $40 per month. There was a single service rate to begin with — $1.00 per month. This was raised later to $1.25 per month. In 1909 the rates were again increased and were classified as follows: which rates have contained in effect until the present time, with the exception of the two-party business rate which has been abandoned. These rates are slightly lower than the average rate contemporaneously charged in plants similarly situated." (12 N. S. R. C. 170.) An investigation of the books of the company was made in September, 1918, and the following is quoted from the accountant's report filed as an exhibit at that time. "Statement No. 1 shows the profit and loss account for the calendar year 1917, arirved at by taking the expenses from the check stubs for the period and the earnings of station rentals from the rental ledger. It was impossible in some cases, for me to make proper distribution of the expensse as no explanation of the transaction was made on either the check stubs or journal. Where it was possible, I referred to invoices to get the dis - tribution of the expenses. "Recently the office of the company was moved, which ac - counted for some of the records being lost. I attempted to make a financial statement for 1916 but found some of the check stub* missing. I found the company had no toll ledger and when a patron paid his toll bill, the original toll ticket — the only record kept by the company- — was given them as a receipt.

            <seg id="p342">342 reason the toll earnings in the revenue statement are partly estimated. "The toll business over Nebraska Telephone company lines is accurate as same was taken from monthly settlement blanks, but the business accruing over toll circuits owned by the Arlington Telephone company could not be arrived at accurately as the toll tickets had all been given as receipts and no account kept in the company's ledger of the toll and rental earnings. I estimated $100.00 to cover this part of toll earnings. "The salaries are all charged into one expense account. I estimated the maintenance expenses by pro rating linemens' salaries on the basis of purchases for material as shown in State - ment No. 1." I Applicant's asset and liability statement as shown by Its report December 31. 1918. is as follows; Bills payable in the sum of $6,415.00 appears in this statement and the following explanation is also taken from the accountant's re - port: "I have listed all bills payable outstanding against the Arling - ton Telephone Company which totals $4,915.11. These notes were issued as of September 1, 1914, to stockholders in lieu of a stock dividend. The following notation is shown on all notes so issued. 'When the Nebraska State Railway Commission allows the company to issue new stock.' " The Commission found that the company had borrowed $1500 in addition to the dividend notes in the sum of $4,915.00 which explains the bills payable in the sum of $6,415.00 as noted above. It now appears 'that the stock dividend notes were issued in lieu of a rash return on the investment. I An inventory and appraisal by the engineering department of the mmission as of July, 1918, was also included as an exhibit.

The company's reports to the Commission show that the paid up capital stock of the company by years from 1901 to 1909 is as follows: Y.-ar Paid up Capital Stock Since 1909 no new stock has been Issued. In the first years of the existence of the company and during the period of its most rapid growth the record shows that the stock issued and outstanding in - creased rapidly from $745.00 to $18,485.00 par value. In the same year!! the reports show large dividends paid and these correspond in a measure to the additions to the capital stock. The Commission found in its order of May 29, 1919. in this matter that dividends had been paid in the sum of $5000 in exceas of a rea - sonable return on the value of the property. A careful review of the record shows that the dividends recorded as paid prior to and includ - ing the year 1914 consisted of stock issued for services performed and materials furnished by the owners of the property and in addition thereto small sums were paid in cash irregularly from the earnings of the company. It is probable that some stock was sold for money but in general the policy of the company was to put the earnings back into the property as disclosed by the notes issued as a dividend in 1914, Notwithstanding the fact that the accounts of the company did not furnish an exact basis for the issuance of these dividends the total amount of stock issued is well within the cost of the property. The Commission provided that no dividends should be paid to the stock - holders until $5000 had been earned by the company and it further provided that when this had been done the maximum rate of return on outstanding stock should not exceed eight per cent per annum. The order also required that the company should set aside annually out of operating revenues nine per cent computed on $37,500.00 plus the cost of additions and betterments as a depreciation reserve fund. The order also authorized the applicant to issue and sell stock in the sum of $1500.00 par value for payment of notes payable in a like amount.

This disposes of the notes issued in lieu of a stock dividend. The company has a surplus reserve in the amount of 14971.88 and net earnings for the year 1922 in the sum of $2487.62, or a total surplus unappropriated of $7459.60. The correct depreciation reserve credit in 1919 was $13,659.54. This hag been increased to $16,166.95. The economy In operating expenses for the year 1922 of approxi - mately $1000 as compared with the year 1921, results in part from the fact that the manager's salary has been charged to maintenance when he was engaged in making repairs or replacements. Certain other expenses described as the cost of power, which may have been properly chargeable to additions and betterments or the depreciation reserve have been greatly reduced. Applicant has an authorized capital stock in the amount of $25,000 par value. Stock in the sum of $18,485.00 has been issued.

            <seg id="p347">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 347 APPLICATION NO. S205 In the Matter of the Application of the Minnesota Electric Distributing Company, of Hartford, South Dakota, for Authority to Construct, Operate and Maintain a Transmsision Line in the Vicinity of Waterbury, Ponca and Martinsburg, In Dizon County, Nebraska. Appearances For applicant: Minnesota Electric Distributing company, F. C. Snuff, assistant vice-president. For protestants: South Creek Telephone company, James Mc- Quillen; Farmers Line 204, Henry Harney. BY THE COMMISSION: Applicant herein is a corporation engaged in the generation, transmission and sale of electric energy to the public. It has applied to this Commission for authority to construct, operate and maintain a transmission line from a point three miles south of the village of Waterbury to the village of Ponca. to be operated as a 60 cycle, three phase, alternating current line, having a potential of approximately 22,000 volts between wires, and a transmission line from Ponca to Martinsburg, of the same general description, except the pressure be - tween wires will be 4,000 volts. The 22,000 volt line will connect with a transmission line, owned and operated by the applicant, and supply these villages with electric energy for light and power purposes. Applicant filed a map which shows the location of the transmis - sion lines, and specifications which describe the manner of their con - struction as required by law. The parties at interest are the Northwestern Bell Telephone com - pany, the South Creek Telephone company, the Martinsburg Telephone company, and Farmers Telephone Lines described as follows: Nob. 203, 204, 210 and 211. Applicant secured written agreement with the Northwestern Bell Telephone company, the Martinsburg Telephone company, and Farm Lines Nos. 203 and 210, but was unable to secure the consent of the remaining parties at interest. A hearing was held in the offices of the Commission, September 18, 1923, at which testi - mony was taken, and the matter was submitted. The testimony shows that the transmission line between Water - bury and Ponca will parallel grounded circuit telephone lines for short distances, the longest parallel is approximately one mile and the others are approximately one-half mile and less. These are exchange service lines and in no case serve as trunks, or toll lines between villages. </seg>
            <seg id="p348">SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 348 The north and south highway, about one mile to the east of the pro - posed location of this line, is occupied with telephone circuits (or the entire distance between Ponca and Waterbury, and the section line to the west is not dedicated to the public use. Both sides of the highway from Ponca to Martinsburg is occupied with telephone lines for practically the entire distance. The North - western Bell Telephone company has a lead on one side and various small telephone companies occupy the other which includes the lines of the South Creek Telephone company, and the several grounded circuit mutual farm lines. The voltage on the transmission line la 4.000, and the probability of substantial interference, with the service on the grounded lines, is comparatively slight. There is no highway due east from Martinsburg, and the east and west highway one mile further south, is occupied with telephone lines. Moreover, the section line, one mile north of applicant's proposed location, to Martinsburg, is not open for the public use. Mr. McQuillon, of the South Creek Tele - phone company, could not suggest a route that would avoid the pro - posed parallel. Objection was made to the construction of the proposed line for the reason that applicant might later raise the operating voltage. The transmission line law provides that applicant must secure the permis - sion of this Commission before this can be done, and the parties at interest may appear and be heard. Protestants also objected for the reason that applicant demanded an excessive price for service con - nection. A law passed by our last legislature, provides, that the power companies must furnish service to customers along their lines, if de - manded, and when the parties at interest are unable to agree as to the cost of the service, they may ask the Commission to fix the charges. It was also urged as an objection that where both sides of tbe highway are occupied by telephone lines, and it is necessary to vacate one side for the transmission line to avoid overbuilding, that the tele - phone lines compelled to occupy the same side of the highway might not be able to harmonize their interests at times when reconstruction is necessary. The Commission can not avoid such situations if they come about, for the transmission line law specifically provides that one side of the highway shall be vacated under these conditions. Applicant agreed to move protestants' telephone lines to the op - posite side of the highway where both sides are occupied and replace such poles as might be broken in the operation, or proved to be unlit, at no cost to the owners. The Commission finds that the prayer of the petitioner should be granted subject to the terms and conditions of the written agreements </seg>
            <seg id="p349">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 349 with the parties at interest, and the transmission line rules adopted by this Commission and effective September 5, 1919, subject also to applicant's stipulation that it will move defendants' telephone lines to the opposite side of the highway, where it is necessary to avoid over - building, and provide such new poles as may be necessary at no coat to the owners of such lines. The Commission further finds that one year from the date of this order is a reasonable length of time in which to complete the proposed construction. The Commission will retain its jurisdiction over the service on the communication circuits involved in the parallel created by the pro - posed construction, and in the event that the service on these lines it interfered with by prolonged inductive interference resulting from the construction and operation of the proposed transmission line, the parties at interest may apply to the Commission for relief as provided by statute. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission pursuant to the provisions of the transmission line law of Nebraska, as amended to date, that the Minnesota Electric Dis - tributing company, of Hartford, South Dakota, be and the same is hereby permitted to construct, operate and maintain the transmission lines described in the application, to be operated as 60 cycle, three phase, alternating current lines, having a potential of approximately 22,000 and 4,000 volts between wires, along the route and in the manner set forth in the application, subject to the terms and con - ditions of the written agreements with the parties at interest, the transmission line rules adopted by this Commission and effective Sep - tember 5, 1919, and applicant's stipulation that it will move pro - testants' telephone lines to the opposite side of the highway where it is necessary to avoid overbuilding, and replace such poles as may be broken in the operation, or proved to be unfit for further service at no cost to the owners of such lines. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Commission will retain its jurisdiction over the service on the communication circuits involved in the parallel, created by the proposed construction, and in the event that the service on these lines is interfered with by prolonged inductive interference resulting from the construction and operation of the pro - posed transmission line, the parties at Interest may apply to the Com - mission for relief as provided by statute. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that unless the proposed construc - tion is completed within one year from the date of this order, the order shall be null and void. </seg>

It has applied to this Commission for authority to construct, operate and maintain a transmission line on the north side of the public highway from Auburn due east to the village of Brownville. to lie operated as a 60 cycle, three phase, alternating current line, having a potential of approximately 22,000 volts between wires. Applicant also desire ti&gt; erect two additional wires on the poles of this line, to be operated at 6600 volts, and supply the farm customers along the highway with electric service. As a part of the same system, the company also pro - poses to build two branches to the villages of Howe and Nemaha, to be operated as single phase. 6600 volt lines. The branch south of Howe connects with the main line one mile east of Auburn, and the branch south to Nemaha connects with the main line one mile west of Brownville. The system will supply the villages of Brownville Howe and Nemaha with electric energy for light and power purposes. The company owns and operates a generating plant at Auburn, and proposes to connect the high voltage line at Brownville with power lines, owned and operated by the applicant, in the state of Missouri.

            <seg id="p351">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 351 parties at interest were unable to agree on the joint use of the east and west highway, where the toll circuits would be involved, and a hearing was held in the offices of the Commission August 8. 1923. The record shows that the telephone line consists of two through metallic toll circuits for the entire distance between Auburn and Brownville, and one toll circuit for a distance of six miles east of Auburn, where it turns north to the village of Peru. The telephone company also ■has several grounded exchange wires on the same pole line with the toll circuits for various distances east of Auburn, and one grounded exchange wire for a mile or more west of Brownville. Applicant alleged that the highway due east of Auburn is especial - ly attractive for the location of a transmission line, by reason of the number of rural customers between Auburn and Brownville, and that these farmsteads can be served at a minimum cost by erecting service wires on the poles with the transmission line. The testimony shows that there is an east and west highway one mile south of the road, applicant proposes to use, which is open and traveled between the branch lines tq Howe and Nemaha. Grounded telephone exchange lines are also located on this highway, but they are few in number and serve only the rural residents along the road. These can be made metallic or otherwise adjusted to protect the ser - vice from the effect of induction. The testimony shows that by actual &lt; ount there are 27 farm homes on the north highway and 25 on the Kouth From this it appears that the prospect for rural customers ix practically the same on both highways. The company can build a low voltage line from the south road to the north highway and project the line east and west and serve the customers on the north highway at the additional expense of the poles and the necessary labor to install them, as the cost of the wires, in - sulators, cross-arms, brackets, etc., will be the same in both instances, except that one mile of additional pole line and wire would be neces - sary to reach the north road. If this is done, smaller and less ex - pensive poles could be used than those required for high voltage con - struction. Some economy can be effected by the use of transformers at Auburn and Brownville which would be credited to the cost of poles. The toll circuits on the north highway constitute the only outlet for long distance telephone service for Peru and Brownville, and the volume of traffic on these circuits indicates that they are well patron - ized. The effect of induction on the service on these lines, by reason of the parallel with the 22,000 volt transmission line, may not be serious under normal operating conditions, however, the effect, which is difficult to measure, is not limited to the length of the parallel, but </seg>
            <seg id="p352">352 ay extend to other long distance lines when physical connection curs. There is no doubt that at times of abnormal operation, result - g from tree grounds, short circuits, broken insulators, etc., that in - uction will not only prevent service on the lines of communication ithin the parallel, but may be transmitted the length of the circuit. t is also true that abnormal operating conditions on applicant's lines utside of the parallel may result in disturbance on the circuits where parallels occur. In this instance abnormal operating conditions in issouri may affect the toll service on the telephone circuits in this arallel by reason of the connection at Brownville. The Commission has repeatedly said that where an alternate high - ay exists, which is reasonably adapted for the use of the power com - pany, it will not authorise the construction of a high voltage transmis - on line where important telephone circuits will be involved in parallel r substantial distances. In the instant case, the Commission finds tat the operation and efficiency of the existing telephone lines in - olved in parallel by the proposed transmission line will be interfered Ith by the construction of the power line. The Commission does not say that the farm residents along highways, where important toll cir - uits have been erected, can not have electric service for they can be served with low voltage lines, and if this results in an additional ex - pense to the power company, it is fully justified in the protection of he lines of communication. The prayer of the applicant, for authority o construct a 22,000 volt line between Auburn and Brownville along ■e highway described in the application, will be denied. ORDKK IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission pursuant to the provisions of the transmission line law of Nebraska, as amended ot date, that the Western Public Service com - pany, of Colorado Springs, Colorado, be and the same is hereby denied the necessary authority to construct, operate and maintain the 22,000 volt electric transmission line between Auburn and Brownville, Ne - braska, along the route described in the application.

Appearances For the applicant: S. S. Sidner, attorney; Jacob Ries, president; Arnold Witt, secretary; T. J. Weywood, treasurer. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This application is for the purpose of securing authority to issue and sell bonds in the maximum amount of $90,000.00, for the purpose of securing funds for the construction of an electric distribution sys - tem in accordance with the terms of article 7, chapter 67, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922 as amended by chapter 169 session laws of 1923. It is one of three applications to this Commission neces - sary under the laws of the state before the district, applicant herein, may proceed to purchase, distribute and sell electric current to con - sumers within the boundaries of the district. The district in question is described in exhibit 1 of the transcript of testimony as follows: Commencing at a point forty rods west of the northeast corner of section thirty-six, township twenty, range six in Dodge County, Nebraska, thence westerly two hundred rods, thence southerly one hundred sixty rods, thence westerly one and three - fourths miles to the center of section thirty-four, thence northerly one mile to the center of section twenty-seven, thence westerly two miles to the center of section twenty-nine, thence southerly one mile to the center of section thirty-two, thence westerly one mile to the center of section thirty-one, thence southerly two miles to the center of sectiont seven, township nineteen, range six. thence westerly four miles to the center of section nine, town - ship nineteen, range five, thence southerly five miles to the center of section four in township eighteen, range five, thence easterly six miles to the center of section four in township eighteen, range six, thence north one mile to the center of section thirty-three in township nineteen, range six, thence easterly three and one - half miles to the southeast corner of the northeast quarter of section thirty-six, thence southerly two miles to the southwest corner of the northwest quarter of section seven, township eighteen, range seven, thence easterly one mile to the southeast corner of the northeast quarter of said section seven, thence southerly two and one-fourth miles to the southwest corner of the north half of the southwest quarter of section twenty, thence east one mile to the east line of said section twenty, thence northerly five and one-fourth miles to the northeast corner of the southeast quarter of section twenty-nine, township nineteen, range seven thence westerly two and one-half miles to the center of section </seg>

In this proceeding the Commission is interested only in the pro - lsions of section 7153 Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. as mended by chapter 169, session laws of 1923, which requires that te board of directors of the district shall have the power to issue K&gt;nds in accordance with provisions cf section 6 7 6-6 7 8 Compiled atutes of Nebraska for 1922. It is, therefore, necessary in this pro - eeding only that the Commission shall find from the testimony that le issues and sale of securities is reasonably required for the purpose the corporation. The amended statute limits the securities issued a greater degree than do sections 676-678. It requires also that le legality of proceedings leading up to the issue of bonds against le property of the district shall be passed upon by the state auditor. The district has not yet employed an engineer to make detailed pecifications of construction and it is hence impossible for the ('om - ission accurately to judge the necessary expenditure of funds. The eason this data was not furnished was stated by counsel as an economy racticed in preliminary so that no avoidable expenses be incurred rior to the registration of the bonds. Mr. Harris, construction ngineer for the Scribner Electric and Artificial Ice company, has only ade rough estimates in order that the proposed bond issue might be ubmitted to the people of the district. He estimates trunk lines through the renter of the district of tree phase construction to carry current at a pressure of 66ou volts, nd trunk lines of single phase construction for laterals. He estimates timate need for one hundred transformers to step the pressure down o 110 volts. His estimate includes northern white cedar poles wenty-flve and thirty feet long, spaced thirty-six to the mile, and No. hard drawn copper wire. With this rough description of the specul - ations, he estimates the construction cost to be $800 per mile ex - usive of transformers and meters. These bonds have been voted by the people of the district. The w requires that the aggregate issue shall not exceed six per cent of e last assessed valuation of the district. The county clerk certifies lat the assessed valuation of the real estate of the district in 1923 as $4,768,455, that the bonds shall not bear a greater interest rate lan six per cent nor run for a longer period than twenty-five years. t is proposed that bonds shall be dated September 1, 1923, and $5,000 hall be due and payable September 1, 1925, and $5,000 annually, lereafter. on September 1 of each year until the entire amount shall </seg>
            <seg id="p355">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 355 be due and that the bonds shall bear interest at the rate of 5 &gt;4 % per annum. The statutes require that the board of directors shall make provisions for the levy of such taxes on the property of the district as shall provide for the Interest on the bonds and the sinking fund for the ultimate retirement within the period provided by law. Section 7153 also forbids the Issue of bonds in greater amount than the estimated cost of the distribution system. We find that the necessary authority should be granted; that the form of the bond shall provide for the gradual retirement of the prin - cipal amount between 1925 and 1948 inclusive; that the interest rate shall be such as will command in the judgment of the directors the best market but not to exceed six per cent per annum; that the bonds shall be held in the treasury of the district until complete and detailed specifications and estimates of cost have been prepared and submitted to the Commission for approval. The Commission also further finds that the district directors shall report to the Commission sales of bonds and expednditures of funds derived therefrom whenever $10,000 or multiple thereof shall have been sold and the proceeds expended. The Commission further finds that the proceeds of the sale of bonds shall be used for the payment of the construction of the distribution system, the legitimate expenses incident thereto, and for securing working capital not in excess of $5,000, and for no other purpose un - less tirst there shall have been made to the Commission an application tor amendment to this order. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, that Scribner Rural Electric District No. 1 be and it hereby is authorized to issue and sell its bonds in amount not exceed - ing $90,000 under the following restrictions: la l Bonds shall be in denomination of $500 or $1000, or both, in the judgment of the board of directors, shall bear interest at not exceeding six per cent per annum, and shall be due and payable in suili installments as will retire the entire issue not later than Sep - tember 1, 194S.

Railway Com - pany for Authority to Discontinue Sunday Passenger Train Ser - vice Between Nelson, Nebraska, and DuBois, Nebraska, Trains Nos. 305 and 306. Appearances: For applicant: E. P. Holmes, attorney; E. D. Hungerford, super - intendent; and W. W. Cameron, trainmaster. For protestants: J. E. Portwood, Nelson; H. J. Struve, Deshler; J. Tillotson, Hebron: C. O. Hull. Ruskin; R. E. Riley, secre - tary Commercial Club, Fairbury. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: Applicant carrier operates branch line train service between Nel - son, Nebraska, and Horton, Kansas, where the branch connects with main line service. Its passenger service consists of a train each way, each day, seven days in the week. There is also motor car service out of St. Joseph, Missouri, as far as Bern, Kansas. Applicant asks our authority to discontinue the Sunday service in Nebraska purely as a matter of operating economy. This service has been in effect for many years. </seg>
            <seg id="p357">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 357 Hearing was held at Fairbury on August 23, at which practically all towns west of Fairbury were represented in protest. Certain data, in the opinion of the Commission necessary to a conclusion in this case, was not available at the time of the hearing, but was submitted later by applicant. This, in part, accounts for delay in conclusions. Applicant offered the earnings of the branch on Sunday service to sustain its contention that the revenues are insufficient to warrant operation for seven days in the week. This showing was in brief that the total number of passengers handled by the train in question on a run of 207 miles between Horton and Nelson was approximately fifty persons. This represented patrons boarding the train at twenty-four stations en route, or approximately an average of two persons per station on and off. In general the traffic is short distance traffic, as the average fare paid by each passenger on these Sunday trains fell below one dollar. There was, of course, the revenues arising from the carry - ing of mail and express, which will be set forth later. Protestants emphasized the necessity of Sunday train service by pointing out the relative isolation of the towns on days when trains do not run, the necessity of moving by express large quantities of cream received from the country in Saturday night deliveries, the deteriora - tion in dairy products occuring when the product is held over and shipped on Monday, the necessity for Sunday evening mail service in order that Monday morning business might be promptly dispatched, and the inconvenience to citizens desiring to travel on Sunday. What was said by respondents at this hearing could be said by any interior town located on branch lines between the main line of the Burlington from Kansas City to Denver and the main line of the Burlington between Omaha and Denver if those towns are confined to the territory west of the main line of the Rock Island, excepting the towns served by The St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island Railway company. It would be an equally true statement, no doubt, for many towns east of this mentioned territory. Sunday service has never been given in much of the branch line territory of Nebraska. The testimony of the carrier on different exhibits is conflicting as to express earnings. Under the circumstances we will use the tele - gram from the American Railway Express, read into the record on the day of the hearing, as properly reflecting the allocated earnings of the Horton-Nelson branch for the handling of express. It is necessary, through lack of date, to ascribe the same amount of earnings for Sunday express service as for week-day express service. Reducing the earnings and expenses to a basis of train mile be - tween Horton and Nelson (and we use the full extent of the service </seg>
            <seg id="p358">358 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT merely {or convenience rather than indicating our desire to invade the territory of Kansas by way of scrutiny) we have the following summary of the situation: EARNINGS Average passenger earnings per train mile 31.0 cents Average express earnings per train mile (Exhibit 111 21.4 cents Estimated mail earnings per train mile 12.0 cents Total earnings per train mile 64.4 cents Note: Does not include excess baggage earnings KXI'KNSKS Cost of fuel per train mile (Exhibit 1) 15.6 cents Wages of train crews per train mile 16.9 cents Notes: (a) An estimate, taking into account two somewhat con - flicting exhibits. (b) Does not include any allocated portion of main - tenance of way and structures and general expense. Includes nothing for fixed charges. This data summarizes the financial situation that confronts us in passing on this application. On the basis of this showing the com - pany's out-of-pocket cost, which it would avoid by not running the train, is more than met by the earnings. It is not fair to say, how- w r. that this is conclusive because a portion of these earnings would be added to the week-day trains if the Sunday trains were not operated and the expense, set forth above, would all be avoided. The main - tenance of way and structures, mentioned above but not included in the expenses, will almost entirely be incurred whether the trains run or not and this is equally true of fixed charges. In O'Malley v. V. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. (15 N. S. R. C. 12 2-130) we found the pasesnger train mile earnings to be $1.27 and ordered in Sunday branch service. In Application No. 4 700 and Application No. 4691, wherein the Union Pacific desired to abandon certain motor car passenger service on the Stapleton and Spalding branches, (15 N. S. R. C. 365-373) we found the passenger train mile earnings on the Stapleton branch, including steam and motor trains, to be fifty cents per train mile, and the steam train earnings on the Albion branch about ninety cents. From the Spalding branch we found the motor car earnings to be thirty cents per train mile. In these Union Pacific cases we denied a curtailment of service. However, we pointed out that the applicant in those cases was financially prosperous. That cannot be urged in this application.

            <seg id="p359">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 359 The Commission is unanimous in saying that the branch line train service is becoming increasingly a grave problem. Such branches have always depended largely on short distance or intertown traffic. That traffic has, as a matter of convenience and pleasure, largely gone to motor cars privately owned and we think it is there to stay. This is a matter of evolution of transportation. The problem has not been solved. The train service now being given did fit the needs of the period when it developed. It apparently no longer fits conditions. Is it to be answered by curtailment of service or by substitution of cheaper transportation? A majority of this Commission believes that circumstances sur - rounding this case and the out-of-pocket operating expenses as com - pared with the revenues, do not warrant approval of the application to abandon the Sunday service. The Commission is, however, unanimous in the belief that the company should be permitted to make every possible curtailment of the Sunday expense and to that end recom - mends that the company relieve itself of the burden of keeping open stations on Sunday except at those points were train operation make it imperative. Arrangements can be made for train crews to load and unload express and to house the mail at each station. Tickets can be sold on the train and arrangements can no doubt be made, with the aid of the people of the towns who have expressed themselves so in - terested in the convenience of this service, for the lighting and heating of the stations so that the expense thereof will be light, an expense which cannot now be so limited by the use of regular employes of the company. By this economy the company could considerably increase the net earnings available to aid in maintaining the roadway and structures. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the application of The Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company, for authority to discontinue passenger train service between DuBois, Nebraska and Nelson, Nebraska, on Sundays, be and it hereby ia denied. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this finding may be considered by applicant as sufficinet authority to warrant adjustment of station service on Sundays in order to reduce that expense to a minimum, notice of the plan to be filed with the Commission when put into effect.

OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: tThis applicant asks authority to sell not to exceed $50,000 of ht per cent cumulative preferred stock, the proceeds from the sale which to pay for new construction, or, at its option, to retire bills 'able and other payables. The company operates several exchanges in the North Platte valley and other exchanges in eastern Wyoming. It has outstanding at this time $250,000 of common stock and bonds in amount of $165, - 000. As of date June 30, 1923, there were bills payable outstanding in amount $50,547.50, most of which was owed to officers of the com - pany. The company furnishes also a statement of new construction not capitalized in amount $48,595.73. most of which represents con - struction in eastern Wyoming in the new territory opened up by the extension of the Union Pacific's North Platte branch. In response to an inquiry from the Commission it is stated that of the total cost of extensions and betterments 16.33 per cent repre - sents overhead cost and 4.44 per cent interest during construction. These percentages represent allocations of salaries and wages being currently paid. Section 676, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 192 2. requires lat the Commission find that issue of securities is reasonable and ecessary for the purposes of the corporation as a precedent to ap - roval of such issues. Without hearing, the evidence is clear enough lat this company has been making extensive improvements from cur - ent funds, which funds are necessary for other purposes, and that it lould be allowed to sell securities to reimburse its treasury for the utlay. While the overhead expenditures are somewhat higher than le average, they cannot be said to be excessive. The Commission ill approve the issue, subject to the provisions of section 5, article X, onstitution of the state of Nebraska.

            <seg id="p362">362 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT lines joined in an application to provide uniform carload minimum weights {or certain seeds, as follows: Cane and sorghum seed -...30,000 pounds Sudan seed .■ 30,000 pounds Wild mustard seed 36,000 pounds At the hearing it developed that there is a lack of uniformity of rule among the different carriers serving Nebraska and as between the intrastate rule and the interstate rule. The lowest applied min - imum is the Burlington intrastate where 24,000 pounds has been the rule for many years. The highest minimum is that of the Rock Island, which provides that these seeds must be loaded to the marked capacity of the car, or full bulk loading. Generally the interstate rule calls for 40,000 pounds minimum. Objections in general terms were tiled by the Omaha and Hastings chambers of commerce traffic bureaus. No one appeared for the Protestants and we are unable to ascertain the reasons for their ob - jections. The Lincoln chamber of commerce specifically stated its interested shippers had no objection!!. The testimony indicated that the traffic in these seeds is not heavy. Such carload traffic as does exist consists chiefly in the pur - chase of cane and sorghum and sudan seeds at production points and their movement, carload, to seed houses for later distribution less than carload and carload. The latter movement for the most part appears to be to distant points in interstate traffic, particularly the southeast of the United States. While the western trunk line committee of traffic men was con - sidering this matter it received some objections from dealers in the middle west, which objections appear to be that the nature of the traffic renders it difficult to secure in any one growing community car - loads of large weight and this difficulty would, if the minimum were high, require the purchaser to pay on grain he does not move, or to ship less than carload. All the seeds involved in this application are carried in carload quantities at the corn rate. If other conditions were equal the rule relative to minimum loading should be Mat which applies to the load - ing of corn. However, commercial conditions, over which no one has control, interposes a barrier to such heavy loading, that is. the inability to secure quantities at any one station sufficient to load heavy carloads. This fact is recognized by the carriers in their proposal to limit the minimum to 30,000 pounds, or only slightly more than one - third of the average lading of corn. Hence, if this minimum is applied the carload earnings on these seeds will be very much lower </seg>
            <seg id="p363">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 363 than the earnings on the movement of corn in equal quantities tor equal distance. It is also obvious that if these seeds are to continue to enjoy the advantage of corn rates the lading must be as high as the commercial conditions will reasonably permit. There is probably no intrastate carload traffic in wild mustard seed. The proposed minimum will reduce the requirements, on three railroads, of lading in Nebraska, will leave the present rule effective on one railroad, and increase the minimum on one railroad. The ap - plication appears reasonable and will be approved. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company, Chicago.

On December 4, 1922, the Interstate Commerce Commisson directed an inquiry into the proper rules governing the weights on carload ship - ments of hogs within the territory comprising Missouri, Illinois, Min - nesota. Nebraska, Wisconsin, South Dakota, Kansas, Iowa, Oklahoma, and Texas, to the end that reasonable and uniform rules throughout that territory might be prescribed for the interstate movement of this commodity. The Commission invited the states affected to cooperate in the investigation and in reaching conclusions with hopeful purpose of securing uniformity, interstate and intrastate, on the rules in ques - tion. A conference was held of representatives of a considerable num - ber of the states and a committee was appointed to represent the group of states. I Hearings were held at Excelsior Springs, Missouri, on March 20 23, inclusive, 1923, with representatives of the Interstate Commerce Commission and the committee representing the group of states sitting jointly. The investigation was the first of its kind in the territory affected, except a hearing held in Iowa a year or two previously. A vast amount of testimony was received from shippers and from rail - roads. Nebraska shippers and markets, although notified of the scope of the proceedings, did not participate. The same was true with reference to South Dakota, Minnesota, Illinois and Texas. The case was argued at Washington on June 11, 1U23, before a majority of the members of the Interstate Commerce Commission and the three members of the committee representing the group of states. Conferences were then held and unanimous conclusions were reached from the testimony as to the proper and reasonable rules.

The committee representing the group of states issued a joint letter to the various state commissions, recommending procedure within each of the states looking to the adoption of similar rules on intrastate shipments. The necessity for an investigation instituted by the Nebraska Commission was eliminated by the filing of this application. It is understood that the Western Trunk Line Committee has taken favor - able action, which should result in similar applications in each of the ■tateH that have not already acted. In considering this application we will give full consideration to the testimony given at the joint hearing. It was shown fairly clearly there that small hogs cannot safely be loaded to the minimum of 17,000 pounds now applying in standard stock cars. The Western Weighing &amp; Inspection Bureau, in Circular No. 436, issued June 3, 1921, reached the same conclusion and recommended that hogs weigh - ing less than 250 pounds as an average for a carload ought not to be loaded to the minimum of 17,000 pounds. The record also indi - cated clearly that heavily loaded cars resulted in increased damages to the load in deads and cripples; that the lightest loaded cars were made up of the lightest weight hogs and conversely; and that light loading of hogs was in considerable degree due to the lack of enough animals to make up the minimum load and the election on the part of the shipper to ship an underweight carload rather than to secure additional animals. It was impossible, from the record, to ascertain the relative effect of each of these factors, although both had an evident influence. It was also clear from the record that the territory affected did not have identical conditions of transportation. In some sections, particularly Wisconsin and the southern states of the group, the mar - keting of light hogs was more nearly the rule than In the remainder of the group of states, and in the states south of the Iowa-Nebraska state line the hogs did not appear to be as vigorous as those farther to the north and damages en route were usually larger on similar weight loads. Nebraska, which is affected by this application, invariably ships relatively heavy hogs to market and, with the. possible exceptions of South Dakota, loads the cars heavier, on the average, than any other state in the group. Exhibits covering the receipt of 6347 cars of hogs into South Omaha showed 3946 loaded above the minimum, or two - thirds of the total. A large per cent of the remaining cars loaded fairly close to the minimum. If the studies had been confined to loadings of Nebraska origin the percentage weighing the minimum or better would have been even higher. The average weight of hogs originating in Nebraska exceeds 250 pounds. The percentage of deads and cripples arriving on the Omaha market is relatively low and most </seg>
            <seg id="p366">366 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT of these shipments originate in Nebraska and constitute intrastate commerce. S There is a definite relationship between the minimum weight carloads of hogs, or more properly between the experienced average loading of hogs and the freight rate on hogs. In so far as reduced minima may affect the average weight of carloads of hogs moving in intrastate commerce it will have an effect on the relative rate for moving hogs as compared with the rate for moving cattle. If a re - duction in the minima were to make necessary a readjustment of the hog rates it would in Nebraska disadvantage more shippers than would be benefited by a reduction in the minimum. If the reduction in the minimum does not appreciably reduce the average loading the effect in Nebraska will not be great. In the joint consideration of this problem it was agreed that uniformiay of rules within the territory was desirable because of market competition. The majority of this Commission does not think this is particularly true over so wide a territory as is here concerned but desires to defer to the judgment of the joint investigators. The cooperative case was held in the hope that the same rules might be promulgated to cover all shipments originating within the territory affected. The application will be approved.

Taylor, Chairman. Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) APPLICATION XO. 52*4 In the Matter of the Application of the Western Public Service Com - pany for Authority to Issue and Sell Securities. Appearances: For applicant: Clarence A. Davis, attorney; E. C. van Diest, president. BROWNE, Commissioner: The Western Public Service company, applicant herein, formerly known as the Intermountian Railway Light &amp; Power company, a Colorado corporation, organized in 1912, asked for authority to issue and sell not more than 1200,000 in seven per cent first preferred stock, shares of par value $100 each, said shares to be sold at not less than ninety per centum of face value. By its charter this company is authorized to sell one million dollars of common stock, one million dollars of seven per cent first preferred stock, and one million dollars of seven per cent second pre - ferred stock. By its charter, also, the preferred stock is non-voting unless the company shall have passed two quarterly dividends, in which case the preferred stock at once assumes full voting powers on a parity with common stock, which power to vote continues until all dividends in arrears have been paid. Such stock is legal, according to the evidence, in the state where this corporation was created. Applicant desires to find a market in this state for a small portion of its securities in furtherance of its program of so-called "customer ownership." By the provisions of chapter 168, session laws of Ne - braska for 1923, it was necessary to apply to this Commission for authority to sell the securities. Applicant owns varied public utilities in Colorado, Texas, Mis - souri, Nebraska and Wyoming, these consisting of electric, water and gas public utilities and ice plants. In Nebraska, it owns the electric </seg>
            <seg id="p368">368 light and ice plant at Holdrege and sells over its own transmission lines current at wholesale to Funk, Hildreth, Axtell, and Wileox. It owns plants and distributes to its own customers at Crawford, Scotts - bluff, Bayard, Gering, Minatare, Melbeta, Auburn and Chadron. Any securities issued by this company are to cover the entire properties, with the exception of certain underlying bond issues ac - quired with properties. It is obvious that this Commission cannot check the physical properties in so wide-flung a territory. In consider - ation of this application it has confined itself to careful scrutiny of the company's plan of doing business and of financing. The balance sheet as of December 31, 1922, as prepared by Has - kins &amp; Sells, public accountants of Denver, shows plant valued at $4,563,936, and total assets of $5,027,310.97. The plant value was taken from appraisals by Day &amp; Zimmerman, valuation engineers of Philadelphia. This plant value represents a re-valuation reflecting reproduction in the latter part of 1922 and that only. The company, however, in order that this write-up of property values might not show in the statement as a surplus earned and ostensibly reflecting prosper - ous operation, carries the amount representing the re-valuation over and above the cost to applicant of the plant as a separate item. This item amounts to $482,114. It does not, however, reflect the amount of increase in assets, brought about through the engineer's re-valuation, since the accountants wrote off against this re-valuation surplus vt-ry extensive losses, due to operation, in the war-time period. Our ex - perience with work of valuation of engineers at this time would lead to the conclusion, in the absence of anything to the contrary, that the valuation resulting from their efforts has been very liberal and that it is not at all certain that the company will be able to establish fair values even approximating such figures. The company's liabilities as of December 31, 1922, consisted of $2,739,062 of bonded indebtedness for the most part, or entirely, con - fined to individual properties. In this figure are also notes payable in amount $121,762. There was also outstanding at that time $482, - 400 of preferred stock, which becomes under the refinancing scheme second preferred stock. One million dollars of common stock was also outstanding. Testimony shows a portion of this was issued for promotion purposes. It is the purpose of the company in its refinanc - ing plan, by which first and second preferred stock will become out - standing, to retire bonds as fast as is practicable from the proceeds of the sale of these preferred stocks. Within limits such financing is sound as it reduces the fixed charges. hThe company presented an operating statement showing that tie twelve months ending July, 1922, the net earnings were $247,- II and that the bond interest paid amounted to approximately </seg>
            <seg id="p369">369 1160,000. That left $87,297 with which to pay dividends on stocks and out of which a prudent company would set up a reserve for un - realized depreciation. For the year ending July, 1923, net earnings were $336,964.54. Total interest obligations are placed at $186,500 in round numbers, leaving for dividends and reserve for depreciation $150,418. The accountants and auditors, heretofore mentioned, cer - tified that for the calendar year 1922 the net earnings available for interest, dividends, and depreciation were $323,597. It would appear that preferred stock dividends are now being earned and that so long as the proceeds from the sale of such preferred stock are used for betterments which have earning power, or for con - verting other interest-bearing obligations, they have fair assurance of continuing to earn. We will authorize the sale at this time of only $100,000 of this preferred stock in order that we may have opportunity to again scru - tinize the results of the company's financial management before pass - ing on further issues after these preferred stocks may have been sold. This conclusion is without prejudice to further applications at any time. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Western Public Service company be and it hereby is authorized to issue and sell in the state of Nebraska, or elsewhere, $100,000 par value of its first preferred seven per cent cumulative pre - ferred stock, par value $100 per share, said stock to be sold for cash or its fair equivalent in property, at par if in property, and at not less than ninety per centum of par if sold for cash. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the proceeds of the sale of these securities shall be used for additions and betterments, or for converting or retiring other indebtedness incurred in the construction of additions and betterments and for no other purpose. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED as of December 31, and not later than thirty days thereafter, the company shall annually for five years file a statement showing the balance sheet of the consolidated prop - erties and the result of operations for the preceding year.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 52JKJ In the Matter of the Application of Harry T. Mead, Owner of the Farmers Telephone Company of Dix for Authority to Abandon Such Exchange. OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION This is an application presented by H. T. Mead, owner of the Farmers Telephone Company of Dix requesting authority of the Com - mission to discontinue the operation of such telephone exchange. It </seg>
            <seg id="p372">372 I stated that the exchange tor a considerable period ot time has been erated at a constant loss. An itemized statement of receipts and penditures submitted by applicant shows monthly gross receipts in lount $54.91 and fixed monthly expenditures in amount $67.80, or Lai loss each month of $12.89. Applicant also states that it is his lief that it is not possible to collect a rate for service which would compensatory. This statement is confirmed by information at hand &gt;m representative of interested subscribers advising "that they &gt;uld far rather dispense with the service altogether than to stand for higher rate." The Commission appreciates fully the Inconvenience which will be occasioned citizens of this community if they are to be without tele - lone service. It is also aware of the fact that the owner has certain egal rights and that he cannot be compelled to operate this exchange definitely at a constant loss. To make such requirement would olate certain constitutional guarantees and would result in confisca - on of property. However, it is not desired to foreclose the matter if lere is an alternative. Accordingly, opportunity will herein be af - orded applicant or interested subscribers, to offer, prior to January , 1924, some plan or alternative which will result in continuation of rvlce at a rate reasonable and compensatory. Failing in which the bandonment of the exchange will be at the owner's option at any time ter January 1, 1924. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway omniission that effective January 1, 1924, applicant herein, at his ptlon, be and he hereby is authorized to discontinue operation of the "armer8 Telephone Company of Dix, provided, however, that such dis - ontinuance shall not become effective if prior to that time there shall be filed with the Commission, either by the owner himself or by in - erested subscribers, some alternative plan by which continued oper - tion of such exchange may be continued without confiscation of roperty.

Commissioner tThis applicant operates exchanges at Hooper and I'ehling. and ires also on party lines the towns of Nickerson and Winslow. It over 800 subscribers. The company was organized in 1901. with il capital, and has remained a local company, having at this time i stockholders. The plant at Hooper is common battery within the hange area, with magneto metallic farm lines. The plant at I'ehl - is magneto metallic and the lines serving the additional towns also metallic. In 191S, the company made application for rate relief to begin with the first of the year 1919. Much delay ensued and a rate increase was approved, to be effective January 1. 1920, in much lower amounts than had been applied for. The subsequent history has indicated that the Commission was as much too conservative in its conclusions as the company was too liberal. The company was required, because of certain local conditions, to pay a seven per cent dividend if it were earned. It has paid tUa seven per cent dividend in cash, although through much of the period of the last four years it has not earned all the amount, having drawn on surpluses. In 1922, it failed to earn the seven per cent dividend by $1,995, and in the first ten months of 1923 has failed by $1,441 to earn the dividend. It is this situation that has given rise to the application. tThe matter was discussed at the annual meeting of the stock - ders and it was unanimously agreed to ask for increases ranging m ten to twenty-five cents per station. If approved in its entirety the net rates will be as follows </seg>

The Commission hag also been asked to permit the company to reduce the set-up for maintenance and reserve from ten per cent per annum of the fixed property to nine per cent and points to the results of the past two years in justification. The reserve invested in property now amounts to more than $36,000. On this no return is paid, although it is mostly invested in earning properties. There was passed to this reserve in 1922 $4,316.54 over and above the current expenditures therefrom. For the first ten months of this year there has been passed to the reserve $3,298.69. Under the circumstances the authority will be granted to reduce the set-up from ten to nine per cent of the fixed property. This will release for other purposes, including dividends, approximately $825 per annum. At the time the rates were fixed in 1919 there was no common battery service offered. It hag since been installed, available to Hooper subscribers only at an expense of $10,000. It is a higher grade of service and is more expensive to give not only on account of the in - vestment, but by reason of higher requirements of maintenance. The company's proposal would require the business subscribers at Uehling, Nickerson and Winalow to pay within five cents per month of as much as the business subscribers at Hooper and would require residence subscribers to pay within ten cents as much.

The proposed charges for tt service are Justified. It is at the option of the subscriber and it not necessary that he pay the additional ten cents a month unless so desires. In our opinion it would be equitable to confine the increases to e Hooper property and to the rural service. It is proposed to in - ease the rural service ten cents per month, which would put the etallic rural lines on the same rate basis as surrounding territory. me of which is not metllic. If we leave the rates in the towns of ehling, Winslow and Nickerson as they now are, increase the rates in ooper as prayed for, and the rural rates at all exchanges in the mount asked, viz.: ten cents per month, the company will have net ncreases slightly more than $1,000 per annum. It will also have the mount released by the reduction of the reserve and should be able nnually to continue to pay its seven per cent dividend without draw - g further on liquid reserves which are already seriously depleted.

The system formerly included an exchange and intermediate farm lines at Clearwater, but with the approval of the Commission in 1918 the Clearwater exchange was sold and the capital stock of the company reduced proportionately leaving the amount of common stock outstanding at $6,240. From the time of its organization in 1902, or 1903, down to the present the company has paid but two dividends, one of six per cent and one of eight per cent. The property was permitted to run down for several years prior to 1918 and 1919 but in 1920, 1921 and 1922, the plant was reconstructed and upwards of $7,000 put into improvements. In 1918, a valuation by the Commission on the basis of original cost showed the property to have cost $15,028.70 with a depreciated value of $7,2 84.77. Disregarding any allowance for increment in prices since the 1918 valuation was made, and adding the additions and betterments referred to, the property would be worth on a cost basis today $14,227.50. This figure does not take into ac - count any depreciation in the new property installed since 1920. In lieu of cash dividends the company now asks authority to issue its common stock in an amount equal to 100 per cent of its present outstanding capital. The history of the company shows that only two small dividends have been paid and these were based on a small amount of stock outstanding. Whatever money in the form of net </seg>
            <seg id="p380">380 income that has been available has been applied to maintenance and improvement of the property. The value of the property on the most conservative basis that could be taken exceeds by a comfortable margin the amount of stock that would be outstanding if the present appli - cation were to be allowed. The stockholders of the company have been entitled undoubtedly to their dividends. Since it has been largely a cooperative institution they have preferred to invest these dividends in the property. They are now content to take added stock to represent their interest. Further improvements in the property will be necessary from time to time and money will have to be secured from sales of stock. The issue asked for herein will equalize the interest of the existing stockholders as against any who may come in later and is an additional reason for the increase in the stock at this time. The application appears to be reasonable, therefore, and will be approved. itRKKR IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Antelope County Mutual Telephone company be, and the same hereby is. authorized to issue its common stock in the amount of (6,240, the same to be issued at par of $60 per share and to be distributed as a stock dividend to the present stockholders of record in the ratio of their present holdings; same to be in full payment of any and all claims of present stock - holders against the company. Within ninety days from the date hereof the company shall make report to the Commission covering the is - suance and distribution of the stock herein authorized.

            <seg id="p381">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 381 APPLICATION NO. 8846 In the Matter of the Application of The Western Public Service Com - pany for Authority to Sell Its First Mortgage Bonds and Its Mortgage Lien Notes. Appearances For the applicant: Clarence A. Davis, attorney; E. C. van Diest, president. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This is an application wherein the Western Public Service com - pany of Colorado Springs, Colorado, seeks the approval of this Com - mission to an issue of 13,500,000 of its first mortgage, 6% per cent twenty year bonds, and $1,500,000 of its 7 per tent ten year mortgage lien notes. The Western Public Service company is a foreign corporation, incorporated under the laws of the state of Colorado in 1912, formerly known as the Intermountain Railway Light &amp; Power company, which name was changed to the Western Public Service company in 1922. The financial statement of the company, submitted with this applica - tion, shows a capital stock outstanding of $1,536,200 as of September 30, 1923. which is the last statement available. From this statement it appears that the company has outstanding several bond issues of various amounts, at various rates of interest, and covering miscellan - eous properties. The amounts and rates of these various issues are more fully set forth in the financial statement of the company attached to the application. It will suffice here to say that there are seven classes of securities outstanding, secured by various of the company's properties. Some of these issues are issues that were outstanding against properties at the time they were acquired, and which have been permitted to remain because of desirable interest rates; as for instance, $50,000 of five per cent bonds on the Tarkio properties. Other of the bonds out - standing were issued from time to time during the period of the war for more or less temporary purposes and to meet emergencies, without due regard being had to the permanence of the issue, or to the future financing of the company. The total amount of the bonds at present outstanding approximates $2,562,000. It is now proposed to issue a first mortgage bond on all of the properties of the company in the amount of $3,500,000, utilizing so much of the proceeds thereof as Is </seg>
            <seg id="p382">382 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT necessary to take up all outstanding bond Issues, and to bold the re - mainder of the $3,500,000 for the purpose, of acquiring new properties from time to time, some of which the company has already under contract to purchase. The record shows that the proposed first mortgage bonds, in amount $3,500,000, styled Series A, are to be secured by an open mortgage on all the properties of the company and that the Inter - national Trust company of Denver shall act as trustee of the issue. The bonds are to be marketed through well-known brokerage houses in Chicago and will be offered to investors through the usual financial channels, rather than by sale by the company itself. The terms under which the mortgage is to be executed were not fully worked out at the time of the hearing, these being under the direction of the bond houses which are undertaking to find a market for the securities and at the same time are interested in protecting the purchasers of the securities. It had, however, been decided that the bonds are callable on any interest payment date, at prices ranging from par to 105 per cent of par, dependent upon the date of calling; that they shall bear interest at the rate of 6 Vs per cent and be due in twenty years from the date of issue: that the company shall set up 12' 2 per rent of the gross earnings as a reserve fund, which the company is permitted to use in the construction of additional properties, or in the purchase and retirement of any of the bonds themselves, as well as in the re - placement of property under standard rules for handling depreciation reserve. If invested in other properties this reserve cannot at any time be made the subject of other indebtedness. This provision is for the purposes of protecting the investor in the securities After the refinancing of existing indebtedness shall have been completed any other proceeds from the sale of bonds of Series A shall be invested in property only to the extent of eighty per cent of the cost of such property, or its valuation, whichever is less. Such added property is to come under the mortgage before the funds are released by the trustee, as we understand the indenture. The selling price of the securities to the public is, of course, not known prior to their being offered. The company will get somewhere between 80 and 90 cents net on the dollar for the securities. This company's property is located in several states. Some of the properties included under the mortgage now being executed are not pubic utility properties. Most of them are light, water, and gas prop - erties. The properties in Nebraska constitute a minority of the total holdings The application is made to this Commission under the provisions of article 676, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, as amended. </seg>
            <seg id="p383">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 383 relating to the issues of securities of common carriers or public service corporations doing business in the state of Nebraska. We are directed by that law to approve the issues of securities if we find the use of the capital to be "reasonably required for the said purposes of the cor - poration," viz.: for the acquisition of property, construction, com - pletion, extension, or improvement of facilities, or for the improvement of its maintenance, or service, or for the discharge or lawful refunding of its obligations. This company is growing rapidly and extending into new terri - tory. Financing is one of its problems. It is quite apparent that that financing will be improved by consolidation of the indebtedness. We are in no position to pass upon the conservatism with which the exist - ing indebtedness was undertaken. We must deal with the property as it is presented, with the net earnings, and with the provisions of the refinancing. The bonded indebtedness now totals $2,562,100, on which the annual fixed charges are 1165,684. Other interest-bearing debts ap - parently total $555,594, the fixed charges on which are $38,583. The fixed charges on the property as it stood at the time of the hearing were, therefore, $204,267, and the indebtedness, which it is here pro - posed to fund, or refund, is $3,117,694. The maximum fixed charges after the refinancing has been completed will be $241,130 on the prop - erty as it stood at the time of the hearing. The fixed charges will un - doubtedly be less than that. It cannot be ascertained how much until the refinancing has been completed. It is, however fairly apparent that the fixed charges will be somewhat increased as a result of the refinancing. It will require not more than $3,000,000 at par of the first mortgage bonds and $646,000 of the debenture bonds to fund and re - fund the existing indebtedness. The remaining amounts which the application covers, viz.: $500,000 of first mortgage bonds, and $854,000 of debenture bonds, are to be handled through the trustee for future development purposes. It is apparent that on properties existing from Texas to northern Wyoming and Nebraska this Commission cannot check the physical property in the field as it usually does for more localized properties in this state. It must rely on other information. Applicant has sub - mitted a balance sheet prepared by Haskins &amp; Sells of Chicago, pur - porting to show the assets and the liabilities as they exist to date on the company's books. This statement is made up in so far as it affects physical property by the use of an inventory and valuation prepared by Day &amp; Zimmerman of Philadelphia, valuation engineers, to which has been added property acquired since the taking of that inventory. Day ft Zimmerman appear to prepare their valuation with overhead </seg>
            <seg id="p384">384 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT coat placed at approximately twenty-four per cent and the unit values based on average unit prices of labor and materials for a five-year period immediately preceding the inventory. They are, therefore, somewhat higher than the figures ordinarily taken in arriving at fair values for rate-making purposes and represent, generally speaking, the maximum values of physical properties undepreciated. Nothing in the record indicates whether the company's statement takes into full ac - count the amount of depreciation set forth by the valuation engineers. The statement does show a reserve for depreciation of $303,667, or approximately seven per cent. This is probably low from the point of view of fair value for rate-making purposes. The statement also shows a surplus of $606,524. The figure is taken from the statement of September 30, 1923. When this is com - pared with the statement in this record of December 31, 1922, it is clear that this surplus represents very little earned surplus. It Is derived from the placing into the assets of properties at appraisal figures rather than at cost. Since December 31, 19 2 2, the company has added extensively to its properties. A check of such data as is at hand would indicate that a considerable amount of the additional assets acquired during the current year represent appraisal Igmi rather than cost figures. The actual amount it is impossible to ascertain on this record because it is not shown how much of the net earnings of the current year have temporarily been employed in the acquisition of investment securities and additional plant. It does not appear that there is any sound reason in law for refusal to approve the refinancing, even under the rather heavy fixed charges which will result. It is economical for the company at the time of the refinancing to make arrangements for funds for future development. This is being done in this instance to the extent of ap - proximately one half million dollars of bonds and three-quarter millions of debentures. This will be issued under the trust agreement only when the property has been acquired. The soundness of the in - vestment will depend upon the conservatism of such development. This cannot be foretold. Our approval of the issues must in no sense be considered our approval of the securities as an investment. If the company were to continue setting forth its assets on the basis of appraisals it would be effectually hiding the trend of the business, whether good or bad. It is our understanding that the bankers who are undertaking to find a market for these securities have insisted on a reasonably conservative rule in this respect. The company's net earnings for the twelve months ending October SI, 1923, were $367,017.23, from which should be deducted ap- </seg>
            <seg id="p385">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 385 proximately $125,000 as a reserve. Undoubtedly the earnings will considerably exceed this next year as part of this property has been so recently acquired that its earnings hare not been much in evidence. The company is safely earning its fixed charges and bids fair to earn them and the required reserve, as well as preferred stock dividends. Whether it does better depends upon the development and management. A condition of this order will be that the company file with the Commission statement each thirty days for the next year of the progress of the refinancing and a consolidated balance sheet, either monthly or quarterly, at the option of the company. In such a state - ment as is filed with the Commission shall be included a separation of the surplus into earned surplus and surplus due to re-valuation. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Western Public Service company be and it hereby is authorized to issue and sell $3,500,000, twenty-year, 6 hi per cent first mortgage bonds, subject to the following conditions: (a) The bonds shall be sold to net the company not less than 85 per centum of face value. The proceeds shall be used from time to time as prudent management shall dictate in the retiring of present outstanding under - lying bonds, set forth in detail in the application, or, in the acquisition of property in accordance with the terms of the mortgage.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that of January 31, 1924, and each succeeding month thereafter for a period of twelve months the com - pany shall file with this Commission a statement of the sale of bonds and debentures under this order and the use of the proceeds, each statement to cover the preceding thirty days; (b) A consolidated balance sheet, either monthly or quarterly, which balance sheet shall state separately surplus earned and surplus acquired in other ways; and (c) A supplemental statement if the facts are not otherwise dis - closed as to the purchase or construction cost of properties acquired from the proceeds of the sale of these securities and the figure at which such properties are put Into the plant accounts. </seg>

Chairman Attest: John E. Curtlss, Secretary. (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 6«B7 In the Matter of the Application of the Omaha. Lincoln &amp; Beatrice Railway Company for Authority to Make Reclassiflcation of Its Express Tariffs and an Increase in Rates on Certain Commodities OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR. Chairman Applicant operates an lnterurban railroad extending from the center of the business district in Lincoln to the suburbs of Bethany and University Place. In addition to handling passengers it also trans - ports express matter. It now proposes to increase its rates for express service and submits a rather elaborate classification. All commodities under the new classification are to be divided into two classes — first and second. Heretofore there have been four classes. This will result in increasing second class commodities to the first class basis and all third and fourth class commodities to the second class basis. The rate for first class commodities is to be thirty cents and for second class twenty-five centts. The minimum charge is to be increased from twenty cents to twenty-five cents. The principal commodities handled are ice cream, fresh fruits and vegetables, groceries and packing house products. Practically all of these commodities are handled for the manufacturing and wholesale houses in the city. Most of these con - cerns have delivery trucks and handle the bulk of their business in such trucks. Late orders and shipments that move on days when trucks do not make the trip are turned over to applicant for trans - portation. It follows, therefore, that applicant is required to furnish an emergency or stand-by service to a large extent. In support of the application applicant submits a revenue and expense statement wherein it is shown that the expense for handling express averages about $4.75 per day, or $123.50 per month. The revenue for the twelve months from November, 1922, to October 31. 1923, aggregates $1,087.94. The deficit per month In the handling of the business, therefore, averages $32.84. The expense figures ap - pear to be conservative and are submitted in detail so as to be suscep - tible of analysis. The increase from the proposed rates is estimated </seg>
            <seg id="p387">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 387 at not to exceed $25.00 per month and will, therefore, no more than exceed the actual operating deficit, with no allowance for a return on the property involved.

(SEALt APPLICATION NO. 8300 In the Matter of the Application of the Gage County Independent Telephone Company for Authority to be Permitted to Pay Eight Per Cent Dividend on Outstanding Stock if Same is Earned This Year. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE. Commissioner In the early part of 1920 the Commission authorized this tele- phone company, operating in Blue Springs, Nebraska, with farm lines located on three sides of Blue Springs and Wymore, Nebraska, to make certain Increases in rates (13 N. S. R. C. 322-326). At that </seg>
            <seg id="p392">392 time the property was not In first-class condition and the Commission limited the dividend which might be paid to seven per cent on out - standing stock. No valuation of the property was, however, made. The Commission also required that additional capital should be in - vested in betterments. Two years later, the company made additional representation that it had failed to earn the dividend rate the Commission said it was entitled to have because costs of operation were higher than the estimate. Certain other increases were then granted, these being con - fined to town subscribers. Those rates continue today. This com - pany offers its subscribers free service to the Wymore exchange of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company. It has 600 subscribers of its own. Its subscribers, therefore, are granted a wide range of service at exceedingly conservative rates under a scale wherein almost all the rural subscribers pay |1.25 per month. The business rate is (2.25 per month net. IThe company earned something more than seven per cent on the Lstanding stock and will in 1923 earn $300 more than a dividend seven per cent on such stock. There is no indebtedness. The Com - ssion is not willing to say that seven per cent is not a fair return the fair value of the property in that portion of the state. Some ler public utilities are paying more than that on common stock, I in such cases a portion of the investment is in senior obligations iring lower rates of interest. However, we do not consider the application of the company un - easonable because the outstanding stock represents only $25.00 per tation. This Commission has never made a valuation of properties ' a telephone company doing commercial business where the net value s that low. Hence, there is every reason to believe that the actual alue considerably exceeds the amount on which dividends are being aid at seven per cent. We will approve a change in the previous rders to read a maximum dividend of eight per cent on outstanding tock. This will probably represent less than seven per cent on the air present worth of the properties even on a cost basis. A further inducement in approving this amendment to previous orders is that this company's rural property is grounded. There is a rapid development of high tension electric lines in the territory and the day is approaching when a considerable additional investment must be made to make these rural lines metallic in the interest of service. The company must depend upon local capital. It is sound policy that the securities of this independent telephone company be favorably enough considered locally so that necessary additional </seg>

(SEAL APPLICATION NO. 5870 In the Matter of the Application of the Western Barge Line, Inc., to Issue and Sell Securities. Appearances For applicant: Thomas P. Craig, president; C. F. Christopher, secretary- OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This applicant is incorporated in the state of Missouri, with an authorized capital of $17,000, divided into shares of $50.00 each. It proposes to construct a steam propelled towboat and certain cargo barges for operation on the Missouri river and desires to issue and sell $8,500 of stock in the state of Nebraska to finance partly the project. It is proposed that the corporation shall in the first instance operate between Sioux City and Omaha, serving generally the two towns of Decatur and Macy, and such other rural landings as may de - velop business. It will haul merchandise freight to the inland towns on the river from both Omaha and Sioux City and farm products in the reverse direction. The incorporators have agreed to purchase one-half of an issue of $17,000 of stock themselves and have the cash on hand for that purpose. It is proposed to market the remaining stock at the towns most to be benefitted from such a barge line and among merchants at the jobbing cities of Omaha and Sioux City. The </seg>
            <seg id="p394">394 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Forporators agreed of record to dispose of the stock at no other ex - ise to the company than the out-of-pocket expenses of the officers selling the stock. tThe ultimate plan of the incorporators is to prove the adapt - ity of the Missouri river for such traffic, to enlarge the company eafter, and to engage in general barge business between Sioux City St. Louis. The amount of stock which it is proposed at this time to sell would, according to the witnesses, do little more than purchase a ■team towboat. Barges of 150 tons capacity will cost each about $2200 additional. The money for such barges will be secured by addi - tional sale of stock in Missouri, or by borrowing the money. Nego - tiations have been carried on with the businessmen of Macy and De - catur, inland towns not served by railroad in Nebraska, and promises of financial support have been secured. The corporation proposes to enter the common carrier business and as such the proposed issue falls within the scope of article 17, chapter 12, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. Its purpose is legitimate and may not be visionary. The incorporators are willing to risk their own money in the enterprise. The president of the com - pany has had fourteen years' experience as a pilot on the river, mostly in the United States government service. It was agreed of record that the funds secured from the sale of stock in Nebraska should be placed on deposit at the First National Bank of Decatur, which, as trustee, should honor drafts of the com - pany's officials upon evidence that the money had been spent for the purposes here approved, viz. : the purchase and construction of a steam towboat, barges, and loading and unloading facilities. TUe trustee, by the terms of the statement of record preliminary to this approval is empowered to assure himself before honoring drafts on the proceeds of the sale of securities that the incorporators are com - plying with the testimony to the extent of also expending their own funds secured from the purchase by themselves of one-half of the total issue. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Western Barge Line, Inc., be and it hereby is authorized, under the provisions of article IT, chapter 12, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, to issue and sell {17,000 of common stock, par value $50 per share, and to dispose of one-half of this amount within the state of Nebraska, subject to the following re- </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 5872 In the Matter of the Application of the Hamilton County Telephone Association for Authority to Continue Present Rates and Charges for Telephone Service. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: Applicant operates exchanges at Aurora, Doniphan, Giltner, Hamp - ton, Hordville, Marquette, Phillips, Btockham and Trumbull. It has 1562 stockholders and 2837 subscribers. Under date of April 30, 1920, we authorized this company to in - crease its charges for telephone service approximately eighteen per cent. The rates were temporary and have been annually extended by us under orders and supplemental orders on Application 4167 (13 N. </seg>
            <seg id="p396">396 8. R. C. 167-171; 14 N. S. R. C. 242-248; 15 N. S. R. C. 202-206) The last of such orders expires automatically December 31, 1923. After careful consideration the board of directors asks to continue the present scale. Applicant operates a common battery exchange in the city of Aurora at rates considerably below the average of such serrlce In the state. It furnishes free connections between all exchanges of such standard as may be expected from free service between towns. It operates magneto metallic and grounded service at its other exchanges and generally grounded service to its rural subscribers. Its revenue* approximate $51,000 a year. The company was originally mutual and at the present time by its articles of incorporation cannot pay dividends to its stockholders. In lieu of such dividends it has been authorized by us to rebate at the rate of twenty-five cents a month to all except certain business stock - holders who have a rebate of fifty cents a month. In the original order on Application 4167 (13 N. S. R. C. 367-371) we found that the fair return on the outstanding securities would entitle the company to some additional earnings above the rebate. This amount was fixed at $2,000 per year, which amount should be increased at this time because of additional Investments made since. The net earnings for eleven months of 1923, after deducting in - terest and taxes, was $5,979. It is apparent, therefore, that the com - pany wll be able to pass to surplus, over and above the amount rather arbitrarily found by us to be within the limits of what it is entitled to, about $4,000 this year. There might, therefore, be a reduction in the rates of ten cents a month, or Its equivalent spread differently. This matter has been referred by us to the board of directors and their conclusion is that It is inadvisable. This conclusion is not shaped in any manner by the impelling influence of earnings for dividends. The Commission gives great weight to the judgment of this board of directors. It is also impressed by the fact that the company is serving in a manner appar - ently fairly satisfactory to subscribers at lower rates than obtains in surrounding territory. These two facts lead us to the conclusion and we so find that the rates should be continued tor another calendar year. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Hamilton Counyt Farmers Telephone association be and it hereby is authorized to continue its present rates and charges until the close of business December 31, 1924, unless otherwise ordered </seg>

OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: In response to a resolution by this Commission on its own motion, dated February 5, 1923. bearing was held in the offices of the Com - mission on February 20, 1923, on certain suggested and contemplated amendments to the intrastate tariffs of various carriers regarding rates on brick and related articles. Subsequent to that hearing the carriers, under verbal agreement with the Commission, filed application for authority to amend the various tariffs to provide for a minimum of 60,000 pounds on brick and related articles subject to the protection of cars whose marked capacity was less than 60,000 pounds. Authority was granted to pub - lish the changed minima on April 20, 1923, under Application No. 5069. A check of the tariffs indicates that the Chicago ft North West - ern Railway company is the only party to the application who have published out the reduced minimum. The present brick rates in Nebraska are the result of an order Issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission on I. C. C. Docket No. 11829, dated August 26, 1921. That order was the result of an agree - ment between shippers, carriers and the Nebraska Commission dur - ing a period when federal injunction interfered with the operation of the intrastate regulatory machinery. The rates set forth in that order were subsequently reduced ten per cent. The minima of the various tariffs were in existence prior to the order and were continued in effect, having been amended by our order on Application No. 5069, and by most carriers operating intrastate not yet published. One of the reasons for setting down a further investigation of the brick schedule of rules intrastate was that by an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, dated December 29, 1922, (Ballon Brick Company « ai. v. A. T. * 8. F. Ry. Co. et al.; 77 I. C. C), effective ultimately on May 21, 1923, certain readjustments In brick </seg>
            <seg id="p406">406 rates interstate to Nebraska destinations were made which were pos - sibly prejudicial to intraatate shippers of these commodities. The points raised by the Commission and considered and dis - cussed of record by witnesses for carriers, manufacturers and jobbers were : (a) Whether the then minimum of marked capacity of the car operated disadvantageous^ to producers and consumers of clay products; (b) Whether common brick should by reason of its cheapness and lack of liability to damage carry a different rate than other prod - ucts of clay: and (c) Whether it was desirable from the point of view of all con - cerned that intrastate tariffs provide for joint rates at an arbitrary over the single line haul. In the consideration of the Ballou Brick ra.sc, supra, the intra - state rates of Nebraska had been taken as the basis for prescribing the interstate rates with certain departures. The interstate rates from manufacturing points in other states not distant from the Nebraska state line were made one-half cent lower per hundred pounds for dis - tances up to and including fifty miles. Following the decision pre - viously rendered by the Interstate Commerce Commission in I. ('. OL Docket No. 10788, National Paving Brick Manufacturers' Association T. A. £ V. Railway company &lt;•« al.; 68 I. C. C. 213, known as the Gen - eral Brick case, the decision in the Ballou cane, supra, provided for Mr - tain reductions from the schedule in rates on common brick and de - fined common brick identically with the definition in the General Brick case. The Nebraska carriers without exception published in their in - terstate tariffs the reduced rate on common brick but so interpreted the confusing definition laid down by the federal Commission aa to grant the reduced rates to no shipments which might be destined to Nebraska points. Hence the failure of Nebraska tariffs to reflect so low a common brick rate was not disadvantageous to Nebraska shippers. Carrier witnesses were opposed to a further reduction in the rates on common brick from the schedule applied to other brick and related articles but admitted that if they did not succeed in preventing such reduction on interstate shipments they would not be in good position to urge the retenton of the present scale intrastate. Manufacturers who testified were far from a unit on the advisability of a lower rate on common brick than on other brick and related articles, even though such spread resulted in reductions in existing rates on common brick. In general, the attitude of manufacturers depended upon whether they </seg>
            <seg id="p407">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 407 were devoting more attention to the making of common brick or to the making of face and pressed brick and hollow building tile. The latter manufacturers saw in a more favorable rate on common brick considerable danger to the development of their specialties. All shippers were united that occasions were frequent when the absence of joint rates on brick produced a very high freight rate on certain shipments. The marked capacity rule governing the minimum weight was found to be frequently disturbing to manufacturers and shippers. No objection was raised to the ability to load to the required minimum but it was pointed out that often retailers found it em - barrassing to order so large a carload. For all practical purposes the carriers evaded the prescribed lower rate on common brick by insisting that the brick must be dumped at random into the car before the lower rate would apply. While this Interpretation might have been gleaned from the interstate order It was an illogical position and apparently assumed merely for the pur - pose of avoiding the lower rate. The Nebraska Commission has been and is now of the opinion Chat freight rates on the high grade expensive brick and hollow tile should be higher than on common brick. Failure to preserve a spread ignored one of the large factors in the making of rates. We are of the opinion and so find that the existing brick schedules applicable on the commodities named in the uniform brick list in Nebraska are unjust and unreasonable and should be modified for distances up to and Including fifty miles so as to be uniform with the interstate rate from adjacent states to Nebraska destinations. This adjustment will reduce the rates one-half cent per hundred pounds for the above distances. The resulting schedule, which will be set forth in the order below should be applied to the following articles: Brick or block: Building or facing (solid, hollow or perforated), except enameled. Brick, lire. Brick or block : Paving, shale or fire clay Brick : Salt glazed, when shipped in same manner as building or facing brick. Ground clay, ground shale or ground fire clay. Blocks or tile: Hollow building or condensing. Blocks: Silo, radial-chimney and segment. Conduits: Clay or shale, not lined. Slabs: Clay or shale, not enameled, not roofing or ornamental, loaded loose in cars, when shipped in the same manner aa building or facing brick. Tile: Hollow building or fireproof ing. </seg>
            <seg id="p408">408 SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The Commission is also of the opinon and so finds trom the record that rates on common brick for distances not in excess of 150 miles in carloads shall not exceed eighty per cent of the scale set forth in the order below and for the purposes of this order common brick shall be defined as follows: Brick, not hollow, made from low grade clay or ■bale or clay and shale not including any grades, firsts, seconds, thirds or culls of enameled, face, front, paving, Are or refractory brick, and when not braced, wedged or packed for protection against rubbing, breaking or chipping. I Our previous order dated April 20, 1923, on Application No. 6069 luld be amended to provide for a minimum of 60,000 pounds on all icles in the brick list except common brick, provision for the pro - tion of the loading capacity of cars smaller than 60,000 pounds and 'vision that common brick enjoying the lower rate must be loaded full marked capacity of the car. The Commission is also of the opinion and so finds from the record that Nebraska carriers, parties to this investigation, should publish Joint rates of movement of brick intrastate at not more than one cent per hundred pounds above the scale set forth in the order below. This arbitrary on joint hauls should not be applied on movements between the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company and the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company and between the Union Pacific Railroad company and the St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island Railway company, which, for purposes of this order, are to be considered aa ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Qulncy Railroad company, the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway com - pany, the Missouri Pacific Railroad Corporation in Nebraska, the Union Pacific Railroad company, the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company, the St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island Railway company and the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company be and the same are hereby ordered and directed to publish, effective July 16, 1923, the following scale of carload rates for the transportation of brick and related articles defined in the next paragraph below between points within the state of Nebraska in single line hauls: </seg>

(SEAL) RESOLUTION NO. 84 In the Matter of the Relative Grain Rates in Their Relation to Cross - country Competition. SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION AND ORDER BY THE COMMISSION Order in this case was entered December 8, 1923, effective not later than February 1, 1924, making certain localized adjustments of grain rates to the Omaha primary market. Petition has been filed by the Nebraska Farmers Cooperative Grain &amp; Live Stock State asso - ciation, J. W. ShorthiU secretary, on behalf of members of that asso - ciation at Foley, Richland, David City, Ulysses and Garrison, asking that the order be suspended and the case reopened tor additional testi - mony, looking to different adjustments in some respect in the territory covered by the order and enlargement of the territory to be adjusted. It is alleged that many of the rates in the territory between Lincoln and Grand Island and between the main line of the Union Pacific on the north and the main line of the Burlington between Lincoln and Grand Island on the south bear a different relationship to each other than they bore in 1917 and prior thereto, and that as nearly as prac - ticable the old relationship should be restored. Certain suggestions as a basis for future consideration are appended as exhibits In support of the motion. After careful consideration, the Commission is unanimously of the opinion that if the relationship existing prior to 1917 is to be made the measure of proper readjustment, such readjustment cannot rightly be confined to the territory suggested in the motion, but should be extended. It is also the opinion of the Commission that such an extensive investigation cannot profitably be carried on informally. </seg>
            <seg id="p414">414 The adjustments made in the Commission's order related to rather acute situations.

            <seg id="p415">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 415 OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE. Commissioner: tThis is an investigation ordered by the Commission on its own ion ai the result of a number of informal complaints relative to rate adjustment cross-country between closely competing origin its in grain traffic. Maladjustments were alleged. On June 21, 1923, the Commission dirceted certain changes in grain rates in eastern Nebraska, the net effect of which was redac - tions ranging from three to thirty per cent. No hearing was held in the matter, the order being the result of verbal agreements between the carriers and the Commission following extensive conferences. The reductions ordered by the Commission were voluntarily filed for inter - state application to all markets, the rates to which are made on a pro - portional over Omaha. The rates published under the order were specific rates. They were, however, based upon the Nebraska distance scale. It was recognized at the time that some maladjustments would result, which would have to be ironed out later. This proceeding is for that purpose. There were presented for consideration unusual spreads in intrastate rates between competing cross-country points and competing points in line. All were carefully discussed. Not all the points which fell under discussion were represented by shippers. The notice sent out was general, but did not specify particular points. The solution of the various matters presented for consideration was not difficult excepting the rather complicated situation centering at David City. Three railroads serve that town, the North Western being the short-line into Omaha and making the rate. The converg - ing lines create grain shipping points located rather closely cross - country and in keen competition. The solution here proposed by the Union Pacific would have reduced the rates at two stations and would have increased them at twelve to fifteen stations. The solution pro - posed by the Nebraska Farmers Elevator association would have in - creased no rates and would have reduced six towns. It was generally agreed, however, that the adjustments should be as much localized as possible and the suggesters of both of these plans were attempting to do that. This investigation was in no sense an effort to measure the reasonableness of grain rates. Its sole purpose was to eliminate rates spreads in the same localities working to the serious disadvantage of competing origin points. This limitation was not challenged by any who sat in the hearing. </seg>
            <seg id="p416">416 Carriers and shippers agreed that any adjustment to eliminate these irritating localized conditions must be applied interstate as well a* intrastate in order to eliminate confusion. It is our understanding that the carriers will, on their own motion, file with the Interstate Commerce Commission corresponding adjustments interstate to meet our conclusions on the intrastate rates. t After full consideration of the testimony it is the conclusion of Commission, and it so finds, that the following adjustments will inate all serious difficulties which were presented at this in - gation: ON THE NORTH WESTERN: Increase Octavia and David City rates on wheat one-half cent and reduce rates on wheat at Miller-ton and Surprise one-half cent per hundred weight. Make corresponding adjustments in coarse grain rates. ON THE UNION PACIFIC: Increase the wheat rate at David City one-half cent and at Rich- land and Yutan one cent. Reduce the rate at Foley one-half cent. Make corresponding adjustments in coarse grain rates. ON THE ROCK ISLAM): Reduce the rates on wheat and coarse grain at College View one-half cent per hundred weight. ON THK BURLINGTON: Increase the rates per hundred weight on wheat one-half cent at David City, Garrison. Ulysses and increase the rate at Yutan one cent. Reduce the rate on wheat at Bellwood and Malnio one cent and at Cheneys and College View one-half cent. Make cor - responding adjustments in coarse grain rates. It may be of incidental interest that the adjustments here found by us, measured by the 1922 business of the stations involved, would have the equivalent effect of increasing rates one-half cent per hun - dred weight on 2,031 carloads and of reducing rates in like amount on 1,737 carloads. There was discussed Informally certain alleged maladjustments between competing stations on business destined to interstate markets in southeastern Nebraska, chief among them being Dunbar and Tur - lington on the Burlington, Talmage and Tangeman and Union and Nehawka on the Missouri Pacific on shipments to St. Louis. Repre - sentatives of these roads said that the maladjustments would be taken care of voluntarily by them. The disparities arose by reason of meet - ing short-line competition between Omaha and St. Louis. </seg>

            <seg id="p420">420 Heard before Morrissey, C. I.', Rose, Aldrich, Day and Good J. J.; Troup, District Judge. tThe Southern Nebraska Power Company, a public ultiity cor - ation, made application to the State Railway Commission for hority to issue additional stock of the corporation based upon value of its property. In addition to its physical property the lpany listed a water-power right, upon which it asked permission Issue stock. At the conclusion of the hearing the Railway Com - ision made findings as to the value of the physical property, and ) found the value of the water-power right to be $50,000. Upon se findings the Railway Commission issued an order granting the poration authority to issue additional stock. From the order of Railway Commission the corporation has appealed. No objection is made by appellant to the action of the Commis - sion in fixing the value of the physical property. It contends, how - ever, that the value of the water-power right as found by the Com - mission is entirely too low, and urges that under the evidence the water-power right should have been fixed at not less than $100,000. The attorney general in behalf of the state, appearing in the case for the first time, has filed a brief in which he contends: First, that appellant's water-power right is a franchise, and that under the pro - visions of section 676, Comp. St. 1922, the Railway Commission Is prohibited from authorizing the issuance of any stock by a public utility corporation, based on the value of its franchise, and that therefore the Railway Commission erred in permitting the corpor - ation to issue stock to the amount of $50,000 based on the value of the water-power right; and, second, that, should the court hold that the water-power right was not a franchise, then under the record the Railway Commission's finding as to the value of the water-power right is correct and amply sustained by the evidence. Section 676, Comp. St. 1922, provides, in substance, that public tility corporations organized under the law of this state may not issue ock of the corporation without first obtaining authority of the State ailway Commission. The section further provides: "The Commis - on shall have no power to authorize the capitalization of any fran - llse to be a corporation, or to authorize the capitalization of any ranchise, or the right to own, operate, or enjoy any franchise whatso - ver, in excess of the amount (exclusive of any tax or annual charge) dually paid to the state or to a political subdivision thereof as the onsideration for the grant of such franchise or right." tit appears that in 187S, and long before the state undertook to ulate or control the use of the waters in the streams of the state, bert Guthrie conceived the idea of operating a grist-mill by means </seg>
            <seg id="p421">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 421 of water-power obtained from water in the Republican river. A little south and west of the city of Superior the Republican river, flowing from the west, makes a sharp turn to the south, and, returning north, forms what might be termed an "ox-bow." The distance across the bow is about three miles. In consideration of Guthrie's erecting the mill, a number of property owners donated to him a right of way 100 feet wide for the mill-race. The right of way thus acquired, together with a few purchases, and the use of the bed of a dry creek, to which no objection was made, gave him a strip of land 100 feet wide, extend - ing from the intake of the mill-race to where the tail-race returned the water to the river. Guthrie built a diversion dam in the river, constructed his mill-race and tail-race, erected a mill, and operated it for a number of years. At a later period the rights of Guthrie were acquired by Guthrie Brothers, a corporation, and in 1915 appellant was incorporated and succeeded to the rights of Guthrie Brothers. Still later the appellant acquired by purchase an electric light plant, having a franchise from the city of Superior, and also built a trans - mission line to a neighboring city. The power used to operate these plants was largely obtained from water taken from the river. During all the years since its first construction, the water-power from the river has been used, except occasionally when some parts of the equipment were undergoing repair. In recent years the prin - cipal use of the water-power has been to generate electrical power for the operation of public utilities. The appellant having succeeded to the water-power rights of Uuthrie, the question is presented whether his water-power rights, in any proper sense, can be said to rest upon a franchise. Generally speaking, a franchise is a grant of a special privilege by public authority, the main element of which is the permission to do some - thing which otherwise the grantee would not have the right to do. Under the facts presented by this record, it does not occur to us that the water-power right acquired by Guthrie was a "franchise" as that word is usually understood. By virtue of the fact of his ownership of the right of way connecting with the river, he was a riparian owner, and, as such, had the right to divert the water tor power purposes. This right was not bestowed upon him as a special privilege by the state or any of its municipal subdivisions, but was a common-law right applicable to every riparian owner alike. The only persons who had a right to complain of Guthrie's use of the water were other riparian owner whose rights were thereby infringed upon. Such was the law of the state before the enactments declaring the waters in the streams of the state to be dedicated to the use of the people. In Kearney Water A Electric Powers Co. v. Alfalfa Irrigation District, 97 Neb. 139, the history of our legislation upon the subject of water-rights is reviewed at considerable length, and it was held </seg>
            <seg id="p422">422 Et, prior to the enactment of the irrigation statute (Laws 1889, ch. , our law provided no method of making a claim of appropriation water except the construction of works to divert it, and applying water so diverted to a beneficial use. It was also held that there i no distinction between the use of water for irrigation or for rer purposes, and that appropriations which were completed under act of 187 7 became vested rights and could not be taken for any pose without just compensation. It may not be amiss to say here that the law of 1S7T simply to corporations operating canals for irrigation purposes, the right to acquire a right of way by condemnation.. In Clark v. ( iiinbridxi- &amp; Araphoe Irrigation A Improvement Co., 45 Neb. 798, it was held that E common law doctrine with respect to the rights of riparain owners vails in this state, except as it may be modified by statute. It was o held that the right of a riparian owner, as such, is a property ht, and, when vested, cannot be taken away or impaired without compensation. In Crawford Co. v. Hathaway, 67 N'el&gt;. lit, it was held that the common-law rule with respect to the rights of private riparian proprietors has been a part of the law of this stat. since the organization of the stat overnment. I Whatever may be said of a wat le the legislature declared the us te to be dedicated to the people r-power right acquired sinc&lt; of water in the streams ol M being a franchise, a qn&lt; which seems unnecessary to determine, we are quite clear that, under the facts of this record, the water-power right cannot be considered a franchise. Appellant's water-power right is a valuable property right, and it was proper for the Railway Commission to authorize tli&lt; poration to issue sotck based upon its value. Upon the question of the value of the water-power right there as a wide diversity of opinion among the expert witnesses who te&gt;ti - ied upon that subject. One of them placed the value at something rer $200,000. The testimony of the experts was highly technical. nd based upon theories which resulted in a saving by the use of ater-power over the use of internal combustion engines. One of the xperts, whose valuation was the lowest, advanced certain theories pon which his calculation was based, and which resulted in a valu - tion of $85,000; but, he further testified: "Realizing that my costs ere estimated and more or less theoretical. I concluded hy saying that believed a normal value of the water-right to be $5u.0ou. I say this ecause I realize that something might happen to the water-plant. 'he dam might wash out again as it has just done; a great many lings might happen which would cause this company to generate its lower on the oil basis; and. in view of all those contingencies through- </seg>
            <seg id="p423">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 423 out the years, I have considered the $50,000 more reasonable and con ■Mil !&gt;■ than the $85,000." From an examination of the expert testimony, we are unable to say it affirmatively appears that the finding and order of the Railway Commission were clearly wrong. The rule is now well established that, in direct appeals to this court from orders of the State Railway Commission, such orders will not be reversed unless it affirmatively appears from the record that they are clearly wrong. Byington v. Chicago, R. I. &amp; P. R. Co., !&lt;fi Neb. 584. To sum up, we conclude that the water-power right of appellant does not rest upon a franchise; that it was proper for the Railway Commission to authorize appellant to issue stock of the corporation based upon the value of the water-power right; and that the fixing of the value of the water-power right at $50,000 is fully sustained by the evidence.

            <seg id="p426">426 pass over or under any turnpike, road, canal, water course or other way." tThis section is part of the Revised Statutes of 1866 and of rse antedates most irrigation works in this state. It seems to cover Iges of all kinds. Section 5406 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922 pro Tides as follows: "It is hereby made the duty of every person, company or corporation operating a railroad in the State of Nebraska to so construct all bridges on its line of railway that every bridge over a running stream in this state shall have an openins below liith water line whose area is sufficient to allow the free and unob - structed passage of the water of such running stream at extreme high water stage: Provided, if in the case of any given bridge satisfactory proof be made to tae State Hallway Cmnnii ...sion that the dimensions herein prescribed are greater than are Deo to permit the unimpeded passage of the water under such bridge at high water, the Commission may by order authorize the ron - struction of such bridge with dimensions less than those pre - scribed in this section." It was enacted in lull after most irrigation projects now existing in Nebraska had been undertaken. The purpose of the section to be to require railroad companies to provide adequate waterwa over streams that are likely to overflow. It does not appear to applv to irrigation ditches, which, generally speaking, are not the cause damaging overflows. The language of the section separates tin bridges over running streams from bridges in general and over running streams within the jurisdiction of the Commission. This view of the purpose and meaning of the statute is borne out not only by the verbiage of the section itself, but also by other sections the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska lor 1922. Section 2739 provid&gt;-.- that bridges over streams on roads on county lines shall be paid for equally by the two counties concerned. The Supreme Court has ™n - sidered several times the meaning of the last mentioned section. In County of Dorigt* v. County of Saunilcrs, To Neb. 442. it said (pp. 452-453) "The word 'stream' which occurs in the statute has two &lt;li&gt; - tinct uses. The first and most important meaning of this word is 'A course of running water, a river, rivulet, or brook.' Century Dictionary. It is there also stated in connection with that definition, 'All rivers and brooks are streams and have currents.' Another and more technical use of the word 'stream' is to distinguish the volume of water of a river, rivulet or b ook from the banks and bed; thus, as suggested in the former opinion herein, a river is said to consist of three parts: the bed, the bank and the stream. *****It was, we think, rather intended that the statute should apply to bridges over rivers and, also, to bridges over smaller water courses that did not carry a sufficient volume of water to cause them to be denominated rivers. In this statute, </seg>
            <seg id="p427">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 427 then, the legislature used the word in the sense of 'a course of running water, a river, rivulet or brook'; and if, as is well point- 1 out in the former opinion, the bank of a stream used in this sense is as much a part of the stream itself as is the bed or the volume of water which it carries, then the stream divides counties, since the boundary line lies in a part of the river." ilso Ifcxlgt- County v. Saunders County, 77 Neb. 787. Kirk v. Stal&lt;- Hoard of Irrigation, 90 Neb. 627. Ditwson v. Phelps County, :&lt;4 Neb. \\2. Stan- «-\ i-H. v. Kiclioff &lt;-t al., 98 Neb. 739. WVstern I'acitic li&gt;. Co. v. V«MH I'aHnc Co., 151 Fed. 376. In all of these cases the word "stream" is treated as describ - ing a natural water course and in most of them as synonymous with water courst In* section 8427, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, it is provided that the department of public works shall measure the quan - tity of water flowing in the several streams and make a record thereof for use in the consideration of applications for water appropriations. The section, of course, would be meaningless if irrigation ditches were included within the significance of the word "stream." Other sec- of the statutes relating to irrigation and water rights point to i li&gt;- same conclusion. The distinction between a "stream" and an "irrigation ditch" or "canal" seems to be fully determined by sections &gt; and Ml 3. They read as follows: "Any canal constructed for the purpose of developing water power, or any other useful purpose, and from which water can ba taken for irrigation, is hereby declared to be an 'irrigation canal' and all laws relating to irrigation canals shall be deemed applicable thereto." "The water appropriated from a river or stream shall not be turned or permitted to run into the waters or channel of any other river or stream than that from which it is taken or appro - priated, unless such stream exceeds in width one hundred feet, in which event not more than seventy-five per cent of the regular flow shall be taken." A consideration of the authorities cited above compels the con - lusion that the word "stream," as used in section 5406, does not include irrigation ditches or canals, that the Railway Commission is without jurisdiction to determine the sizes of the openings to be left beneath bridges over such ditches or canals, and that the complain - ant referred to in your letter will have to resort to the courts for the protection of his rights. It should not be understood that the Railway Commission is without jurisdiction where a bridge crosses such a ditch or canal if </seg>
            <seg id="p428">428 the service of the carrier to the public i8 affected. In such case the Railway Commission has jurisdiction to protect the service. Very truly yours, O. S. Spillman, Attorney General. By Hugh LaMaster, Assistant Attorney General. Lincoln, July 3, 1923 rrs. Babcock &amp; Babcock, Attorneys at Law, Loup City, Nebraska. Gentlemen: Your favor of June 14, addressed to the attorney general, has been handed to me for answer. You propound this question: Have the former officers of a cor - poration, the charter of which has expired by lapse of time, power to continue such corporation in existence? The answer must be in the negative. The officers of such a cor - poration have only the power specified in the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922 under section 444 et seq. This does not preclude maintenance of actions by or against de facto corporations arising by estoppel, as covered by section 478. Under section 477 it is provided r.hat corporations whose charters expired by their own limitation, or by the voluntary act of the stock - holders, may continue to act for the purpose of closing their business, but for no other purpose. In discussing this subject the court of appeals of New York in Sturges v. VanderbUt, 73 N. Y. 3 84 says: "It is further claimed, that, until a corporation is declared dissolved by judicial decree, creditors may proceed against it by its corporate name, and that it remains in esse until formally ad - judged dissolved. All the cases cited in support of this proposi - tion relate to a dissolution in consequence of insolvency or non - user or mis-user of the corporate franchises, or some other cause of forfeiture. In such cases, it is well-settled that the dissolution does not take effect until judicially declared. But the principle upon which that class of cases rests is not applicable to a dissolu - tion by expiration of the charter. The dissolution in such a case </seg>
            <seg id="p429">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 429 is declared by the act of the Legislature itself. The limited time of existence has expired and no judicial determination of that fact is requisite. The corporation is de facto dead." The ease above quoted from cites the case of Mamma v. Potomac Co. 8 Pet. 281; 8 Law Ed. 945, in which it is said: "A corporation, by the very terms and nature of its political existence, Is subject to dissolution by a surrender of its corporate franchises, and by a forfeiture of them for wilful misuser and non-user. Every creditor must be presumed to understand the nature and incidents of such a body politic, and to contract with reference to them. And it would be a doctrine new in the law that the existence of a private contract of the corporation should force upon it a perpetuity of existence contrary to public policy, and the nature and objects of its charter."

Spillman, Attorney General. By Hugh LaMaster, Assistant Attorney General. Lincoln, November 27, 1923. Honorable Thome A. Browne, Commissioner, Nebraska State Railway Commission Office. Dear Sir Answering your inquiry of the 26th inst. as to the legality of a declaration of dividends by the directors of the Wehn Telephone com - pany, the company having no net earnings during the period for which the dividends were declared, I have this to say: The report of Mr. Devoe, accountant, shows that dividends were declared but were not paid and were carried on the books of the com - pany under accounts payable. Under the circumstances the action of the board in declaring dividends was illegal. As pointed out in my memorandum, heretofore filed in this connection, dividends are to be declared and paid only out of net profits. The declaration of dividends </seg>
            <seg id="p430">430 is a necessary corporate act preceding the actual payment and in the absence of anything to the contrary it must be presumed that the dividends declared will be immediately paid in cash. In the case of Ik-niii.* v. Mk Hfg. Co. (R. I.) 3)1 Atl. Rep. 129 the court said: "The declaration of a dividend is one of the most important acts of a corporation. It is an assignment of its property. It clearly implies corporate action to that effect. It is action of such a character that it ought to appear upon the books of the company." kThe declaration has the legal effect of appropriating the net fits of the concern to the payment of the dividends declared and ites a liability on the part of the corporation to pay them as lared. Cook on Corporations (Tth Ed.), Sec. 542, states the law as follows: "The debt which the corporation owes its stockholders, when a dividend is declared and the day of payment arrives, is one which may be collected by the usual action at law. A suit to compel the declaration of a dividend must be in equity; but wkm the dividend is not paid after it has been regularly declared the stockholder's action is at Law, ami he may sue in a»uni|»il for the amount due him l&gt;y the resolution declaring the dividend; under certain circumstances lie may tile a bill in equity for an accounting." See also Thompson on Corp. L'nd Ed. Se It will be observed that under Section 5 of Article X of the Con - itution of Nebraska no dividends shall be declared or distributed xcept out of net earnings. It is clear that the declaration of a divi - end is as much prohibited under the terms of the Constitution as le payment. The directors of the Wehn Telephone company had no ght to increase the liabilities of the company by declaring dividends nd thus lay the company liable to suits and to receivership. Divi - ends that are not declared out of net earnings, but impair the capital I the corporation, may be enjoined. 14 C. J. p. 829, "Corporations" ec. 1235. tl recommend that the company be directed to rescind the un - ful action and if it will not do so that a suit be brought to compel h action and to correct the books and accounts of the concern and Din the payment of such illegally declared dividends. Very truly yours. O. S. Spillman, Attorney General. By Hugh LaMaster, Assistant Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p431">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 431 Lincoln, December 1, 1923. Mr. John E. Curtiss. Secretary Nebraska State Railway Commission, (litio Dear Sir Your favor of November 28, enclosing a communication from Honorable Clarence A. Davis, requesting an opinion on questions aris - ing under the stock and bonds act, has been given attention. These questions are presented: 1. Should a foreign corporation conducting a public utility in this state apply to the State Railway Commission prior to issuing stocks and to issuing bonds due more than twelve months after date, for permission therefor, such proposed securities not to be sold in Nebraska? I. Must each particular issue be the subject of a separate pro - ceeding before the Commission? The first question should be answered in the affirmative. The purpose of the statute is twofold; the protection of the public service and the protection of the investing public. This is well expressed in the case of lVopIc ex rt-1. v. Stevens, 197 N. Y. 1, thus: "We undersatnd that the paramount purpose of the enact - ment of the Public Service Commissions law was the protection and enforcement of the rights of the public. Public service cor - porations have been granted valuable franchises to enable them to serve the public, and they are deemed to have undertaken to render to the public the service for which they were incor - porated upon receiving a proper and reasonable compensation therefor. It is the duty of railroad corporations not only to main - tain their equipment, tracks and roadbed in good order, but also to operate their railroads with safety to the public and afford such service as will supply the reasonable demands of the public. For a generation or more the public has been frequently imposed upon by the issues of stocks and bonds of public service corpor - ations for improper purposes without actual consideration there - for by company officers seeking to enrich themselves at the ex - pense of innocent and confiding investors. One of the legislative purposes in the enactment of this statute was to correct this evil by enabling the commission to prevent the issue of such stocks and bonds, if upon investigation of the facts it is found that they were not for the purposes of the corporation enumerated by the statute and reasonably required therefor. "We do not think the legislation alluded to was designed to make the commissioners the financial managers of the corpor - ation, or that it empowered them to substitute their judgment </seg>
            <seg id="p432">432 for that of the board of directors or stockholders of the cor - poration as to the wisdom of a transaction but that it was de - signed to make the commissioners the guardians of the public by enabling them to prevent the issue of stock and bonds for other than the statutory purposes; these purposes we have already enumerated in quoting the statute, the last being for the dis - charge or lawful refunding of its obligations." kSee also People ex re*, v. Wlllcox. 207 N. Y. 86; 45 L. R. A. (N. 629. Consolidation of R. L. &amp; R. R. Co. etc. 8 P. S. C. N. Y. (1st t.) 112. Prior to the amendments of the stock and bonds act made at last session of the legislature the first part of the first section read; "A common carrier or public service corporation organized and incorporated or hereafter incorporated under or by virtue of the laws of the state of Nebraska, may issue****." (That gave the foreign corporation a distinct advantage orer s domestic corporation in that it was not required to apply to the mmission for permission to issue securities whereas the domestic •poration was compelled to secure authority before issuing secur - m. In some instances citizens of Nebraska formed corporations der the laws of other states for the specific purpose of avoiding ! necessity of securing permission of the State Railway Commission issue securities. The legislature, at the last session, amended the it part of the first section of the stock and bonds act by making read thus; "A common carrier or public service corporation doing busi - ness in the state of Nebraska may issue stock*****" etc. Considering the old law, the mischief to be corrected and the ew law, it is apparent that the legislature intended that all common arriers and public service corporations (except those required by ederal law to secure permission of the Interstate Commerce Com - mission) should be controlled in their security issues by the State ailway Commission. No reference is made to the place of sale of securities. Under the "Blue Sky" law (Comp. Stat. 1922, Sec. 8116), hich is designed primarily for the protection of investors, the sale t securities, issued by foreign corporations in Nebraska, is controlled tut as the protection of the public service is one of the objects, and erhaps the principal object, of the stock and bonds act the place of sale of the securities is not material. This must have been the intent f the legislature in view of the provisions of Sec. 1 of Art. 12 of the onstitution prohibiting preferential treatment of foreign corporations. L While there is no provision of law requiring a separate hearing each iwue of stock it seems clear that a blanket order should not </seg>
            <seg id="p433">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 433 be entered; that is, (or example, an order should not authorize security issues (or the purchase of property generally. Before an issue is authorized the use to which the proceeds of the sale of such securities is to be applied should be ascertained with reasonable deflniteness. The Commission may, doubtless, exercise its discretion as to how far it will go into details. Vanderblue and Burgess, in their work on Railroads, say, as to the approval of securities by the Interstate Commerce Commission, (p. 367): "The approval, therefore, looks not only at the character of the security — whether share of stock, mortgage bond, note, or debenture — but the purpose and intended use of the proceeds." Broadly speaking each issue of securities should be the subject of a separate proceeding. Very truly yours, O. S. Splllman, Attorney General. By Hugh LaMaster, Assistant Attorney General. </seg>
