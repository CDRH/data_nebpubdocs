            <seg id="p009">Introductory In presenting this, the fifteenth biennial report of the State Department Labor, it has been the purpose to show in as compact and simple form as practicable, the statistical material gathered and compiled by the department. The best thought of the department has been given to the compilation and it oped that the data contained herein will prove of interest to those con - led in the subject matter treated upon. The value of statistics when faithfully gathered and carefully compiled ■ ought to be, manifest to all, yet there are those who object to giving information sought, and there are others who look upon all statistical work as failing to make a good return for the money expended in the col- on, corrrpilation and publication. Statistics become a permanent record tie growth and expansion along material lines in the state or county where gathered. They Cell the story of the growth and progress as it can be told in no other way. The real growth and development of a state along material lines can always be traced through statistics. It should be borne in mind that the statistics are not for today, although they have a great present value, but for .■. More than this a state's social life, whether of advancement nee, is shown by the statistics. By the study of the statistics the jdent of social and political economy watches for and detects the decad - ce. seeks for the causes and suggests the remedy. und statesman, the wise politician, studies not alone the statis - own state or county, but those of other states and other lands, may see wherein we are weak and they are strong; that he may point out our weak places and know how to strengthen them; that he may better see how we may extend our possibilities, widen our influence. By statistics he learns what other states and other countries and other people want, that we can produce. Careful, diligent and faithful students of sta - tistic- have made the United States the greatest commercial nation of the world. Xo state excels Nebraska in variety and extensiver.ess of its natural resources and possibilities, and no state has developed more rapidly in the last fifty years, nor still presents greater opportunities, The people will demand more statistical information as the state grows older and the work of the state statistical department must be made more accurate and comprehensive. This is evidenced by the fact that copies of all bulletins issued by the State Department of Labor during the present biennium have been sent to all localities of the state, and many localities outside of the state. </seg>

The accomplishment of all this work falls upon one chief deputy com - missioner of labor and one stenographer. If the State Department of Labor is to perform the many duties imposed upon it by the statutes there should be sufficient appropriation for mainten - ance and office and outside help so that a reasonable degree of efficiency and performance of the many duties may be realized. The following- appropriations for salaries and expenses of the depart - ment is recommended for the coming biennium. SALARIES puty Commissioner, per year, $2,100, for biennium $ 4,200 It will be noted that the recommendation above is for a force of five people. A force of two people, with a limited amount of extra help, have conducted the work of the department for several bienniums. But the de - partment has not been able to perform all the duties assigned to it during any one of the past bienniums owing to lack of sufficient help. Many requests have come to the department for inspection and visitations out in the state which have not been complied with owing to the impossibility of finding time from other and more urgent requests. There are 7,240 organized school districts in the state, with a large per cent of the districts having school houses or buildings used for school pur - poses, which demand an inspection by the State Department of Labor. Only a small per cent of these inspections have been made during the present biennium owing to lack of sufficient help in the department. The State Department of Labor has the inspection of moving picture theaters in the state, and most every hamlet has one or more of these, while the larger cities have several. There are upwards of two thousand manufacturing plants in the many Male factory inspector, per year, $1,200, for biennium 2,400 Female factory inspector per year, $1,080, for biennium 2,160 Stenographer and librarian, per year, $1,080. for biennium 2,160 Stenographer and statistician, per year, $1,080, for biennium 2,160 Total for two years $13,080 EXPENSES Traveling expenses, per year, $1,500, for biennium $ 3,000 General maintenance, postage, office supplies, cuts, telephone, tele- graph, printing, etc., $4,000, for biennium 8,000 Total for two years $11,000 Fotal appropriation for two years $24,080 </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 FIFTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT cities and towns of the state, which the statute directs the department to inspect as to work accidents, the probable cause and suggestion of remedies. The inspection of public halls and meeting places, work rooms and offices is a part of the work assigned to the department. These institutions are located in all sections of the state. Controversies involving the laborer and the employer arise in all sec- tions of the state, and the department is called upon to offer its good offices in an amicable solution. The female labor law and the child labor law cause many requests to visit remote sections of the state. The personal calls at the department from laborers and employers ant the general public in quest of information on various subjects of personal concern, added to the volume of requests for information made through the mail, demands the attention of the chief deputy commissioner the greatet part of the time. The conduct of the free employment bureau demands the time and a tention of one person the greater portion of the biennium. The farmer and the employers of labor generally, have come to realize and appreciat the purpose of a free employment bureau and the use made of the has grown in the past two years to a degree most flattering and serv A labor bureau, if it is to meet its purpose as interpreted by the commissioner and chief deputy, is to be of service to the labor employer and the general public. Whatever the department may d gest which will tend to help solve the problems of the worker its list of duties and purposes. The result of this belief and prc the present biennium has been that the department has awMai many vexing problems, each one of a different degree of impc magnitude, each calling for different methods of solution. T of the department has grown and broadened until most ever been presented in consultation or correspondence To facilitate the work of the State Department of Labor and a same time provide an avenue for advertising the unexcelled r Nebraska, the creation of a separate and distinct statistical departrr seems to be justified both from an economic and efficiency standpoint. Un form and fixed rules and regulations for gathering statistics could be pro - mulgated and the new department could be in the nature of a statistical and publicity bureau. Nebraska is far behind its sister states in provisions for good wholesome statistical advertising. Nebraska is not sufficiently ad- vertising her natural resources, her splendid opportunities for homeseekers opportunities for investment and for manufacturing industries. Publicity what Nebraska needs. The State Department of Labor collected and turned into the state treasury $1,200 in fees during the biennium. These fees were collected from employment agncies under the employment agency regulation law and represent the first fees turned into the state treasury by the State Department of Labor since its creation. </seg>
            <seg id="p013">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 13 he he m :in pr ■f nt K A resume of the work and accomplishments of the deparment would not complete without an expression of appreciation of the cooperation and ipfulness of Governor John H. Morehead, the Commissioner of Labor ilk ■t, who has not only been patient and deliberate in action, but interested 1 aggressive in an effort to find the just and equitable solution of every &gt;blem coming to the department for solution. Too often executive heads departments select assistants and then dismiss all interest and concern its work and needs. Governor Morehead has at all times taken a keen erest in the work of the department and has assisted with valuable sug - stions and cooperation. Respectfully submitted, FRANK M. COFFEY, Chief Deputy Commissioner. </seg>
            <seg id="p014">The Gathering of Statistics The State Department of Labor has had the best of cooperation from th railway and express companies in gathering statistical matter. An equal degree of cooperation has been experienced from about fifty per cent of the manufacturers of the state. Employers operating under and subject to the compensation law have been untiring in their cooperation in gathering statistics regarding the law's operation and application. But the State De - partment of Labor has experienced more or less difficulty in assembling data from other sources. The State Department of Labor is presumed to be a statistical depart ment, though the obsolete methods and lack of cooperation make the gat ering of statistics a difficult task. Statistics regarding the industries state, manufacturing, railway traffic, railway accidents to passengers am employes and patrons and tresspassers, vital statistics, mortgage statistics banking statistics, building and loan statistics, agricultural statistic labor statistics, statistics regarding number of corporations and their cap stock and nature of business, the actual valuation and the assessed va of the different items upon which taxes are paid, the amount pended in road improvement, statistics regarding the number tricts and the number of school children attending school and not in school — in fact statistics of every nature which tend growth and progress of the state, are assembled, each line of state government. The State Department of Labor, said tical department, must collect and tabulate these the best it car they are gladly furnished — other times with strings attach other times refused. It is a well-settled fact that the voluntary blank systerr uv statistics is unsatisfactory in results. Prejudice, neglect, indifference an ignorance combine to make the percentage of returns very meager in coir parison with the number of schedules asking for information scattered broadcast throughout the state through the mails. The first three causes named might possibly be overcome to a considerable degree, if the statute required that information asked for by the State Department of Labor should be furnished, and provided a penalty for neglect or refusal to do so, but such is not the case only in one or two instances. This unfortunate position in which the State Department of Labor finds itself greatly retards its efficiency. Practically no one is under any obliga - tion whatever to furnish information of any character, and to be reminded of it, often times in language more forcible than elegant, if any reply is made, is not an infrequent experience. Assurances honestly given and </seg>

            <seg id="p016">16 FIFTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT of Labor from enforcing the law after its adoption by the legislature. Application was made to the district court of Lancaster county for an injunction. The attorney general, acting for the Commissioner of Labor, demurred, and Judge Cosgrave of the Lancaster district court, sustained the demurrer. The case was appealed by the Omaha agencies to the su - preme court. The supreme court sustained the decision of the district court and dismissed the case. The agencies then applied to the district court of Douglas county for an order enjoining the county attorney of Douglas county and the Com - missioner of Labor or his chief deputy from enforcing the law. Judge Redick of the Douglas county district court issued the order. The in - junction was later set aside by Judge Redick upon the application of the Commissioner of Labor. Complaints were filed in the courts of Douglas county against four Omaha agencies, charging violations of the law. During the month of October, 1916, the law was held to be unconstitutional and void by Judge Sears. Employment agencies conducted for hire specialize. While one agency will cater to tradesmen and unskilled laborers, another agency will cater to those seeking clerical employment. The agency specializing in the trades and unskilled labor field lists the wants of employers and then for a fee gives the informa:ion to applicants. The bonding and reference agencies, specializing clerical employments, such as stenographers, salt- - men, accountants, etc., first exact a fee from the applicant, common! called a registration fee, and then promises to place the applicant. If th agency succeeds in finding employment for the applicant, and the applicar accepts, the applicant must assign not less than 2."&gt; per cent of the tir&gt; month's wages to the agency as a fee for securing the employment- thi 25 per cent of the first month's wages being in addition to the registratio fee, and sometimes the per cent charged the applicant is as high as fi per cent — measured generally by just what the traffic will bear. If the applicant secures an advance in wages during a specified time the agency demands an additional per -cent from the applicant. If the applicant fails to pay the fee the agency brings suit and garnishees the employer. This procedure generally results in the applicants submitting to. the demands of the agency or the loss of employment. The registration fee charged the applicant in the first instance is retained by the agency in each case, regardless of the fact as to whether employment is furnished or not. Greater knowledge of the abuses of private fee agencies and a growing belief that the work of employment bureaus is a public function is evi - dent in the 1915 legislation on private employment bureaus in a large number of the states. In most of the states governmental regulation is, provided, while in some of the states private fee agencies have been out - lawed as an economic waste. The legislature of California provided for the establishment of free public employment offices in four designated cities authorizing also others to be established if the commissioner of labor should deem it necessary, and $50,000 was appropriated to pay the expense of this undertaking. </seg>
            <seg id="p017">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 17 In Idaho public employment offices are to be established in municipali having a population of 5,000 and upward, and smaller municipalities if deemed advisable, in which fees are to be charged for the mainte- iance and expense. The amount of the fee is fixed at $1.00 for jobs utside the municipality and 50 cents for those inside. If no separate iffu-e is established one is to be opened in the office of the police judge or ustice of the peace of the locality. Private employment offices charging fees from persons seeking employment are forbidden. This prohibition i(H&gt;&gt; not interfere with the operation of teachers' agencies or with bureaus naintainetl by benevolent and charitable institutions. In Illinois an act establishes a general advisory board of five persons to appointed by the Governor. It is the duty of this board to promote the ?fficiency of public employment offices which are to be established in cities }f prescribed population. The Iowa law provides for the establishment of a state bureau of em - ployment at the Capitol where a registry of unemployed persons is to be maintained, copies of which are to be sent to the clerks of all towns of 500 more population at least once a month but not oftener than once a week. The Michigan statute was amended by naming three additional cities i which free employment offices are to be maintained and providing that ilaried managers must give all their time to the duties of their appoint- ment. The New Jersey law provides for the establisment of public employment offices in the various municipalities of the state, the location and number to &gt;e determined by the commissioner of labor. The Oklahoma law provides for the establishment of free public offices several municipalities of the state. The Pennsylvania law creates a central public employment office at Har - sburg and directs the commissioner of labor to establish additional offices i the various municipalities of the state. The law of the Philippine Islands creates public employment offices ich permits a fee to be charged employers. The amount to be fixed by the director of labor and approved by the secretary of commerce and police. The law of Idaho forbids the taking of any fees from persons seeking employment. The law of Washington forbids fees directly or indirectly from anyone seeking employment or from anyone in his behalf. The Alaska law is practically the same as the Washington law inasmuch as it provides an annual license fee of $500 from agencies collecting fees from employes. The California law increased the license fee from *50 to $100 in cities of the second class and above, and from $25 to $50 in cities of the third and fourth class. No registration fee is to be charged and no fee whatever col - lected unless a bona fide order for employment was received from the agency. The Connecticut law provides that if employment is not furnished the ap - plicant immediately following the payment of the fee, the fee must be forth - with returned to the applicant. </seg>
            <seg id="p018">18 FIFTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT The law of Maine was amended by permitting a fee of $1.00. This f to be returned if no job is secured. The Oregron law fixes the scale of license fee according to the populatior of the locality and requires an approved bond. The law also establishes a scale of fees to be charged applicants for employment varying- with salary or wage. The Pennsylvania law was amended providing; a license fee of $50 and r quiring: a bond in the amount of $1,000. The Commissioner of Labor issut rules for the governing of such offices. Contracts used by agencn'.- a schedules of fees to be chared by them must be filed with the commis and must be approved.

These workers, unable to speak the Eng - ish language, are usually anxious to secure work, and are told that a job can be secured upon the payment of a certain amount of money to some superintendent or foreman or gang boss. Later these unfortunate workers A-ould be notified that it would be necessary for them to continue paying rertain amount weekly or monthly in order to hold their job. It has been found a very difficult task to secure relief or render as - stance to these workers. Being unable to speak the English language so that they can be understood, as well as being unable to comprehend md understand American ways and means and methods, they remain the mercy of the interpreter who helped fleece them in the first instance. Under the provisions of Section 8728 of the Revised Statutes of Ne - braska for the year 1913, whoever gives, offers or promises to an agent. ploye or servant, any gift or gratuity whatever, without the knowledge consent of the principal, employer or master of such agent with intent influence his action in relation to his principal's, employer's or master's or an agent, employe or servant who, without the knowledge r consent of his principal, employer or master, requests or accepts a gift r gratuity or a promise to make a gift to do an act beneficial to himself, inder an agreement or with an understanding that he shall act in any particular manner to his principal's, employer's or master's business; or an agent, employe or servant, who, being authorized to procure materials, supplies or other articles either by purchase or contract for his prin - cipal, employer or master, or to employ service or labor for his principal, employer or master, receives directly or indirectly, for himself or for another, a commission, discount or bonus from the person who makes such sale or contract, or furnishes such materials, supplies or other articles, or from a person who renders such service or labor; and any person who gives or offers such an agent, employe or servant such commission, dis - count or bonus shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine of not less than ten dollars nor more than five hundred dollars, or by such fine and by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than one year. Under the provisions of the section above quoted one who gives or offers to give or promises to give any gift or gratuity to an agent, employe or servant is equally guilty of a misdemeanor with the agent, employe or servant who requests or accepts a gift or gratuity or a promise to </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 FIFTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT make or to do an act beneficial to himself. The worker who testifies against an agent, employe or servant subjects himself to the same pun - ishment provided by the statute for the punishment of the agent, employe or servant. Of course the prosecuting attorney could decline to file a complaint against the worker who testified, but such refusal would not be binding or give full assurance that such complaint would not be filed. Such action by the prosecuting attorney would be against public policy and repugnant to law enforcement, the authority to acquit or absolve from violations of the statute being vested in courts and juries. The worker finds himself up against practically the same situation when he undertakes to maintain a civil action for the return of the money so paid. Under the provisions of the statute he would be equally guilty with the party against whom action was brought, and the courts would evidently hold that he was a particep criminis and could not recover. It would seem that justice would demand that the statute be so amended that relief may be secured for these foreign born workers who fall a prey to the cunning of their countrymen and the greed of some agents and servants of some employers. Pay Day The State Department of Labor ha&lt; I I upor during the biennium to assist in the settlement worker and the employer as regards pay for labc difficulty has been to determine just when mor formed. As the State Department of Labor understands tr as interpreted by the inferior courts which have p: I" pay day is not fixed except by the terms of the contr and then rather vaguely. The ordinary rule followed in accepting employment is to agr* upon the nature of the employment and the amount of the wages. Paj day is not mentioned. It is simply taken for granted that the employ is to receive pay for labor performed. The term of the employment not very often mentioned or agreed upon. The employer at some period the term of employment decides that he has no further use for the em - ploye and dispenses with his services, and informs the employe that he will receive his pay at some future date, being the regular pay day of the employer. Then the conditions are reversed and the employe decides that he does not care to continue in the employment of his employer and quits and asks for his pay. He is advised by the employer that he must wait until the regular pay day. These conditions work untold hardships, not only upon the employe and- the employer, but upon society as well. The migratory worker ac - cepts employment, continues in such employment for a short time, as is common with such workers, and quits his job. In keeping with the finan- </seg>
            <seg id="p021">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 21 cial rating of the average migratory worker he is without funds. If he is to wait until some future date for the regular pay day of the em - ployer he must find other employment or become a charge upon society, or procure funds for his keep in ways not sanctioned by rules of civil conduct. Some sort of rule should be laid down by the legislature which will meet these conditions. The employer should be protected against quitting without due notice, and the employe should be able to extract himself from a term of employment which only binds himself, the employer being able to set aside the contract of employment at will. Of course where he period of employment is a part of the contract the employe and the mployer should be bound by its provisions as to all features, including the fixing of pay day. But where the period of employment is uncertain and not fixed, there should be some rule adopted whereby many of the vexing controversies between employer and employe may be removed. Another feature of contracts of employment and the fixing of pay may be explained by citing a concrete example, of which this departmnt had many during the biennium. A young lady had been employed about eighteen months in Chicago as an expert hat trimmer. A Ne- aska milliner induced this young lady to give up her Chicago employ - &gt;nt and come to Nebraska, offering $25.00 per week and from nineteen twenty-one weeks' employment. The young lady accepted the offer I tame to Nebraska. She worked for thirteen weeks. Her work was isfactory. the employer complimenting the young lady frequently upon class of her productions. But business was poor, the demand for hats ; up to the desires of the milliner, and at the end of thirteen weeks mietl the young lady that she was without employment in his establishment. The season for hat trimming was practically over and the young lady had to wait for the coming of the next hat trimming season, losing about two months' employment. No adequate remedy is provided by the statutes for cases like this one. An investigation practically de - veloped the fact to be in this case that the employer sought the termin- ation of the contract for the reason that he had found a local hat trimmer who would take the place for $10 per week. Female Labor Law The legislature of 1899 passed a law having for its purpose the regulation and limiting the hours of employment of females in manufac - turing, mechanical, and mercantile establishments, hotels and restaurants. The hours were limited to not more than ten in any one day, and in no case should employment be before the hour of 6 a. m. nor after 10 p. m. The legislature of 1913 amended the female labor law limiting the hours of employment to not more than nine in any one day nor more than fifty-four in any one week. Laundries, offices and public service corpor - ations were added to the list of employments to which the law applied. Public service corporations were permitted to employ females between the hours of 10 p. m. and 6 a. m., but the hours were limited to eight. </seg>
            <seg id="p022">22 FIFTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT The 1915 session of the legislature amended the female labor law by Striking OUt the original section as to hours of employment and sub - stituted the following: "In metropolitan cities, in cities of the first class having more than 40,000 and less than 100,000 inhabitants, in cities of the first class having less than 40,000 and more than 25,000 inhabitants, in cities of the first class having more than 5,000 and less than 25,000 inhabitants, no female shall be employed in any manufacturing, mechanical or mercantile estab - lishment, laundry, hotel or restaurant, office, or by any public service corporation in this state more than nine hours during any one day or more than fifty-four hours in one week. The hours of each day may be so arranged as to permit the employment of such female at any time from six o'clock a. m. to ten o'clock p. m., but in no case shall such employ - ment exceed nine hours in any one day; provided, however, such females shall not be employed between the hours of 10 p. m. and 6 a. m.: Provided further, public service corporations may employ females between the hours of 10 p. m. and 6 a. m." The female labor law is a most difficult law to enforce at best, but as amended by the 1915 session of the legislature it has been more difficult than under its former application and provisions. The female employed in a laundry located in a town of less than five thousand population feels that she is entitled to the same consideration and protection from the standpoint of state law as the female employed in a laundry' located in a city of more than five thousand population. Likewise the employer and owner of a laundry operated in a city of more than five thousand population feels that he is entitled to employ females the same number of hours that the employer and owner of a laundry operated in a city of less than five thousand population. Owners of hotels, restaurants, mercantile establishments ami laundries complain that if public service corporations are permitted to employ females between the hours of 10 p. m. and 6 a. m. they in turn should have the same privilege. The female employed by the public service corpor - ation can see no reason why she should not have the same consideration as to hours as the female employed in the other employments mentioned in the law. The greatest difficulty in the enforcement of the female labor law has been the relation of master and servant. The women need the employ - ment and accept upon the terms laid down by the employer. Later the female seeks relief from the excess of hours and sends an unsigned letter to the Deputy Commissioner of Labor, or calls over the telephone and refuses to give her name, or she has some friend call the attention of the State Department of Labor to conditions as regards hours in the -place of her employment. When an inspector out of the State Depart - ment of labor calls, each female employe denies that the hours of em - ployment exceed nine, fearing that if she becomes in any way connected with a complaint that she will lose her place of employment. Conviction cannot be had unless the female employe will testify. </seg>

            <seg id="p024">24 FIFTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT It has been a physical impossibility for the Deputy Commissioner of Labor to visit the larger number of these districts. The legislature did not see fit to appropriate money for the employment of inspectors or sufficient office help so that the larger number of these requests for in - spection could be met. The State Department of Labor has refused to approve a cloth tobog - gan, a perpendicular ladder, a wooden stairway or a rope fire escape for the equipment of school houses or buildings used for school purposes. If a building is to be equipped with a fire escape it should be a fire es - cape in fact, and should furnish a safe and an adequate means of exit. The State Department of Labor has consistently refused to approve fire escape equipment for school houses or buildings used for school purposes with other than an iron stairway reaching from the place of exit to the ground with railings on each side of the stairway and double railings on each landing, or in lieu of an iron stairway a metal chute 01* a spiral. The fire escape law should be so amended that factories, workshops, mercantile establishments and office buildings two or more stories high should be equipped with fire escapes regardless of the number of em - ployes or occupants. The law as it now stands does not apply to the buildings above referred to unless the building is more than two stones high or houses a certain number of employes or occupants. The life and limb of the individual employe who happens to be employed in a building two or more stories high is just as sacred and should have the same degree of protection from society as if working in the same build- a ing with a specified number of other employes Under the provisions of the law creating the hot* equipment of hotels, tenement houses and apartments and rooming houses with fire escapes is under that commission. The rules laid down by the law requiring the equipment of these buildings are neither definite nor adequate. The hotel commission law should be so amended that the larger degree of protection may be given to guests and occupants of these buiW - ings. It doesn't seem in keeping with economic administration or the best of service that the statute should designate various buildings which should be equipped with fire escapes, and then split the administration of the provisions of the statute between two departments of state. The admin - istration of laws regarding fire escape equipment should be confined to one state department, to the end that economic administration may prevail and that the best results may be obtained. Loan Sharks The 1913 session of the legislature passed a law for the regulation of short time loan agencies. The purpose of the law was not only to regulate, but to inspect the records and ascertain the volume of business of each agency; supervise the methods of renewals and probable cause for the </seg>
            <seg id="p025">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 25 loan. The interest rate was limited, and certain penalties were provided for failure to comply with its provisions. The short time loan agents banded tog-ether and carried the matter to the supreme court where it was held unconstitutional by that court. A bill having for its purpose the same object was introduced in the 1915 session of the legislature, and after a rather rough voyage through the various committees and sessions of the house, was passed and later signed by Governor John H. Morehead. Under the provisions of the latter bill the interest rate was limited, the security available plainly act forth, the records of the agencies to be inspected by representatives of the state for which the agency must pay the per diem, in fact a general supervision of the short time loan business as conducted by each agency was provided. The license fee was fixed by the law and each agency be - fore being granted a license must execute a good and sufficient bond as t guarantee that it would faithfully discharge all of the obligation imposed upon it by the provisions of the law. The loan agents again sought to set aside the law and appealed the first case under the law to the supreme court. The supreme court sustained the second loan shark bill. The second bill differed from the first one, in that it permits a greater rate of interest than set forth in the statute for farm loans, loans on city property and chattel loans made upon other than musical instruments, diamonds, household goods, watches, revolvers, salaries, etc. But the interest rate is limited to not more than one per cent, plus filing fees and examination fees. No loan is to run more than six months. Eleven licenses were granted under the loan shark bill for the license vear of 1916. Enforced idleness, sickness, business reverses, and misfortune in its various forms come to the worker, and others as well, unsolicited and unforseen. These people become the prey of the loan shark, and once in the clutches of the loan shark the borrower is fortunate if he ever loosens their scissor-hold. These were the conditions before the state assumed the supervision of loan sharks and the business conducted by loan sharks. The law passed by the legislature of 1915 and sustained by the su - preme court has resulted in saving many dollars to the workers of the state, and has made it possible for one in need of immediate financial assistance to get that assistance when needed, pay a fixed fee and dis - charge the obligation during his natural life time. Factory Inspection The Nebraska factory inspection law lays down certain rules and regulations having for their purpose the protection of employes against work accidents, unsanitary work rooms, in fact to protect the employe against all the hazards of factory employment. The Commissioner of Labor is directed to make inspections as when needed, and is empowered to appoint the necessary number of inspectors so that factory inspection </seg>
            <seg id="p026">26 FIFTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT may be in keeping with the needs of proper state supervision. But each succeeding legislature has failed to make an appropriation for the pay of such inspectors. As a result the Deputy Commissioner of Labor must make all the inspections which are made, and these inspections in addi - tion to the many duties assigned to him by the statutes. During: the biennium just coming to a close the State Department of Labor has made 2,064 inspections. A report of each inspection is on file in the department. The legislature of 1915 made a limited appropriation of money which could be used for factory inspection, and this money was used in inspecting Omaha factories and work rooms. The larger number of the 2,064 inspections made during the present biennium were made in Omaha and Lincoln, it being impossible for the Deputy Commissioner of more and more persons are beinjr employed in fact The toll of human life and limb being exacted Esuch startling proportions as to be a serious menace to ou . That it is so recognized is evidenced by the increasin made to protect life and health, and the marked tendency legal responsibility for accidents. ■Investigation into the causes of this drain upon our national vitality proved conclusively that a very large percentage of industrial acci - s can be avoided by the adoption of proper preventive measures. From the nature of the case it is plain that, although the employer and om - £oye must work together to attain the desired end of reducing accidents a minimum, the initiative should come from the employer. Ignorance can never be entirely overcome in many instances, and it is certainly not the duty of the employer to undertake the general education of his employes. He can do much, however, to prevent ignorance from con - tributing to the causing of accidents in his plants. He can see to it that Labor to inspect factories and work rooms located in many of the othe sections of the state. If the factory inspection law is to be of any degTee of benefit to th workers of Nebraska, and in like manner a benefit to employer who operate factories and work rooms, in minimizing work ace. dents and the bad effects and results of unsanitary work rooms, a&lt;lt Ie appropriations must be made so that factory inspection may be mad jntemplated by the statute. There should be two employes added to the list in the State Departmer of Labor, who could be used in factory inspection work the whole of th year period. In the very nature of things one of these inspectors shoul be a woman. I The increasing danger of life and limb involved in the pursuit of ii rial occupations has become so great that the necessity of inin ything feasible to keep it within the narrowest possible limits i rly evident. Wp are living in a constructive era. Articles are bein ufactured in greater numbers and variety than iver before in th d's history. More and more machinery is constantly being used. mm </seg>
            <seg id="p027">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 27 10 man is allowed to handle or work about any machinery unless be is lualified to do so. He can prevent a workman familiar with one job, and pecially trained for it, being allowed to undertake other work in which lis ignorance is apt to cause injury to himself, if not to others. He can xerci.se discrimination in the assignment of work, so as to avoid putting a ■nan of slow-moving mind and heavy body on a job for which quickness of -nental action and physical agility are necessary. He can formulate rules showing how work should be done to assure argest degree of safety possible, and he can furnish copies of these to all his employes, printed in as many languages as may be neces- iry to convey their meaning to all concerned. He can also make prominent splay of caution signs warning his men what not to do in order to avoid nger. It is astonishing how ignorant many workmen are, not only of •chanical arrangements in use in factories, but of palpably dangerous ?ral conditions and the necessity of exercising ordinary care to avoid a hurt. It is equally astonishing how large a part native curiosity plays ausing of accidents. \11 of this applies with equal force to carelessness, which, of course, never be wholly eradicated from human nature. At the same time suits of both ignorance and carelessness can be largely diminished leans suggested, if they are consistently and persistenly applied. ying that "'familiarity breeds contempt" nowhere finds greater in the carelessness arising from daily proximity to machinery or nvolving risk. A man working in a factory day after day comes run unconsciously a number of chances of accident which he ild take pains to avoid, except that he has become so used to his en - mment that he hardly gives it a thought. evil effects of this condition of mind can be held to the lowest rgely through the action of the employer, in furnishing rules and ns. and also in supplying, in many instances, simple protective nts which may serve chiefly to call attention to the existence Such an arrangement may not prevent the careless workman a ?ver going to the danger spot, but its presence there is apt to reawaken nd to the danger every time he approaches, with the result that he e careful than he otherwise would be to avoid an accident. The wearing of unsuitable clothing is a matter which is largely within the control of the employer, and to which he should give his serious atten - tion. A ragged sleeve, a loose coat, or a ■flowing cravat can do incalculable harm if caught in any part of moving machinery. Insistence that proper clothing shall be worn by all employes will prevent many an accident This is particularly essential in the case of female employes, who should not be permitted to wear flowing sleeves or aprons with long strings, or to have their clothing made of such light material that it will be easily affected by draughts or will swish about of its own accord as its wearer moves. Women, moreover, should never be allowed to work with their hair loose. So many cases are on record where girls have been scalped by having their </seg>
            <seg id="p028">FIFTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT 28 hair caught in machinery that the importance of this suggestion can well be appreciated. Poor lighting of buildings and rooms used for factory operations and of passageways, especially in basements where shafting and belting are located, is responsible, directly or indirectly, for many accidents. This is a condition which should not be allowed to exist where it can possibly be improved. Whenever new construction is undertaken, factories should be built with especial regard to the matter of good lighting. Where existing conditions do not admit of constructive improvement, the liberal use of white paint or the frequent application of the whitewash brush will be of much remedial value, as white reflecting wall surfaces do a great deal to help diffusion of what light is available, whether natural cr artificial. Where natural light is not obtainable artificial should be liberally provided. q Accidents due to defects of machinery and structures cannot be entirely prevented, for things will wear out or give way unexpectedly, but they can be reduced very much by frequent inspection and prompt repairs when - ever such are necessary. In the first place, the best of machines, equip - ment and material should be purchased. In the long run this will be found cheapest as well as safest. To insure as good service as possible, no part of the machinery should ever be overloaded. Frequent and close inspec - tions of the machinery should be made of all parts, to discover quickly any signs of wear or any possible original defects or weakness which may not have been apparent at first sight. Certain essentials of machinery, too, re - quire frequent renewal of periodical treatment, and inspections will show when these are needed. In some classes of factories, also, the platforms, runways, stairways, etc., are apt to be temporary, and these deteriorate so rapidly that they require the most careful watching. The same is true ir the case of plants in which the nature of the material or operations quickh destroys the equipment or affects it to the extent of rendering it unsafe One of the factory conditions most conducive to accidents is insufficient room. Accidents are far more frequent in crowded factories than in those which are roomy. Especially should there be plenty of room around ma - chinery notoriously dangerous, and around vats, pans, etc., containing dan - gerous material such as is used in chemical and many other works. There should be a broad passageway between such danger spots when they are located in rows, as is often the case. Cleanliness is another important essential for a well regulated factory. If tools, waste material, etc., are allowed to litter the floor, there is always danger of an employe tripping over them and being injured by the fall. or being thereby precipitated into a dangerous spot which otherwise he would have avoided. There should be order in the disposition of tools when not in use. The practice of throwing them into the first inviting place, as under moving machinery and in aisles, has often been followed by disaster. When floors must necessarily be slippery, firm footing should be secured to employes by means of sand or suitable mats. It is perhaps needless to lay stress on the advisability of an abundant supply of good air in an industrial plant. Not only is this necessary from </seg>
            <seg id="p029">STATE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR 29 the standpoint of the employe's health, but it is essential to the prevention of accidents. Workmen who labor in a foul atmosphere cannot help thereby suffering a loss of the alertness, both mental and physical, which would be an invaluable aid to them in avoiding accident or lessening its ill results. The loss is similar, and in only less degree, to that caused by the fatigue due to overwork which statistics have proved to be a fruitful cause of accidents. Every effort should be made by systems of ventilation as well as by methods of construction to ensure the presence of plenty of pure air in all places where industrial operations are carried on. All machinery is in a greater or less degree dangerous. So long as machinery is used, which will be to the end of time, accidents will occur in connection with it. Many accidents can be attributed to carelessness on the part of the operatives which might have been averted had their minds been closely on their work. Many accidents are made possible be - cause dangerous parts of the machinery are exposed. The employer is the custodian of the person of his employe during such time as the latter is engaged in his service, and it is the employer's duty to protect his em - ploye from injury as far as possible and by all reasonable means. It must be taken for granted that the employe will become careless at times. No one is infallible. But if the machinery and surroundings are made safe the number of accidents due' to carelessness can be very materially dimin - ished. The best time to provide safeguards for a machine is while the machine is building. It can be done then at less cost and with less effort, and a great deal of the unguarded machinery now turned out would be guarded ■y its manufacturers if the buyers insisted upon it. When machinery is not guarded, it falls upon the user to make it safe by patented devices or by home-made safeguards. The former cannot always be obtained, nor are they always needed, but the case is rare where some home-made guard annot be devised which will be thoroughly effective. The protector may, ir may not, be an artistically finished piece of work. That is a matter of taste and is not material. The important thing is, does the protector pro - tect? If it does, the requirement is filled. There is a great difference of opinion among men as to that which is safe and that which is dangerous. In one shop all dangerous machinery, such as protruding set screws on revolving shafting, exposed cog gears, dead ends of shafting, openings in floors, belts running through floors, engine fly wheels, saws, planers, stairways, elevator shafts, etc., are guard - ed. Guards are provided because it is considered unsafe to be without them. In another shop there is no protection for any of the features men - tioned. Speak to the proprietor or manager about it and he will laugh at you, or more likely he will become indignant and assert that there is nothing in connection with those parts that is dangerous; that he ought to know, for he has run the place for years under present conditions and never has had a serious accident. He will admit, of course, that if a man got his coat caught on a set screw and was whirled around a shaft, it would then be dangerous. He </seg>
            <seg id="p030">30 FIFTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT i will l..i :m n Wl * r owr ror i i r I ;l i 1C&lt; o will admit that if a man walked into an unguarded elevator opening fell off an unguarded platform, it would be bad for the man. He agree, with you that anything, in connection with which an accident occur, was dangerous, but it is hard to convince him that in his own pi where the same conditions exist, there is anything dangerous about it, : ply because he has been "lucky" and never had an accident. He also tell you that a man has no business to go near this or that plao machine; that if he does so and meets with an accident, it is his fault. He will further tell you that a man is a fool to get injured f a cause that is exposed and constantly staring him in the face, foi knows the danger is there and should know enough to avoid it. If certain things are dangerous in one factory, then it stands t son that the same things are dangerous to another factory. If it it ticable and proper to guard them in one factory, then it is practicab proper to guard them in other factories. Take, for instance, the c rc men. He either does not furnish the guard is not insistent on their use. One employer a to his employe and takes reasonable precaut injury. The other does not, and dangero main, a standing invitation to injury and death. What is said regarding the rip saw applies to all othe chinery. If there is a willingness and a desire, on the f sible, to provide safeguards for everything of a dangerou proper safeguards will be forthcoming. That is all there is And it is important for selfish as well as humanitariar manufacturer should both provide safeguards and insist upon their Me. Th employe, as a rule, will not hesitate to sue him for .u any injury, and the tendency is to hold the employer responsible of safeguards as well as the provision of them. Humanitarian as well as economic considerations demand of eacr ployer, and for that matter of every one in his employ, persistent effort for the prevention of accidents and of injuries to persons. To accomplish this purpose is the finest work that can be done in the field of safety and sanitation. It is clear, nevertheless, that absolute immunity from a dental injuries cannot be expected; it is therefore of next importar or rip saw, one of the most dangerous pieces of machinery, and prc one of the most difficult to guard and keep guarded, after (guards been provided. It has been stated time and time again that it is imp' able to use guards on a rip saw. You will be told that guards h:i\( placed on the saws, but that thr men will not use them, anil that take them off. Yet in some shops every rip saw is provided with a and it has been proved that the guard daet not retanl the work am it is not an inconvenience to the operator. If this is the case in one shop, why not in another shop'.' The qu resolves itself into this: In one case, sruarcis are provided and the or manager of the shop insists on their being used for the protection operators; in the other case, the owner is indifferent to the safety </seg>

Whatever the cause, it is obvious that an injured ould receive prompt and effective attention, sometimes to prevent hou •quences such as blood poisoning, and sometimes to save even n&gt; work during the winter months. Lack of employment turned many to the navy. One New York city recruiting station reported that enlistments were 6,091 as against 3,625 luring the winter months of 1914. Rough approximations -regarding unemployment were made during the winter of 1914-1915. The central trades and labor council of Rochester, X. Y., estimated that there were 40,000 unemployed in that city during the winter season. The business agent of the central labor union of Toledo ife itself, as when the injured person bleeds excessively. f. Unemployment No one can tell just exactly how much unemployment there is in Nebraska each winter season. England and Germany make official cen- suses of unemployment which show how many persons are idle from nonth to month and from season to season throughout the year and in .vhich industries and occupations this idleness occurs, but neither the riiiTal government nor any state gathers similar information in this *ountry. Nevertheless we know that there is unemployment in Nebraska each .vinter. and the amount of involuntary idleness in the large cities of the I'nited States each winter reaches alarming proportions. Among: the first to give warning of unemployment in winter months ire the charitable and relief societies. The United Charities of Brooklyn ii its report for 1915 said the leading cause of dependency had been iiiemployment. The Boston overseers of the poor for the same year re- sorted that the averatre number of men looking for jobs had increased over 100 per cent as compared with the previous year, and that jobs for these nen had decreased during the .same period 50 per cent. The Minneapolis public employment exchange which placed 12,141 persons during the last 4x months of 1914 could place but 7,517 persons during the same period n 1914-191."). An investigation made by charitable institutions of Cleve- land for the same period showed that in 300 industrial establishments there were l&amp;JtSl fewer jobs than at the same time the previous year, and :hat practically 24 per cent of the wage earners of that city were put out </seg>
            <seg id="p032">32 FIFTEENTH BIENNIAL REPORT estimated the unemployed in that city during the winter season at 15,000. According to information tabulated by the federal department of labor unemployment varied among building trades workers from 33 per cent in New York to 75 per cent in Washington, D. C; among machinists from 50 per cent in Dayton to 78 per cent in Birmingham; among painters from 30 per cent in Rochester to 80 per cent in New York city; among car - penters from 30 per cent in Dayton to 90 per cent in Newark, N. J.; and among steam fitters from 35 per cent in Louisville to 99 per cent in New York city. The table following is compiled from the Massachusetts bureau of statistics.

In New York the figures for the same periods were 32.7 per cent and 24.2 per cent res- pectively. After a study of the organized trades, both men's and women's, a house-to-house canvass of the working class districts, and a canvass of the lodging houses, the committee appointed by the mayor of St. Louis reported from 75,000 to 80,000 unemployed during the winter months of 1914-1915.

Wage studies show that the slender savings of workingmen are inade - quate to meet the burden of sickness. One study has revealed that sickness is a very serious disabling condition in 75 per cent of the families under the care of the New York Charity Organization Society, while the United States Immigration Commission of 1909 states that sickness was the ap - parent cause of poverty in 38 per cent of the 31,481 charity cases studied. </seg>

A minimum wage fixed by statute, which would require legisla v actment to change, would probably be the maximum wage, and w allow for the protection of either the employe or the employer as changed cost of living and changed cost of production. The minimum wage law, as it has been known in recent discussion, and as it is usually understood in Great Britain. A and New Zealand, does not refer to a law in which is fixed below which no worker may be employed, although such laws ence in most of the Australasian states.

This method was introduced in South Au Queensland in 1908, in Tasmania in 1911 made in more recent legislation. A second method of fixing the minimum wa New Zealand since 1894. The compulsory arbitration law of N&lt; adopted primarily for the prevention of strik upon the arbitration court the authority to fix t\ ment, including the minimum wage to be paid, in tl it. This method was adopted by New South Wales in 1901, We V tralia in 1902, and the Commonwealth of Australia in 1904. In the states which have the industrial arbitration systen agreements of employers and employes under certain conditions registered and have the force of awards. They are enforceablt ligainst the parties and such other organizations and persons as signify the n tention to be bound by agreement. In some of the states these industrial agreements have become very important. Thus, at the end of September, 1914, 89 such agreements were in force in New South Wales and 84 in Western Australia. An important difference between the wages board and the compulsory arbitration method is that the wages board itself takes the initiative in determining wages and conditions of employment for the industry, with - out waiting for a dispute to arise, while under the compulsory arbitration •ion l.a.- been ] are set up for each trs various processes and occu </seg>

Another important difference is in the fact wages boards consist of persons representing both employers and with an impartial chairman, while the arbitration court usually lember only, who may, however, be assisted by experts \ recent tendency in Australia is to combine the most successful fea - ; of the two systems. Thus, Victoria since 1903 and South Australia courts of industrial appeals, which may review the boards. Queensland since 1912 has had an in- urt to which appeals may be made. In Tasmania appeal from sard determination may be made to the supreme court. On the I. New South Wales introduced in 1908 wages boards i or "in- iards") in connection with its system of compulsory arbitration, Zealand in the same year added conciliation councils, whose ;'unc- what similar to those of the wages boards in the laws providing for the fixing of a minimum wage courts of arbitration, the laws specifying a wage below ker may be employed, which have already been re- ;o, are important as limiting the wages for children or apprentices, al reason for their enactment was to prevent the employment of n or apprentices without any wages or at a premium, as was often nder the pretense of teaching the trade. All of the Australasian except Western Australia now have such laws. During the period since the enactment of these laws, the industries ie various states have maintained a steady growth and it is reported that the systems of fixing minimum wages have not been found a check upon this growth. uch reports as are available from the Australasian States do not se any tendency, after the many years during which the laws have been in effect, to make the minimum also the maximum rate. A New Zealand report discussing this question in 1910 showed that in trades where minimum rates had been fixed by the arbitration court, employing some 7,400 workers, 62 per cent were receiving in excess of the minimum established by the court. The investigation covered the four principal cities of the colony. In Auckland 63 per cent received in excess of the minimum; in Wellington, 64 per cent; in Christchurch, 63 per cent, and in Dunedin, 56.5 per cent. In the Australasian States the wage rates fixed by the wages boards and industrial courts are not for unskilled and low-grade workers only, but for all occupations, skilled as well as unskilled. The "living wage" is ac - cepted as the basis for laborers, but above this many rates are fixed, for the several occupations coming under the jurisdiction of a board, accord- </seg>

Germany many of the labor organizations are modeled after the plan of organization. Some are of a purely beneficial character surance features, paying sick and funeral benefits, and are assisted ouraged by manufacturing cities, strikes seldom occur, and the rela - ?tween employers and employes are generally friendly.

Trades unions have existed in Holland since 1866, but they are few in mber, and some of them are of a purely social character.

These wily record evidences of debt, and equally entitled to consideration in mmary of total indebtedness; but compared with each other, the are relatively insignificant in number and amount. There question as to the paramount value of the statistics of mortgages, illy no question as to the desirability of obtaining both, but a definite the resources of the State Department of Labor has rendered it im- collate and publish statistics regarding judgment debts. Mortgages naturally group themselves into two classes, those in which real estate is made the security for debt, and those in which personal prop- erty is so pledged; real estate is also classified as lands and lots, and this distinction is, perhaps, not less important than the former. The primary jbdivision of the subject is accordingly threefold, embracing mortgages on inds, on lots and on chattels; the first including all lands not subdivided as property; the second, all lots, blocks and subdivisions in and about and towns; the third, all kinds of personal property. In addition to this classification it would be interesting to know just : per cent of the mortgages represent borrowed money and just what it represent deferred payments of 'purchase money. The motive in wo cases, and the situation implied, are so dissimilar as to justify and • a separation of them, solely on the basis of their essential differences. mplies at least the need of money, though it may be solely for l ss ventures, and suggests possible extremities; the other indicates the sion of money to invest and a legitimate expectation of more. It would be additionally interesting to penetrate somewhat deeper into the motives of mortgages, of both classes; but the records afford no clue as to what proportion of the money borrowed on land, for instance, is used in the purchase of other lands, or for buildings, or other betterements of the estate; or what proportion of the loans made on town lots is restored to the lot in the form of improvements; or what amounts are borrowed for specu - lation or business purposes, as distinguished from loans made by reason of misfortune or financial embarrassment. The mortgages also for balances of purchase money may be, and in cities and towns frequently are, made by speculators in real estate rather than by bona fide holders for use. The de - tails of motive, however, cannot be discerned from any study of the public records. It is usually possible to find internal or other evidence of the fact, if a mortgage is given for deferred payment; but beyond that no classifica - tion based on the nature of the transaction is feasible. </seg>

That there is ber of manufacturing establishments in Nebraska is comn It is estimated that only about 60 per cent or 70 per cent o h turing establishments made a report of their activities for the year 1915 to the State Department of Labor. In tabulating the reports received bv v the State Department of Labor no padding has been resorted to and every report which was not made in full and plainly revealed the activities of the establishment in detail is not included in the tabulations. Statistics of manufacturers are compiled primarily for the purpose of making a comparison of the magnitude of the different branches and their growth or decline. Incidentally information is given as to the character of the organization, location of establishments, size of labor force and similar subjects. When an attempt is made to derive from manufacturing statistics the actual cost of products or the profits, it should be remembered that only a </seg>

In most instances the larger part of the value of arge part of the profits, represent the value of the material has been produced by agriculture, or mining, or by other in - blishments. The best measure of the importance of different the value created as the result of the manufacturing within the industry. The value of products of a lant is best obtained by deducting the cost of the consumed from the value of the product. The figure thus ob- value added by manufacture." her statistical advantage which "value added" has over products. In combining the value of products for all in- of products produced by one establishment and used rials in another is duplicated, and the total, therefore, gives a I icagjrerated idea of the wealth created. No such duplication takes he total "value added by manufacture." \ Eicturing establishments have been assigned to the several classi- l according to their products of chief value. Details as to several luring establishments are grouped in one classification and totaled unification so that individual activities may not be divulged. Where only one report was received in any given classification, detailed ted. establishment" comprises the factories, mills, or plants which jmmon ownership, or control, and for which one set of books kept. If, however, the plants constituting an establishment, acc defined herein, are not all located within the same city, separate ire secured in order that they might be included in the statistics of In some instances separate reports are secured for different :nh which are carried on in the same establishment. The term "employe" when used in tabulating manufacturing statistics chanic. workman or laborer who works in or about a manufact- I! uring plant for hire The term "factory" or "manufacturing plant" when used in the tabula- ion of manufacturing statistics, means any mill, packing house, workshop &gt;r other establishment engaged in the conversion of goods from a less ad- vanced stage of readiness for consumption to a more advanced stage. In considering the gross amount of wages paid in any classification, and the average wage in the same classification, it must be borne in mind that the total wage and the average wage is reached by computing the figures presented in the various reports filed in the department In reporting wages the manufacturers have included all moneys paid out as wages and salaries to employes. Thus salaries paid to clerical help and heads of departments enter into the computation of total wages and aver - age wages, and to an undetermined per cent raise the total and average wages beyond the actual amount distributed as wages. It has been im- possible to separate these two items in tabulating the reports as filed. The date for the 1915 annual report on the statistics of manufacturers </seg>

This condition of f society is to do its full duty to the men and il accident.- npensation law reads as follows: "N'o policy ist liability under this article shall be made unless the he entire liability of the employer thereunder", ■ction the insurance company is bound to pay the total nployer under the provisions of the compensation law. e company collects a premium based on the theory that such ill be made. Settlement for work accidents according to the the compensation law is a part of the contract of the •ntered into by and between the employer and employe. The ployer has not kept his contract of employment unless he insists that • insurance company pay to the injured employe or his dependents all UI t forth in the compensation law. Any other settlement nefit ompany with an injured employe or his depen- nly does the employe an injustice and withholds from him his tjal rights, but is a breach of the contract of employment. As the compensation law now reads settlements may be made between parties. If they cannot agree then the controversy may be submitted Arbitration. If mutual arbitration cannot be agreed upon, then submitted to a court of equity. Under this method of it ettlement, many injured employes are at the mercy of the employers and the representatives of insurance companies. There are a large number reports on file in the department of labor which on the face of the ow that the employe has not received the full amount of benefits he is entitled. The injured employe does not understand suffi - ist what his rights are and to avoid the expense of legal advice submits often times to a settlement which is far from what the law horizes. The purpose of the compensation law is to get relief to the injured employe and his family when that relief is needed and without negotiations and litigation. The representative of the rav nsurance company too often knows the immediate need of relief of the njured employe and proceeds to negotiate and consume time before a settlement is proffered. The pressing needs of the injured employe and his family often under the present method of settlement necessitates an acceptance of terms of settlement not in accord with the provisions of the law. The employer pays a premium to the insurance company on the theory that the injured employe and his dependents will be compensated according to the provisions of the law, and that there is to be no sharp practice or shaving down of these settlements as to benefits.

An annual license fee of $60.00 was provided, and a $2,000 surety bond was required as ■ guarantee of compliance with terms of the act. Restrictions were placed on the location and provided for inspections by the Commissioner of Laboi agenc ir any on of his deputies. Receipts were to be given to applicants and tka receipts were to show all the facts and all charges, t to those seeking clerical employment. The agency spe trades and unskilled labor field list.: the wants of employers an fee gives the information to applicants. The bonding and referenc agen cies, specializing clerical employments, such as stenograph men accountants, etc., first exact a fee from the applicant, commonly called 2 ■ registration fee, and then promises to place the applicant. If the agency succeeds in finding employment for the applicant, and the applicant accepts the applicant must assign not less than 25 per cent of the first month's wages to the agency as a fee for securing the employment, this 25 pet cent of the first month's wages being in addition to the registration fee if no employment was secured, the failure to secure such employment no being the fault of the applicant. If the applicant was Mat b?yond the limits of the municipality where the agency was located and no employ ment was secured, the agency must refund the total cost of travel to thi applicant. Dividing- fees with employers was prohibited and females wcr. not to be sent to houses of bad repute in quest of employment. Omaha bonding and reference companies contested the paanga of the law in the legislature and then sought to t njoin the Commissoner of I.abo from enforcing the law after its adoption by the legislature. Applientior was made to the district court of Lancaster county for an injunction The attorney general, acting foi the Con missioner ■••. !.. &gt;or, demurred and Judge Cosgrave of the Lancaster District Court Mtatained tht de murrer.

The Idaho law authorizes county boards of commissioners to provide mergency employment for citizens of the United States who have been mx month? in the state of Idaho. Until such time as the state assumes the overhead expense of getting the jobless worker to the job through the establishment of a sufficient number of free public employment agencies in the various localities of the state, private fee agencies must be permitted, not however without regula - tion and inspection from the standpoint of the state. The state can be possesed with no greater asset than a citizenship willing to work and with the ability to work. The state in its organised capacity will have fallen short of its purpose if it permits the exploitation and commercialization of the needs and the desires of its workers for private and personal gain. In fact there can be no more serious problem presented to society to solve than that of the jobless worker, willing and able to work and who is in need of employment, being unable to find the employer who is in need of his service owing to lack of an organixed and systematic method of the distribution of the necessary information. When the jobless worker is without funds fee agencies do not solve the problem. The legislature should make reasonable provision for public employment offices in addition to the re-enactment of House Roll No. 144, with some minor changes. </seg>
            <seg id="p244">Abundant Progress A consideration of the conditions which attended the in- hMtrial affairs of the state during the year 1914 shows per- ;eptible improvement and general advancement. The usual tatistics of this department pertaining to many interests are reinforced by statistics made available by the national census, *ud both agree, as to the per cent of abundant progress that home manufacturing has made in the past few years. The ma rial progress of the state has been greater even than the most sanguine hopes of a decade ago. The same rate of development will justify the conjecture that Nebraska's position will not mly be maintained, but that in the course of some few years this great state will take rank among the most advanced manu- facturing states as to importance and variety of industrial products. So imperial are the natural and developed and un- developed resources of the state that there are within these bounds elements enough to constitute a kingdom and there is yearly a forward movement into the ranks ot industrial leader- ship. Civic progress has been equally noteworthy. Moral development has not lagged, but all the attributes of a great tate have gone hand in hand. Enterprising citizenship and manufacturing organizations of all kinds have made possible the achievements of the past, rearing many milestones of progress, and their present efforts so happily united, give most auspicious promise of still greater attainment. </seg>

That there are a greater number of estab- ishrni&gt;ntB in Nebraska which are engaged in manufacturing is common nowledpe. but for various reasons, reports were not made to this department. n tabulating the reports filed in the Department of Labor, there has been no 'adding The figures given heiein are a duplication of the reports tiled in he department. sties of manufactures art 1 compiled primarily for the purpose of show- ng the absolute ana relative magnitude of the different branches, and their irrowth or declin&lt; icidently. data is given to throw light upon the character of organization. oration of establishments, size of labor force, and similar subjects. When use is made of the data for these purposes due attention should he given to the limitation of these figures, particularly when an attempt is made to derive from them the xctual cost of the products or the profits. The value of products is not a satisfactory measure of either the abso- the relative importance of a given industry, because only a part of this &lt; actually created by the manufacturing process carried on in the indus- elf. Another part of it. and often by far the larger part, represents the alue of the materials used, which have been produced by agriculture or ninim; or by other industrial establishments. For many purposes, the beat npas'^re of the importance of different classes of industry is the value created he result of the manufacturing operations carried 011 within the Industry Phis value is obtained by deducting the cost of the materials consumed from he value of the product. The figure thus obtained is termed in the census eports "value added by manufacture." a further statistical advantage which "value added" has over cross value of products, hi combining the value of products for all industries the value of products produced by one establishment and used as materials n another is duplicated, and the total, therefore, gives a greatly exaggerated dea of the wealth created. No such duplication takes place in the total 'value added by manufacture." Manufacturing establishments have been assigned to the several classifi- cations according to the ir products of chief value. Details as to several manu - facturing establishments are grouped in one classification and totaled for that classification so that individual activities may not be divulged. Where only one report was received in any given classification, detailed data is omitted. The term "establishment" comprises the factories, mills, or plants which are under a common ownership, or control, and for which one set of books </seg>

            <seg id="p288">Comparisons The following assembled from the 1910 federal census shows the distribu - tion of the number of persons engaged in manufacturing, and the average num - ber of wage earners, but il should be borne in mind, however, that this aver - age is an estimate: The average number of persons engaged in manufacturing in 1909 was 9. 600. of whom 24. 339 were wage earners. Of the remainder. 3,686 were pro- prietors and officials and 3.944 were clerks. In order to compare the distribution of persons engaged in the manufac - turing industries in 1909 with those shown at the census of 1904. it is neces - sary to use comparative figures employed at an earlier census. The following t;tl&gt;les makes this comparison according to statistics: Comparative figures are not attainable for 1899.

This covers all industries combined, and eleven important industries individually: Persons engaged In manufacture Of the total number of persons engaged in all manufacturing industries 11.5 per cent are proprietors and officials, 11.3 per cent clerks and 7t&gt;.3 pel cent wage earners. LThe highest percentage of proprietors and officials shown for any iudivid - industry, 29.5 per cent, is for the bakeries. In this industry and also in the flour mills and grist mills, and the printing and publishing industries, the majority of the establishments are small, and the work is to a largo extent done by the proprietors or their immediate representatives, so that the pro - portion of persons engaged in these industries fall in the class of proprietor and officials, and is very much higher than any other or all combined. smallest proportion of this class is shown in the slaughter and meat king industries, due to the large number of wage earners in this industrv. bFor all industries combined 85.3 per cent of the average number of wage lers are males sixteen years of age and over .and only 9 per cent persons er the age of sixteen.

Statistics were not collected for establishments having products for the census ye*r valued at less than $500, except that reports were taken for establishments idle during a portion of the census year, or which began operations during that year, and whose products for such reason were valued at less than $500. The reports were taken for the calendar year ending December 31, 1914, wherever the system of bookkeeping permitted figures for that period to be secured, but when the fiscal year of an establishment differed from the calendar year, a report was obtained for the operations of that establishment fur its fgcal year falling most largely within the calendar year 1914. The statistics represent the establishments located within the corporate limits of the city. Tim summary for Omaha shows a consistent increase at the census of l'.'H. as compared with that for 1909. except that the number of establish - ments decreased from 432 in 1909 to 417 in 1914. This is partially accounted for by a decrease in the number of establishments in the tobacco industry from 20 in 1909 to 13 in 1914.

In this connection it should be stated that the inquiry contained in the census schedule calls for the total amount of capital, both owned and borrowed, in - vested in the business, but excludes the value of rented property, plant, or equipment which was employed in the conduct of manufacturing enterprises. The cost of materials used in 1914 was $48,278,000. as against $43,415,000 in 1909. an increase of r4.863.000. or 11.2 per cent.

As a rule, establishments included were rated by steam power and are known as steam laundries. In some, how- r. steam and electric power are combined, and in others electric power is i ployed exclusively, steam and hot water being used only for washing pur- . The figures, therefore, comprise all kinds of power laundries. liere were 74 power laundries in Nebraska in 1914, of which 32 were in nving an estimated population of 10.000 or more, as follows: Omaha. in Lincoln. 6: Grand Island. 3; Hastings, 2; and Omaha (South Side), 2.
