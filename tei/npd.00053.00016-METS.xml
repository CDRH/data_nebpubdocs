            <seg id="p005">SUMMARY 1. One of the outstanding considerations developed by these experiments concerning seed corn is the importance of udaptatioii. It is pomibie to move corn which i&gt; well adapted in one section of this State to another within the State where it will prove an almost complete failure. The degree of adapta - tion is dependent upon the degree of equilibrium l&gt;etween the plant requirements and its environmental growth condition*. The chief conflicting factors in this adjustment are: (1) Too late plant maturity for the length and character of the growing season: (2) too large inherent vegetative development with its proportional demand upon soil moisture, under conditions of moisture shortage; (3) too early maturity for the length of growing season available, which limits unnecessarily the length of time during which the plant may elalwrate and accumulate organic materials: and (4) too small inherent vegetative de - velopment with its unnecessary physical limitation upon syn - thetic and accumulative processes. Surveys of corn production in this State suggest that, in the main, corn types are l&gt;eing grown which meet the local en - vironmental conditions fairly well. Marked cases of inadapta - tion are the exception. It may l&gt;e readily observed that there is a gradual transition in the vegetative and associated e»r charac - teristics of corn which is parallel with the transition in the climatic values from one region to another. Such transition is found l&gt;oth within standard varieties and between different varieties. There i&gt; an apparent tendency among growers to. aekd corn types which are slightly too late maturing to produce the best results under their environment. The corn crop has l&gt;een found rather plastic, due to its heterozygous or complex hybrid composition, and may 1h&gt; made earlier or later, larger or smaller, thru selection. Such changes may 1h« brought about by either direct or indirect modes of selec - tion. Because of promiscuous wind pollination, selection for sjxH-itic plant characters is somewhat complicated by the segrega tioii and recombination of individual or linked characters. The progeny seldom represents as extreme a type as the plants which provide the seed. By means of ordinary selection continued thru a number of years, the type may be materially changed. </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 \ '*ka Agricultural fls/K Station, h'cm'urch It«l..l'&gt; i Many of the plant character- which arc involved in adapta- tion are not inherited singly, but commonly go in groups of associated characters. As a consequence the selection for some single specific character is frequently attended by the indirect -election of a group of characters.

Continuous -election within a commercial variety at Station during four rears for opposite extremes in the rat leaf aiva to dry plant mbatance resulted in seven "high leaf area" and nine "low leaf area" -trains of corn, in which t former, in comparison with t r, avel leaf- area per unit dry malt i irea. and five dav- later maturity.

Selection of long, slender, smooth ears results in tlie isolation of types having a smaller and earlier maturing vegetative development than where the pposite large, rough type of ear is selected. t.

Previous correlation of the germinator re-nits cir and kernel types indicates from 10 to - J&lt;&gt; reater freedom from root-rot diseases in case of th« nooth ear with horny kernels than in case of the burse rchv. deep-grained ear. It seems possible that the in ■Id secured by some investigators following selection free ear- by the irennin;!lor to-t i~. in part at least. th their prescribed preliminary selection of the it -niooth. -lender, horny ears for seed purposes. Wherever corn types are Keinjr BWli which tend to M somewhat too large and late matiirinir for their envirotunental conditions, selection of t li i - -niooth type of ear. whether ln-cause of root-rot disease con - -iderations or otherwi-e. is likely to result in increased produc - tion becaaaa of the better adaptation of plant types re])resented in thi- type of ear. These type considerations apply where the various types are selected from the same &lt;reneral variety of corn. In tlie case of seed grown under Held conditions of promis - cuous pollination, the progeny show- a tendency to come true to the ear tyj&gt;e planted. In 1921, the percentages of rough, medium, and smooth ears harvested from large rough ears, long smooth ears, and the original unselected Nebraska White Prize corn were respectively 52, 35, and 13 per cent, 16, 40, and 44 per cent, and 30. 38. and 32 per cent.

Reward, Rul. §t 8 rough and smooth ear types averaged during six yeans approxi - mately one-third as great for the ears harvested as for the ears planted. The progeny of the rough ears used in our disease study contained approximately 14 per cent more rough ears than did the progeny of the smooth ears: while on the other hand, the progeny of the smooth ears contained approximately 13 per cent more smooth ears than did the progeny of the rough ears. The progeny of the medium smooth ears was intermediate in both cases. ."&gt;. Continuous selection and testing of ears high versus cars low on the stalk during five years resulted in a spread of 23 per cent in ear height and a corresponding spread of 10 per cent in stalk height, based on the low ear selections. The low ear selec - tions yielded 3.9 per cent more grain than the high ear selec - tions, but 3.0 per cent less than the original corn. During the same period continuous selection and testing of seed ears from standing versus lodged plants resulted in a yield 10.!* per cent greater for the standing than for the lodged plants, and 2.9 per cent greater yield than was secured from the original corn. Continuously selected, during five years, ears batM erect on the stalk, as compared with drooping ear selections, yielded re - spectively -Vl ana 0.7 |mt cent less than the original corn. 6. In a six-year test, seed from the butt&gt;. tips, and middles yielded respectively 50.4. 60.4, and 60/2 bushels per acre. Little is to be gained from discarding butts or tips, aside from secur - ing a more even stand, and a better germination under certain conditions of freezing injury. In a two-year test, corn selected when fully mature and at five weekly intervals before maturity yielded respectively 64.5, 610, &lt;••"&gt;.(). NLA, t',4.o. ami &lt;',:U bushels per acre. The earlier selections required great e;uv in curing. The data suggest that the selection of slightly immature seed corn to avoid freezing injury or for any other reason would not be objectionable if it is pro|)erly cured. 7. Seed selections of high viability made during three years, from the field in September, November, and March gave respective yields of 47.0. 4S.:5. and V.K* bushels per ;i&lt; re. ;i~ com - pared with 4!&gt;. - 2 bushels for corn selected in the ordinarv man - ner at husking time. Altho the time of selecting seed corn is not a vital factor if good viability is secured, the mo:*t rational time suggested is just prior to any likelihood of fall freezing injury. Storage difficulties are reduced by permitting the coin to undergo as thoro curing as practicable in the field. S. Four methods of ear-to-row breeding have been compared. </seg>

They are: (1) Continuous ear-to-ro\v breeding: (■_') increasing a single high yielding strain in isolation; (3) increasing a II— |H mil i of several high yielding strains in i&gt;ola tion: and (4) cross ing .several high yielding strains. \ - • ----- — b — c ♦ r* During a seven-year yield test, seed derived by these four practices yielded respectively ().&lt;&gt; per cent less, 10.9 per cent les.-. •2.K par cent more, and 1.7 per cent more than the original corn. The great reduction in yield resulting from a single high yield - ing ear-to-row strain continuously grown in isolation is doubt - less due to close breeding. In a five-year test of ear-to-row strains with a different local variety. (1) continuous ear-to-row breeding resulted in 0.8 MR c«'nt lower yield than the original. (-J) increasing the eight best strains in composite under isolation yielded 4.7 per cent less than the original, and (3) crossing of ear-to-row strains yielded 1.7 per cent more than the original corn. Improvement in yield of an adapted variety thru ear-to-row breeding seems rather uncertain, and *2.6 per cent increase is the maximum attained in these experiments. In the initial ear-to - row tests, the strains which were continued in these experiments had yielded approximately M per cent more than the original corn. 1&gt;. As an average for eleven years, corn selected from an isolation seed plat in which the poorest half of the stalks were annually detasseled gave a grain yield 1.8 per cent greater than .-eed from a corresponding plat in which the best half of the stalks were kept detasseled. However, both yielded slightly le— than the original, thus indicating that no actual improvement resulted from continuous detasseling of the stalks that appeared to be inferior. 10.

The continuous natural segregation and r of elemental hybridizing characters together with the natura element of survival of the Kttest accent uated by man"- repeat*) -election of well-developed ears for seed may account in a lartr measure for the inherently high productivity of field com a now grown. 1."). More than one hundred distinct pure lines or elemental -trains have been developed in thc-&gt;c experiments by continuous self-fertilization for -even or more years. Such aelf •fertilisation gradually so purifies the chromosome composition of the plant that hoth male and female gametes of all it- progeny plants are alike and carry the same inheritance. All hybrid vigor has then been eliminated and the re-ultant pure lines have become stabi - lized in plant size and growth habit and no farther heritable re - duction occurs. In a seven-year test, eight to twelve inbred strains of Hogue's Yellow Dent corn tested for yield in com - posite produced 32 per cent as much grain as the original Hogue's Yellow Dent corn.

In a two-year te&gt;t in which seven first and second gen - eration hybrids were compared with the original corn, the iv - spective relative yields were l-2~&gt;. 07. and l(H). If the segrega - tion of factors pertaining to grain yield should occur in tin - simple Mendelian ratio, the yield of the F., hybrids might be e\ pected to center lx'tween the average of the pure line parent - and their Fj hybrids. During 1014 and 1017 the pan line par ents approximated }H&gt;r cent of the F, yield. A theoretical F, yield intermediate between these pure line and F, hybrid yields would have l&gt;een 62 per cent of the hybrid yield. wherea - the F 2 actually yielded U jxt cent as much. i These data show very definitely the inadvisability of select seed corn from an F, hybrid U'tween such pure line-, m matter how productive the F, generation may Ik*. i - — t r m . 19. Very different results were obtained from hybrids !«• - »en ordinary commercial varieties. In a four-year test, the d of thirteen variety hybrids averaged 4 per cent less than the average of both parents, and !&gt; per cent le» than the l»--t par - ent. No hybrid equaled the l&gt;e-t variety parent in grain yield. This failure of the F, hybrid to 1m&gt; more productive than the twr - age of the two parent- may 1m&gt; accounted for liv the fact that the varieties are already fully heterozygous. For the same reason the F, generation of the variety hybrids yielded fully up to the F, generation. All plant- of the second generation were it - heterozygous as were plants of the F, generation. In these experiments, seed for the F., generations for both pure line and variety hybrids was produced by r rowing F, plants, and not by self-fertilization. The latter procedure would doubtless have reduced the F., variety yield approximately the same as the F, pure line yield was reduced. The method em - ployed in these experiments corresponds to a farmer's pvamhure in selecting seed ears from an F, hybrid field. </seg>

Kiesselbach INTRODUCTION The purpose of tin- investigations reported in this bulletin !ia&gt; been primarily to determine some of the underlying princi - ples involved in corn improvement. The work comprises a study of MM of the physiological characteristics of the crop together with si comparison of various selection, breeding, and cultural practices in their relation to grain yield. The experiments were niaile largely on the Agricultural Experiment Station farm or within it&gt; immediate vicinity, at Lincoln. Nebraska, except in a few in-tances where the nature of the investigation required other designated locations. The investigatioDH reported herein are in part a continua - tion and extension of work done by Lyon and Montgomery prior to l'.'ll and reported by them in earlier publications. There aat I m-cii perfect continuity in some of these exi&gt;eriments for the l.-i~t eighteen year-. This has been made possible by the com - plete records kept thruout their progress, and also by tlui fact that Montgomery and the writer were each in turn associated lor a number of year- witli their predecessors in these corn ex - periments. The acreage devoted to tkflM studies during the last ten reara ha- varied from thirty to sixtv acres annually. The -ea^on- of l'.'l* and 191* were so dry at the Station that the corn grown in these experiments was virtually a failure both vear- ami wa&gt; used for silage without yield determinations. Thus, inanv of the data in the fallowing tables terminate with the 1 i» 1 7 crop.

Reneaich Bui. ,.'u 16 Many of the problems investigated in these experiments have been studied elsewhere by other workers. 1 with varied re - sults and conclusions. One probablt cause for this diversity of results from certain selection and breeding practices is the use, by different investigators, of varieties differing in their degree of local adaptation. It is reasonable that a poorly adapted variety is more likely to respond favorably to selection and breeding than is a well-adapted variety. The pvaem of im - provement in such a case may simply be that of directed ac - climatization. This diversity of results is doubtless also to be accounted for, in part, by experimental errors which have un - consciously modified the correct indications. Method studies. such as reported in Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Research Bulletin No. IS. indicate many sources of possible error. These chiefly arise from irregularities in stand and soil, insufficient numbers of individuals and replications of plats, competition with adjacent unlike sorts, and insufficient duration of test-. Some experiments are greatly subject to seasonal effects and require continuation thru a period of years in order to secure average indications. The nature of other experiment- i- such that the seasonal variation is not a vital factor, and dependable indications may l&gt;e had in a much shorter time, provided the number of replications i- ample aad the method employed is correct. ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS Thel'nited State- produces, in round numbers, 3,000,000,000 bushels of corn annually. Nebraska"- normal corn crop ap - proaches MNMMMMO bushels. (Table 1.) An increase in the acre yields accompanied by an improvement in or at lea-i main - tenance of commercial quality would be a matter of no small moment. The significance of improvement along these lines. even tho slight, is so profound that agricultural agencies mm justified in the expenditure of great effort to establish the essen - tial considerations in such improvement. An annual iacreaac ol approximately seven million bushels in Nebraska's corn crop would result from increasing t] u . average yield one bushel i&gt;er acre. •The literature bearing upon many of the problems investigated herein is so extensive that it has seemed expedient to completely omit all literature citations. </seg>

TECHNIQUE OF THE FIELD PLAT YIELD DETERMINATIONS Since 1911. except where the nature of the experiment re - quired otherwise, the corn lias been planted thick and thinned to the desired uniform rate. In the main, the corn rows have been Due to the severe winterkilling of the 1917 crop, much of the wheat acreage was replanted to other crops. The 4-year average, 1918 to 1921, therefore represents more nearly a normal average of the various crops than does the 1917-1921 average.

Fur the purpose of determining the opportunity for cross - fertili/.ation. the natural silking and Useeling relationships were &gt;tudied doriag 1!&gt;14 and 1!)1"&gt; for fourteen varieties.

With the initial advent of tassels and silks, individual plant records were kept of their daily development. The cor - relations In-tween the shedding of pollen and the pollination of Mlks and. indirectly, the fertilization of the ovules, are pre - mtod in Tables I to S and summarized in Table 9. Data bear - ing upon the same relationships were obtained on a smaller -calf with nine varieties in 1920 and are included in the sum - marv table. The tipper portion of the central tassel spike is commonly the &gt;eat of the initial shedding of pollen. From here it extends downward and laterally to the tassel branches. The shedding of pollen begun with elongation of the anther filament and the extrusion and dehiscence of the anthers. Receptive silks are lijt'ct to self-fertilization as long as the plant bearing them pollen. The exact time at which the pollen falls upon the fertilizes the kernel is not directly apparent. This in U&gt; approximated by noting the date upon which the t characteristic slight discoloration and withering of the silk con - -&lt;'i|iicnt upon fertilization is first apparent.

For this determination the ears of 1(X) plants were cov - ered with paper bags before the -ilks appeared. Upon removal of the bags following silking, pollen was artificially applied and the time determined for each plant to show the effects. The data are given in Table 10. Varieties as well as individual plants were found to vary somewhat in the sequence of the various flowering stages of tassel and silk.

These elemental :-trains do not occur in the variety as a mere mechanical mix - ture, but rather as natural hybrids due to chance wind pollina - tion. The characteristics transmitted by these elemental strains to their hybrid offspring is in accordance with the principles of Mendelian inheritance.

This purified condi - tion of the germ plasm, in which all zygotes, i. e., eggs and sperms, are alike, is called homozygous as opposed to the hybrid or heterozygous condition where two unlike zygotes have united and where many different kinds of zygotes may be formed by segregation of the factors derived from the parents. The elemental strains differ in such visible physical and physiological characters as height of stalk, diameter of stalk, leaf area, leaf width, erectness of leaves, suckering tendency, brace root development, lodge resistance, firing of leaves, firing of tassels, sterility of tassels, barrenness of ears, stalk and leaf i-olor. grain color, cob color, silk color, anther color, tassel con - formation, shank development, ear type, kernel type, grain yield, disease resistance, and earliness of maturitv. Many heritable variations and gradations of these and other plant characteristics are found in innumerable hybrid combinations in an ordinary corn variety. The particular chance combination of factors or groups of factors upon fertilization of the egg determines the exact nature of many of the individual plant characters as well as of the complete assemblage of char - acters comprising the plant in its entirety. The more closely any variety, or individual corn grower's Mil&gt;variety. has ban selected for triteness to plant or ear type, thru prolonged continuous selection, the fewer will l&gt;e the nuni - l&gt;er of elemental strain&gt; represented in its composition. Accord - ingly, tin- greater will be the likelihood under ordinary field condition* of some identical factors of inheritance from both parents uniting in the process of fertilization.

It is necessary that any foreign pollen which may have lodged upon the tassel iit-the time of covering should have lost its viability before the pollen is used in fertilization. For the purpose of approximat - ing the life of pollen, the following tests were made: One hun - dred ear shoots of Hogue's Yellow Dent corn were bagged to exclude pollen. A quantity of pollen was shaken into a bag from a large number of plants. This was immediately stored in a div building of 7."» -83 V. At intervals of 10. M. SOL M, M, 51. </seg>

The relative viability of pollen at various ages is illustrated by the number of kernels fertilized on the ears shown in figure No. 11. Fertilization m very poor at the end of 51 hours and failed after 56 hours. In l'.^O. fresh pollen was collected at 7 A. M. from 40 ta&gt;sels and was well mixed. This WM immediately divided into 1(1 paper bags which were tied to the tops of corn plants in the cornfield, where they remained until used. The temperature range was from 7"&gt; F. to KM) F. and the mean relative humid - ity ranged from :5&lt;) to 70 per cent. Ears pollinated with this pollen 10 and 1"&gt; hours after it was collected showed good fer - tilization: but the pollen had practically lost its viability at the end of -24 hours. Thus it may be inferred that pollen kept iiniler Mich intermediate conditions will have lost its viability at the end of -JO to • '■&lt;&gt; hours after shedding. LIFE OF SILKS The life of the unfertilized silk is seldom a problem in ex - periments involving the artificial fertilization of corn. Control tests have indicated that silks are receptive to pollination before they have emerged from the husk, and for a period of two weeks thereafter. The earliest effective application of pollen in some in-tanees necessitated opening the husks three or four inches to reach the silks. In other cases of delayed yet effective pollina - tion silks were m [Will for a length of twelve inches. Silk&gt; continue to grow in length for some time if pollen is withheld. Siidi &gt;ilks may be cut off to a short length and yet be success - fully pollinated. In controlled fertilization experiments which necessitate covering the young ears, it is important to keep them covered for some time after applying the pollen, in order to avoid the chance pollination of late receptive silks. Dr. E. C Miller of the Kansas Agricultural Experiment Station has found by means of histological studies that fertili - zation of the kernel is effected within a period of at&gt;out '24 hours after applying pollen to the silk. Thru similar studies. Dr. Paul Weatherwax of the University of Georgia estimates the lapse of time between pollination and fecundation at about twenty-five hours. (Termination of the pollen on the silk is rather rapid. In our tests regarding this, the tip ends of the ear shoots were sterilized in alcohol six hours after pollination, and were cut off a short distance below the end of the husks in order to com - pletely remove the portion of the silks to which the pollen had been applied. The ears were kept covered to exclude further </seg>

In l!Ut' ( . F 2 hybrid seed was again produced in the MM manner, and third genera- tion (!•'.) hybrid seed was similarly produced from F., plants. Fir-t generation hybrid seed was produced anew each year, for comparison. The comparative l!»lti results for the individual fir&gt;t and second generation hybrids are shown in Table 10. in contrast with the average results for the pure lines and the origin*] corn. The original corn yielded 37.5 bushels per acre: the seven pure lines averaged 9.8 bushels: the eight first genera - tion hybrids averaged 51.7 bushels: and the second generation hybrids 25.1 bushels per acre. Thus the F, crop yielded 138 per cent as much, the F 2 crop 67 per cent as much, and the pure lines 20 per cent as much as the original variety from which they were produced. The increased degree of homozygosity due to Mendelian segregation and recombination of parental factors would ac - count for the reduction in yield of the second generation plants. which is nearly in accordance with expectancy in a hybrid popu - lation in which the factors represented were all derived from two homozygous individuals. In 1!&gt;17. F,. F... and F a pure line hybrids were available for comparison. (Table 17.) The original seed yielded -K&gt; bushels, the F, imaged S1J bushels, the F, 20.4 bushels, and the F. -I'tX) bushels per acre. This extreme reduction in yield of the F., and F :! crop below the yields of the F, and the orig - inal variety is evidence to show that, in any application of tne principles of corn improvement thru crossing two pure lines, it is essential to avoid selecting seed from the hybrid progeny. An experiment is under way in which seed of a large number of elemental strains are mixed to be grown thereafter as a variety without further controlled inbreeding and hybridization. By mixing a large number of strains, the chance of union of like gamete- is reduced and when enough strains are used will be - come small, as in ordinary commercial varieties. At the same time, advantage would be taken of the process of weeding out inferior strains thru inbreeding. The two years' results with F, and F, crop are summarized in Table 18 and show respective yields of 52.2 and 27.8 bushels per acre in comparison with 41.7 bushels for the original corn. </seg>

The ratio of leaf area (in square inches) to dry matter (in grams) was calculated as a basis for type selection. The ean from two plants having a low ratio of leaf area per gram dry matter served as the foundation for "low leaf area" selections, while the ears from two plants having a high ratio of let! area per grain dry matter formed the foundation for the "high leaf area" selection.

Comparing the average of the low leaf area selections with the average of the high leaf area selections, the former had S2 per cent as much leaf area per gram dry matter. 77 per cent as much actual leaf area. !O per cent as much total dry matter, 99 per cent a&gt; great ear weight, grew two inches shorter, and ma - tured live days earlier. These comparisons were all based on individual measurements of ten representative plants for each strain. In addition to the above differences, a very distinct difference in ear type had unconsciously been developed for the two general groups. The low leaf area selection had a more slender ear, with shallower and flintier kernel, than the orig - inal variety. The high leaf area selections, on the other — — D — 7 __ — md. were characterized by a somewhat larger ear circumfer ind a deeper and rougher kernel INBRED STRAINS During the six years 1909-1915 (omitting 1913), these 8 high and 17 low leaf area strains were subjected to continuous self-fertilization. The comparative growth at the end of this period of reduction to elemental strains is shown in Table 20, which gives the averages for the two years 1915-1910. Compar- ing the average of the low leaf area pure lines with the average of the high leaf area pure lines, the former had 84 per cent as uch leaf area per gram dry matter. 7(5 per cent as much actual if area. 'M j&gt;er cent as much total dry matter, 125 per cent as reat ear weight, grew 3 inches taller, and matured 5 days lrlier. In the more important characteristics, practically the same relationships obtained between the two groups of pure lines as existed before self-fertilization. However, a great reduction in plant size and productivity had resulted from the continuous self-fertilization. HYBRIDS BETWEEN LEAF AREA PURE LINES During ltlff and 1916 a comparative yield test was made of (1) I* F, hybrids between low leaf area pure lines, (2) 4 F, hybrids In'tween high leaf area pure lines, (3) 7 F, hybrids between high and low leaf area pure lines, and (4) original Hague's Yellow Dent corn. The results are given in Table No. 21. </seg>

Investigations 65 It is interesting to note that the principal character, viz, ratio of leaf area to dry matter, showed an identical difference for the two group- in all three conditions — before inbreeding, after inbreeding, and after crossing;. The plant and ear types, which had ben fairly well fixed by ordinary plant selection within a variety, were carried over thru the inbreeding period for live jean and retained in the F, pure line hybrids. The F, hybrids between low leaf and high leaf area pure lilies were intermediate in tlieir ratio of leaf area to dry weight and also in ear type. Considerable variation occurred between different hybrids in yield of grain per acre, but as an average the hybrids were considerably more productive than the original. The yields of the low leaf hybrids, high leaf hybrids, low by high leaf hybrids, and the original averaged respectively 61.7, 55.6, .".'.'.■_'. and ."«."». 1 bushels. This is a V2 per cent greater yield for the average of the low leaf pure line hybrids compared with the original variety, while the highest yielding individual hybrid yielded 34 per cent more. RELATION BETWEEN VIGOR OF PURE LINE PARENTS AND PRODUCTIVITY OF FIRST GENERATION HYBRIDS There has been much regarding the relation be - tween the vigor of the pure lines and of their hybrid progeny. The general concensus of opinion among students of this prob - lem would &gt;eein to support the theory that those elemental strains which undergo the least reduction from inbreeding are likely to produce the most productive hybrid offspring when ro-s The ol&gt;M-r\ at ion- at this Station bearing upon this point may lie of interest, altho they are hardly of sufficient extent to warrant conclii&gt;ions. The yields of eight F, hybrids and their inbred parents are given for 101»&gt; in Table -J-J. The average yield of the four hybrids in each of which the lowest yielding parent yielded not to exceed 3.1 bushels per acre was 4."&gt;.0 bushels. In comparison, the average yield of the four hybrids in none of which the lowest yielding parent produced less than s.ii bushels wa- 58.5 bushels pat acre. The average Superiority in grain yield of the inbred parents of the second group over those of the first group was 34 per cent. In comparison, the average superiority in grain yield of the I-', hybrids of the second group was :'.() per cent over the F, hybrids of the first group. In Table 28 are compiled the average yield per acre during two years for eighteen F, low leaf area hybrids and the average </seg>

DECREES OF INBREEDING There are various degrees of kinship between the ovules of the ear and the pollen grains which fertilize them. The past discussion has indicated that a large number of distinct ele - n rntal -trains with independently inherited Mendelian charac - ters are the liasis for an ordinary corn variety, and that broad fertilization to avoid the pairing of identical Mendelian factors is desirable. Investigation has been made to determine the effect oF intermediate degrees of close breeding. Two separate experi - ments have I teen conducted, one beginning in 1009 with Hogue's "Yellow Dent corn and one in IMS with Nebraska White Prize. Beginning with ear-to-row strains, the following degrees of re - lationship between source of ovule and pollen have been studied: 1. s, If-fi rt'ilizntiint. in which the seed has been continued eich year with a single ear of corn, fertilized by pollen from the same plant. •2.

It is well known that the embryo of a kernel of corn is the direct product of the union of t lit* mnle and frinale gametes. The embrvo is a rudimentary corn plant and i- ju-t M iMMnosygous or hetero/.vjrons as is the plant wliicli it produce- when planted. As the result of double fecundation in corn, its endosperm de - velopment is also subject to the influence of both &lt;rainete». The color and type of endosperm are verv readilv influenced by the immediate effect of foreijni pollen, which irives rise to the well - known phenomenon of xenia. </seg>
            <seg id="p081">t III //&lt; rtxt'ujationx 81 Under What conditions ami to what extent the kernel weight is influenced l&gt;y the degree of kinship between pollen and ovules is not BO well understood. It lias been suggested by other inves - tigators (1) that variety teats a- commonly conducted, permit - ting promiscuous pollination lM'tween neighboring varieties, are unreliable because of the immediate effect of foreign pollen upon the yield and ( -1 ) that funnels may increase their yields by planting a mixture of varieties so that cross-pollination will occur. The theory upon which these statements are based is that the developing corn kernel receives an immediate stimulus thru being fertilized by foreign pollen. On this subject the following te-ls have been made at tbe Nebraska Experiment Station. METHODS OF DETERMINATION Since the effect of foreign pollen is confined to the indi - vidual kermis so fertilized, a direct comparison of hybrid and pure kernels on the same mature ear is possible. Pure, in this ■a*, refer- to kernels fertilized by pollen of the same variety, and hybrid refers to those fertilized by another variety. Fur experimental purposes, varieties are used which differ in endo-perm color, so that the two sorts of kernels may Ihj dis - tinguished by the phenomenon of xenia. This mixture of pure and hybrid kernels of known parent - age may Im&gt; produced either by planting two varieties in close proximity, UlCTeby permitting natural mixing of pollen, or by artificially collecting, mixing, and applying the pollen to recep - tive -ilk- which have Iktii previously covered to avoid chance fert ilization. The method of comparing the weights of pure and hybrid kernels on the aaaae ear ha* been commonly employed by other inve-tigator- and lias been used in thes;&gt; investigations. The r and location oi the hybrid kernels upon the ear is more or lea a matter of chance. On some ears they are uniformly Mattered thru the ear (tig. -Jl): on other- they will tend to be localized in certain portions of the ear. Since the kernels Usually become systematically smaller with an approach toward the tip of the ear. it i- apparent that precautions must be taken to avoid experimental error- easily resulting from place etfect on the ear. Pun- and hybrid kernels should, for comparison, be re - moved in adjacent pain. Thus the hybrid kernel should be taken for the test only when there is an adjacent pure kernel in the same row. which may also l)e removed. If a high de - gree of accuracy is desired, equal numbers of pure kernels should </seg>
            <seg id="p082">Nebraska Agricultural Exp. Station, Research Bui. 20 82 be taken from the butt and tip sides of the hybrid kernels used. This will overcome the systematic reduction in kernel size toward the ear tip which is associated with the natural tapering of the ear. In a test with four varieties, the average reduction in kernel weight from butt to tip was one per cent for each successive kernel.

In the ease of two varieties: (1) When the hybrid kernels were largely localized on the tip third portion of the ear and all were compared as to average kernel weight with all the pure kernels on the ear. the average weight of hybrid kernels was MM per cent less than that of the pure kernels: whereas, when removed in pairs the hybrid kernels weighed only 0.27 per cent Im than the pure.

(-4) When the hybrid kernels were quite generally distributed thru the ear, their average weight was 0.88 per cent less than that of the pure when com - pared by the former method and 1.14 per cent more when re - moved in pairs. When all the hybrid kernels were contrasted with all the pure kernels on each ear. the variation in weight, for all ears, of the hybrid kernels was from 2B.58 per cent less to 11.91 per cent more than that of the pure; and when the kernel- were removed from each ear in pairs, the extreme range of variation in weight of the hvbrid kernels for the various ears d »a~ from 0lS7 per cent les- to l.iH) per cent more than the pur RESULTS WITH VARIETIES During five years (Table M) a large number of ordi - nary Hogue's Yellow Dent ears were selected which had been prown near a field of Nebraska White Prize corn and were therefore subject to partial cross-fertilization.

The results for different years were slightly Variable, ranging from 1.8 pet cent increase for hybrid kernels in 1014 to 0.7 per cent reduction for hybrid kernels in 1017 and 1920.

The small leaf area, reduced root development, and sluggish synthetic activities of the inbred plant may result in a somewhat undersupply of plant nutrients. In &gt;iich event, the full development of the embrvo. which is the vital element in reproduction, might be favored at the expense of the endosperm. The endosperm is a mere food supply for the embryo and may be somewhat more heavily drawn upon even at this &gt;ta«re M a result of the stimulated growth of the embrvo.

The data in Table :5H. showing the ivlative number and &gt;ize of certain histological units, cover- &gt;even pure lines and ten F, hybrids in which all seven pure lines are represented. Histo- Logieal material was gathered from four representative plants of each pure line or hybrid at about the silking period. The corn had attained it- full vegetative development DJT this time. Material for stalk sectioning was taken midway of the tir-t internode above the ground. Material for leaf study was taken at the widest portion of the main ear leaf midway between the mid- rib and the margin. In order to overcome the great variability amonjr the different units. &lt;i lane number of individual counts and measurements were taken for each -train. In the case of stalk sections, fifty independent observation- were made for each character under consideration. In case of leaf measurements, this number was increased to 100. All of these microscopic ob- servations were made with unstained material preserved in alcohol. The data as taken are considered a- indicative of the hist logical differences which occur between pure line- and their hybrids.

SELECTION FOR SPECIFIC PLANT AND EAR CHARACTERS "HIGH LEAF AREA" AND "LOW LEAF AREA" STRAINS During the six-year period ltOft-1910, two distinct types of Hogue's Yellow Dent corn differing in relative leafiness became fairly well established by continuous ear-to-row selection.

The basis of selection on the one hand was a high ratio of leaf area to total plant weight, and on the other hand a low ratio of leaf area to total plant weight. The characteristics of the progeny grown each year are shown in Table 4C&gt;. In 1911 these two types were planted in isolation plats without further selection aside from the use of well-developed ears for seed. These isola - tion plats have each year provided the seed for the comparative 3 T ield test during the six years 1911-1017 which is reported in Table 47. While neither strain has surpassed the original corn in yield, the low leaf area strain has out yielded the high leaf area &gt;train 3.3 bushels per acre. The low leaf area strain actually yielded 2.3 bushels less than the original while the F, hybrid butww the two strains, which was made each year by natural crossing, yielded 3.2 bushels more than the low leaf and t"..5 bushels more than the high leaf area strains. The data as a whole suggest a possible superiority of the low leaf area over the high leaf area strains, but also suggest a reduction in yield, probably due to narrow fertilization resulting from the restricted type '-..lection. SELECTION FOR PLANT CHARACTERS OF NEBRASKA WHITE PRIZE CORN In 1914 eight lots of ears in composite were .selected from a field of Nebraska White Prize corn, representing (1) three de - grees of ear height, viz, high, medium, and low; (2) throe de - grees of erectness of ear on the stalk, viz. erect, medium drooping, and drooping; and (3) two degrees of lodge resistance, viz. land - ing Stalks versus lodged stalks. These various plant type- were tested for yield in adjacent plats during the five years 1915 - 1917 and 1920-1921. Continuous type selection of the most ex - treme plants for seed was practiced yearly within these same plats. Thus, the pollination was promiscuous between the types, and the selection was confined primarily to the mother parent. During the five years (Table 4H). selection for high, medium, and low ears yielded respectively ."&gt;l.f&gt;. .VU. and BftJ l&gt;u&gt;hel&gt; per acre. The plants with low ears yielded two bushels per acre more than those having high ears. As an average for the period, the plants resulting from these three lines of ear height selection averaged .VI. 47. and 44 inches for ear height, and 102, 98. and 03 inches for stalk height. None of these surpassed the original corn in yield of grain per acre. Selection for erectness of ears resulted ill !l somewhat higher per cent of plants having erect ears than where drooping ears </seg>

The droopiaaj ears yielded -2.'-\ bushels more than tin* erect, while the medium drooping ear yield was 0.1 bii-hel les&gt;. The original corn surpassed that with drooping ears i&gt;.i bushel per acre. Seed selected (ran -tanding stalks outyielded Mad from lodged stalk&gt; by 5.6 bushels per acre, and surpassed the original corn l.&lt;'&gt; bushels per «cre. Since from tlie low tar, drooping ear. and standing stalk- yielded most in their respective groups, the data suggest that a very slight increase in yield might ha expected from selection for a combination of these characters. This increase might approximate three per cent. The various lots of ncd do not transmit nearly so large a type difference a&gt; exi-ts between the selected plants upon which the seed wma grown. RELATION OF EAR TYPE TO YIELD OF GRAIN During afr year-. 1!&gt;14-1!»17 and 1990-1921, four distinct ear trpm have been Batacted annually from the standard Nebraska White Prize variety and compared for yield. Ten or more ears were mixed for the -eed of each type. The selection has not Ix'en rout unions, and results indicate the immediate effect of selecting e»r types in bulk. Under the circumstances, the male parentage is entirely uncontrolled and represents a mixture of types. The progeny ear- of the several types, therefore, do not and cannot 1m&gt; expected to differ in the same degree as did the ■asd ear- from which they were grown. However, there is nsuallv a very apparent tendency in the direction of the special selection. The ilauai in jut u (i of both the ears planted and the ear- harve-ted a- well as the plant characteristics and yields per acre are given in Table 49. In the &gt;ix-vear comparison with long, slender, smooth ears, the lonjr. large, roogfa ear- averaged ■"&gt;.(• bushels less per acre, ripened four days later, and had a 1.7 par cent greater shrink - age of ear corn. Short, slender, smooth ears and short, large, rough ears yielded practically alike, and intermediate between the other two types. The long, slender, smooth type of ear sur - paaavd all the other- and yielded 0.8 bushel more than the original corn, which is a natural mixture of rough, smooth, and intermediate types. Tkm data do not indicate what difference would have resulted from prolonged continued selection. </seg>

This general conclusion has been reached at taaat in Ohio. Illinois, and Kansas in addition to Nebraska. Experiments in these four states and in Minnesota and New York have indicated that ear type considerations aside from maturity, soundness, and adaptability are rather neutral in their relation to vield. The relation of kernel depth to moisture content and freezing injury in a year of late maturity in the fall was shown force - fully in a field of HogMs's Yellow Dent corn at the Experiment station in 1917. The ears harvested from this field on Decem - ber l'O were divided into five groups according to their apparent soundness, maturity, and solidity. The moisture content, germi - nation, and kernel length were determined for the grain in each group. Beginning with the most solid and mature group, the germinations, after curing, for the five groups were respectively 'X\. .V.i. 14. ."&gt;. and 0 per cent. The moisture contents at time of husking. December ■_'!•. were respectively 15, 16, 19, 21, and 28 par cent, while the average kernel lengths were 0.40. 0.50, 0.52, O..~&gt;4. and 0.57 inches. The deep kernels, representing later ma - turing plants, contained more water at the time of freezing weather, and for this reason were more subject to freezing in - jury. Extensive data regarding the correlation l&gt;etween mois - ture content and susceptibility to freezing injury have been re - ported in Agricultural Experiment Station Research Bulletin No. lfi.

COMPARATIVE YIELDS OF SEED FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE EAR Con growers have always been interested in the relative yields to l&gt;e expected from seed produced on different parts of the ear. During six years, comparative tests have been made of seed taken respectively from the butt, tip, and middle sections of the ear. The results given in Table ;V2 show no material differences in the respective crops in any regard. The respective yields for butts, tips, and middles were MM, f&gt;0.4, and 60.2 bushel- per acre. Altho the kernels at the tip of an ear are relatively small and their early seedling development is slightly backward, they still contain sufficient food material to support the seedling until its own synthetic activities are established. The reserve food material in the average kernel of dent corn an - pears to be greater than the young seedlings require under ordi - nary Held conditions. It seems, therefore, that little is to be gained by discarding kernels from the butt and tip ends of the ear aside from a some - what more uniform dropping by the corn planter and a better germination under certain conditions of freezing injury. </seg>

Summary of plant characteristics during period Seed from RELATION OF SEED MATURITY TO YIELD OF GRAIN In years of late maturity, the question of special field selec - tion of slightly immature seed corn to escape frost injury com - monly arises. A two-year test reported in Table ."&gt;."&gt; indicates that carefully cured corn selected midway between silking and maturity may possess both high germinative and yielding abil - ity. Corn selected at five weekly intervals before ripe yielded in no case more than two per cent less than fully matured seed. Even tho viability and yield may not be impaired by immature selection, thoro field curing of seed should be practiced as far as possible, since difficulty of curing and preservation are thereby greatly reduced. The above test does not include the effect of unfavorable growth conditions in some seasons. It is possible that small, immaturely harvested seeds would be handicapped under unfavorable climatic or seed bed conditions. i i Portion of ear used for seed Yield of grain per acre 1914 1915 1916 1917 1920 1921 Av.

EFFECT OF TIME OF SELECTION AND PRESERVATION OF SEED CORN UPON YIELD This test has previously been reported in Nebraska Agricul - tural Experiment Station Bulletin No. 163. The object was to determine the effect of the time of harvesting seed corn upon its yielding ability provided care is taken in selection to obtain equally high germination. Comparative yield tests were made in 1916, 1916, and 1017 of September, November, and March field selections made from Nebraska White Prize corn grown at the Experiment Station.
