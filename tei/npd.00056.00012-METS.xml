            <seg id="p003">PRODUCTIVE SEED CORN Corn is the most extensively grown field crop in Nebraska. Approximately 7,000,000 acres are planted annually. The average yield during the last 28 years is reported by the State Board of Agriculture to have been 25.2 bushels per acre. The yield is somewhat greater in the eastern portion of the State and decreases toward the west, with the rather gradual re - duction in the rainfall and length of growing season. The yield varies greatly in any given locality from year to year in accordance with the fayorableness of the season's climatic conditions. Such variations in yield during the last 13 years may be observed for the Nebraska Experiment Sta - tion, at Lincoln, Nebraska, in Table 1. This table further suggests the desirability of the diversification of crops.

            <seg id="p004">4 Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 188 The economic importance of employing the most profitable production practices on so large an acreage has attracted the public attention for many years, and has induced many in - dividuals and agricultural institutions to investigate the fac - tors influencing production. In the progress of such investi - gations many different cultural, seed selection and breeding practices have been suggested. The annual production of corn in this State would be increased about 7,000,000 bushels for each bushel per acre added thru crop improvement. Rea - lizing the importance of such improvement, the Nebraska Experiment Station is striving to establish the practices whereby corn yields may be increased, and also to point out those which are unprofitable. The yield and quality of the corn crop depend upon the inheritance and soundness of the seed, the soil productivity, the climate, and the cultural practices. This bulletin relates primarily to problems concerning the production and improve - ment of seed corn. RELATION' OF (IJMATK TO (X)KX TYI'K A survey of the climate of the State is of great importance since the characteristics of the corn variety or type which is most productive in any locality bear a very close correlation to the climate of the region. The chief climatic considerations which may become limit - ing factors in corn yields and which influence the type of corn that may be grown most advantageously in any locality aiv : (1) Length of growing season before killing fall frosts. (2) amount and distribution of effective precipitation, which take*; into consideration the difference in relative evaporation rates for various regions, (3) the average temperature of the corn growing season, and (4) occurrence of temporary periods of excessively high temperatures accompanied by low humidity and high wind velocity. The question of local adaptedness is of great importance due to the wide range of climatic con - ditions prevailing in this State. The degree of adaptedness depends upon the state of harmony between the plant's re - quirements and its environmental growth conditions. The highest degree of adaptedness is regarded as that resulting in the maximum yield of sound grain per acre. Since the crop environment of any locality is rather variable from year to year, the type of corn to be grown must be determined by its average performance over a term of years. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">Productive Seed Corn 5 Corn has now been grown in all agricultural areas of the State for many years, and experience indicates that, in the main, fairly well adapted plant types are being used, with the possible exception that there appears to be a tendency toward slightly too large vegetative size and late maturity. Those climatic conditions which virtually determine the type of corn best suited to various parts of the State are .shown in Figures 1 and 2. The data are averaged for 30 or more years of observations made by the Nebraska Weather Bureau, under the direction of G. A. Loveland. Summing up these regional climatic conditions, it is apparent that varia - tions showing extreme differences of 50 days in length of frost free periods, 6 degrees F. in seasonal temperature, and 16 inches in the amount of annual rainfall place marked natural regional limitations upon the maximum hereditary ve«retative size and lateness of the corn types that may be advantageously grown. The most productive corn grown at the Nebraska Experi - ment Station matures on an averajre about 20 days before the average date of the first killing frost in the fall. In most years it matures fully before fall frosts, altho occasionally a very early frost results in slightly immature and soft corn. Itl-XilONAI. TYPKS OF CORN IN NEBRASKA Extensive surveys and comparative tests within the State have suggested some important principles in regard to the correlation of plant and ear characters of dent corn as grown and best suited to various parts of Nebraska. In general, the more adverse the growing conditions are for corn the smaller will be the plant, and the earlier its maturity. This adjust - ment manifests itself in a reduction of all the plant characters, inclnHin« r stalk and ear he'crht. number and size of leaves, length and circumference of ears, and number of rows on the ear. In association with these changes, the kernels become shorter and more flinty. Thp 2 extremes of plant tvpe adapted in Nebraska are found at opposite ends of the State, in Richardson and Kim - hall Counties. When native seed from both of these regions was planted at the rate of 3 plants per hill in 1916 and 1917 under th° rather favorable conditions of the Experiment Sta - t'on at Lincoln, it was found that in comparison with the Richardson County corn the Kimball County corn ripened 16 </seg>

The ears of the Kimball County corn were 19 per cent shorter, their circum - ference was 10 per cent smaller, the shelling percentage 9 per cent lower, the kernel 20 per cent shorter and the shrink - age of ear corn was 6.5 per cent less. The Richardson County ears were moderately rough while the Kimball County ears were smooth with a mere dimple dent. The corn types grown in other parts of the State were found to range between these 2 extremes very much in accordance with their proximity to either extreme in locality. In a 7-year test at the Experiment Station the Kimball County type of corn was found to use only 1 234567 8 9 10 11 Fig. 3. — Representative ears of corn grown from native seed from the 11 regions in Nebraska indicated by number in Figs. 1 and 2.

As an illustration of the effect of moving corn to less favor - able climatic conditions than prevail in its native locality, we may compare the results of native Richardson County corn and Kimball County corn when grown in Kimball County in 1916. The Richardson County corn had two and one-half times as much leaf area per plant and also per pound of dry plant substance, and the yield of shelled corn per acre was only 24 per cent as large as for the native Kimball County corn. These data suggest the inadvisability of moving seed corn to conditions materially different from those where it is adapted. Representative locally adapted seed was obtained in 1916 from each of the 12 counties indicated by number in Fijrures 1 and 2. This corn was grown in 1916 under the relatively favorable and unfavorable climatic conditions of Lancaster and Kimball Counties, respectively. Typical ears grown from each regional type are shown in Figure 3 for both the Lan - caster County and Kimball County crop. All types matured quite well when grown under the favorable conditions of eastern Nebraska, whereas when grown in western Nebraska the maturity and grain production were rather proportional to the nearness to the seed's source. LOCAL VS. IMPORTED SKEI) CORN There has been considerable public interest in the question of the relative productivity of the various corns grown within a community. A 3-year test at the Experiment Station (Table 2) of seed from 9 local farmers living within 5 miles of the Station probably illustrates fairly well the amount of such difference that is to be expected. This local corn was compared during the same neriod with corn secured from 7 more distant eastern Nebraska corn growers. As an average for the 3 years, the Hogue Yellow Dent, which has been grown at the Nebraska Experiment Station for 20 years, outyielded seed from all other sources. Of the local varieties the poorest yielded 7.7 bushels less than Hogue Yellow Dent. Three of th* local corns yielded within 3 t&gt;er cent as much as Hoorue, which yielded 6 Der cent more than the average of all other local sorts. Of the seed obtained at a distance, from oth«»r eastern counties, one lot yielded 16.7 bushels less than the local Hogue Yellow Dent ; another yielded </seg>
            <seg id="p009">Productive Seed Corn 9 10.5 bushels less. Three of the remaining 5 yielded within 2 bushels of the home grown Hogue Yellow Dent. As an aver - age of the 2 groups tested, locally grown seed yielded 63.4 bushels and the seed from some distance within the State, yielded 60.8 bushels. The data confirm the results of other tests. There may be considerable variation in yielding capac - ity of corn grown by different farmers in the same locality and also among com secured from various distant sources within the State.

In much territory beyond the State borders to the east and south, larger and later matur - ing types of corn are grown than is possible in Nebraska, because of more favorable climatic conditions. Progressing west and north within the State the risk and loss from im - porting seed com from more favorable sections is materially increased.

Hundreds of seed corn importations from varying dis - tances have been made by the Experiment Station during the last 20 years, and in no case has seed from a distance yielded materially more than our best local seed; but it has often proved very inferior in yield and quality. Caution must be exercised in moving seed corn any great distance within or from without the State. When corn adapted to relatively favorable climatic condi - tions is moved to a relatively less favorable region, it under - goes a very noticeable change in type. The apparently new characteristics are almost universally present in the inheri - tance of the old corn, but are largely hidden in hybrid com - binations.

These ears are naturally selected for planting the following year and by such continued selection an entirely new appearing type of corn becomes isolated. This change to a smaller, more slender, more horny, and shallower kerneled ear, with a lower shelling percentage, has very com - monly been regarded as a "running out" of the seed. This is a mistaken notion, as it is an indication that the corn is be - coming better adapted to the new conditions and will on an average yield more corn of better quality in the new environ - ment than the original seed. In selecting seed care should be taken to pick the best ears which have fully matured. When corn investigations were first seriously undertaken in this State about 20 years ago, it was thought feasible to determine and prescribe certain varieties as being best for the various regions of the State. Continued investigation has shown that variety recommendations must be greatly qualified in order to meet the more important consideration of local adaptation. There frequently exists as much difference within a var - iety due to local adaptation, as between different varieties. Such local type differences within a variety may be illustrated by Table 4, which shows the comparative growth habits of typical Lancaster County and Thurston County Reid Yellow Dent corn when grown comparably at the Experiment Station in Lancaster County. The northern seed obtained from 100 miles farther north matured a week earlier and the plants were distinctly shorter and of lighter weight; the ears were smaller, the kernels shorter and smoother, and the shelling percentage and shrinkage of ear corn was also somewhat less. The table gives a similar comparison of Lancaster County and Lincoln County acclimated Calico corn. When compared at the Experiment Station, Lincoln County seed, acclimated 210 miles west, produced plants which ripened 12 days earlier, were 15 inches shorter, and had a somewhat lower shrinkage and shelling percentage of ear corn. The leaf area per plant was only about two-thirds as great, the ears were smaller and smoother, and the kernel length shorter.

On the other hand, it is possible to secure regional strains within each of these varieties, adapted to various sections, which differ greatly in their growth habits and relative yields when grown comparably. It is more important to know to what conditions a corn has become adapted than to know the variety to which it belongs. The original variety name of many of our best Nebraska corns is obscure.

The farmer's main corn crop is more likely to lack full adapta - tion in this State by virtue of being too large and late rather than too small and early maturing. Km. 4. — Rough and smooth ear types of Reid Yellow Dent corn. Top: This is a typical, old fashioned, rough, deep kerneled, soft - starchy show type of ear. Boiiom: This is a somewhat more slender, fewer rowed, shallower grained, dimple dented, horny type which has out yielded the type at top during a period of 12 years at the Nebraska Experiment Station, and also in co-operative tests with farmers. Under known conditions of production the ear type may reflect hereditary adaptation differences in the vegetative growth habits of the plant. Selection of seed ears for great uniformity may result in a slight reduction of yield thru restricted or close breeding and should be avoided. Under such circumstances the corn may often advantag - eously be made both smaller and earlier by selection. This may be accomplished in several ways: (1) Direct selection of the normally early ripening plants. (2) Indirect selection for earliness by selecting for seed, (a) ears that are some - what smoother, hornier, shallower grained, more slender and fewer rowed than has been customary, and (b) seed borne </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 188 on plants that are somewhat shorter, less leafy, and have the ears lower on the stalk than the average for the crop as a whole. All these characters tend to be associated together, and greater earliness or lateness may be secured by selection of any or all of these characters for either extreme. A large number of ears should always be mixed for seed in order to insure against fertilization by pollen from closely related plants, as this is likely to reduce the yield. Extreme uniform - ity of plant and ear type should be avoided for the same rea - son. RELATION OF EAR TYPK TO YIELD OK CORN During the 6 years, 1906-1910, long, smooth ears of Reid Yellow Dent corn with kernels of only medium depth were compared for yield at the Nebraska Experiment Station with the standard medium rough corn of the same variety. Con - tinuous selection of the smooth ears was practiced in this test . As an average for the 6 years, the long, smooth ears yielded 57.3 bushels, and the standard type 53.3 bushels per acre. In a 2-year test (1916-1917) with Hogue Yellow Dent com seed ears with relatively shallow, smooth kernels surpassed ears with deep, rough kernels by 5.6 bushels, and the original corn from which both types were selected by 5.1 bushels per acre. In a 6-year test witn Nebraska White Prize corn, the long, slender, smooth type of ear outyielded the large, rough, deep kerneled type by 5 bushels per acre, and also slightly out - yielded the original Nebraska White Prize, from which both types were selected each year. This is a gain of 9.3 per cent for the smooth over the large rough type. The yields for the various ear types of all 3 varieties are summarized in Table 5. Altogether these results suggest that a definite improve - ment would result from selecting a somewhat longer, more slender, smoother type of seed ear, with more horny and shal - lower kernels than is now customary. This type of ear prob - ably yields more, for the reason that the plants grown from it are commonly slightly smaller and earlier maturing. Both of these qualities are elements in relative adaptedness where the tendency has been to grow a type that is too large and late maturing. </seg>
            <seg id="p015">Productive Seed Corn 15 Many of the best corn growers in the State have become convinced that the long slender, smooth or dimple dent type of ear is superior to the large, rough, deep kerneled ear. Fur - ther evidence of the undesirable nature of deep grained corn was secured indirectly in 1917. The ears harvested on De - cember 29 from a field of Hogue Yellow Dent corn at the Experiment Station were divided into groups according to their apparent soundness, maturity, and solidity.

SELECTION FOR FREEDOM KKOM ROT DISEASES Investigators in several states, notably Illinois and In - diana, have concluded from their experiments that certain so - called "root, stalk and ear rot" diseases are prevalent and very destructive of corn in their respective states. Methods for detecting and eliminating infected seed ears by means of germination tests of individual ears have been described in the U. S. Department of Agriculture Fanners' Bulletin No. 1176 and the Indiana Agricultural Experiment Station Bul - letin No. 224. Approximately 1,450 ears of local Hogue Yellow Dent and Nebraska White Prize corn were subjected at the Nebraska Experiment Station in the early spring of 1921, to the rag doll germinator test for diseases described in these bulletins. One hundred and ten ears which appeared to be disease free and 99 ears which appeared to be badly diseased, according to the recommended germinator tests, were compared for yield in duplicate ear-to-row plats, as well as in composite. The diseased and disease free selections averaged respectively 50.6 and 50.2 bushels per acre, as compared with 49.7 bushels for the original corn. The crops grown from these 3 groups showed no material difference in field germination, growth, lodging, barrenness, diseased plants, or diseased ears.* In view of the fact that this was a very carefully con - ducted yield test and represented many ears, it would appear that the proposed individual ear germinator test for disease is not likely to prove practical or effective for farm applica - tion under our conditions. On the other hand, when the yields of all the ears included in the above ear-to-row yield test were classified according to ear type, the rough, medium and smooth ears averaged re - spectively 50.4, 52, and 53.5 bushels per acre, as compared with 51.3 bushels for the original corn. This confirms previous ear type investigations to the effect that the smoother ear types surpass both the rough and the original corn. •These results were corroborated by tests made in 192 </seg>
            <seg id="p017">Productive Seed Corn 17 SELECTION FOR VARIOUS PLANT CHARACTERS Experiments covering a 5-year period and involving the continuous selection for certain plant characters have indi - cated that the prevailing plant type within an ordinary com - mercial variety of corn may be definitely changed by mass selection in the field. Such changes were secured with regard to ears being borne high or low on the plants, ears drooping or erect, leaves narrow or wide, leaf area high or low, plants high or low, and stalks erect or lodged. Selections for single plant characters within a well adapted variety did not show any appreciable increase in yield of corn, but continued selec - tion of seed ears from lodged plants definitely decreased yields. COMPARATIVE YIELD OF SEED FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF EAR The butts, middles, and tips of a large number of Nebraska White Prize ears were shelled separately and tested for yield during each of 6 years. The average yields for the butts, middles, and tips were 59.4, 60.2, and 60.4 bushels per acre, respectively. These tests indicate that seed from the various parts of an ear yield about equally and that little is to be gained from discarding butts and tips in preparing seed corn, aside from a somewhat more uniform dropping by the corn planter, and a better germination under certain conditions of freezing injury. In years of late maturity and early frosts, injury to germination by freezing has been found most severe at the butt of the ear. RELATION OF SEED MATURITY TO YIELD OF GRAIN In years of late maturity the question of special field selection of slightly immature seed corn to escape frost injury commonly arises. A 2-year test indicates that carefully cured corn selected midway between silking and maturity may pos - sess both high germinative and yielding ability. Corn selected at 5 weekly intervals before it was ripe yielded in no case more than 2 per cent less than fully matured seed. Even tho viability and yield may not be impaired by the selection of immature corn for seed, thoro field curing should be prac - ticed as far as possible to reduce difficulty in its final curing and preservation. The above test does not include the effect of unfavorable growth conditions which occur in some seasons. </seg>
            <seg id="p018">18 Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 188 It is possible that small immaturely harvested seeds would be handicapped under unfavorable climatic, or seed bed con - ditions. If properly cured, seed which has reached the dent - ing or the glazing stage is sufficiently developed for planting under any circumstances. KKKECT OF TIME OK KKLKCTIO.X AM) l'KKKKRVATK&gt;X OV SKKU CORN VPON VIKI.K The object of this test was to determine the effect of the time of harvesting mature seed corn upon its yielding ability, provided care is taken in selection to obtain equally high germination. Comparative yield tests were made in 1915, 1916, and 1917, of September, November, and March field selections made from Nebraska White Prize corn grown at the Experiment Station. The seed was carefully preserved in a dry, well ventilated place upon being harvested. Only seed ears were selected which showed a bright clear germ and thereby promised good germination. A large number of ears were mixed for each selection. As an average for the 3 years, seed selected for high germination from the field in Septem - ber, November, and March, yielded respectively 47.0. 48.3, and 49.8 bushels per acre as compared with 49.2 bushels for seed selected in the ordinary way at the time of husking in the fall. The results indicate that corn which has been left stand - ing in the field during the cold of winter may yield quite as well as specially fall selected seed, provided its germinative power has not been impaired. Frost injury and moisture content of the grain are closely correlated. The time and manner of seed corn preservation may therefore vary in dif - ferent seasons according to prevailing conditions. Neverthe - less, it is good practice to select sped corn before possible frost iniury because it is often exceedingly difficult and trying to select viable seed after such injury. CORX KKKKDIM. An attempt has been made in these experiments to improve the yield of local, well adapted, productive varieties of dent corn. Since established productive varieties are now available for all parts of the State, due to continued local growth, such varieties should commonly serve as the basis for attempts at improvement. </seg>
            <seg id="p019">Productive Seed Corn 19 Any commercial variety of corn must be recognized as a very mixed population. Every plant in a cornfield is a hybrid, whose hereditary characteristics are determined by the inheri - tance which it received from its 2 parents. The kernel of corn, rather than the ear, is the unit of propagation. Under field conditions the individual kernels on an ear, being sub - ject to independent fertilization, may all have different pollen parents. When planted, the plants from such an ear may all differ more or less in some characteristics. The object of corn breeding is to isolate from the mass variety by certain modes of selection and testing that inheri - tance which results in the maximum production of sound grain per acre. Investigation has shown that one of the prerequi - sites for such improvement is to avoid any practice which is likely to result in seed that was extensively fertilized by pollen from closely related plants. This invariably reduces the producing power of the seed. The closest possible degree of parental relationship occurs when a kernel is fertilized by pollen from the plant upon which it is borne. The usual effect of such self-fertilization during a single year is to lower the yield of the ensuing crop about one-third. If con - tinued during 5 or 6 years, the average yield gradually de - creases until a constant low level of approximately one-third normal production is reached. Such continued inbreeding never occurs under ordinary field conditions, but by continued close selection to a given plant or ear type close fertilization may occur to an extent which will reduce the yield per acre by several bushels. A similar result may occur from increasing the supply of seed for future planting from a single ear. K \K lo-ltow BREEDING Ear-to-row breeding began at this Station in 1902, and has continued in some form since then. It consists in the separate comparative yield determination of individual ears of a com - mercial variety, planted in field test plats, with the object of isolating the more productive strains. An ear-to-row strain is the progeny in direct line of descent from an individual ear of corn. Several different methods for continuing the high yield - ing ear-to-row strains as determined by the initial ear-to-row tests have been compared at this Station for the 2 local var - ieties, Hogue Yellow Dent and Nebraska White Prize. None </seg>

It appears that much of the earlier enthusiasm for ear-to-row breeding was based upon the indication of superiority in the initial tests of the "mother" ears before the work had pro - gressed sufficiently far to make more extensive practical field progeny tests. NATIRAL tX&gt;MPKTlTlOX AS A KA&lt;TOK IX CORN IHPROVKMUXT Competition and survival of the fittest has long been recog - nized as a principle in the evolution of living organisms. In - vestigation has been made with 2 varieties of corn, Hoguo Yellow Dent and Nebraska White Prize, to determine whether this natural principle might be utilized in the improvement of corn. With reference to this principle, corn was planted in 3 rather large plats at the rates of 1, 3, and 5 plants, respec - tively, in hills 44 inches apart. In the case of Hogue Yellow Dent corn, continuous seeding at the 3 rates has been carried on since 1905. and with the other variety since 1911. Each year from 30 to 50 of the best developed ears produced under the respective planting rates were mixed for continuing the seed the next year. The seed ears were harvested from the standing stalks to be cer - tain that they actually came from the best plants growing at the specified rates. Some of the seed selected from these respective increase plats was tested each year for yield at the normal planting rate. As an average for both varieties, when tested at the normal planting rate, the seed grown oreviously at the respec - tive rates of 1. 3 and 5 Dlants ner hill yielded 45.8. 46.7 and 47.0 bushels per acre. These data do not indicate sufficient advantage to the farmer to warrant growing his seed corn in a specially thick planted seed plat. DETASSKI,1N&lt;; POOR STALKS IX A SKKI) PLAT During the period of 1906 to 1917 a seed plat was main - tained in which the poorest appearing half of the stalks were annually detasseled in order to avoid fertilization by their pollen.

IKKKIT I I-ON &gt;ll.l&gt; VALUE OV SELECTING SEED EARS FROM DETASSELE1) PLANTS During the 8 years, 1912 to 1917, and 1920 to 1921, a yield test was made of Nebraska White Prize seed corn which had been produced on detasseled plants, as compared with seed from plants not having the tassels removed. In the seed plat, planted to ordinary wind fertilized corn, 8 or more alternating rows were detasseled each year, and the 100 best developed ears were saved from both the detasseled and tasseled rows to furnish seed for the following year's yield test. The test con - sisted of single rows 16 rods in length, and were duplicated 6 or more times each year. The air dry yields were based upon the first 50 hills, in each row, containing 3 plants and sur - rounded by a normal stand. As an average for the 8 years, the seed harvested from the detasseled rows yielded 48.6 bushels per acre, compared with 48.3 bushels for the seed from the normal rows. It is evident from these data that the amount of self-fertilization which actually occurs under our ordinary field conditions is negligible and no material advantage results from selecting seed from detasseled rows. &lt; kossim; varieties An investigation was carried on with 14 varieties during 4 years, 1914-1917, to determine what effect the crossing of varieties might have upon the yield of dent corn. The var - ieties used were selected so as to include a wide diversity of growth characteristics. Thirteen hybrids and their parents were tested each year. Their male parent thruout was Hogue Yellow Dent, while the female parent was different in each case. The first generation hybrid seed was produced by plant - ing rows of the varieties to serve as the female parents be - tween rows of the Hogue Yellow Dent. All varieties except the Hogue were kept detasseled, in order to insure their cross fertilization with Hogue Yellow Dent. The date of planting the different varieties for hybridizing was so adjusted that their flowering period would coincide with that of the Hogue Yellow Dent. Second and third generation hybrids were pro - duced by artificially close breeding a number of ears in the </seg>
            <seg id="p022">22 Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 188 first and second generations with mixed pollen from a number of plants, and corresponded to a farmer's selection of seed ears from his first generation and second generation hybrid plants. Not any of these variety crosses showed an increased yield above the better of the 2 parents. As an average for all the first generation hybrids, the yield was 1.6 bushels lower than the average for both parents, and 4 bushels lower than for the best parent. The most productive cross, Reid Yellow Dent by Hogue Yellow Dent, averaged 45.0 bushels during the 4 years, whereas the yields of the 2 parents, Reid Yellow Dent and Hogue Yellow Dent, averaged 44.9 and 45.2 bushels per acre, respectively. Later generations of these variety hybrids yielded on an average approximately the same as the first gen - eration. These results do not suggest an improvement from crossing well adapted varieties except where seed selection has been so restricted that a measurable degree of close breed - ing has resulted. The method of crossing 2 varieties for seed each year would seem to have no advantage over securing seed from a single productive variety of the type desired. PRODUCTION" OF I'IKK LINKS AM) TMr.lli HYIUtllHZATION The most promising of all methods of corn breeding that have so far been investigated consists in the hybridization of "pure lines" that have been developed from adapted varieties by inbreeding. The practical application of this method to farm conditions is still in the experimental stage and it will be several years, at least, before the farmers of the State may possibly benefit by the new practice. This new method recognizes that any variety of corn is a very complex hybrid combination of good, bad, and indifferent qualities many of which are inherited independently of each other. Thru continuous artificial inbreeding or self-fertiliza - tion for a period of years, the germ plasm of the resulting pure line is so purified that all of the progeny plants carry identical inheritance in all of their reproductive cells. Some of these pure lines represent good qualities borne in the parent variety and others, undesirable qualities. It is found upon crossing these pure lines with each other that some combina - tions are superior to the original corn, while others are in - ferior. The practical application of this method of corn im - provement is to develop a number of pure lines, and to de- </seg>

The superiority of some of these first generation hybrids over the original corn appears to be marked. New seed must be produced each year by crossing the inbred strains. Seed selected from the field of first generation hybrid plants has a fine appearance, but is very inferior in yielding capacity and should be avoided. In the Nebraska Experiment Station tests, such second generation seed has yielded less than two-thirds as much as the first generation hybrid seed. It is hoped that other and simpler methods of applying this weeding out process of self-fertilization and hybridization may be developed. The Experiment Station is undertaking to determine the most practical method for applying this ap - parently sound principle of corn improvement. ItKLATION OK STAND TO YIKLD OK OOHN In connection with another experiment both Hogue Yellow Dent and Nebraska White Prize corn have been grown for a period of years at the rates of 1, 3, and 5 plants per hill. The results are given in Table 6. As an average for 7 years Hogue Yellow Dent yielded 36.6, 44.6, and 40.3 bushels per acre, re - spectively, for 1, 3, and 5 plants per hill. As an average for 8 years the Nebraska White Prize yielded 37.1, 52.9, and 49.4 bushels per acre at the same respective planting rates. The yield of the thin stand is augmented by an increased number of ear bearing suckers, more 2 eared stalks, larger ears, and fewer barren plants. The reverse correlations hold for the thick planting rate. Hogue Yellow Dent is a much more freely suckering variety than is Nebraska White Prize, which enables it to yield relatively better at a very thin rate of planting. Comparative results obtained with the 5 planting rates of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 plants per hill during a 4-year period, 1914 - 1917, are given in Table 7. The grain yields for these rates were respectively 40.7, 49.4, 52.9, 50.7, and 49.3 bushels per acre. It is very evident that there may be considerable varia - tion in stand, fluctuating about 3 per hill without a material effect upon yield. A stand ranging from about 2.5 to 3.0 plants per hill appears to be the optimum for local varieties under Experiment Station conditions. This rate should be gradually reduced from the eastern toward the western part </seg>

It is not advisable to plant corn thicker than is necessary to obtain the maximum yield since the thicker plant - ing produces more small ears which makes husking more laborious. In these rate-of-planting tests the corn had been planted thick and was thinned so as to insure the actual stand of plants indicated. \l».ll STI\«.

Investigations indicate that these smaller and earlier maturing sorts should be planted at a rela - tively thicker rate. This may be illustrated by a 3-year comparison at the Ne - braska Experiment Station of the standard large full season variety, Hogue Yellow Dent, and the small early variety, Min - nesota No. 23. In plant height the latter averaged 30 inches shorter and matured 16 days earlier.

Hogue Yellow Dent yielded 10 per cent less at the 5, than at the 3 plants per hill rate, while the Minnesota No. 23 yielded 21 per cent more at the 5, than at the 3 rate. Under conditions where the standard, full season varieties are normally planted at a thinner rate than 3 plants per hill, a corresponding reduction should also be made from the 5 plant rate for the smaller types. During the 5 years, 1915-1917 and 1920-1921, an investiga - tion was made to determine the effect of varied distribution of plants upon the yield of grain per acre. While the number of plants per acre was the same in all cases, the number of plants in adjacent hills differed. The methods of distribution compared, and the average yields per acre were as follows: (1) All hills with uniformly 3 plants. Yield 59 bushels. (3) Alternating hills with 2 and 4 plants. Yield 59.2 bushels. (3) Alternating hills with 1, 3, and 5 plants. Yield 56.1 bushels. (4) Alternating hills with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 plants. Yield 58.6 bushels. The results indicate that the 3 irregular distributions averaged 58 bushels per acre, as compared with 59 bushels for the uniformly 3 plants per hill rate. Alternating hills with 2 and 4 plants yielded fully as well as did uniformly 3 plants per hill. Alternating hills of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 plants per hill yielded 0.4 bushels less, and the alternating hills of 1, 3, and 5 plants yielded 2.9 bushels less. These data suggest that corn plants of the larger varieties, at least, draw upon the soil fertility and moisture for such a distance that considerable irregularity in stand may exist without markedly affecting the yield.

            <seg id="p031">• Productive Seed Corn 31 When exposed to a temperature range of 16 J to 12° F., the first reduction in germination occurred at a moisture content of 20 to 25 per cent and germination ceased entirely with corn containing 35 per cent. With a temperature of 8 to 4° F., the first reduction in viability occurred in corn containing 15 to 20 per cent mois - ture and germination ceased at 30 per cent. When the temperature between zero and 5 degrees below zero, the germination fell off strikingly when the corn contained as much as 15 to 20 per cent moisture content and ceased at 20 per cent. Fig. 6. — Vertical and cross sections of the grain of dent corn, showing the germ and distribution of horny and soft starchy endosperm. Usually when the germ has been killed by freezing, it turns dark in color. Farmers are accustomed to testing the viability of their seed by ex - posing and examining the appearance of the tip of the germ. For practical purposes this Is usually a reliable method. THK l&gt; WI.KK LINK OK PKKKZINU INJVHY An approximate safety zone free from freezing injury may be established for seed corn differing in moisture content. The combinations of freezing temperatures and their duration which seed corn will withstand as indicated in Fig. 7 are con - structed from numerous tests at this Station and should be re - garded as approximate rather than absolute. They set forth the probable duration of a given low temperature which corn of a given moisture content will withstand without injury. A slight lowering of the temperature or a longer duration of the exposure may initiate a reduction in the per cent germina - tion at the moistures indicated but will not prove entirely fatal. Greater fatality will result as the adverse factors are extended. </seg>

            <seg id="p033">Productive Seed Corn 33 It will be noted that in general an extension of the time of exposure is comparatively as dangerous as is the lowering of the temperature, until the moisture content in the grain is reduced to 17 to 20 per cent where it manifests a decidedly greater resistance to the duration of exposure. When the moisture content is below 14 per cent corn will endure any natural low winter temperature for any length of time. The chart indicates that: (1) Corn containing 60 per cent moisture will withstand temperatures of 28 F. and 20° F. for periods of 8 and 4 hours, respectively. (2) Corn having a water content of 50 per cent will withstand temperatures of 28 , 24°, and 20° F. for periods of 12, 8, and 4 hours, respectively. (3) Corn containing 40 per cent moisture will endure freezing temperatures of 28 \ 24°, 20°. 16°, and 12° F. for periods of 16, 12, 9, 6, and 4 hours, respectively. (4) Corn containing 30 per cent moisture will withstand freezmg temperatures of 28 , 24°, 20°, 16°, 12°, 8°, and 4 F. for periods of 24, 20, 14, 9, 6, 4 and 2 hours, respectively. (5) Corn containing 25 per cent moisture will endure temperatures of 24°, 20°, 16°, 12 , 8°, and 4° F. for periods of 24, 18, 12, 8, 6, and 4 hours, respectively. (6) Corn containing 20 per cent moisture will withstand temperatures of 16 , 12°, 8°, 4°, and 0° F. for periods of 24, 16, 12, 8, and 5 hours, respectively. (7) Corn containing 17 per cent moisture will endure temperatures of 4°, zero and 4° below zero F. for periods of 24, 16, and 6 hours, respectively. (8) Air dry corn containing less than 14 per cent mois - ture will withstand all natural low temperatures indefinitely. These data clearly suggest that corn is subject to freezing injury after it is ripe, whether in the field or in the crib until it is thoroly cured. </seg>
            <seg id="p034">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 188 34 MKTHODS OK COMPARING tX)KN VIKI.IO ON THK FARM The local testing by farmers of corn varieties, regional strains, and selections, has become so common and the results have so much importance attached to them, that an under - standing of reliable methods is desirable. The information to be had from such tests may have great import, but may be very misleading if unreliable methods are used. Fields are seldom uniform in productivity. It is not uncommon for adjacent 5-acre tracts to differ as much as 5 or 10 bushels in yield per acre, even tho the crops in both are given similar treatment. Various parts within a 5-acre field may also differ fully as much in productivity. Even tho the land looks uni - form such variations are likely to exist. These differences may be due to native differences in the soil factors such as contour and composition, or they may be due to the unequal effect of previous cropping, tillage, or fertilizing treatments. It becomes apparent at once that such soil irregularities must be overcome in order to permit a dependable crop comparison. Furthermore, crop yields are so variable due to seasonal cli - matic variations that many comparative tests should extend over a period of years before definite conclusions are drawn. Investigations of methods have clearly shown that long narrow plats of land within the same field are more compara - ble than short wide plats. The nearer these plats are to each other the more likely are they to possess the same yielding capacity. Accordingly, if only a few kinds of corn are to be compared, a relatively small area of land will be needed for all, and the results will be more comparable than if many sorts were being compared with a necessary extension of the tests over larger territory. In any comparison, it is usually desirable to duplicate the entire test at least once or twice, and average the duplicate plats for final results. Whenever the various kinds of corn differ appreciably in their vegetative growth characteristics, there is likely to be an abnormal competition between adjacent unlike rows for the available moisture and plant food. Error in comparative tests resulting from such competition should then be overcome by planting at least 3 or 4 rows in each plat, discarding the border rows from the yield test. Care should be taken to have comparable planting rates and stands. This may best be done by planting the corn somewhat thicker and later thinning to the desired number of plants per hill when the corn </seg>
            <seg id="p035">Productive Seed Corn 35 is 4 or 5 inches high. Fairly comparable results may also be had by use of a corn planter set to plant the various sorts at as nearly the desired rate as possible. A slight variation in stand, amounting to perhaps 5 to 10 per cent, in the number of seeds dropped per row cannot be avoided by this planter method. The error due to such a variation of 10 per cent in stand is not likely to affect yields more than about 2 per cent, if 4 row plats are used and the border rows discarded from the yield test. If a farmer wishes to compare his own regular seed with another sort, a much better comparison may usually be had by planting and harvesting adjacent narrow plats of this kind than by planting a larger tract of each for separate tests. Since moisture content and shelling percentage are large factors in determining the relative yields of dry shelled grain per acre, these should be taken into consideration in the final comparison of results. It is usually desirable to save a large bag of each kind of corn of known weight at husking time, for reweighing and shelling when air dry in the following spring. A few simple accurate yield tests of important prac - tices may be good business and a source of much satisfaction to the fanner. [4-'2S-10M| </seg>
