            <seg id="p020">20 LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT RULES AND REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO THE LEASING AND SALE OF EDUCATIONAL LANDS Lease Contracts The Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings may at least once in each year designate a day and hour for offering in a public manner, at the office of the county treasurer in the respective counties, lease contracts on all of the educational lands, which may be subject to lease in that county at the time of such offering. The same shall be subject to lease at an annual rental of six (6) per cent on the ap - praised value. Provided, that if two or more parties desire to lease the same land, the officer having control of the auction shall lease to the person who will pay the greater amount of cash bonus in addi - tion to six (6) per cent on the appraised value as annual rental. Lease rentals are due in two installments, January 1 and July 1 of each year. If not paid within six months after due, the lease hold - ers are declared delinquent and notice is sent them if their postoffice addresses are known; if unknown, advertisement is made in a news - paper. Ninety days after date of such notice lease contracts are de - clared forfeited and are subject to auction thereafter. (See Fees.) Delinquent lease holders are not permitted to bid at the sale of the lands they have forfeited, but at any time before the land is actually put on the auction block they may reinstate their leases by paying all back rentals and penalty fees. (See Fees.) All school lands under lease are subject to appraisement at any time the Board of Educational Lands and Funds so elect. All leases expire twenty-five years from the first day of January next ensuing after the date of the lease. All lessees have the right, at the expiration of their lease, to apply to the County Treasurer for a new lease and receive the same without competition, at the same time surrendering the old lease, paying rentals six months in advance and a lease fee of fifty cents. This will do away with the public auction only in cases where the former lessee does not apply for new lease. In such cases, the lands will be advertised and leased at public auction to the highest bidder, and all improvements on the land shall be appraised by the County Board. Improvements to be included in such appraisements shall be all buildings, orchards, trees, fencing, wells, cisterns, windmills, pumps, tanks, irrigation improvements, and also costs for labor ex - pended in breaking sod on said tract of land and reducing same to cultivation, and for alfalfa or other crops growing upon said land. The appraisment shall be made within thirty (30) days after the acceptance of the bid. (See page 175, Laws of Nebraska, 1923.) Where lands are forfeited on account of non-payment of rentals the movable improvements are sold under the direction of the Commis- </seg>

The amount of school land authorized to be leased, direct or by renewal, to one person is limited to 640 acres. . ...... EDUCATIONAL LANDS MAY BE PURCHASED FROM THE STATE AS FOLLOWS: Lands known as isolated tracts; lands situated in the irrigation districts, and lands for the use of churches, cemeteries, school house sites, county agricultural fairs and public roads. Any lessee of land situated within the areas irrigated or to be irri - gated from irrigation works constructed or controlled (or to be con - structed or controlled by the United States or its duly authorized agencies) or any lessee of any forty-acre tract or government sub - division, any part of which is under irrigation, may purchase the same. (See page 1S5, Laws of Nebraska, 1923.) The law also provides that if any forty (40) acre tract adjacent to other school land which is wholly or partly under irrigation and therefore subject to sale, such tract may be sold even though not under irrigation, if in the opinion of the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings it is expedient to sell the same. Any irrigation districts in which there is, or may be any educational lands belonging to the state which are or may hereafter become sites for reservior purposes, may purchase from the state for reservoir sites such educational land, or portion thereof. (See page 358, Laws of Nebraska, 1925.) The law provides that the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings shall make a list of all isolated tracts of school lands con - taining less than forty (40) acres and all undivided interests in realty and all city lots held by the State of Nebraska in trust for the per - manent school fund; appraise same, and upon the expiration of the leases and where the lease title has been forfeited, offer the same for sale at public auction. To be sold by the County Treasurer of the county in which the lands are located, to the highest bidder for not less than ninety (90) per cent of the appraised value. The purchaser shall pay not less than twenty-five (25) per cent in cash on day of sale, and the balance to be secured by sale contract running ten years at six (6) per cent annual interest; the purchaser having the right to pay all of the unpaid purchase money, or any part of it in multiples of five (5) per cent of the total purchase price at any interest payment date. In the event the purchaser or the assignee does not pay the annual interest upon the unpaid purchase price within six (6) months after interest becomes due, the land shall revert to the state.

            <seg id="p022">22 LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT land is situated; provided all interest at that time earned and due has first been paid; and when the principal is paid in full, other than the first of the year, interest upon the obligation having been paid for the entire year, the County Treasurer, receiving such principal payments may refund to the payor, out of any interest money then in his hands, the interest so paid in advance in excess of the amount earned and due at the time said final payment is made. Refund receipts are furnished by the Land Commissioner for this purpose. All unpaid principal on sale contracts draws interest at five (5) per cent per annum, payable annually on January first of each year, in advance. Sale contract holders making final payment to the County Treasurer should also surrender their contracts, that same may be forwarded to Land Commissioner with receipts showing the full pay - ment. NOTES No assignment of a school land lease or sale contract is valid until recorded in the office of the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings, and will not be recorded if any interest or rental is due at the time said assignment is offered for record. The original sale or lease contract must be sent in with the assignment or the latter will not be recorded. The contract will be returned with the recorded assignments. When a sub-division of not less than forty acres in any contract is assigned, a new number is given the assigned portion on the ledger account, and a certified copy of the original should be given to the a* signee. When assignments are made as above, the original contract must be reduced and the interest or rental* as the case may be is ad - justed to the new conditions. Whenever a lease or sale contract becomes lost or destroyed, a certified copy of the same may be procured by filing an affidavit of lost contract. Such copies may be used in lieu of the original for the purpose of passing title. When interest on a sale contract or rental on a lease contract is not paid when due, the county treasurers will collect "penalty" in - terest at 7 per cent for the time purchaser or lessee has been tardy in making such payments. Improvements on leased land, and the owner's equity in land under sale contract are subject to taxation. County treasurers are requested to send in school land receipts at least once each week. Sometimes tardiness in this particular leads to considerable unnecessary correspondence and occasionally to delin - quencies being charged against contract holders who are not in arrears, but whose receipts have not been sent to the Land Commis - sioner's office. </seg>

Conroy, Ogallala Deputy Edward Johnson, Orleans Deputy Chas. Gardner, Sidney Deputy The original evidence of land surveys, consisting of more than eight hundred bound books of field notes and the official plats de - rived and made up therefrom, were transferred to the state, under the provisions of Sections 2218, 2219 and 2220, United States Revised Statutes, and are in the custody of this office. A resume of the law governing the care of these records and the duties of the state surveyor, as set forth by Mr. Robert Harvey in a previous Biennial Report, is as follows: "The statutes of 1903 defined the duties of the State Surveyor and Draughtsman, and placed in his direct charge, under the supervision of the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings, the field notes, and all other records of the Government Surveys of Public Lands in the state, conduct the correspondence pertaining to the surreys, grievances or disputes growing out of conflicting surveys of lands and lots, to prepare the advice or instructions and opinions and issue a circular of instructions to county surveyors of the state for their direction and guidance in the restoration and establishment of lines and preservation of corners, in conformity with the laws, rules and regulations govern - ing the surveys of the United States and establishing rules of survey - ing, and perform such other duties as may be required by the Com - missioner; and in case of any disputes among land owners or by reason of any survey of boundaries of lands within the state, or of disputes or disagreements between surveyors as to the survey of boundaries, when petitioned for, shall be referred to the State Sur - veyor, who is made the arbitrator to determine and settle such disputes by making the necessary examinations and surveys to settle the same, and whose decisions shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness thereof." "The law also provides for an appeal to the courts from decisions of the State Surveyor in making such surveys by any person having an interest in the lands affected by such surveys." "It also provides that the per diem of the surveyor for each day's service while engaged in field work and necessary expenses shall be paid by the parties having the work done. The per diem of the State Surveyor is to be paid into the general fund of the state. The law was amended in 1909, providing for the appointment of experienced and competent land surveyors as deputies. The law was also amended in 1919, which provided that when surveys were made by the State Sur- </seg>

We, the undersigned land owners in section. hereby petition (or a survey of the following lines. Township No North, Range No West, East, in.. County, Nebraska, and request that the State Surveyor make an ex - amination and survey of said lines. We agree to make an advance deposit of such sum as may be re - quested by you to be applied in payment of the office fees for copying the necessary field notes and maps for the surveyor's use, examination of the surveyor's notes and maps of survey, and of the surveyor's per diem and his necessary expenses. We further agree to pay such additional sum as may be necessary to complete the survey, for material necesssary in making the corners of said survey and county surveyor's fee for recording. Respectfully, Witnesses: Names of Applicants: Note: One dollar filing fee must accompany each application. See Sections 4864 to 4870 inclusive, Compiled Statutes of Nebras - ka, 1922. "A resurvey must be initiated at some well-defined, identified, and unquestioned starting point on the original surveys. It must termin - ate at some equally well-known and identified point." Hence it is often necessary to extend measurements beyond the lines required in the immediate survey in order to ascertain the correct location of the corners required. </seg>

Separate surveys must not be included in the same application. Blanks will be furnished when requested. Upon receipt of an application with the proper fee, the records are consulted and an estimate made of the probable cost, and an advance deposit to be applied in payment for copying field notes, the surveyor's per diem and expenses, and other costs incidental to the survey, is required. Extra help and material for marking corners is to be fur - nished by the applicant. Each application is given a serial number in the order of its filing and all records of surveys made under such application contain this number. The state surveyor or some deputy is assigned the task of making the required survey and furnishing complete field notes, maps etc. which are carefully examined and checked in this office. Finally, after approval by the commissioner, the complete maps, field notes and accompanying memoranda are made a part of the rec - ords of this office, and a certified copy is filed in the county surveyor's office in the county where the survey is made. After the work is completed, approved and properly placed on record, any excess payment is refunded to the applicant. Neither the state surveyor nor any deputy has authority to make any state survey without special commission referring thereto. DAN SWANSON Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings. We require a deposit to protect our deputies; and on the other hand, to protect our applicants, no deputy is paid until his work is carefully examined and approved by the commissioner.
