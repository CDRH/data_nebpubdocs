Entered a:-- second class matter, February 6th, 1914, at the Post - oince, Seward, Nebraska, under the act of July 16th, 1894.

            <seg id="p003">SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT I publish in this issue of the bulletin a complete index of the laws, rules and regulations adopted by the State Board of Health. The intention was to have this index embodied in the publication but the printer neglected to do so. I would advise that it be removed and placed in the original issue or that this bulletin be kept convenient as reference to the same.- The index is quite exhaustive but will be of material benefit to those who consult the laws, rules and regulations, as you will note the rule and page is given, also the sections giving the statutes governing same. I am very sorry that this was not embodied ia the original issue but hope that this will in a way overcome that mistake. — Editor. NOTICE I wish to correct a mistake that was made in publishing our laws, rules and regulations pertaining to measles and whooping - cough, which should have been included in Rule 5, page 30. Health officers and physicians will please note this. I would suggest that you write in your laws, rules and regulations measles and whooping cough following scarlet fever in Rule 5. This was an oversight on the part of the copyist. A fly's feet are never clean. Just pause and think of all the places where you have seen flies walking about, and then decide that you do not want the manure or typhoid-fly using your milk for a foot bath, your bread for a dcor mat, or your butter for a skating rink. — Health Bulletin. No one except the injured party will object if you swat at an imaginary fly on the nose of the man who spits on the floor. — Good Health. </seg>

Up to the present issue, I have received requests from the fol - lowing County Superintendents asking that the names of the teachers in their respective counties be placed on our mailing list : J. M. Matzen, County Superintendent, Dodge County. Emma R. Miller, County Superintendent, Cuming County. N. A. Housel, County Superintendent, Madison County. Charles Speedie, County Superintendent, Otoe County. Emma Schwerin, County Superintendent, Cedar County. N. Lund, County Superintendent, Washington County. The following Boards of Education have requested that bulletins be sent to their teachers. Frank A. Doten, Secretary Board of Education, Albion, Nebr. M. H. Ryan, Secretary Board of Education, Homer, Nebr. Dr. M. A. Hoover, Vice-President Board of Education, Kearney, Nebr. We have appreciated the interest shown by the teachers in hygiene over the state. Among those who have asked for bulletins for use in class work, are the following : Annette Brindley, Teacher of Hygiene, Chadron, Nebr. Gertrude H. Gardner, Dean of Women, Kearney State Normal, Kearney, Nebr. Mabelle Hunter, Teacher of Hygiene, Aurora, Nebr. From time to time we have received inquiries from various sources concerning the bulletins and asking that their names be added to our mailing list. All this has been gratifying to us show - ing that our efforts in this publication have been appreciated, and that public health and sanitation is considered an important sub - ject by the laity. </seg>
            <seg id="p026">26 NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF HEALTH I wish to apoligize for the short-comings of the bulletin but ask you to consider that our limited facilities and appropriations for the maintenance of the same have been such that for the past year we have been denied the salary of a stenographer, and all the financial aid that has been granted was for printing and postage. We have continued to publish the bulletin under these adverse conditions for the reason that we felt that Nebraska should be placed as near on a par with other states as was possible. In order that this might be done most of the expense of the same has been furnished by voluntary contributions. The interest that has been manifested by the public, and espe - cially by educators, encourages us to believe that such a publica - tion is wanted. We feel that the people of this state are going to demand that the health of our citizens be considered of sufficient importance to demand a liberal appropriation, and that those who administer the affairs of the state will be expected to cooperate with those who have been chosen to protect the citizens of this state from epidemic diseases and unsanitary conditions, and also to promote and advance the standard of health.

I certainly appreciate the same, as it is what I have wauted for a long time. This is my sixteenth year on the School Board of this city, and thirty-fourth year of residence, I find occasion to consult it almost every day, so you see what a long felt want it has been to me. I wish to congratulate the Board on the work they are doing, realizing that there is still much to do to place man on the same plane of protection as the lower animals, that the states and national government, have been doing for years. Yours for success Fraternally M. A. HOOVER, M. D., V ice-President of Board of Education, School District of Kearney, Nebr. I very much regret the fact that one of the most important laws failed to be published in the laws, rules and regulations of the State Board of Health but it was due to an oversight of the printer. The law referred to is House Boll No. 759. Introduced by Messrs. Liggett and Meredith. Section 1. Physicians — To Use Nitrate of Silver on Eyes of New Born Babies. — It shall be the duty of every physician in attendance upon any lying-in woman, either in hospital or the general practice, upon the delivery of </seg>

            <seg id="p029">ANNUAL BULLETIN NO. 2 29 CONFERENCE OF STATX AMD LOCAL BOARDS OF HEALTH The Fourth Annual Conference of the State and Local Boards of Health was held January 25th and 26th, 1916, at Omaha, Ne - braska. Papers were read by such prominent men as Dr. A. W. Freeman, Epidemiologist, of Cincinnati, Ohio, Representative of the United States Public Health Service. Dr. Chas. F. Crowley, Consulting and Analytical Chemist, of Omaha, Nebraska. Dr. Paul Paquin, Health Commissioner, Kansas City, Missouri. Dr. W. S. Fast, Superintendent Hospital for Feeble Minded, Beatrice, Nebraska. Dr. Robert Retzer, Dean, Creighton Medical College, Omaha, Nebraska. Dr. F. L. Wilmeth, Dean, Lincoln Medical College, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dr. Irving S. Cutter, Dean, Uni - versity of Nebraska College of Medicine, and Dr. Wm. Edmonds of Nebraska City, Nebraska. The Address of Welcome was given by Dr. Dan B. Butler, Act - ing Mayor of Omaha. Response to the Address of Welcome was given by Governor John H. Morehead. The Governor spoke in extent and manifested great interest in matters of Health and Sanitation and stated that he was going to recommend to the legis - lature that more consideration be given to this subject. He expressed himself as being highly pleased with the efforts that had been made to advance the cause and that he was willing to use his influence towards securing advanced legislation along the line of Sanitation and Conservation of Health. The President's address was delivered by Dr. E. Arthur Carr, Vice-Pre8ident State Board of Health, Lincoln, Nebraska. His address will be published in this issue of the bulletin. Hon. A. O. Thomas, Superintendent Public Instruction addressed the meeting on the subject of "School Inspection." His paper will be published in a subsequent issue of the bulletin. Owing to the limited time and the fact that the Conference hav - ing accepted an invitation to inspect the creamatory at Forest Lawn Cemetery, the papers of Dr. Chancey F. Chapman, State Engineer G«o. E. Johnson and Attorney General Willis E. Reed were not read. Those present expressed regrets at not being able to hear these papers and their discussions. We were especially </seg>
            <seg id="p030">30 NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF HEALTH unfortunate in not being able to have the paper of State Engineer Johnson on, "The Relation of an Engineer to the State Board of Health, ' ' as one of the greatest needs of the Board of Health today is a Sanitary Engineer. Mr. Johnson's paper would have taken up this subject and knowing his ability in this line it would have been one of the most important papers of the session. Mr. John - son is taking great interest in sanitary work and we hope to have the benefit of his experience and suggestions at the next meeting. Those in attendance expressed themselves as being very much pleased with the address of Dr. Paul Paquin, Health Commissioner of Kansas City, Mo., on "The Broad Powers of Hygiene, Physi - cially, Mentally and Morally," and that it was well worth their time and expense to have heard his address. Dr. Paquin 's work is along the line of Health and Sanitation in Kansas City and he is one of the best qualified Health Commissioners in the West. His paper will undoubtedly be published in a subsequent issue of the bulletin. • Dr. Chas. F. Crowley's lecture on "Septic Tanks" was illus - trated with lantern slides and demonstrated the fact that he was thoroughly conversant with the subject and the requirements in the installation of septic tanks. Dr. W. S. Fast's paper on "Vaccination as Preventive Against Typhoid Fever" was highly appreciated. Dr. Fast is one of the progressive physicians of the state and we are glad to know that his ability is being appreciated which is demonstrated by his advancement to higher position, and we feel confident that the doctor is fully able to fill any position that he is called upon to fill. His paper will be published in this issue of the bulletin. Dr. Irving S. Cutter demonstrated although holding a high position in the field of medical education he realizes the import - ance of what to some would seem of minor importance. He read a paper on "The Present Status of Opthalmia Neonatorium," which I hope will be published in a subsequent issue of the bulletin. Dr. Cutter was very active and took great interest in the meeting and it was largely due to his request that the meet - ing was held in Omaha. The Board of Secretaries appreciates his interest and hereby wishes to extend our thanks to the doctor for his efforts. </seg>
            <seg id="p031">ANNUAL BULLETIN NO. 2 31 Dr. P. L. Wilmeth read a paper on "Proposed Legislation" »nd recommended that some radical changes in the law be made per - taining to the duties of the Board of Health, that more power be given the Board of Secretaries and that a larger appropriation be asked for. At the close of his paper a motion was made and car - ned unanimously asking that the Association appoint a legisla - tive committee. The following committee was appointed ■ Drs F. L. Wilmeth, P. P. Dodson, J. R. Bell, H. B. Cummins, and E. Arthur Carr. Dr. Robert Retzer's paper on "Fatigue" was a very scholarly production and was given close attention by all. So far I have not received a copy of the doctors paper but will try and secure a copy so that it can be published in a future issue. Dr. A. W. Freeman delivered an address on "Rural Sanitation " Dr. Freeman entered into the subject very extensively as to the needs of the same and demonstrated the necessity of careful super - vision. He also stated that a rural sanitary survey might be made in one or two of the counties in connection with the Board of Health this year. He has promised to write out a synopsis of his address for publication in a later issue of the bulletin. Dr. Robert W. Connell of Omaha, stated that it was impossible for h.m to spare a single minute from his scarlet fever epidemic and turned the affairs of the conference over to Dr Cutter We regreted very much that the doctor could not be in attendance. Dr. Wm. Edmonds read a very interesting paper on "Co-opera - tion of Local and State Boards," which will be published in a later issue of the bulletin. . Resolutions were passed thanking the Rome Hotel for their courteous treatment, the Commercial Club and Local Committee of Arrangements for their interest in the meeting. Also extend ing thanks to Dr. A. W. Freeman and Dr. Paul Paquin for their attendance, addresses and interest taken in the discussions. Following is from the Western Medical Review. The official organ of the medical society of Nebraska. "The fourth annual conference of state and local health officers of Nebraska was held in Omaha on the 25th and 26th of January, 1916. Although the number of health officers in attendance was somewhat less than </seg>
            <seg id="p032">32 NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF HEALTH had been expected, the character of the papers presented and the discussion which they called forth marked this meeting as the most successful of the kind ever held in the state. "The unusual amount of sickness all over the state at the time probably was a factor in preventing many physicians from being present who had planned to attend the conference. "The subjects treated by the various essayists, some of whom were men of national prominence in sanitary matters, covered a wide range of subjects touching almost every branch of sanitary science. The discussions, nnfortunately at times, overran the bounds of alloted subjects and wandered over field foreign to the purpose of the conference. "The interest displayed by the laymen, as well as physicians, in the subjects discussed in the conference shows that public sanita - tion is a live issue in Nebraska." INSTITUTE A FLY CAMPAIGN A number of persons have written saying that they are institut - ing a fly campaign in their town and asked for literature on the subject. As the Board has no literature for distribution I am devoting this issue of the bulletin largely to the fly question. I believe that a fly campaign is one of the best things that can be started in any town. With a flyless town you can be absolutely certain you have a clean town and so far as sanitation and dis - ease is concerned it is a safe town to live in. The solution of the fly question is simply cleanliness. Lots of flies, plenty of filth, and vice versa. Don't think you can deceive the public for they are well aware that a butcher shop, grocery, ice cream parlor or any place where flies are numerous indicates uncleanliness and that the number of flies shows the degree of filth and the unsanitary conditions of the place. The public also knows that flies in a kitchen, dining room or any other part of the house indicates poor housekeeping and that swarms of flies around back doors, porches and any place near the residence indicates that proper precautions is not being taken in the dis- </seg>
            <seg id="p033">ANNUAL BULLETIN NO. 2 33 poaal of garbage, etc., and that the best means to prevent the accumulation of flies in the house is not only by screening and swatting but by seeing that no material upon which flies feed or in which they breed be left where flies can have access to it. I wish to quote Z. P. Metcalf, who says "Don't think that you can treat these same trash heaps with some magical chemical and render them harmless. So far it hasn't been done, or if it has been done the folks that did it have kept mighty quiet about it. There has been much talk lately about spraying the manure heap with Paris green and killing all the little baby flies while they are 'aborning.' Don't do it; the flies tell us when we have filthy premises, just as the thermometer tells us whether it is hot or cold, or just as the barometer indicates differences in air pres - sure. Don't disturb the workings of this sanitary barometer. It is just like doping up with perfume when, according to all good reason, you should take a bath. Don't treat the symptoms. Treat the disease. Don 't try to disinfect your filth. Clean it up and then stay clean. Clean the stables regularly and often. Clean the hog pen and the chicken coop. Have such a privy that fecal matter will not be exposed to flies. Get rid of the garbage, the swill and the kitchen slops. Keep all of your food under cover and insist that your grocer, butcher and market man do the same. In fact, make everything so absolutely clean about the place that the filth-loving house flies will have to pass by on the other side."— Ed. WHAT THE FLY IS There is just one living thing, it seems which performs not a single useful function in the scheme of the universe. It is that creature best known as the typhoid fly. He was formerly sup - posed to be a scavenger that destroyed destructive microbes or germs in decomposing matter, but we know better now. We know that he destroys nothing but life, health and happiness, that he </seg>
            <seg id="p034">34 NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF HEALTH spreads microbes wherever he goes, and leaves disease and death along his trail. As we know more about the fly, about his filthy habits, his breed - ing place and the disease carrier that he is. we have come to regard him as fitting in the universal scheme of things only as a danger signal, as a warning of filth and disease. We know now that wherever he is, where he tarries, there is food for him, and what is food for him is poison for people. We should be suspicious of any place where flies swarm or tarry. We should take them as danger signals and avoid their objects of attraction, whether they be the restaurant, the hotel, the grocery store, the market or the butcher's shop. — The Health Bulletin. THE BIOGRAPHY OF A FLY Once I was only a tiny, white, oval egg. My mother laid me with a hundred others in stable dirt. After a few days I hatched out. a little white worm. I fed for a week or two on the filth where I was, then I changed into brown pupa. Several days later I burst forth a full-grown fly, with two gauzy wings. Since then I have traveled about a good deal. My feet have a fine little fuzz on them ; you cannot see it without a magnifying glass, but it is just splendid for catching germs of all kinds. They also cling to my wings. You would not think so (I am so small), but I really can carry 6,000,000 bacteria on my body at once ! What kinds of bacteria T All kinds but especially typhoid fever and summer complaint, which kill so many young children and adults. You do not hear of summer complaint in winter; I am not flying around then, leaving the germs on the baby's bottle, or lighting on its lips, or falling into the milk, or feasting in the sugar bowl, or crawling over the dish towels hanging in the kitchen, or on the food there and in the pantry. I also carry tuberculosis germs ; in fact, I pick up a good many kinds of germs, for I love to flit about, lighting on filth of any </seg>
            <seg id="p035">annuau bulletin no. i 35 kind I can find. Of course, haying hatched out in it and lived on it the first part of my life, you could not expect me to do other - wise. But I also love to feast on candy, cake, sweets, meat, cheese and every kind of food. I am really quite ancient, being one of the very few flies that lived over last winter. I hid myself in somebody's kitchen. I cannot tell you anything about my descendants, but a very learned scientist said I might have 195,312,500,000,000,000 in one summer. So there is no danger of the fly crop failing, even though only a very few of us live through the winter. If people cleaned us out of their houses, stores, markets and stables, while it is still cold, so we are stiff and inactive, and burned us up and then kept everything clean, so there was no filth, stable litter or decaying garbage for us to lay our eggs in, we would be starved out and disappear. If stable refuse and street sweepings that we have laid our eggs in is carted away and piled up to decompose, we will hatch out there, and torment the farmer's cattle, so the cows will give less milk, and the horse will lose some of their vitality, having to fight us off all the time. We make it a lot harder for the horses every summer. If you want to get rid of us the only way is to prevent us from having any breeding places, by keeping all stable refuse screened, or treating it thoroughly every little while with lime, to kill our eggs. Some day people will become enlightened enough so they will clean everything up thoroughly early in the spring, brushing off every one of us that is clinging to the electric li»ht cords and scale cords in the markets and groceries and from the walls. They will swat" us without mercy until we disappear. I suppose people would not like to have us leave flyspecks on their candy, cake and bread, if they knew the specks were our excreta, and also that they might contain disease germs, but they do not seem to know it. They say, "Oh, it is just a fly speck!" They do not seem to care if their bread and cake is flyspecked. They buy it in the market just the same when they see us crawling over it. </seg>
            <seg id="p036">36 NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF HEALTH They think wrapped bread looks a little smaller, but by actual weight one baker's loaves were just the same, another's had about four mouthfuis less in the wrapped loaf. So people continue to buy the unwrapped bread. If they had watched us coming from human excreta and stable filth perhaps they would not be so willing to have us make a doormat of their food. But they never notice, so we swarm over the food in the markets and groceries and have access to many a highly respectable kitchen. I came near losing my life this morning bathing in somebody's milk pitcher. I was afraid I was going to drown, but a kind - hearted lady lifted me out and poured the cream, with all those hundreds of bacteria I had left there, on her little girl's oatmeal. If she has typhoid fever I suppose her mother will wonder where she could have gotten it! It was a sad day for us when Dr. Kober, of Washington, D. C, announced in 1895 that we were carriers of typhoid. He told the public how we crawled over excreta in the open closet (privey) vault, and then started for the kitchen table to wipe our feet laden with filth and bacteria on the beefsteak, or to take a morn - ing bath in the milk pitcher, leaving hundreds of bacteria there in the milk, in which they grow and multiply more rapidly than anywhere else. We had such a strenuous time in Washington, D. C, last sum - mer. The traps were worse than submarines! The Gospel Mis - sion at the suggestion of the Housekeepers' Alliance, gave work to the unemployed making fly traps. One of the leading news - papers bought 75 of them and gave them to the city. The health office gave orders to have them properly baited and cared for at the fish wharves, city markets, fire stations, etc. They trapped and destroyed us by the thousand ! By next summer I suppose we will not be safe anywhere for hav - ing been so successful with the municipal traps in the Capitol of the Nation they will hear of it all over the country, and even the farmers will be using the big out of door traps around their stables where we always love to be, and where we find ideal breeding places. </seg>
            <seg id="p037">ANNUAL BULLETIN N6. i 37 We cannot live in a perfectly clean city, where there is no filth or rubbish of any kind for us to breed in, so we shall disappear from the scrupulously clean cities of the future. GEORGIA ROBERTSON, Chairman Committee on Civic and Sanitation, Housekeepers' Alliance, Washington, D. C. Following is a paper by Ernest C. Levy, M. D., Chief Health Officer, Richmond, Va., on Modern Methods of Fighting the House- Fly, read before the General Sessions, American Public Health Association, Colorado Springs, September, 1913. MODERN METHODS OF FIGHTING THE HOUSE-FLY Tou have all heard of the temperance lecturer who was to give a talk on the Demon Rum in a country town. The morning paper next day stated that, while the lecture was not given, it was nevertheless apparent to everyone in the audience that the speaker was full of his subject. This lecturer has nothing on me ; for in the present instance not only the speaker but also all who are here present are simply covered with my subject. So I am assured of your interest from the start. Extermination of the house-fly is one of our really important health measures. It is not necessary to go into proof of this today. Every health officer who has studied this question actively in the field, and not just written about it in his office or dabbled a little with it in the laboratory, is convinced that the house-fly is a very active agent in the dissemination of disease. I am going to assume that we all understand this. Moreover, it is surely fair to assume that, in many a case of illness not itself caused by flies, the delicately poised balance between life and death may well be turned by the annoyance and loss of rest brought about by this </seg>
            <seg id="p038">38 NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF HEALTH pestiferous insect. Still again, there is abundant reason why everyone of us in attendance on this meeting would like to see Musca domestica, and all allied species and genera, wiped off the face of the earth, or at least from that wonderful and otherwise perfect corner of it on which we are now assembled. I think that up to even a year ago most of us felt that we were engaged in hopeless kind of light. We felt that we could of course do a great deal, but that in spite of killing millions of Hies and doing our utmost to limit the breeding of this insect, yet their tremendous prolificness — the mere brute force of their numbers — would still get the better of our ingenuity. This is not true today. The fight against the fly is a winning tight. We now have the necessary knowledge and the necessary machinery. To make these effective, however, we need the same old thing that we need in all public health work — the cooperation of the people. This, in turn, must be preceded by education of the people. The evolution of our work for the extermination of the fly has been somewhat slow — slow at least for these days. But we have today methods which are perfectly capable of wiping out the fly in any community within a very short time, provided always that the people understand and are ready to help us. More than this, if cooperation of all the people cannot be secured, we know how to eliminate the fly almost completely in any limited section of a city in which the local residents are sufficiently interested to carry on that part of the work which is assigned to them. In order to fight flies successfully, we must fight them at every stage of their development. This means the keeping apart of flies and all material (especial horse manure) suitable for the depositing of their eggs; the removal, or destruction, of fly-blown material before the eggs have had time to develop into flies or into mature maggots, and the destruction of adult flies by all known means. It is useless to expect results of a satisfactory nature if any single thing is neglected. Fly-swatting campaigns, for example, kill relatively few flies, even though the actual number killed may go into the millions. Nevertheless, fly-swatting has a decided </seg>
            <seg id="p039">ANNUAL BULLETIN NO. 2 39 field of usefulness, in that by this means we get rid of flies which are not reached by other methods, and which will multiply many hundredfold unless destroyed. To claim that fly-swatting is use - less because only a few million flies are killed, or that it is worse than useless because these flies should never have been allowed to hatch, is altogether wrong. The life cycle of the fly is so short, from egg to egg, from maggot to maggot, from pupa to pupa, or from fly to fly, that each point precedes every other point as well as follows it. Those who contend that killing adult flies is the wrong way to proceed, because we should have prevented these flies from ever hatching out, fail to realize that the killing of a few adult flies of a previous generation would have gone really further back than merely preventing these flies from depositing their eggs in a favorable place. The literal swatting of flies does not, of course, get rid of any very great number of these nuisances, but in all fly-swatting cam - paigns dead flies are counted regardless of how they were obtained, and hence the term "fly-swatting" is frequently used as essentially synonymous with the killing of adult flies by any method whatever. For killing large numbers of adult flies no method is so produc - tive of results as the use of traps. By this I do not mean the small fly traps sold for about 15 cents at hardware stores, and used about the house. Such traps are not found by the flies for a long time, and even then the number which such traps get rid of is relatively small. There are today in use traps of another kind — large affairs about two feet tall and fifteen inches in diameter. These traps are of very stout construction. They are built on the same principle as the smaller traps, but the cone ends in an opening which will admit one's thumb. The flies which once get through this opening and into the trap proper never find their way out again. These traps are, therefore, not only useful on account of the tremendous number of flies which they catch, but, speaking from my personal experience, they are encouraging. When one sees flies by the thousand walking and flying about over every fraction of a square inch in such a trap without ever find - ing the large opening by which they entered, and out of which they could get with equal ease, one cannot fail to feel that it would </seg>
            <seg id="p040">NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF HEALTH 40 be a disgrace to admit that an insect with so little sense could outwit man. These large modern fly traps are not placed indoors, but in the case of residences they are placed in the back yard, and in the case of stores they are placed in the street near the curbstone. The manufacturers of this trap lay great stress on the role played by the bait which accompanies each trap. One or two drops of this bait are placed in a saucer of vinegar and put under the trap. The manufacturers claim that the bait so prepared will attract flies from a great distance, even from a kitchen in which a meal is cooking. My own trap was built by myself at a cost of about 50 cents, and I did not find it necessary to employ any especially manu - factured bait. A saucer of vinegar with a liberal sprinkling of sugar around it was in every way successful. Stale beer worked equally well. This trap caught many things besides house-flies. In fact, there was, roughly speaking, about one fly of some other kind to every two or three house-flies. These other flies were green ones and blue ones and gray ones, large and small, but the house-fly was always in evidence, outnumbering all other kinds put together. In addition to flies, my own trap caught regularly large numbers of June bugs, and at one period tremendous num - bers of moths about the size of the last joint of one's thumb. Bees and wasps were also caught in considerable numbers. During the summer this one trap caught over three quarters of a million flies, calculated on a basis of 13,000 to a quart. It can hardly be contended that even one such trap on a city block has no effect on the number of flies prevalent in that block, even though nothing else be done. In my own case, a neighbor living about ten doors from me was hatching flies throughout the summer at a far greater rate than I could catch them. Even under such circumstances, the number of flies on my block must have been lessened not merely by the 750,000 which I actually caught, but by numbers far greater than this, since the flies trapped early in the season would probably have multiplied at least a thousandfold before the end of the season. After we get complete control over all breeding, places, this special kind of trap will probably no longer play a prominent </seg>
            <seg id="p041">ANNUAL BULLETIN NO. 2 41 role, since it is not effective in dealing with the smaller residual numbers with which we will then have to deal. For this latter purpose smaller traps, tanglefoot paper, poisons and swatting will meet the situation. These large fly traps have another distinct field of usefulness, as illustrated by the following case: A mile or so outside of Richmond there is a very attractive suburban community. Prom all that I have ever been able to see, there are few, if any, horses kept in this community, and all the lots are apparently free from any large collections of material which would serve as breeding places for dies. But regularly each year this community is literally overrun with flies. It is no exaggeration to state that I have seen at least one-tenth of the surface on railings and pillars of porches occupied by flies. Where they come from I have never been able to determine. It is true that I have never made a thor - ough investigation, but there is no section of Richmond where I have ever seen flies as prevalent as they are in thus suburb. Of course, these flies breed somewhere, either within or without the boundaries of this suburb, and an investigation would ultimately determine where. Pending this, however, it would be entirely practicable for this community to reduce the number of flies to a small percentage of their present numbers if each householder would use even one of these traps and look after it properly. It seems to me that there is room for good work in determining what is the best bait to be used in traps of this kind. It would be desirable to find a bait which would attract flies but not moths, June bugs, wasps, bees, etc., since these insects consume the sugar far more rapidly than do flies, and thus necessitate more frequent rebaiting, besides which there are obvious personal objections to dealing with a trap in which the two insects last mentioned are present. I shall not discuss at length the very important questions of stable construction and removal of manure. It is useless to expect very good results unless these things are properly looked out for. I am inclined ot believe that the statement that 90 per cent of all house-flies in cities breed in horse manure is far below the mark, and that very small numbers breed in any other material. Even though this be so, we must nevertheless believe that in a com- </seg>
            <seg id="p042">42 NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF HEALTH munity in which there are no horses, or in which all horse manure is so perfectly handled that it never becomes accessible to flies, house-flies would deposit their eggs in other organic matter, if such were available. In fact, I frequently found during last summer large numbers of fly eggs laid on the bare wire of my large fly trap. Whether these were the eggs of the house-fly or of one of the other 57 varieties I am unable to state, but it would appear from this as if the female fly is unable to retain mature eggs be - yond a certain point, but must deposit them somewhere. Stable floors should by all means be of tight construction. I have frequently seen maggots disappearing in cracks less than one-eighth of an inch wide between wooden blocks in a stall. Whether or not such maggots pupate, and whether or not they could ever emerge as adult flies, is another question which I have not had time to look into. Recent experiments conducted by the Richmond Health De - partment have caused me to hold views quite different from those generally accepted in regard to stable construction and removal of manure. These experiments have been told briefly in a paper published a few months ago. They convinced me that the house - fly does not normally enter the pupa stage in manure if the adult maggots find it easy to leave the manure and enter the earth. Since the paper above mentioned was written, additional experi - ments have been conducted by us. I will relate one of these briefly. Two wooden soap boxes, about two feet long and one and a half feet wide and nine inches deep were used in this experi - ment. In one of these boxes was placed fresh horse manure. This was supported on wire gauze with a mesh of about one-half an inch, the bottom of this box having been first knocked off. This box was placed on top of a second one of exactly the same kind. This lower box was first filled with dry earth. The two boxes thus arranged were placed near a stable. At the end of 24 hours the manure in the upper box was loaded with eggs of the house - fly. Fine wire gauze was then nailed over the top of the upper box. The manure, meanwhile, had settled down so as to leave a space of about one inch between the upper surface of the manure and the fine wire gauze. Maggots developed promptly, but three days after the beginning of the experiment all the maggots had </seg>
            <seg id="p043">ANNUAL BULLETIN NO. 2 43 apparently left the manure box. Examination of the lower box at this time showed it to be swarming with large maggots. We then separated the two boxes and screened the lower one, which, to repeat, contained finely divided earth. We got thousands of flies from the box of earth, but not one from the box of manure, nor did careful examination of this manure show a single mag - got or pupa. In other words, every maggot had left the manure and gone into the earth. Our experiment went even further than this. The wooden bot - tom of the lower box (the one containing the earth) had in it several small holes and cracks which we had failed to notice. Not only did all the maggots go through the nine inches of manure in order to get to the earth in the lower box, but a very considerable number of them continued on down through the nine inches of earth in the lower box, and then got out of this box through the holes and cracks above mentioned, as was shown by the fact that we found in the earth immediately under this box, and for several feet around it, maggots and pupa. This experiment surely sus - tains our point — namely, that the house-fly does not normally pupate in manure but in earth. The facts just discussed have an exceedingly important practical bearing in connection with fly-fighting work. It has heretofore been held that if all manure is removed from a city at intervals shorter than the minimum time in which the eggs of the house - fly can develop into adult flies, flies will not hatch from this manure while it is in the city. According to Howard, the mini - mum time from egg to fly is eight days, so that heretofore weekly removals of manure have been considered sufficient. It is obvious, however, that if manure stands on the ground, or is placed in re - ceptacles which have in them even very small openings, fly breed - ing will take place freely, even though the manure is removed at intervals of four days, since three days have been shown to be ample for the development of eggs into maggots of such stage that they leave the manure and enter the earth, if there is any means available for them to do so. We believe, indeed, that large num - bers will leave the manure in two days and successfully go through the remaining stages of development in the earth. We must, then, do one of four things: (1) remove all manure from the city </seg>
            <seg id="p044">NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF HEALTH 44 every day, (2) store it in absolutely tight receptacles, (3) pro - vide the means whereby maggots which leave the manure box through cracks or holes will fall into some tight receptacle in their efforts to reach the earth, or (4) store the manure in a receptacle especially designed to encourage the maggots to leave the manure and catch them as they do so. On of our great needs in fighting the house-fly is some substance which will effectively kill eggs, maggots and pupa of the house - fly. While many substances have been recommended for this purpose, I have not yet found any which was really efficient. . Such a substance must be cheap, it must penetrate the manure to a con - siderable depth, it should not be poisonous to human beings, or especially offensive to them, and it should not interfere with the fertilizing value of the manure, while at the same time it must kill eggs, larvae and pupae. The discovery of such a substance would be of tremendous value. Even though we know of no substance which will fulfill all the indications just mentioned, the use of a fly repellant has consider - able value. In any community in which flies are prevalent, we may assume that horse manure becomes fly-blown in stables within a very short time after it is dropped. Frequent spraying of the droppings with some coal tar product will accomplish a good deal in the way of limiting the number of eggs which are deposited in manure in the stable between periods of removal to a proper receptacle. The screening of horse stables is also desirable from this standpoint. Windows offer little difficulty, but screening the doors of large livery stables is scarcely practicable. Horse droppings on the streets are of no importance in fly breeding. There are many reasons for this, but most of them are self-evident, and hence will not be entered into. In any campaign against the house-fly it is of the utmost im - portance that food supplies should be made inaccessible to as great an extent as possible. This constitute one good reason for having covered garbage pails, even if garbage is not a suitable place for the breeding of the house-fly. In spite of all that can be done, it is scarcely likely that any fly will actually perish for lack of food in any of our cities, hence the chief reason for limit- </seg>
            <seg id="p045">ANNUAL BULLETIN NO. 2 45 ing the amount of food to which they have ready access is that this measure will increase the efficiency of our fly traps. In spite of the length of this paper, there are a number of minor points which I have of necessity failed to touch on. These are for the most part points which are so generally understood that this paper loses nothing by omitting them. In closing I wish to repeat what I said in opening — that our methods of fighting the house-fly are today sufficiently well de - veloped to enable us to accomplish the extermination of flies in any community in which these measures are diligently applied, and even to exterminate them in limited sections of a community provided the entire community cannot be sufficiently interested to attack the problem. </seg>

THE TEACHER AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES In the handling of contagious diseases in children one of the best ways in which to handle them is through the medium of the school. Nearly every year, in about every school, some epidemic starts and before it is properly controlled has infected the greater majority of the pupils and causes a great economic waste by the useless spread of contagion. If physicians and health officers generally could get hold of that "First Case" how much more easily we could cope with the average epidemic. As a rule, in the eruptive contagions we know nothing about any disease being present in the community until some parent wants to know "What that breaking out is that is going the rounds." We ask to see the child and find a nicely developed case of measles, chickenpox, scarlet fever or small pox. By the time we see the case every child in the school or the neigh - borhood is infected so that it seems practically useless to try to cope with the contagion. One of the things most necessary in the successful operation of any plan is to have the co-operation of the parents and school teachers. Beginning this fall in Cedar County, at the Annual Teachers' Institute, will be incorporated a short course of instruction in the diagnosis of the commoner contagious diseases. These lectures will be a part of the regular program of the institute, and through the co-operation of our highly efficient County Superintendent the teachers will be expected to attend them as well as all other branches taken up. The teachers will be taught the use of the clinical thermometer and how to apply the knowledge gained thereby. The practical operation of our plan will be along the follow - ing lines: Should a child come to school complaining of any </seg>
            <seg id="p047">. ANNUAL BULLETIN NO. 2 47 train of symptoms the teacher will immediately take that child's temperature. Should the temperature be found to exceed 99 de - grees this child will be sent home and its parents notified. During the presence of any epidemic each child's temperature is taken every morning. Should the temperature go above the prescribed limit the child is sent home and the health officer noti - fied. The health officer, as soon as is possible, will follow up the report of the teacher and try to ascertain the cause of the symptoms reported. Should they be found to be due to any of the contagious diseases the rules of the Board of Health will imme - diately be put in force and that child ceases to be an infective agent. It is our intention to present the principles of sanitation, per - sonal hygiene, as well as school hygiene, to all of the teachers who attend the institute, believing that in that way we will have a greater control over these epidemics which seemingly appear every year and break into and interfere with the successful opera - tion of the schools. This plan appears to me to be very simple as well as efficient; and I believe that if it can be adopted, with whatever modifica - tions may suggest themselves, it would practically abolish the average school epidemic. </seg>

Hospital for Feeble Minded, Beatrice, Nebr., now Supt. of Engleside Hospital for Insane, before the Conference of State and Local Health Officers, held in Omaha, January 25th and 26th, 1916. VACCINATION AS A PREVENTIVE AGAINST TYPHOID FEVER Mr. Chairman, Health Officers of the Cities and Villages of Ne - braska, Doctors and Gentlemen : The prevention of typhoid fever by vaccination is a subject, compared with its importance, as yet, given but very little attention. I do not know that it will be possible for me to give to this intelligent body of gentlemen any - thing particularly new upon the subject. It is my intention however to briefly review the work done in the line of typhoid prevention by vaccination, and in placing the facts before the health officers of the various Nebraska com - munities, I feel that it should stimulate us all to go to our homes and insist upon our patrons that they accept and use this most potent weapon against typhoid fever. The prevention of typhoid fever by the use of anti-typhoid vaccine is a procedure in medicine followed by the most positive results. Typhoid vaccine is a culture of typhoid baccilli properly grown and developed, then suspended in a physiological salt solution in which has been added a creosol preparation for preservation. The product is standardized by making an estimated count of the number of bacteria to a cubic centimeter of suspension, and the organisms are killed by heating. The vaccine is now obtainable from the laboratories of most of the manufacturing chemists, and is put up in either individual or hospital packages. The first immunizing dose is of just half the strength of the second and third doses. The first dose con - tains approximately five hundred million of the dead bacteria known as Bacillus Typhosus, killed by heat. The second and third dose each contain approximately one thousand million of the dead bacteria. </seg>
            <seg id="p049">ANNUAL BULLETIN NO. 2 49 The history and literature of typhoid prevention by vaccination has nearly all been made in the past five years. Personal con - clusions in this paper are based upon my experience of having vaccinated between five and six hundred young adults in the Ne - braska Institution for the Feeble Minded during the past three years. A little over three years ago there was quite an epidemc of typhoid at the above named institution, and besides ridding the premises of all known sources of infection, it was deemed advis - able to take advantage of all the resources known to modern science. We therefore gave to all of the inmates of the institution three immunizing doses of typhoid vaccine. Current medical literature contains many references to highly satisfactory results obtained by the use of anti-typhoid vaccine in the reduction of typhoid mortality. The value of anti-typhoid vaccination has been investigated by specially appointed com - missions in the United States, England, Germany and France, and in every instance their conclusions have favored the adoption of this prophylactic measure. The prevalance of typhoid fever in practically every section of the United States makes any measure which will protect the individual or assist in preventing the spread of the infection extremely important to the community. The production of arti - ficial immunity against this disease by anti-typhoid vaccination, constitutes such a measure, and it is destined to render real ser - vice, especially to those about to enter conditions in which they will be unduly exposed to the disease. The safety and certainty of vaccination as a method of protec - tion against the disease, have been conclusively demonstrated on a large scale during the last ten years, by the experiments of the Japanese Army, the English Army, and more recently the United States Army. The method of applying this prophylactic measure is very simple. The initial discomfort is not more than that caused by an ordinary hypodermic injection, and the subsequent brief re - action is usually less than in a case of vaccination against small - pox. According to the army rule, these innoculations are made at </seg>
            <seg id="p050">50 NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF HEALTH intervals of ten days, the entire course thus requiring twenty days. The injection is always made under the skin — not in the skin or muscle, and the site usually selected is the arm at the insertion of the Deltoid muscle. The arm should be cleansed as for any operation. The Surgeon General's office recommends washing the arm in tincture of iodine diluted in an equal volume of alcohol, and states that this method of disinfection has proved satisfactory. The skin is painted with the iodine before and after the hypodermic injection. Instead of following the absolute army rule in giving the innocu - lations at intervals of ten days, we have as a routine procedure given the innoculations at intervals of seven days, excepting in a few cases where the local inflammatory reaction was considerable, ten days or even two weeks was allowed to elapse between doses. Army surgeons suggest that women and children should receive doses according to body weight, taking 150 pounds as the unit, and while their conclusions are probably well thought out, our experience leads us to believe that large doses should be uniformly given even to frail persons. We have as a routine measure given every child, regardless of physical infirmities, the regulation initial dose, as also have we given them the regulation second and third doses, and have observed in no case any alarming symptoms. The Widal reaction is always positive after the typhoid innoculation. It appears within ten days after the first dose, and is stated by the Surgeon General's office to remain positive for six months or a year. Col. Leishman, who has had charge of the preventive innoculation in the British Army in recent years, states that the period of protection lasts for two years, and in some cases con - siderably longer. Other investigators claim the period of im - munity to last for only one year, still others claim protection for periods of four or five years. Prom the fact that there is a considerable difference of opinion regarding the period of immunity we are lead to believe that no one as yet knows what the real period of immunity is. Our per - sonal observation has been that in no patient, who has been properly vaccinated against typhoid, has there appeared a true case of typhoid fever. </seg>
            <seg id="p051">ANNUAL BULLETIN NO. 2 51 During our early experience while an epidemic was still in progress, a few cases of modified typhoid developed among those who had been vaccinated, but in no case did the fever run a typical typhoid course, nor did the usual abdominal symptoms occur. There were no fatalities nor even any alarming symptoms in any of the very few cases of typhoid occuring in patients who had been properly vaccinated. As an attack of typhoid fever ordinarily renders the patient immune to subsequent attacks, so do I believe that a thorough vaccination with properly prepared anti-typhoid vaccine, will render the subject immune to virulent typhoid fever, not only immune for a year or two, but my personal opinion is that it really renders them immune for life. Typhoid fever is a communicable disease, more to be dreaded on the whole than smallpox, because at present in countries where vaccination is generally practiced, smallpox occurs only occasion - ally and is soon stamped out, whereas typhoid fever prevails widely in all civilized countries, attacking by preference the young and middle aged, and causes not only many deaths every year, but great economic losses. The disease is not contagious in the ordinary sense of the word, i. e., it is not usually spread from person to person by touch, as in the case of scarlet fever and smallpox. Careful nurses seldom contract the disease. Generally it is distributed indirectly, the person who contracts the disease having in some way swal - lowed some of the germs derived from a previous case. The Bacillus typhosus causes ulcers on the intestinal walls, and also multiplies in other organs of the body, notably the spleen and kidneys. The virus of the disease, i. e., the germ, is dis - charged from the body in great quantities through the bowels and also through the kidneys, and the discharge from these organs usually form the source of subsequent infections in other persons. The disease is usually contracted by drinking infected water, but may also be acquired through infected milk, salads, or other un - cooked food. Many wells, springs, and small streams are infected for longer or shorter periods, especially during the autumn and early winter. It is not safe to drink at such places without cer - tain knowledge of the conditions. </seg>
            <seg id="p052">52 NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF HEALTH iijg 8iiw . Sanitary Measures WhAi one is compelled to live in a house or in a neighborhood where typhoid fever prevails he should make it his infallible rule to eat ana drink only such foods as have been recently heated to abovf^lte foiling point. Salads should be avoided, water and milk shoula always be scalded before use. Fruits should be pared. The typhoid fever organism is very susceptible to heat, the slight boiling or even a good strong scalding is sufficient to destroy it. So far as possible the house-fly should be screened out of the house, while any that gain access should be diligently pur - sued and destroyed. If these measures were consistently practiced a large part of the now generally prevalent typhoid fever could be prevented, especially if in conjunction with these measures the discharges of the sick were consistently and thoroughly disin - fected before being thrown out upon the soil or into sewers. In many cases the typhoid organism persists in the bowel dis - charges, and in the urine for quite a number of weeks after re - covery, so that great care sould be taken for a month or two that these discharges are not allowed to contaminate soil or water. In the case of a few unfortunates known as typhoid carriers, the organism becomes acclimated, and these persons are then a source of constant danger to their fellows. Typhoid fever is a self-limited disease. By this is meant that if the patient does not die during the progress of the disease the body reacts against the invading micro-organisms with the pro - duction of various antibodies known as agglutinins, opsonins, etc., and these antibodies limit the disease to a variable number of weeks, after which the person recovers and the virus (the germ) disappears from the body. The preventive innoculation for typhoid depends upon this fact. In recent years it has been discovered that by injecting under the skin a small quantity of a dead typhoid culture of known strength the body would react against these organisms in the same way as against the living bacteria in the bowels, and with the same result, namely, the increase in the body of anti - bodies which persist for a considerable period, rendering the person resistant to the disease. </seg>
            <seg id="p053">ANNUAL BULLETIN NO. 2 53 In the conclusions of some of the investigators it is recom - mended that anti-typhoid vaccination be not given in subjects in whom typhoid fever is imminent, or at the beginning of an attack, that it may under such circumstances aggravate the disease. My observation has been to the contrary. We have not considered the exposure or even the beginning of fever a contra-indication for the vaccination, and have rather considered that with either condition present it was more imperative that vaccination be used. We even have under such circumstances used vaccination at intervals of four days, hoping thereby to raise the resisting power, and if possible render the immunity more certain and in a shorter period. We have in one particular case satisfactorily demon - strated that even an injection of typhoid vaccine as a curative measure is sometimes feasible. A certain non-vaccinated young man became ill with typhoid fever, run a rather severe course, had all of the usual symptoms, and several of the sequelae, among which was two violent hemorrhages. Patient at the end of six weeks was still having fever, some days evening temperature reaching as high as 104. Realizing that continuation of these symptoms would finally ex - haust the patient, and having followed the usual method of giving intestinal antiseptics, the baths, etc., etc., we decide in our desperation to give this young man typhoid vaccine in small doses, which we did, giving one half of the usual first dose, or instead of five hundred million killed bacteria we gave two hundred and fifty million as an initial dose, and every second day repeated the dose until the patient had equivalent to the three doses ordinarily given for prophylactic purposes. The fever declined, the abdominal symptoms became better, patient gained and evidently in my mind the vaccine put strength into this young man's body, brought up his resisting power, and rendered him immune to the ravages of the active germs un - doubtedly present in his system. I also believe that this measure was the means of saving the young man's life. Personally I believe that every young adult or even every per - son between the ages of seven and fifty, who might in any way come in contact with the germs of typhoid fever, should be vac- </seg>
            <seg id="p054">NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF HEALTH 54 cinated against the fever. The general public use of vaccination as a preventative against typhoid fever is just as necessary as vaccination against smallpox, and as time goes on, and as our knowledge of the subject is increased, my opinion is that typhoid vaccination will be practiced as generally as smallpox vaccina - tion is now practiced, and as the vaccination for smallpox has so radically changed the disease from the terrible scourge known to our fathers, into the mild modified type of the present day, so we believe typhoid fever will be modified and the disease possibly wholly eradicated by the general use of this comparatively new prophylactic measure. A tremendous responsibility rests upon the local health officers of the various communities. Their professional acts as they per - tain to quarantine, vaccination and the carrying out of proper sanitary measures are often accepted reluctantly by the laiety, or not accepted at all. The suggestion is sometimes heard, that the health officer is recommending vaccination, etc., the prime purpose being for financial gain. Doctors know that such is not the case, and they should be ever ready to assist local health officers in giving out the proper information, and aid him in his endeavor to properly inform the public as to the best methods to prevent disease. </seg>
            <seg id="p055">ANNUAL BULLETIN NO. 2 55 This address was delivered by Dr. E. Arthur Carr, Vice-Presi - dent, State Board of Health, Lincoln, before the Conference of State and Local Health Officers, held in Omaha. January 25-26, 1916. Mr. Chairman: — To the Members and Guests of the Fourth Annual Conference of the Nebraska State and Local Health Officers : Gentlemen : I am indebted to your President for the privilege of addressing you as Vice-President and thereby sounding the warning note of the needs and purposes of this gathering and I cannot select two terms which convey our hopes and ambitions more clearly than preparedness and conservation. I want to champion that preparedness that seeks the latest equipment and up-to-date modern methods in locating the enemy disease and attacks it in the most destructive manner. To know where the enemy is the most active, we need a state sanitary survey such as we recommended to you for your consideration two years ago. "Waterborne diseases, typified by the typhoid baccillis, con - titute one great division of the enemies forces. Housing and crowding favored disease, typified by tuberculosis, constitute a second division. Lowered resistance disease, typified by pneu - monia; occupation disease, illustrated by lead poisoning; ignor - ance-aided diseases, such as syphillis and gonococcus infections, and smallpox, constitute other important divisions of this army of disease. Even a cursory knowledge of the resources and methods of attacking communicable diseases will convince any one that it is foolish for the public to expect a victory without knowing the condition of the state and where the enemy is located," which can only be done by making a survey of the whole state and get the minute data on file in our office where it can be used by the general who is directing a campaign against disease and unsani - tary conditions. I would recommend that during the coming year, we select one county and make a careful survey of same. This can be done by the card system already recommended by this board. Every health officer in the county selected would be glad to co-operate, and other organizations might be interested to join in the expense and use said county as a unit for further </seg>
            <seg id="p056">NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF HEALTH 56 work, also in interesting the coming legislature. Dr. Rosenru has said : ' ' One reason why prevention has not made faster pro - gress is because it lacks dramatic interest. When we prevent disease, nothing happens; there is nothing very exciting about that. To cure a disease so as to stamp out an epidemic fill the eye and appeals to the imagination. A brave general or a gallant admiral is the object of universal admiration, but where is the monument to those who have prevented wart Again if disease is prevented, there is always a lurking suggestion that perhaps it would not have occured anyway. This skepticism, which is born of ignorance, is one of the most powerful brakes upon the chariot of progress. The results of prevention, seem negative. Cure is real, active, evident ; prevention seems mysterious, quite, uncertain." There is not a factor in this preparedness program which stands out more unselfishly than does the physician and health officer — usually the two are one and the same person. There is not a profession today that seeks to cut down its own revenue as does that of the physician, by his scientific investigation along the line of preventive medicine. Look at the digging of the Panama Canal, if you please and yon will recall that the final prepared - ness reached only permitted that great engineering feat. The physician health officer was the one who went ahead to prepare the way and he was given unbounded latitude. That justly famed sanitation work in the Panama Canal Zone was made possible only through thoroughly organized and powerful departments of health, and in this preparedness the government did not limit them financially. This preparedness brought forth big dividends on the investment, but no greater than we are able to show in Nebraska by protecting its water supplies to keep it free from contamination, quarantining its contagious diseases, etc., thereby conserving the health of our people. Before the splendid sanitation work in the canal zone, you will recall that it is estimated that, while building the original rail - road, men died and fell like leaves by the wayside, until it is claimed that each cross-tie in that railroad represents a human soul. The canal was contemplated several times, but each time to be abandoned on account of the great obstacle, disease. Dr. </seg>

They succeeded in turning the zone which was once a hot house breeding disease to curse the generations to come, into a winter resort with a lower death rate than our own fair state. ' ' It seems to be increasingly evident that the health conscience of the people is being aroused as never before in the history of the world. There are signs on every hand of a great world movement looking toward the conservation of human life and health. That there is a de - mand for enlightment as to the cause and prevention of disease is proven by the numerous articles that have appeared the past few years in journals, magazines, and newspapers written for, and in, the language of the layman. Great business corporations and industries have noted the relationship between sickness and inefficiency, and are making progress toward the improvement of the working and living conditions of their employees. Life in - surance companies have counted the cost of community waste in preventable deaths, and have organized, or are organizing, effec - tive machinery for staying this tremendous economic waste, to the end that their policies may not mature before the expiration of a normal life expectancy, which, in turn, means untold sums of money in additional premiums paid into the company's treas - uries." Many of you know of the vast amount of money spent by the M. W. A. in erecting and maintaining their tubercular sanitorium just out of Colorado Springs, Colo., and they find it is a greater saving to treat and cure their members gratis than to permit the ravages of the great white plague to reduce their ranks. This is the feature of conservation of human life and health which shows the dramatic part. "Already economists, in - dustrialists, engineers, sanatarians, and physicians have joined their voices in deprecating protest of the present inadequate means and measures in both state and nation, for the prevention of disease, and the thinking public is demanding that preventable sickness and death be checked." There will yet be a paramount issue upon which all candidates for election for state office will be required to take a stand, and that will be, conservation of human life and health. We trust that the day is not far distant. </seg>
            <seg id="p058">58 NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF HEALTH I want to personally endorse the stand taken recently by Gover - nor Morehead that all health matters should be placed under the secretaries of the State Board of Health, with their secretary, who should be a full time salaried man and should be empowered, as executive officer of the board to act on all matters at all times when the board was not in session, said officer to have his office at the capitol building. There is a bill now under construction which will, we hope, meet the demands until such time as we shall have a constitutional convention. Our Quarantine Rules and Regulations are working out very satisfactorily and we find people are not considering it so much of a hardship to be quarantined. Only reeently the city dads of a Kansas town received the following card of thanks: "I wish to thank the city authorities for quarantining me and my family for two weeks recently, because one of the children had the smallpox. During that time my wife caught up with her sewing, being undisturbed by callers just at mealtime. We had three square meals a day, as no one came in and she wasn't per - mitted to go out. We enjoyed two weeks of good long night's sleep, and best of all, a cousin with four small children who arrived to visit us, saw the smallpox sign on the door and left town so scared that she will never come back again. I wish to thank the authorities and hope they will be equally as thoughtful of our comfort some time again." The strength of a state or nation is not measured by her hospital record but the health of its people. There was never a greater truth than stated by Booker T. Wash - ington when he said, "You can not keep the negro down unless you stay down yourself." And I want to say you cannot allow a part of the people of our state to remain unsanitary and unclean without getting some of the ill effects yourselves. Time forbids me talking about our work on vital statistics. I trust you are all getting the bulletin and find it of help to you. Again appreciat - ing this opportunity, I thank you. </seg>
