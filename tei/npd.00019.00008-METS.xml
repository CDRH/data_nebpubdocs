Coming at the time of year it did. when the garden, lawn and Howers were at their l&gt;est and covering all with debris, it wa&gt; a very disco :ght to look out over our beautiful grounds and note what seemed utter ruin. By prompt action. however, goods were rescued tter.the basements emptied and the grounds cleaned, thus avoiding any great amount of damage. The tower on the wall at the southwest corner was partially wrecked, requiring the rebuilding of the tower and a portion of the wall. The l.ee Broom and Duster Co.. who have the prison labor contract, suffered quite an extensive loss in broom corn and the almost complete wrecking of their large warehouse just outside the wall.

Besides these a large number have been donated by ids of the prison.

I We think that, for its size, we have as good a library a found in any similar institution in the country. t While it is true that fiction forms the largest class of literit - read. (in this we resemble the outside) yet many read history, nee. poetry and even philosophy, and the measure of thought - and instructive reading done by the men will bear favorable parison with equal numbers on the outside.

The men greatly appreciate There is hardly anything that contributes to the good dis - cipline of the prison more than plenty of the right kind of reading ter circulating among the inmates. It occupies time that would l&gt;e spent in ways not conducive to good order. It prevents that brooding that would result in despair or desperation. It informs the mind, improves the morals, broadens the D ■ ; and qualifies for the living of a better life.

It is hard to tabulate its results. Men lining and going all the time. Its average has l&gt;een about thirty-five. Many of the pupils have learned to read, and others made much advancement in common Knglish branches. Very many more would avail themselves of the privilege of attending the school could this l&gt;e made possible. I have used the help of other inmates and find them efficient helpers. I have no trouble in using them, nor do I find any objec - tion to their presence. I make it a rule to see every man present ami personally note his progress, encouraging him in every way possible. My assistants receive no compensation, and they merit. at least, this note of appreciation from me. The louUI consider this feature of the chaplain's work and provide for its continuance under most favorable circumstances. Whil? this may not be the place for favorable argument on the subject of a penitenti;; 1. I am satisfied that it would be both </seg>

NOTES 1 While fearing that it may unduly lengthen these re] 1 deem it proper to add a few things thereto. t Believing that harmony aids in the administration of affairs any public institution, and that co-operation contribute success of all. I wish to acknowledge my obligations I i have helped me in securing any success that may have le for the past two year IFihbt- I would acknowledge my indebtedness to the \\ numerous courtesies. I have learned thai much of a chaplain's depends on the co-operation of the Warden. While these officers has his own field of labor, yet their relations in prison work, are such as to make harmony of action new the success of both. I The presence and work of the Matron lias been a blessi: Her help in the Sunday School has been an inspiration to Mrs. Beemer has been no small factor in the success of the ol. To Miss l.uree Beemer 1 am under great obligations for a: IBM in that part of a minister's work so often difficult to man: the choir. Her constant, unvarying faithfulness to her s«! sumed duty has made it much easier for the chaplain than, other - it would have been. For six years she has been in her place and none will be missed more than she. t Thanks are due to Mr. Flansburg. our efficient superintendent - -. Howard. Cordner. (father and son). MeNjehol. McVi Mrs. McKeene and Miss Jannev. who. as teachers, have made Sunday school a success. Nor must I fail to mention Mr. Unix I Mr. Cushman. who have generously given time and service to ke our choir one of which we feel justly proud. 1 would also make appreciative mention of the work of Rev. Father Moran, resident pastor of St. Thomas Orphanage. Father Moras) visits the prison regularly once a month, and sometimes oftener. ministering to the spiritual needs of such as are meinl&gt;ers </seg>

While his work ;it the orphan - ape require! the most of his time, he gives faithful attention to the welfare of those of his faith and practice confined here. Nor must I forget to mention the courtesy of Deputy Warden Delahunty. Steward Wagner and Clerk Heilman. In many ways have made the work of the chaplain pleasant and succc And the last in order, yet not the least in importance, is the fact of the good will and reaped of the inmates of the prison. No chaplain could ask for better treatment at the hands of the men "detained" than has !&gt;een accorded me during these yean. I ■: all of which I am profoundly thankful. I s|&gt;eak thus of these hel|&gt;ers for the reason that 1 think a Mower given to the living worker, as a token of your appreciation, a thousand given to the dead. 1 deem it no impertinence to recommend the following: The appointment of a parole officer who shall have the work - ing oversight of the parole feature of the penitentiary. The adoption of the Indeterminate Sentence Law: the employment of discharged prisoners by the state until they can help them - selves: the erection of a building to Ik- used for a chapel and for a school, perhaps for other similar purposes: the changing of the constitution bo as to admit of the election of a Board of Pardons a Hoard of Control, who shall divide, with the Governor, his duties and responsibilities in the matter of paroles, commutations and pardon-. We arc coining to the conclusion already reached by many 8, that the State is rather called to the reformation of its prison population than to its mere punishment. While the last may l&gt;e necessary, the first is essential to future well l&gt;eing of the man. Reform a criminal and you gain a man. Punish a criminal vou enforce a law. Which lessens crime'.' In order to do this. I am in full accord with the Warden's recommendation that the state purchase a large tract of land upon which to put its young offenders against law and order.
