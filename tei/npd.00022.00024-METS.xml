I.ITTI.K I icattag of cream by the Babcock method requires skilful and anituilutiun. Every detail must be carefully carried out. No part ;hted. There are many standard works treating of this one who follows the rules prescribed therein will have little operating the test. The question of correct and uniform opera - come so important in Nebraska that the last Legislature saw fit porate in the "Food, Dairy and Drug Law" a clause governing the of testing cream 1 . This part of the law is as follows: cream sold in the State of Nebraska for the purpose of butter shall be tested for butter fat by the following prescribed method. iabcock test shall be employed, using a weighed sample of eighteen sjms.l weighed on a delicate balance and tested in a nine inch adiuted to at least five-tenths per cent (.5 per cent) of the column d between the lemperature of 130 decrees and 140 degrees Fahren- lie this in itself is not very complete, it furnishes a b.isis for a common orm method of testing cream which is imperative. \ iree essential points in cream testing are as follows: First, a nple of the cream to be tested; second, exactly 18 grams of this ile in the test bottle; third, an accurate reading of the fat column. The sample should in all cases represent the material to be tested. The rst error in cream testing is generally caused by improperly taking the ample. After cream has stood a long time it cannot be sampled as easily the time it comes from the separator. This is due to the fact that the iifferent ingredients of cream vary in specific gravity and tend to arrange ves accordingly. Therefore a layer of fat is found at the surface avers arranged according to their density down to the bottom of the To mix this fat uniformly with the heavier portions of the liquid, a Terr igh agitation is necessary. Two methods may be used in procuring this orm emulsion, pouring or stirring. In practice stirring is probably better method, as it is very simple and at the same time thorough, pro- viding the vessel is not too full.
