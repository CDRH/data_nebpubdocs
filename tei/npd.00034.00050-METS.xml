            <seg id="p005">THE STORAGE AND USE OF SOIL MOISTURE. BY W. W. BUBE.* I he profitable cultivation of the non-irrigable lands in west •al and western Nebraska is limited by the amount and ent use of the precipitation. There are tracts of land in the hills and minor tracts of badly worn heavier soils where leed of soil fertility is becoming evident. But, in the main, p*eat problem at present is not one of soil fertility, but of to get enough water to make use of the fertility now present, rainfall of this section, which varies from an actual short - :o seldom more than a meager sufficiency, makes it impera - that the best use be made of the water that falls. He who economically gets the greatest use of the rainfall is truly test farmer from the standpoint of production. Ifhis bulletin is largely concerned with problems relative to accumulation and use of the soil water. In presenting the Its shown in the bulletin, we have endeavored to select that ion of our soil moisture studies which may have the most •ticnl application. And we ask that it be read carefully and the tables showing weather conditions be consulted in order one may not draw the wrong conclusions from any data ■ed. Tt is imperative also that the type of soil on which this k has been carried on be kept in mind. Any variation in the type will probably vary — in that same degree — the results lined. The work which we are offering has been done in the B Detailed from the Office of Dry Land Agriculture, U. S. Department sriculture. Formerly Associate Professor of Soils and Crops at the h Platte Substation. Kbe data presented in this bulletin have been obtained by the North e Substation in cooperation with the Office of Dry Land Agriculture the Biophysical Laboratory of the Bureau of Plant Industry, U. S. j-tment of Agriculture. Charts III, IV, VII. and X to XV, Inclusive, are xiuetions of regular soil moisture charts from the Office of Dry Land culture.

A popular edition of this bulletin is Issued as Bulletin 140. INTRODUCTION. </seg>
            <seg id="p006">I Research Bulletin No. 5 field under field conditions and has been subject to the same detrimental or favorable factors that are common to all fields under like conditions. It is not our aim in offering this work to teach actual farm practices affecting crop production, but to discuss underlying principles and show the effect of certain conditions. The ap - plication of these principles to the farm practices must be left to the farmer. We can show that a certain surface condition is more efficient than some other condition in catching water from rains. We also show that weeds use the water. It is left to the farmer to apply the principles. He may stack his grain and plow - bis stubble ground, or he may use the disk after the binder. If he can kill the weeds and get the surface in condition to hold moisture by either method, he has applied the principle. Local conditions on the farms vary so much with locality that it would indeed be hard to discuss the practices. In one section the problem would be to increase the yields of grain for the market and in another it w6uld be to get feed for' live stock. In order to bring farm practices up to the point of greatest efficiency, it is essential that the farmer understand the conditions under which he is farming and the principles affecting the practices. A thoro knowledge of the prevailing weather conditions, soil conditions, and nature and requirement of crops is essential. He can then work out the most economical practices. From the standpoint of storing moisture in the soil, we have found summer tilling, which is clean cultivation without any crop for a season, the most ideal way in which to store moisture. When the rainfall of a season is insufficient to produce a prof - itable crop, it may be better to summer till than crop every year and thereby store a small portion of one season's rainfall to use with the rainfall of the following season for the production of a single crop. In other words, "to use not two years' rainfall for one crop," but rather a small portion of the first year's rainfall, added to a somewhat larger portion of the second year's rainfall for the crop. Our investigation shows that if' is only under favorable conditions that as much as 33 per cent of the rainfall of one season can be carried over to the next, and that during the most unfavorable season only 10 per cent was carried over. Probably not more than 60 per cent of the second year's rainfall is utilized by the growing crop, and it is probably safe to assume that considerably less than one year's rainfall is fully utilized for crop production under the best system of summer tillage. Summer tilling is a system that has been practiced for a long </seg>
            <seg id="p007">7 time in the drier sections of the country. Altho this method of utilizing moisture is seemingly an exceedingly wasteful one, it is probably the best one devised for some crops, soils, and cli - matic conditions. It is obvious that it will hardly be profitable to summer till a shallow soil, for in such soils the effect of culti - vation is of little value in storing water. Where there is a layer of hardpan, gravel, rock, or sheet water close to the surface, the amount of water which the shallow layer of soil above this stratum will hold is so limited that probably one good rain would saturate it. It is useless, therefore, to keep it clean cultivated thru an entire season for the purpose of storing water. Crops grown on this type of soil are almost entirely dependent on seasonal rainfall because of the very limited amount of water which so shallow a soil can hold. We cannot store sufficient water in so shallow a soil to carry the crop thru a long dry spell. As soon as the moisture stored in the soil is used, crops will suffer or die, according to the duration of the drouth. On the deeper soils, however, which prevail over the greater portion of the central and western part of the State, it is possible under normal weather conditions to store a considerable amount of moisture as a safeguard to the crop against drouth. Where it is not desired to summer till, the same principles should always be applied. The preparation of the seed bed for a crop should begin as soon as the preceding crop is off the ground. Usually, the longer the seed bed is prepared and kept in proper condition, the greater is the amount of water stored. The seed bed will also be firmer and in better condition for the crop. Judgment must always be used in doing the work. If a soil is inclined to blow, keeping the surface bare and cultivated for any considerable time might be detrimental. If the soil is heavier, it can be cultivated with a clean surface without danger. If the soil is so dry that plowing requires an extra amount of ex - pensive labor, it is probably better to disk. All of these, to - gether with available horse power and help and the amount of urgent work on hand, are local problems which only the farmer can solve. Too much labor put on a field may be unprofitable. The aim should be to use such tools and do the work at such a time as to obtain maximum water storage and a compact seed bed with the lowest expenditure of labor. Eie principles of Rtoring water may be summarized in a few ices.

Crops which will withstand considerable drouth or escape drouth by maturing early are recommended. Live stock as a medium for marketing the crop, and to in - sure an income during unfavorable yeans, is essential to the •access of a dry-farmer. This bulletin is concerned with problems relating to « greater use of the water that falls. Results of tests made relative to other phases of crop production in this section are given in Bulletin 135 of this Station. SUMMARY. 1. The maximum amount of water that the soil on the North Platte. Nebr., Substation farm will hold under field conditions is from 16 to 18 per cent of its dry weight. 2. The minimum point to which crops can use the water from the soil for growth is about 7 to 8 per cent based on the dry weight of the soil. In other words, water in the soil above 7 or 8 per cent is available for plant use. 3. Summer tillage is the most efficient means of storing water in the soil. 4. The amount of water that can be stored in the soil in one year by summer tillage is influenced by a number of factors. On the same soil it is largely governed by the amount and distribu - tion of the rainfall, the effectiveness of the tillage, and the presence or absence of a growing crop. EFrom 10 to 33 per cent of the seasonal rainfall has been d annually by summer tillage at the Substation during the six years. Bin favorable seasons the soil has been practically filled water to a depth of six or seven feet by summer tilling. ■ During the most unfavorable year the best summer tilled accumulated water to a depth of only three feet. 8. The distribution of the rainfall is almost as important from the viewpoint of storing water as the total amount of rain. 9. Water is accumulated most rapidly when the rains are so frequeut that the surface is still wet from one rain when another 10. An inch of rain falling on a very dry surface will seldom wet down more than six inches on this type of soil. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">BA rain of one-half inch is of no value in storing water, it comes while the surface is still fairly moist from a ing rain. ■L Water is carried into a moist soil much more rapidly into a dry soil. ■': A cultivated surface will retain more water from a rain a surface not cultivated. 14. The faster the rain falls, the greater is the difference be - tween the amount of water held from a rain by a cultivated sur - face and that by a surface not cultivated. 15. Plowing seems to be better than disking for accumulating water in the soil. K Disking small grain stubble to kill weeds and stir the s has generally been effective in accumulating water in 1. ■. A mulch of several inches of hay or straw is more efficient a soil mulch in storing water. 18. Corn, oats, spring wheat, and barley use water from the first four or five feet of soil. 19. Winter wheat uses water to a depth of six or seven feet. 20. Corn grown in rows and cultivated does not dry the soil so thoroly as do the small grains. KThe indications are that plants obtain water from the soil growth of the plant roots into the moist soil. Very little is brought to the plant roots by capillary movement. 22. Under normally favorable conditions, growing vegetation is a greater factor than surface evaporation in removing water from soil which previously has been filled with water. 23. Weeds are frequently the most effective agents in remov - ing available water from soils and in preventing the storage of water for the use of other plants. 24. A mulch three inches deep is more efficient in reducing surface loss of water during a prolonged dry spell than a shal - lower mulch. K Alfalfa, once well established on this type of soil, will water from the sheet water where it is within twenty to feet of the surface.

Away from a source of free water and in a soil partially dry, capillary movement has not been detected. ■I. Water supply by capillarity is not an important factor in production on Nebraska upland soils. 29. The indications are that it requires almost twice as much water to produce one pound of dry matter in small grain in an unfavorable season as is required in a favorable season. 30. A year that is unfavorable for small grain is not neces - sarily unfavorable to corn, as the drouth which injures one mayf not extend into the most rapid growing period of the other. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">The Storage and Use of Soil Moisture 11 THE STORAGE AND USE OF SOIL MOISTURE. Rudies relative to soil moisture hare been carried on at the ation since the spring of 1907. The purpose in starting the was to determine the most efficient and economical methods &gt;ring water in the soil, the amount of water required to ce crops, and to study the use or loss of water from the soil. GENERAL CONDITIONS. Part of the land used in making these studies is bench or second-bottom land, and part is table-land. The soil on the table - land is similar to that on the bench. On the bench land, sheet water is only twenty to forty feet below the surface. Subirriga - tion takes place on the bench land with deep-rooted plants like alfalfa, but has not been found to affect any other crops. On the table-land, sheet water is from 200 to 250 feet below the sur - face, and crops cannot get water by subirrigation. This absolute dependence of the crop on surface precipitation gives the best conditions for the study of soil moisture. TYPE OF SOIL. She soil on the farm is a fine sandy loam, commonly known «ss. The native vegetation is mainly buffalo and grama ies. The soil is free from gravel and is easily tilled. The anical character of the soil is fairly uniform to a consider - depth, the most noticeable change being less organic matter e subsoil, indicated by a change in the color of the soil. This ge in color begins in the third or fourth foot. Mechanical rses have been made to a depth of three feet. The following table gives the results of eight analyses : </seg>

            <seg id="p013">13 • From Table 1 we note that the soil has a low per cent of all material coarser than very fine sand. This, with the low p«r cent of organic matter, would indicate that the soil would bake or cruet badly. However, the soil is easily tilled, this being due probably to the correspondingly low per cent of clay and the comparatively large per cent of very fine sand. Little trouble has been experienced with the soil baking or crusting badly ex - cept in the spring of 1912. After the melting of the heavy snow late in the spring of 1912, the soil crusted badly and cracked to a depth of several inches. Ii considering the work given in this bulletin, it is important one should not lose sight of the character of the soil on i the work was done. It is not probable that the same re - will be obtained upon soils of widely different character. DEPTH OF SAMPLING. When the work was started, samples were taken to a depth of only three feet. As the work progressed, longer tubes for sampling were procured, until samples were taken to a depth of fifteen feet. The reason for the deeper sampling was to find a point where the moisture content remains constant, where it would uot be affected by the tillage or by growing crops. Tt wa» necessary to do this deeper sampling in order to determine how far the moisture from the surface would move downward, and whether water left in the soil below the reach of the crops for one season might not move upward into the feeding zone of the following crop. We have found from a large number of samp - lings that frequent deep sampling is not necessary on- this "hard" land, under continuous cropping, except during seasons of abnormally frequent and heavy rains. The available water is confined to a few feet of soil at the surface. Our aim is to sample deeply enough to include the whole zone in which the movement of water affects crop growth. WATER IN THE SOIL. Border better to understand the work presented in this bul a brief discussion is given of the water found in the soil. ■ ater is found in the upper strata of the soil in three condi- 1. That which is absorbed by the soil particles from the water vapor of the air — called hygroscopic water. 2. That which is held bv surface tension, as more or lea* </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 thickened films around the soil grains, and in the small pore spaces between the soil particles — called capillary water. 3. That which is being drawn downward thru the soil by the pull of gravity — called gravitational water. HYGROSCOPIC WATER. Hygroscopic water is that which an absolutely dry soil will absorb when exposed to a moist atmosphere. The amount of water a soil will absorb from a saturated atmosphere depends mainly upon the temperature and the type of the soil. The finer the soil particles, the more water they will absorb. This water is held in the soil as thin films around the soil particles. It is of no value in furnishing water to agricultural plants. It prob - ably has a beneficial action in bringing into solution some of the plant food material held in the soil, on account of its close con - tact with the soil particles. From determinations that have been made in the laboratory, and from studies made under field con - ditions, the conclusion has been reached that plants are not able to use this moisture for growth. CAPILLARY WATER. Capillary water, or that which is held against gravity in the small pore spaces and adhering as thickened films to the soil particles, is the source of supply to growing vegetation. This water may move in any direction in the soil, but its movement is slow. It moves thru the soil much the same as oil moves along a lamp wick. As some ]&gt;ortion of the soil becomes drier, the films of water around these soil particles become thinner, exert a greater force, and consequently draw some water from the ad - joining particles of soil. The films around these particles in turn draw from the next and so on, moving the water slowly from the more moist to the drier portion of the soil. If the loss of water is ■ ■lit'cked. the movement of water will cease as soon as the soil particles at the drier portion have received sufficient water so that they can no longer exert a stronger force than the adjoin - ing particles. I em the standpoint of crop production we are interested t wholly with the water that is held by capillary force 1 the soil zone occupied by the plant roots. The movement ter thru the soil by capillarity is so slow that it is practi - useless in bringing water from a lower soil area for fhe f a growing crop. The rapid use of water by crops, espe - dnring seasons of drouth and increased transpiration, re- </seg>
            <seg id="p015">15 quires more water than can be supplied by capillarity. Plants will suffer and die under extreme conditions after having used the available water within reach of the roots, even tho there is additional water in the soil immediately below. Under a system of alternate cropping and summer tilling we have found an ac - cumulation of water just below the feeding zone of the crops. During dry seasons when the crops have been suffering for mois - ture this water did not move upward by capillarity in sufficient quantity to be of material benefit to the crop, iphere is no evi - dence that it will replace to any considerable extent during an interval of even several months the water removed from an upper soil zone. This is true on soils separated by a considerable dis - tance from a supply of free water, as sheet water" Where there is a constant supply of free water, there will be a rather rapid movement of water for a certain distance thru the soil, depend - ing upon the type and compactness of the soil. I frequent, rapid drying of several inches of soil at the sur - as in some cases been accounted for thru the quick move - jf water by capillarity. Tt seems to indicate a more rapid lent than is found in the lower soils. There is, doubtless, reased movement due to higher temperature, but the greater ition of air in the soil near the surface is a large factor In pid drying of surface soils. ■ GRAVITATIONAL WATER. As a soil becomes more and more nearly saturated, it reaches the point where gravity exerts a stronger pull than surface ten - sion. Water then begins to move downward thru the soil and tends to connect with the ground water or sheet water below. When the ground water is at a great depth, as it is on most of the tablelands, it is decidedly doubtful if any surface water ever reaches it. When the surface soil becomes oversaturated with water, the downward movement of the water continues until, by distributing the water thru a larger body of soil, the force of gravity is finally equalized by the capillary power of the MAXIMUM WATER-HOLDING CAPACITY OP A SOIL. The maximum water-holding capacity of a soil is the amount of water that soil will retain against the pull of gravity. When water is added to a soil in sufficient amount, the films of water around each soil particle become thickened, and the small spaces between the soil particles filled with water. In the addition of </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 water a point is reached where the attraction of gravity over - comes the force that holds the water to the soil particles, and the water is drawn downward into the lower soil. If no more water is added, a point is reached where the pull of gravity is equaled by the force that holds the water to the soil, and there is no further movement except by the slow action of capillarity. The amount of water in the soil at this time is termed "maximum water-holding capacity" or '"saturation point." Phe amount of water a soil will hold against gravity depends the type of soil. A clay soil composed of fine particles with small spaces will retain more water than a coarser, sandier composed of larger particles and larger spaces. Also, the amount of humus, or decomposed organic matter, in the soil in - fluences the water-holding capacity. The more humus in the soil. the more water it will hold, providing the soil particles are of similar size, - MINIMUM POINT OF EXHAUSTION BY THE PLANT. The minimum point of exhaustion of water from the soil by the plant is the point at which the force exerted by the plant in obtaining water is equaled by the attraction of the soil for the water. At this point the plant can obtain uo more water from the soil and will suffer until water is supplied. The minimum point of exhaustion is in direct correlation with the maximum water-holding capacity of the soil. A fine soil that has a high water-holding capacity will exert a strong resistance to the use of water by the plant, while a sandy soil, with a lower maximum, has a correspondingly lower minimum of water which is not available for the use of the plant. The water held in the soil below the minimum point of exhaustion by the plant is called "nomavailable water." Some water may be taken from the soil below the minimum point, but not in sufficient amount or rapid enough to promote plant growth or even to sustain life for any considerable period of time. From an agricultural standpoint, only the available water is of value. The available water in the soil is the amount that the fanner has to use. in addition to the rainfall, to produce crops. Tn order to interpret results from moisture data, the maximum water-holding capacity and the minimum point of use should be known. These points rise or fall, depending upon the composi - tion of the soil. In the following table we give the data cover - ing tnese two points ! </seg>

            <seg id="p018">18 In Table 2 we give the results of a series of determinations made to ascertain the maximum water-holding capacity of this type of soil. On September 9, 1908, the amount of water present in the soil was determined. After making this determination, an excavation eight feet in diameter and one foot deep was made. A total of thirty-six inches of water was put into this to insure saturation, and the dry earth, which had been removed in ex - cavating, was put back as a mulch. About six or eight inches of hay was put over all of this in order to reduce surface evapora - tion to a minimum. Samples were taken from time to time, as shown in the table, to determine the movement of the water. We note that between the sampling of September 17 and October 9, 1908, there is a Ion of 3 per cent, or a total of five inches of water. It is evident that this water moved downward, as the first foot shows con - clusively that the water did not escape from the surface. This section of the soil was not sufficiently moist to lose much water. Just after the sampling on October 9, a three-inch rain fell, which explains the increased amount of water found October 20. We then find a decrease to April 22, 1909. when the upper six feet of soil have on an average about 16 per cent of moisture. There is an increased amount again when the rains start during the summer, but it drops later in the season. It would seem then that the maximum water holding capacity of our soil is between Ifi and 18 per cent. (All moisture percentages given in this bul - letin are figured on the basis of the dry weight of the soil; for example, 10 per cent represents that for each one hundred units of try soil that there are ten units of water present.)

STORING WATER IN THE SOIL BY SUMMER TILLAGE Ioring water in the soil consists of getting the water into oil and then preventing its escape. Hummer tillage Iras the most efficient of all methods of storing water. This is expected, since the surface is always in condition, if the is properly done, to catch any rain that falls and to check iration from the surface. Also on properly summer tilled there are no weeds or other vegetation allowed to grow and he water from the soil. In the following tables are given relative to the accumulation of water in the soil.

            <seg id="p022">22 Research Bulletin No. 5 inches of water were retained from a rainfall of 12.7 inches. This was about 12 per cent of the total rainfall. It will be noted that this field contained almost as much water the middle of June as it did at the close of the season. On June 15 it had available moisture to a depth of live feet. The field was in good condition, from a moisture standpoint, to seed to a field crop such as cane. Or. if one were preparing to seed alfalfa, the early spring cultivation not only prepares the seed bed and gets rid of weeds, but accumulates moisture to start the crop. From the data given in this table, there have been two years, 1908 and 1912, when water was accumulated to a depth of several feet in time for seeding alfalfa by the middle of June. A stand of alfalfa is much more certain with several feet of moist soil for a seed bed than where only the surface is moist. From the table and the discussion of it, we find that the amount of water which can be stored varies greatly with the different years. The per cent of the total rainfall held varies from 10 to 33 j&gt;er cent. During the summer of 1908, there were eight rains of more than one-half inch each, three of which were more than an inch each. There were also rainy periods when light rains came so close together that the surface soil would be wet from one rain until the next and, therefore, even a small rain would penetrate below the surface. During the summer of 1910. only three rains came of more than one-half inch, two of which were over an inch. The season of 1911 was better from the standpoint of total amount of rain, but the distribution was such that the moisture could not be held. During dry seasons, with the high rate of evaporation and extremely hot surface soil. ra half inch of rain may be lost before it gets into the soil deep enough to be retained, if it comes as an isolated shower. Where the surface is dry, a rain of less than one-half inch is of no value whatever in storing water, tho it may be of great value to the crops. A half inch of water will not get thru the loose mulch on the surface unless the mulch is still moist from a previous rain. It is also noted from the tables that the water content was not increased below three feet in 1910 or 1911. In 1912 it was increased to five feet, while in 1908 and 1909 the soil was filled as deep as the samples were taken. The weather records for the years under consideration show the causes of the variation in the results of storing moisture as shown in Table 4. The table shows that during some seasons, when the rainfall is low or poorly distributed, it is impossible to accumulate much water in the soil by summer tillage. </seg>

            <seg id="p025">25 Charts I to IV show graphically the amount .of water stored by summer tilling. Chart I shows the work done in four fields. Two of these fields were summer tilled during the summer of 1908. which was a good year for storing water. The other two fields were summer tilled during dry seasons. In this chart the base line represents 8 per cent, or practically the lower limit of available water. All water added to the soil above this point and held within reach of the plant roots can be used by the crop. The foot sections of soil are shown on the left of the chart. This chart further illustrates the fact that the amount of water which can be stored by summer tilling in this soil is largely governed by the amount and distribution of the precipitation. Chart II shows the average amount of water in the upper six feet of soil in three fieldR, and the amount of precipitation during the interval. Rh square on the chart, as we go upward from the bottom, nts 1 per cent of water in the soil or one inch of rain. As 'rom the left to the right on the chart, a square represents &gt;d of ten days time. According to work done by Drs. and Shantz of the Bureau of Plant Industry, the ap - ate lower limit of moisture available for plant growth is iat too low as represented on this chart. In the spring each of three fields here represented had about the same, average water content. The water content of the field sown to wheat increases slightly, under the heavy May rains, until the latter part of May. After this date the crop not only uses the rain that falls, but draws on the soil for almost four inches of stored water. After harvest an increase is shown, and at the last sampling the wheat and cornfields have about the same amount of water. That the wheatfield did not gain in water content as rapidly in the spring as either of the other fields was due to the fact that the crop was already using a good portion of the rain that came. It will be noted that the field listed to corn increased in water content almost as rapidly to July 1 as did the summer tilled field. Up to this time the corn plants, few in number and small as compared with the wheat, were not making much demand for water. Almost five inches of water had been retained from the rains up to this time. At this period the corn began to use more water and not only used the rain that fell, but used more than five inches of water that had been stored in the soil. The sum - mer tilled field retained this and remained thru the winter with practically all the water the soil would carry in the upper </seg>

Each section of the chart is divided by minor lines. The spaces between these lines represent five per cent of water in the soil.

The wilting point as indicated on these charts is probably somewhat high as is shown by field results. All water over 8 per cent is available for crop use in this soil. The chart is divided to show the different months and days of the month. The perpendicular lines near the top represent the amounts of various rains on various dates. The total for the month is shown in figures at the top of that section. The heavy, solid, horizontally-drawn lines represent the moisture content of the soil at that particular depth. (This explanation will serve for all charts of this kind used in this bulletin.) It will be noted from the chart that at the first sampling the first foot of soil was filled with water and some water was avail - able in the second foot. Below that the soil was dry. The chart shows several heavy rains between the sampling in June and that done in July. The June sampling showed that the third foot was beginning to receive water and that the fourth foot had not yet received any water. In July the sampling was done an soon after the heavy rain that the first three feet had more water than they would hold. Water had penetrated to five feet. At the time of the first sampling in August, the first six feet were filled to the maximum carrying capacity.

The chart further s that the amount and distribution of the rain was such 10 great amount of water could be stored. The water did ;t into the soil to such a depth that it could be conserved. DEPTH TO WHICH WATER HAS BEEN STORED IN ONE SEASON. Iie depths to which water can be stored in a given length of depends upon several factors: the type of soil, the underly - rtrata, the amount and distribution of the rainfall, the nt of water already in the soil at the beginning of the in - 1, and weather conditions. A light sandy type of soil will absorb water much more readily than a heavy type of soil. The same amount of water will be distributed thruout a greater area in a light soil than in a heavy soil. The maximum carrying capacity is lower in a light soil. Furthermore, there is less resistance to the downward movement of water thru a light soil. A shallow soil overlying a stratum that is practically impervious to water or a layer of coarse gravel or sand may require only a small amount of water to bring it up to its carrying capacity. In this case any addi - tional water would be lost. It is obvious that the amount of precipitation and its dis - tribution is an important factor in determining the depth to which water can be stored in a given interval. Where only a small seasonal rain comes, a relatively small amount will be held, and consequently a relatively smaller portion of the soil will be moistened. An isolated rain even of a considerable amount falling on a hot, dry surface is largely lost. The distri - bution of the rainfall, therefore, plays an important part. It is during rainy seasons where rains are rather frequent that mois - ture is most easily accumulated. In the following table are given data to show the depth to which water has been accumulated during each of six years. K;uh year two samplings are shown, — one at the beginning of rhe season, the other at the close, — and in every case the field was summer tilled : </seg>

            <seg id="p031">31 We have nsed a summer tilled field because summer tillage is more effective than any other farm practice in storing moisture. In the lower portion of the table are given the rainfall during the intervals, the number of inches of water held in the upper 6 feet of the soil, and the per cent of the total rainfall held in the upper 6 feet. In some cases, which is true in 1909, water was accumulated below 6 feet, but we have not tried to show this in the per cent since below C fcot the soil is not as uniformly dry at the first sampling as it is above 6 feet. This is shown in two fields used in 1910 and 1911. Tt is evident that in either of these years no water was accumulated below 6 feet, and yet there is no agreement between the first and second samplings on these fields. This is probably due to the sampling in different places in the field and in one vase finding more water left by the pre - ceding crop than in the other. I: will be noted that for the year 1907 the first sampling was aly 3 feet. This is the depth we were sampling in the g. At the close of the season, the soil was practically filled depth of 6 feet. In 1908 the spring sampling was to 6 feet, luring the season n longer tube was obtained and samplings e fall were taken to 10 feet.

In water was accumulated to 5 feet. It will be noted that during these six years we have held from 10 to 33 per cent of the rainfall in the upper 6 feet of the soil. Reference to the distribution of the rainfall in the tables given under climatic data will probably explain this. These data are taken from 5- and 10-acre fields, one of which is summer tilled each year at the Station and receives uni - formly good summer tillage. Tt shows, however, that we cannot store moisture unless it falls in sufficient amount and with a proper distribution to get it into the soil. EFFECT OF CONDITION OF SOIL AT SURFACE AND CHARACTER OF RAIN ON WATER RETENTION. Ee condition of the surface soil has an important influence : amount of water that will be retained from a certain rain. • runs off much more freely from a smooth, dry surface </seg>
            <seg id="p032">32 than from a surface which has been loosened by cultivation. The smooth, compact soil has less chnnce to hold the water and the dry soil offers more resistance to the penetration of the water than does a soil that is more open. Where the surface has been cultivated, the water runs into the openings made by the imple - ment used, and is held until it can soak into the soil. Where the surface has not been stirred, there are no open spaces to catch the water. As soon as the soil at the surface has been filled, it can hold no more water except as the water is removed from the surface by penetration. The water which falls above this amount will be lost as run-off unless the surface is level. Obviously the amount of run-off from any rain is governed largely by the tvpe of soil and character of the rain. A loose, sandy soil offers so little resistance to the penetration of water that there is little run-off. The soil particles composing the sandy soil are larger than those of heavier soil, and consequently the open spaces are larger and water readily penetrates into the soil. It is only dur - ing excessively heavy rains that run-off is seen in real sandy soil. The resistance to the penetration of water increases as the soil becomes heavier or more like clay. All gradations are found, from the sand, which offers so little resistance, to the gumbo, where penetration is extremely slow. We have observed that water will stand for several days over a heavy gumbo spot, and be lost mainly by evaporation rather than by penetration ; often l»enetrating only a few inches into the soil. The character of the rain has also an important influence on the amount of water which will be retained from any given rain. The more rapidly the water falls on the surface the greater the inn-off. During heavy, torrential rains the water falls so rapidly Hunt it does not have time to penetrate into the soil and must be lost as run-off. The beating drops of water often puddle or clog the surface, making it more difficult for the water to enter. It is a matter of common observation that a heavy downpour of rain frequently does less good than a much lighter rain that falls more slowly. The type of rain that is really most beneficial is the rain of sufficient amount and falling slowly enough to be carried into the soil to a depth where it will not be exposed to the rapid surface evaporation.

From here it is soon lost thru the rapid evaporation which takes place at the surface. On the other hand, where the soil is already moist wheB the rain conies, it is much more quickly carried away from the surface, thus giving place for more water from the rain to be held at the surface. It is also distributed to lower depths in the soil and thus protected from the rapid loss at the surface. Fre - quent observations have been made along this line on the native sod. This is usually hard and dry. It is seldom wet more thau a few inches by the rains that come singly. The lower depths ro - eeive moisture only during "rainy" or "wet spells" when a second rain comes before the moisture from the preceding rain is lost.

A little more than one inch of water was retained in the alfalfa, bnt it waB held in the upper five inches, where it was soon lost by the surface evaporation or used by the crop. The soil was so dry as shown by the first sampling that the water could penetrate but slowly into it. The corn plat shows an accumulation of more water than fell during the rain, indicating that it had caught some of the run-off from the sod land and roadway just above the fteld. The water acquired from the rain had penetrated into the soil in the cornfield to a depth of eighteen inches, thus getting deeply enough into the soil to escape the rapid evaporation at the surface. This shows how much more rapidly water will penetrate a moist soil than a dry soil, as well as the fact that the cultivated surface in the corn retained much more water than the dry, firm, surface in the alfalfa field. tlO. — Effect of surface condition and moisture content on storing water, 1912.

Frequently indications of this kind have been found, and. when there is sufficient water below, there may be some upward movement caused by a change in the temperature at the surface. We have, however, attributed these slight changes to nonuniformity of the soil or. to experimental error, the scope of either of which is sufficient to cover almost any such difference found. In Table 11 are given the data obtained from sampling two fields at different times during the season of 1912. The lowest line of figures gives the amount of rainfall in inches during the period just preceding the date of sampling. It will be noted from the table that the sod land was very dry below the second foot at the time of the first sampling. The third foot shows an in - crease in the water content April 29 and the fourth foot at the following sampling. The following two periods, May 25 and June 10, show a slight increase in moisture in the fifth foot. After this date the soil water is used by the grass and the soil is not again moistened below the first foot. The moisture reached the lower depths in the sod land only during the period of fre - quent rains. The data given in the second portion of the table were ob - tained from a field adjacent to the sod land, which was in oats 1911 and sown to cane 1912. This field was kept clean cultivated until July 3, when it was sown to cane. It will be noted from this portion of the table that the maximum amount of water shown on any sampling date in the upper six feet of soil was on May 11. Tt was not evenly distributed on that date. The upper three feet contained more than they could hold for any consider - able length of time. After May 11 the weather was dry, and only light showers fell until after the cane was seeded (July 3) and began using water. The water content of the soil shows a loss during this period. There is a gradual downward movement of water in the soil in this field from April 22 to June 29, at which date the lower depths contain more water than at any other sampling date during the season. The increase in moisture con - tent in the lower depths at this date was due to the excess water from above moving downward and not to additional water from rains. After July 26, the crop not only uses the rainfall that comes, but uses the water that was stored in the soil during the early part of the season. The samplings are too infrequent to show from wnat portions of the soil it was first used. The table also shows that the cane crop used water from the soil at a depth </seg>

            <seg id="p039">39 The curves shown in Chart V represent the moisture content in a hrome grass field and also a field which was in corn in 1908. The bronie grass was seeded in 1905. The moisture content is practically the same in the two fields in the spring. The cultivated field soon begins to increase in moisture content, reaching its maximum in June and holding it until late in July. At the time that the crop required most water the soil was filled to almost full carrying capacity. The brome grass field did not accumulate much water tho the rainfall was high, as shown by the heavy. Rolid line. These curves illustrate again the effect of tillage and plant growth on the amount of water accumulated in the soil. The fields are adjacent, and the difference shown is doubtless due to the tillage in the cornfield, which retained more of the rain - fall, and the growth of brome grass which used the water as fast as it came. The corn was young and not using much water until in July. As compared with the grass field there were far fewer plants on a given area to use water. EFFECT OF CULTIVATION. Cultivation is the one practical means for storing moisture in the soil on any considerable acreage. Our experience shows that summer tillage is the most efficient method for storing water which we have followed. A number of other methods, however, have been studied, to determine their effect. In the tables rela - tive to the effect of the condition of the surface, it was shown that a cultivated surface would catch more water than a smooth sur - face. The difference that will be shown between the amount of water held by a cultivated surface and that held by a smooth surface is greater during heavy rains than during light rains. It has also been found that plowed ground or listed ground usually catches more water from any certain rain than does a surface which has been disked. Cultivation not only puts the surface in shape to catch the rain but is the means by which the moisture is saved after it has gotten into the soil. By cultivation, weeds are killed and thereby prevented from using the water, and the surface is loosened, forming a soil mulch which reduces evapora - tion from the surface. Ii the following tables are given data obtained relative to feet of cultivation. Space allows for only a small portion I data which we have on any of these subjects. The results, rer, are usually quite similar and we have aimed to show representative results. Many times the weather conditions ncli that no great difference is shown between one method mother. In other cases a greater difference is found. </seg>

            <seg id="p041">41 In 1908 the work was done on a piece of land which had been in small grain the previous year, and was being summer tilled. A portion of the field was left in the spring without disking; the other portion of the field received two diskings before the close of the test, when the field was plowed. It will be noted that there was very little difference in the moisture content of these two tracts up to June 13. After this date the difference becomes greater. During the interval when this work was being done, a total of ten inches of water fell. This was sufficient to replace in the soil not disked any water which may hare been lost from the surface or used by weeds. The sampling was done only to three feet, and it may have been that more difference would have been seen below this "depth. In 1911 no difference in the moisture content was found in the first foot between disked land and land not disked. But where the soil had been disked there was an ac - cumulation of more than one inch of water in the second foot, while no water had penetrated into the second foot where the soil was not disked. During this interval a total of 5.5 inches of rain fell. In 1912 in the field recorded in Table 12 no benefit was found from disking.

            <seg id="p042">42 Research Bulletin No. 5 ture content of these two plats was sufficient to make the plat which had been disked plow in good shape while the other was too dry to plow. In summing up the data given in these two tables, it seems that moisture is conserved by disking following the binder if there is sufficient water in the soil after harvest to start weeds. In some cases we do not get a great deal of difference in the mois - ture content while in others we get a greater difference. But the disking will usually serve a twofold purpose. It will loosen the surface of the soil to catch and retain water and will kill most of the weeds. It is, however, frequently so dry after harvest that it is necessary to weight the disk in order to make it cut into the soil deeply enough to kill the weeds-: In Table 14 are given some data obtained from three plats of soil in 1912. On one of these plats the soil was kept thoroly stirred with a disk and any weeds which escaped the disk were cut with a hoe. On another plat the surface was not cultivated, but the weeds were kept cut with a hoe. The third plat was not cultivated and the weeds were allowed to grow. At the close of the test it is shown that there was very little more water in the upper three feet of soil where it had been disked than where it had not been disked. There is a difference, however, in the mois - ture content of the 4th. 5th, and 6th feet, which indicates that more water was caught and retained on the surface which was disked than on the smooth surface. The soil on which weeds had been growing was dry all the way down except the first foot. The moisture shown in the first foot was acquired from a rain just previous to the last sampling. Table 15 gives the results from a test made to determine the relative effectiveness of plowing nnd disking to store water. The disking was done August 22 and the plowing August 25 and 29. The plowing was done to a deivth of five to six inches. The disk was not weighted, but was set :is deep as it would cut. Most of the weeds were killed by the disking nnd the surface soil was all stirred. During the interval in which the test was conducted, a total of 2.25 inches of rain fell. It will be noted from the table that during the period the plowed soil retained enough water to increase the moisture content of the second foot. In the disked soil there is no increase- in moisture content in the second foot. The greater loss of water shown in the first foot in the disked soil than is shown in the first foot in the plowed land may be due to some weeds having escaped the disk and then having used the water, or it may be due to the witter being held closer to the sur - face in the disked soil and exposed to greater evaporation. </seg>

All of the considerable number of tests that have been made during the past several years show an advantage of plowing' over disking to store water. In many cases the difference is very small and depends largely on the weather conditions and the weeds that escape the disk. If the weather continues dry during a test of this kind or if the disking kills the weeds as thoroly as the plowing, little difference will be found. If the disking, how - ever, does not kill all the weeds the difference will be greater, depending upon the amount of water used by the weeds. Where heavy rains come during the test, the advantage 1 of plowing over disking will be greater. The plowing puts the soil in better shape than does the disk to catch the heavy rains.

            <seg id="p046">46 Research Bulletin No. 5 in tnis test was to check the etteot of the neglect of cultivation with the effect of growing weeds. It is seen from the table that each of fhe plats contained nearly the same amount of water at the beginning of the test. No great variation is seen until •June 29. It is noticed that the difference in water content be - tween the thoroly tilled plat and the weedy plat is much greater than the difference between the thoroly tilled plat and the plat not cultivated but kept free of weeds. There was several times as much water lost from the weedy plat as from the one where only cultivation was lacking. Emust be borne in mind that this work was started with a ilmost filled with water, and carried on during a season of ' rainfall. There was no prolonged or extremely dry spell of weather this season. The results apply to the loss of water after it has been gotten into the soil, and show that on this type of soil under a normal rate of evaporation growing weeds cause a much greater loss of water from the soil than surface evapora - tion. We cannot say what the results would have been if we had started, with a soil filled with water and had run the test thru a very dry season. It is probable tho that the lose from an uncul - tivated surface would be much greater. The results given in Table 14 show that during a less favorable season and starting with a soil comparatively dry below the second foot, there is much less water retained from the rains where the surface is not cultivated than '.*&gt; retained by the cultivated surface, which fur - ther proves that from the viewpoint of storing water a cultivated surface is essential. ARTIFICIAL MULCHES. It is a rather common practice to use artificial mulches among shrubs, small fruit, and in some cases vegetables. The Station has done some work to determine the value of artificial mulches from the viewpoint of catching and holding the water that falls. These mulches are usually composed of old hay, straw, or manure. From the viewpoint of retaining water, they are most efficient and have a practical application. Wherever it is desired to grow shrubs, ornamentals, or small fruit, the mulch can be used for retaining water. Against its efficiency in holding water the opinion is sometimes advanced that it forms a harboring place for injurious insects. We have no data on the latter point. In the following tables the effect of the mulch on the water con - tent of the soil is shown. We are offering two tables on the effect of mulch. A number </seg>
            <seg id="p047">47 of tests have been made along this line, all of which have given practically the same results, and have shown that an artificial mulch of hay or straw several inches thick, if kept intact, is inure efficient than a soil mulch in retaining water. It is obvious that water would find less resistance in the hay mulch than it would in a soil mulch. The hay mulch is also more efficient as shown by Table 18 in checking loss from evaporation.

A second portion was not mulched until the surface became dry enough to work, when it was stirred to a depth of about one and one-half inches with a hoe. The third portion was left untreated. After putting on the hay, no further attention was given this mulch. The plat where the soil was stirred to retain a mulch was kept free of weeds and the surface stirred occasionally. The portion not worked at all soon became weedy. Tho only a few weeks of grow - ing seasou remained, a considerable growth of redroot, foxtail, and other grasses was produced. Just how much of the water lost from the plat not mulched was used by the weeds cannot be stated. Judging from the amount of growth, the major por - tion of the loss must have been from this cause. The table shows an average difference in the amount of water held until the close of the experiment of a little more than one per cent in favor of the hay mulch over the soil mulch, showing that a mulch of straw or hay is more effective in reducing surface evaporation than one made by stirring the soil.

LOSS OF WATER FROM THE SOIL. t There are three ways by which water may be lost after it has en gotten into the soil : First, by escape downward by percola - )n; second, by evaporation from the surface; third, by trans - ration, or by being used by plants. tOf the first-named means of loss little need be said. It is sel - &gt;m that we get enough water into the soil at this Station to low percolation beyond the reach of the plant. Percolation does not take place until a soil is filled beyond its carrying capacity. This point is seldom reached, and, if reached, we cannot control percolation. The second means of escape, that is, by evaporation from the surface, is to a certain extent under the control of the farmer. There will always be some loss, but it can be reduced to a mini - mum. The water that evaporates from the surface reaches the surface much the same as oil from the bowl of the lamp reaches the flame. The water passes from one soil particle to another until it reaches the surface and is lost by evaporation. Tbis up - ward movement is much more rapid when the soils are wet and is retarded as they dry out. If the surface of the soil is cultivated it becomes loose and dry. Either condition tends to retard the further movement of water to the surface. Water moves very slowly thru a loose or dry soil. In this section a rain is usually followed by a hot sun and wind. These cause a more rapid loss of water from the surface than can be supplied by capillarity from adjoining soil particles. The result is that the soil surface soon dries. This is in itself a check to surface evaporation. The water from below moves slowly thru the dry surface. If the rain was of sufficient amount to make the surface smooth and connect with the under moisture, it should be stirred as soon as practical. In order to reduce evaporation from the surface to a minimum, it is essential to have on the surface not only a dry soil, but a loose soil. Cultivation will stir the surface soil, cause it to dry out more quickly, and leave the soil grains not so closely in con - tact. The fewer the points of contact between the small particles of soil and the drier they become, the more effective is the mulch in reducing evaporation. Another reason for cultivation soon after a rain, especially where a field is bare, is that a smooth soil blows muoh more quickly than a rough soil. This, of course, Ki to the soils that are light enough to blow and in regions uent high winds. </seg>
            <seg id="p050">50 Research Bulletin Xo. S On this type of soil we feel that two to threfc inches is sufli ciently deep to make an effective imileh. Where the mulch is too shallow, there will be enough circulation of air thru the" mulch to cause considerable loss. On this soil almost any imple - ment that stirs the surface can be used if it does not pulverize the soil too finely. Where the surface has become *o dry that the drag-harrow pulverizes, we prefer the disk. On still lighter soils the disk might pulverize too much and make some other im - plement preferable. The objections to a real fine or dust mulch are that it will blow and that it offers too great resistance, to the penetration of water. The third means of escape of water from the soil, that of being drawn out by growing vegetation, is much mor£ effective on this type of soil than surface evaporation (see Tables 14 and 17). Considering only the moisture content of the soil, the water used by any plant is lost. From the point of view of the farmer, only the water used by weeds is lost. This is, of course, a real loss, since the* weetls have little value. The water that is taken up tthe roots of the crops, passed thru the plant, and then exhaled the leaves, has served its purpose in plant growth. Tt is for t purpose that we strive to store the moisture in the soil. DEPTH TO WHICH CROPS HAVE USED MOISTURE. The depth to which a crop will use moisture depends upon the root development of the crop, the length of its growing sea - son, its normal development, and the type of soil on which it is being grown. Some crops 'make more root development than others and naturally send their roots deeper into the soil to obtain water and plant food. , An extreme example of deep feeding is seen in alfalfa. Other crops feed to a lesser depth. The length of the growing season also affects the depth to which water is used. A perennial crop, such^s grass, will dry the soil to a consider - ably greater depth in a series of years than it will in one vear. It may be that there is some continued growth of the roots, and that they keep growing so long as they ran find water; or the drying of the lower soil may be due -to the water being brought to the roots by capillary action during the greatly extended time. Winter wheat, due to its longer growing senson, develops a deej&gt;er root system than does spring wheat, and consequently uses the water from a lower depth than does spring wheat. During a very unfavorable season a crop may become so in - jured that it will not make normal development and consequently </seg>
            <seg id="p051">51 Knot use the water to as great depth as it would had it de - ed normally. Indications of this were observed in a number ats in 1911. The crops were so damaged by the hot winds they died while available water was within their reach, had made normal development. The water was not available in derable amount but could have been used under normal con - as. The demand for water, under such extreme conditions, greater than could be supplied from a soil so nearly dry and plant in a weakened condition. The type of soil is an important factor in determining the depth to 'which crops will feed. On a loose or a sandy soil that offers but little resistance to the penetration of the roots, a plant Will send its roots to a greater depth than on a heavier soil that offers more resistance. A layer of gumbo or hardpan underlying the surface soil at no great depth will prove more or less im - pervious to plant roots and cause the crop to feed in the soil above. SJi;ile or rock has the same effect but it is more marked. It is a matter of common observation that during dry seasons the crop will suffer first on those spots in the field where an im - pervious stratum of some kind conies nearest the surface. In the following tables are given data to indicate the depth to which some of the various crops send their roots and use the moisture. The per cent of water in the soil at seeding time and at harvest is shown. Summer tilled land was used in every test. This, in every test, gave available water in every foot - ion to a depth greater than the plant would use it. By com paring the water content of the soil at seeding and harvest times we mn see to what depth water was used: </seg>

            <seg id="p054">54 It will be noted from Tables 20 and 21 that in most cases a rather distinct break is shown in the water content at harvest lime at some depth. Take for example oats. There is in every case a more or less wide break in the amount of water at harvest lime between the fourth and fifth foot-sections. In fact this is generally true of all spring small grain crops. The break ap - pears in the record to be abrupt. This is not quite true in the field, but is due to the method of taking the samples. The samples are taken in foot-sections and the break appears to MM abruptly between them. Tf the samples were taken in inch-sections a gradual lessening in water content would be found to extend thru several inches. This rather abrupt break in water content seems to indicate the feeding depth of the roots. A sufficient number of roots go down to this point to take out must of the available water. There are frequently indica - tions of loss of water from the section just below the drier soil. A few roots may have entered this lower depth and used sonic water, or the loss may be due to some water having moved by capillary action into the feeding zone of the roots. The amount of this water used by the roots from the lower depths is very It will he noted in the tables that the first foot and even the iid foot siiinr times show considerable water at harvest.

Iwm Table 20 it will be seen that oats, spring wheat, and v feed to a depth of four feet or a little more. In some as spring wheat in 1910. the available water has been from the fifth foot. Taking the average, however, it shows &gt;urth foot dry and the fifth rather moist. Table 21 shows •orn does not take out as much water as do the small grain . This is probably due to the lesser number of plants on a </seg>

When the cane is drilled over all the ground and a greater number of plants must be supported, more of the water is used. The table shows that the corn feeds to a depth of at least four feet in this soil. Winter wheat feeds deeper than corn or spring grain. It uses water from the sixth and the seventh foot. The difficulty in de - termining this point has been to get enough water in the soil at those depths so that the break in moisture content would show plainly. Many times there has been no available water in those sections even tho the field had been summer tilled. The evidence is that the roots penetrate to six or seven feet when there is available moisture. This is in accord with work done by the Wyoming Station and reported in an unnumbered pamphlet.

From the standpoint of the farmer is farming under a limited rainfall, weeds are his worst ies. Any water used by weeds is lost to the crop. It is y practicable to keep all weeds down, but the crop is usually hort to the extent that it has been robbed of the water by In the Allowing tables we give data showing the effect of weeds on soil moisture. Wreds have the additional harmful effect of using available plant food, and, if allowed to use all the available water, leave tho soil in such a dry condition that extra labor is required to get it into a good state of tilth. • Bui.

The weeds come on, using a part or all of the accumu - water, and the previous labor is largely lost. The work shown in Table 23 is a continuation of that shown in Table 22 for 1907. on the effect of weeds. The same plats were used. There is a difference of almost two per cent of water at the first sampling. The plat that is kept cultivated does not accumulate any additional water during the season, as it is already filled with water. Tnstead of being summer tilled it should have been cropped. The plat that was allowed to become weedy lost moisture thruout the season, and was as dry at the time of small grain harvest as it would have been if it had been cropped. The plat that was kept clean contained more than five inches more water than the plat which grew the weeds. The data given in Table 24 were obtained from a field which was being plowed May 20. 1011. It was noticed that where weeds were growing the soil was very dry and turned over lumpy and hard. Where there were no weeds, the soil was in good condition to plow and work down for a seed bed. Samples were obtained and the difference iu the moisture content ascertained. The weeds were mainly Russian thistles and were small, averag - ing only two to three inches high. Their growth, however, had consumed over an inch of water, mainly from the first foot of soil. Had the land been worked and these weeds killed early in the season, this water would have been saved for the use of the crop and less labor required to prepare a good seed bed.

The data given in Table 27 were obtained from an experiment on disking grain stubble after harvest. A portion of the field was disked with a weighted disk. A portion of the field where weeds were growing was chosen for the work before disking. The disk killed most of the weeds. The balance were killed with a hoe. The work was of short duration, due to the fact that the field was plowed soon after the last sampling date. About two inches of rain fell after the disking was done and before the final sampling.

Where the weeds were killed, a little more than one-half of the rain which fell was saved. The second six inches was moistened, and the soil was in good condition to plow. We attribute this difference more to the killing of the weeds than to the fact that the surface soil was disked. However, it was the disking that killed the weeds.

In Chart VI is graphically shown the water content, by foot sections to six feet, in the soils of three plats receiving different treatment. The data are shown in Table 17. The solid line represents the water content of a plat receiving the best tillage we could give it. The broken line represents the water content in a plat not cultivated but the weeds kept down with a hoe. The line designated by crosses represents the water content in a plat where weeds were allowed to grow. This chart shows that growing weeds were a much greater factor than lack of cultiva - tion in losing water from this soil. when previously filled with water. After the weeds had been killed by frost so that they were no longer using so much water, rains partially filled the first two feet of soil. The difference at the last sampling is therefore not so great as earlier in the season. Chart VIT shows graphically the use of water from the soil by a corn crop.

This sampling was done so soon after a rain that the moisture had not had time to move downward. The first sampling in July shows that this moisture had moved into the lower depths, as indicated by the abrupt rise in the curves in the fifth and sixth foot-sections. After July 20 the crop not only uses the light rains that come but uses the available water from the first four feet of soil. The use of the water from the first three feet of soil is rather gradual and simultaneous. From the fourth foot it is abrupt. The first four feet are dried to about 10 per cent. The fifth and sixth feet contain IS per cent at harvest, showing that the roots feed to at least four feet. The data in Table 2S were obtained from frequent sampling made on a plat summer tilled 1!)12 and growing spring wheat 1913. It was hoped to show more clearly how the moisture is used from the soil. ' At the first sampling the first and second feet are taken in foot-sections. Thereafter they are divided into six-inch sections. The table shows the soil practically filled with water at the first sampling. Very little water is used the first month. Rains occasionally replenish the water near the surface. On June 23 the third foot was practically dry and on July 8 the fourth foot was dry.

Chart XII shows available water in the first two feet of soil. This was held from the very heavy rain in October. 1908, shown in Chart XI, and from the snow shown in February, 1909. During the entire season, tho there were several heavy rains, no water reached the third foot. The chart indicates a change in the water content of the fifth foot. This is doubtless due to error for. there is no such change indicated in the third and fourth feet. Chart XIII shows at the first sampling an accumulation of water in the first foot of soil and a very little available water in the second foot. The third foot and below remain dry thruout the season. The second foot becomes dry during May and re - mains dry thruout the remainder of the season. It will be noted from this chart that during the latter part of May all available water was exhausted from the soil. From this time until harvest the crop was entirely dependent on the rain. Just enough rain came to pull the crop thru. The crop did not ripen naturally, but simply dried. This is shown by the harvest date which is very early as compared with the preceding years shown. Chart XIV shows that there was no available water in the ■oil at seeding time. This made the crop entirely dependent on the seasonal rainfall. The rainfall was deficient. During the early part of the season, while the crop was small and using very little water, only a small amount of water accumulated in the second foot. The latter part of May the crop began to suffer. By June 4 all growth had ceased, and by June 15 the crop was dead. With the exception of the slight increase in water con - tent of the second foot in May. it remained dry all the season until the heavy rain in October. The second foot was practically dr.v from the last of July. 1909. until the first of October, 19li. Chart XV shows available water in the first two feet of soil in February. 1912. Tn May the moisture has increased, filling the first three feet and passing into the fourth, fifth, and sixth. The rainfall of May and June was almost as low as for the same months in 1911. The crop had the reserve water in the soil to draw upon, however, and made a yield of 11.2 bushels an acre. The chart shows how rapid the crop will use water from the soil when it is forced to depend almost entirely on the water in the soil. Without the reserve in the soil the crop would have died of drouth in Mav or June.

In Table 29 was shown the effect of capillarity when operat - ing just above a constant supply of free water. Under these conditions the force was very active and within certain limits would be a grent factor in crop production. In Table 30 are given data to show its effect when removed from a supply of free water. In this table the fourth foot of soil is shown to be prac - tically dry from June. 1910, to .Tnly. 1911. The fifth foot con - tains about fotir per cent more water, and is only three or four per cent below saturation. We do not find,, however, that any water is drawn from the fifth foot to replace that which had been uaed by the crop from the fourth foot. Even in a period of seven - teen months the content of either foot remains very little changed. In fact we have abundant proof that capillary move - ment is feeble in soils that are dried any considerable extent below the saturation point. The evidence indicates that, in the main, the plant roots, to obtain water, extend themselves into the soil sone where available water is present, rather than depend upon the water being brought to them by capillarity. </seg>

Some is lost as run-off. Especially was this true in the case of winter wheat in 1912. When the heavy snows of that spring melted the soil was frozen below a depth of three inches. Not only did we lose this moisture as run-off but the snow melted so fast that in some cases it washed off the unfrozen soil. Rhe entire rainfall plus the water drawn from the soil is sd as total available water. Dividing the total number of ds of water by the number of pounds of dry matter pro - duced, we have the number of pounds of water to produce one IJ of dry matter. -This table is not offered for its technical . The method of procedure was too crude to give it much from that standpoint. We are using it to prove what vation has so often indicated, that during unfavorable sea - a given amount of water will not produce as large a crop tring favorable seasons. An inch of water in a favorable n goes much further than a like amount in an unfavorable n. The table shows that some years almost twice as much water is required to produce a pound of dry matter as is re- Ied in certain other years. The total rainfall alone is not cient to interpret results. The distribution of rainfall, evap - ion, temperature, relative humidity, and wind velocity, all :t the efficiency of the rainfall in crop production. The rain - of this section is seldom so low but that it would produce crops if properly distributed and accompanied by a favor - rate of evaporation. The high rate of evaporation and the winds resultant from drouthy conditions are frequently more disastrous than the drouth itself. In a few days these will in - jure a crop to the point where it can at best only partially re - cover, whereas under more favorable conditions it would have held on for a considerable length of time and perhaps have been saved by a rain. This is often shown by results obtained from protected areas. E table also shows that a year which is favorable for small not necessarily favorable for corn. An example of this in 1908.

            <seg id="p080">■ Reneareh Bulletin No. 5 CLIMATIC CONDITIONS. In order that the data offered in this bulletin may be more clearly understood, we are giving several tables to show the climatic conditions under which this work was done. Figure 2 and Table 32 give annual precipitations and show years of high and years of low rainfall. Other tables give the average daily temperature, wind velocity, and rate of evaporation from a free - water surface for certain months for the years 1908 to 1912. These averages show almost as wide variation as the rainfall. The averages are, however, not so important as the extremes. For example, in Table 37, June, 1911, shows an average wind velocity of 10.5 miles per hour. In that month the daily average for the four days, 12th to 15th, was about fifteen miles an hour. There were hours within these days when the wind velocity was much higher than others. Tt is the extreme conditions that are critical. Those four days would do much more damage to the crop than many days of less wind. The extreme wind velocity within these days was doubtless much more damaging than the average. Another example is in Table 36. The highest average monthly evaporation given is for June, 1911. The four days. Bto 15th, which showed such a high wind velocity, also show h evaporation. Such days as these are what we call extreme tions. We will not attempt to give a discussion of the tic conditions, but a study of the several tables offered will more clearlv whv some of the results were obtained. </seg>
