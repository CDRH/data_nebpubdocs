         <seg id="p002">SUMMARY In three trials, yearling steers of good to choice quality which had ! been well wintered, were grazed on alfalfa or native-grass pasture for trom 70 to 140 days (referred to as Phase 1). While on pasture, they were given a full feed of corn or other concentrates. They were then l finished in dry lot on corn or other concentrates and alfalfa hay (referred to i as Phase 2). Similar steers were full-fed on corn or other concentrates and : | altalta hay for the entire trial. jj Steers fed on alfalfa pasture in Phase 1 (Lot 2) required less concert- H trates and alfalfa hay per unit of gain than the steers fed on native-grass i'j pasture in Phase 1 (Lot 3) or the steers fed in dry lot (Lot 1) [or the . I entire trial. As a straight average of the three trials (comparing Lots 1 and i: -), one month of alfalfa pasture for one steer had a replacement value of ' j= 263 pounds of alfalfa hay and 41 pounds of concentrates, and one acre .¦' jj Ot altalta pasture was equal to approximately 1.5 tons of alfalfa hay and . j) i-1 pounds of concentrates. One month of alfalfa pasture (comparing Lots \ 2 and 3) tor one steer had a replacement value of 27 steer days of native- |: grass pasture plus 46 pounds of alfalfa hay and 42 pounds of concentrates. 1 Steers fed on native-grass pasture (Lot 3) in Phase 1 required some- |" what more concentrates and alfalfa hay per unit of gain than the steers -j! in Lot 2. Compared with the steers in Lot 1, they required less alfalfa .S! hay per unit of gain. There was considerable variation in the relative con- f ¦ centrate requirement per unit oi gain between Lots ] and 3 in the three H years, believed to be due in part at least to differences in the way the }j steers in Lot 3 were managed in the different years. As a straight average of the three trials, one month's native-grass pasture for one steer was equal I to approximately 240 pounds of alfalfa hay. j There was no consistent market difference between the three lots of ' ] steers during the three years as far as could be determined from the price at which the steers sold or from such slaughter data as were secured. I i When judged by the rapidity and economy of gains, and by the market i desirability of the cattle produced, the practice of full-feeding yearling • steers of good quality on alfalfa or native-grass pasture and finishina them i in dry lot compared favorably with dry-lot feeding for the entire trial. j 11 I' </seg>

BAKER ( FOR SEVERAL YEARS alfalfa pasture and native-grass pasture have been used successfully in southwestern Nebraska in the production of i finished cattle. Snyder 1 in 1930 and the author 2 in 1933 reported the re - sults secured from trials at the North Platte Substation with yearling heifers full-fed grain on alfalfa pasture. '."• | In a later publication the author 8 reported results secured with yearling ] steers grazed on native-grass pasture with a full feed of grain, a limited feed of grain, or with no grain at all and then finished in dry lot. The present publication presents certain data secured and certain con - si elusions drawn from three years' work at the North Platte Substation in f. which yearling,steers were full-fed on alfalfa'pasture or on native-grass (j .... pasture for a part of the feeding.period and then finished.in dry lot, in ('¦{ comparison with similar steers full-fed in the dry lot for the entire feeding period. The trials reported in this publication were conducted in the summers of 1934, 1936, and 1937. GENERAL PLAN OF THE EXPERIMENTS .¦• ' .-¦ .'¦¦'.¦ ¦• . ¦ ¦. i -.¦"."' I ¦.• : The steers were divided into experimental lots early in May.. One lot was full-fed concentrates and alfalfa hay in dry lot throughout each experi - ment. Similar lots of steers were full-fed concentrates for from 70 to 140 days on alfalfa or native grass pasture and then finished in dry lot. Be - cause of variations in length!of the pasture periods and in the feeds used in different years, each trial is discussed separately. .-.-.: V'¦ ! CATTLE USED : ¦'.'-•- The cattle used were high-grade Hereford steers, grading good to choice. All of them came &gt; from the same Lincoln county herd. The average initial weight ranged from about 645 to 685 pounds. The steers for each trial were purchased as calves in the fall preceding the summer feeding period and were well wintered in the experimental lots at the North l Platte Substation. ...-!¦' ¦ . '. '¦'.. | PREVIOUS TOEATMENT OF CATTLE During the winters preceding the trials under discussion, feeds were used, which were most available and which seemed most economical under . conditions prevailing during the respective winters. - Alfalfa hay and silage made jfrom corn or Atlas sorgo were the roughages used. When silage formed the basis of the wintering ration, it was supplemented with alfalfa hay, cottonseed meal, soybean oil meal, linseed meal, tankage, or a com - bination of some of these feeds. In addition, a limited amount of grain . . IW. P. Snyder, The Use of Alfalfaj Pasture for Fattening Cattle. Nebr. Affr. Exp. Sta. Bui. 239, . 1930. •¦"¦. - I ¦ 'Marvel L.

         <seg id="p004">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 315 was fed. About the first of May the grain was increased so that at the beginning of the trials under discussion, the steers were eating from one - half to two-thirds of a full feed of grain. The object kept in mind during the winter was to obtain economical gains which averaged about 1.50 pounds per head daily and to bring the steers through the winter in good condition. The steers carried more flesh at the close of the wintering periods than would have been desirable had the first consideration been maximum summer gains on grass. In these trials, an important consideration was the marketing of the steers in the fall carrying flesh in keeping with their quality. In order to do this it was considered necessary to close the wintering periods with the steers carrying considerable flesh. FEEDS AND PASTURES USED Practically all of the corn fed was No. 2 yellow. In 1934, shelled corn was fed. In the other trials the corn was ground. The alfalfa hay graded U. S. No. 2 and U. S. No. 2 Leafy. In 1937 some rye which graded No. 2 was fed. Dried beet pulp and some cane molasses were also used in 1937. The molasses contained approximately 50 per cent sugar. The native-grass pastures consisted of buffalo (Buchloe dactyloides), blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), little bluestem (Andropogon scoparius), western wheat grass (Agropyron smithii), and a number of minor grasses. The alfalfa pastures used were old fields in which the stand was becom - ing thin. The alfalfa was grazed at the rate of three to three and one - half steers per acre. No attempt was made to measure the actual amount of forage con - sumed by the steers on pasture. It was estimated that they consumed not more than one-half as much forage as they would have consumed had they not received grain. As discussed in this publication, the pasture is reported as "steer days of pasture," one "steer day of pasture" being pasture for one steer for one day. SLAUGHTER DATA Because of circumstances beyond control, the slaughter data are not as complete as would have been desirable. Such data as were secured were obtained through the courtesy of Armour and Company and of Swift and Company, both of South Omaha. The slaughter data are discussed under the respective trials. FIRST TRIAL The first trial began on May 4, 1934. Lot 1 was full-fed shelled corn and alfalfa hay in dry lot throughout the feeding period of 154 days. Lot 2 was full-fed shelled corn on alfalfa pasture and Lot 3 on native-grass pasture during Phase I, which was seventy days in length. Both Lots 2 and 3 were then finished on shelled corn and alfalfa hay in dry lot. Lot 2 was fed in dry lot for 84 days and Lot 3 for 112 days. The dry-lot period is referred to as Phase 2. </seg>

Both lots were full-led rhelled corn and alfalfa hay in dry lot in Phase 2. Because of possible interest, certain data from Phases 1 and 2 are pre - sented separately in Tables 1 and 2. Table 3 contains the data for the entire trial and Figure 1 shows the average weight per head of the steers at different periods throughout the trial. It will be observed that all lots of steers consumed satisfactory amounts of corn whether on pasture or in dry lot. For the entire feeding period </seg>
         <seg id="p007">Alfalfa and Native-crass Pasture in Finishing Cattle . there, was very little difference in the average amount of corn consumed per head daily by the steers in the three lots. ¦.-"¦... The steers in Lot 2 gained more rapidly than the steers in Lot 1 during Phase 1, but this was reversed in Phase 2, so that for the entire trial the gains made by the steers in these two lots were identical. Gains made by the steers in Lot 3 wercmuch lower in Phase 1 but higher in Phase 2 than the gains made by the steers in the other two lots. ,In several trials, steers fed on native-grass pasture have invariably failed to make as rapid gains as steers in dry lot when first put on pasture. Because of the drouth in 1934, Phase 1 was terminated after 70 days. The low rate of gain early in the period and the shortness of the period itself make the average daily gains made by the steers in Lot 3 relatively low. Reference to Figure 1 also shows that the steers in Lot 3 failed to gain satisfactorily during the last part of Phase 1, probably because the grass had become short and dry. It seems probable in the light of results from the later trials that had this slump in gains not occurred, the steers in Lot 3 should have approximately equalled the steers in the other two lots in average gain I per day for the entire trial. There was very little difference in the amount of corn required per unit of gain by the steers,in the different lots. Because of the fact that ho alfalfa hay was fed to the steers in Lots 2 and 3 during Phase 1, the average daily alfalfa hay consumption of the steers in these two lots and the amount of alfalfa hay; required per unit of gain made by them was much less than for the steers in Lot 1. . ! . On a replacement basis, comparing Lots 1 and 2, one month's alfalfa pasture for one steer plus about six pounds of corn replaced 251 pounds of alfalfa hay. In this trial each acre of alfalfa supplied 280 steer days of pasture. Each acre of alfalfa plus approximately 1.0 bushel of corn thus replaced 1.17 tons of alfalfa hay in the production of gains in this trial. As pointed out, the pasture season was unusually short in this trial because of drouth'. Comparing Lots 1 and 3, one month's native-grass pasture for one steer plus 37 pounds of corn replaced 242 pounds of alfalfa hay in the production of gains. Comparing Lots 2 and 3, one month's alfalfa pasture was equal to 27 steer days of native-grass pasture plus 35 pounds of alfalfa hay and 27 pounds of corn. The three lots of catde sold in Omaha at the same price, $8.25 per hundred. The steers in Lot 3 were fed for 28 days longer than the steers in the other^ two lots. They were apparently somewhat better finished than the other lots as they dressed 613 per cent and graded U.S.'Prime. The steers in Lots 1 and 2 dressed 61.0 per cent with 40 per cent of the carcasses grading U.S. Prime and the remainder grading U. S. Choice, SECOND TRIAL This trial was begun May 5, 1936 and closed November 3, 1936. It thus covered a period of 182 days. This trial differed from the first in that ground corn was fed in place of shelled corn, and that two lots of </seg>
         <seg id="p008">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 315 steers were fed on alfalfa pasture. One of these (Lot 2) was fed for 112 days and the other (Lot 2-A) for 140 days on alfalfa pasture. Lot 3 was fed on native-grass pasture for 84 days. The three pasture-fed-lots were Uien finished in dry lot on ground corn and alfalfa hay. Lot 1 was full - fed ground corn and alfalfa hay in dry lot for the entire feeding period. 1 he total feeding period was the same for all lots. Tables 4, 5, and 6 present certain data from Phases 1 and 2, and from the entire trial, and Figure 2 shows the average live weight of the steers in the four lots at periods throughout the trial. It will be noted that the length of Phase 1 is different for the different lots. |loo .*-PHASEI.UJTa.-| J I £. - PHASE I, LOT 2A.

It differed from the other two in certain particulars although the general plan was the same. Because of the high price of com in 1937, the steers were started on a mixture of equal parts of ground rye, dried beet pulp, and cane molasses to which was added cottonseed meal at the rate of 1.0 pound for each steerj daily.

All lots full-fed concentrates and alfalfa hay in dry lot in Phase 2. . : j - required somewhat less concentntes and much less alfalfa hay per unit of gain than the steers in Lot 1. Comparing Lots 1 and 2, one month's alfalfa pasture for one steer consumed by the steers in Lot 2 took the place of 297 pounds of alfalfa hay and 84 pounds of concentrates in'the produc - tion of gains. Each acre of alfafa supplied;32o steer days of pasture in this trial and had a replacement value of 898 pounds of concentrates and 1.58 tons of alfalfa hay. Comparing Lots 2 and 3, one month's alfalfa pasture replaced! one month's native-grass pasture for one steer, 48 pounds of alfalfa hay, and 50 pounds of concentrates. Comparing Lots 1 and 3, one month's native-grass pasture consumed byjthe steers in Lot 3 was equal to 33 pounds of concentrates and 239 pounds of alflflfa hay. At the conclusion of the trial the three lots of steers sold together at Omaha at $16.50 per hundred pounds, which was the top for the day. The buyers refused to make any difference in the price of the three lots but in the opinion of the author, the steers in Lot 2 were inferior, to the steers in the other two lots. This was probably due to the failure of the steers in Lot 2 to consume the concentrate!mixture fed in Phase 1 as well as the steers in the other two lots. They made satisfactory gains, but apparently ate less concentrates and more alfalfa pasture than had steers fed on alfalfa pasture in former trials. As a consequence, they tended_to grow 1 rather than to fatten in Phase 1. As fat as could be determined, the steers in Lot 3 were fully the.equal of the steers in Lot 1 when sold. The three lots of steers) were shipped to New York for slaughter and slaughter data were not available. </seg>
         <seg id="p014">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 315 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS Although the three trials differed somewhat in detail and there were some variations in the relative performance of different lots from year to year, the following general conclusions seem reasonable. With a single exception, the amount of corn or other concentrates con - sumed by the steers fed on pasture in Phase 1 was greater than the amount eaten by the steers fed in dry lot. It is believed that this exception was due to the ration fed in 1937. The steers fed on alfalfa pasture in Phase 1 consumed a greater amount of concentrates per head daily than the steers fed on native-grass pasture in only one trial. wj bs^lH^^i^l^nkUM^hdl Htifl Ho. 4.—Alfalfa-pasture lot, sccontl trial, just before they were shipped in November. Because of their longer period on pasture, the steers fed on alfalfa pasture ate less alfalfa hay than the steers fed on native grass, and in turn the steers fed on native grass ate less alfalfa hay than the steers fed only in dry lot. With one exception, the steers fed on pasture in Phase 1 equalled or surpassed the steers fed in dry lot in the rate of gain. The steers fed on alfalfa pasture made slightly more rapid gains than the steers fed on native grass. In economy of gains as measured by the amount of concentrates con - sumed per unit of gain, the steers fed on alfalfa pasture in Phase 1 excelled the other steers except in the first trial when the concentrate requirement per unit of gain was approximately equal to that of the dry-lot steers. The steers fed on native grass pasture in Phase 1 consumed somewhat more concentrates per unit of gain than the steers fed on alfalfa pasture. They also required more concentrates per unit of gain than the dry-lot steers in 1934, approximately the same in 1936, and less in 1937. It is believed that this variation was due in part to the differences in the proportion of the entire feeding period in which the pasture-fed steers were kept on pasture. Apparently the greater the proportion of the entire feeding period </seg>
         <seg id="p015">Alfalfa and Native-grass Pasture in Finishing Cattle spent on pasture, the more-economical the gains from the standpoint of concentrate requirements. Attention should also be called to two varia - tions in the feeding and management of the steers fed on native-grass pasture in the third trial when compared with the other two trials. Dufr ing the last month of the pasture period, these steers were fed a limited amount of alfalfa hay. It is believed that with native grass in south - western Nebraska this will usually be good practice. The steers may be left on pasture for a longer period, they will be assured of an adequate .-. : supply of palatable roughage, and the change;from the pasture to dry-lot conditions will not be so abrupt. In the third trial, cottonseed meal was , also fed. Although the feeding of a protein supplement may. not be of any advantage during the early months of the grazing period, it is prob - able that it is well worth while after the grass begins to become dry. Fio. s.—Native-grass-pasture lot, second trial, just [before they were shipped in November.." • Because of the small amount of alfalfa hay fed the steers in Lots 2 and 3, the steers fed on pasture in Phase 1 made more economical gains as far as hay was concerned than the steers in Lot 1 fed in dry lot for the entire feeding period.. The steers fed on alfalfa pasture in Phase 1 required less alfalfa hay per unit of gain than the steers fed on native-grass pasture. As a-straight average of the three years' 'work, one month's alfalfa pasture for one steer had a'replacement value of 263 pounds of alfalfa hay and 41 pounds of concentrates. On this basis, each acre of the alfalfa pasture used was equal in value to approximately 1.5 tons of alfalfa hay and 425 pounds of concentrates. ' }'. In the same way, one month's native-grass' pasture for one steer was equal to approximately 240 jpounds of alfalfa j hay. One month's alfalfa pasture for one steer had a replacement value |of 27steer days of native - grass pasture plus 46 pounds' of alfalfa hay and 42 pounds of concentrates. There were no consistent: market differences between the different lots of steers during the three years, as far as could be determined from the </seg>
         <seg id="p016">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 315 price at which the steers sold or from such slaughter data as were secured. The length of time in dry lot necessary for properly finishing steers fed on alfalfa pasture was not determined. No direct attempt was made to answer this question except in the second trial. From this one trial, it appears that a dry-lot finishing period of six or eight weeks is sufficient to make steers handled as these were on alfalfa pasture acceptable market catde. No cases of bloat occurred among the steers fed on alfalfa pasture. It should be pointed out that the steers were consuming considerable grain when placed on alfalfa pasture and that salt and water were readily access - ible at all times. When judged by the rapidity and economy of gain, and by, the market desirability of the cattle produced, the practice of full-feeding yearling steers of good quality on alfalfa or native grass pasture and finishing them in dry lot compared favorably with dry-lot feeding for the entire period.
