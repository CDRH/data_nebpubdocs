            <seg id="p011">12 PRESIDENT S ANNUAL ADDRESS. President Mellor delivered his annual address as follows ntlemen of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture: Another year, with its successes and failures, has passed into history since we last assembled here. From the standpoint of the agriculturist it has become a period of unqualified success and abundance. An all-wise Providence has smiled upon the toiler in the field, and the returns from his labors have yielded an hundred fold. No like period of the agriculturist in Nebraska has been crowned by greater financial success. The granaries of the state are full to bursting with dollar wheat, and our corn cribs are bulging with the "ninety-two" varieties which no other state in I ii ion can show. Ei Lincoln we have seen the greatest fair in the year 1904 ever in the state of Nebraska; greatest from the point of number and ex tee of exhibits; greatest from the number of first-class attractions clean vai mbrance of which causes no blush of shame le on the &gt;ur excuse from the tongue; the greatest in the ter of paid admissions at the gate, and last but not least, the greatest us in our exchequer ever reported at a winter meeting of the uka State Board of Agriculture. [Applause.] &gt;nsider and contemplate these facts confronting us to-day mbrance of the trepidation and fear with which a year ago ontemplated the holding of a state fair in competition with the great World's fair held in our sister state of Missouri, — for at that time no man here was brave enough to predict anything for the Nebraska state fair of 1904 but financial failure,— in view of these facts, we cannot fai to acknowledge the great success and amazing prosperity of the citizen ship of ihis wonderful agricultural state of Nebraska. Knot my purpose to dwell on the theoretical, but upon the prac - which present themselves before this meeting for con - on. l-l.A i 0BOUND6. As one of the first things to do I would urge that decisive steps be taken, without fur irately and artistically plat and lay ne grounds »ri future necessities, giving names to ever; inside the grounds, the said names to be conspicuously displayed a i-8 or intersections, so that all may become acquainted and have ac - e knowledge of location; and as soon as p ume steps be taken toward gravelling or paving the streets, so tli.a at our annua we shall not be handicapped with mud during rainy periods. We nave made a modest start towards cement sidewalks, which we hope to have continued until ' unds are amply supplied. tiATION. Early in the year I called upon the officers of the various railroads b carry passengers to Lincoln, to secure united action in placing </seg>
            <seg id="p012">13 state fair coupons of admission upon the excursion tickets sold during oar state fair. The Burlington has been the only railroad providing such tickets continuously since the permanent location of the fair. The Northwestern and Union Pacific railroads complied with the request, and have since informed me that the business done by them was very satisfactory. An effort should be made that all the railroad lines enter - ing the city join this year, as united action cannot fail to be mutually beneficial. FREE ADMISSION* During the past year an effort has been made along the line of cur - tailing the distribution of free passoo of admission, and with partial success, as the returns show a decrease in the number of free transporta - tions received at the gates of 4,042 less than at the fair of 1903. Free transportation Is a matter of serious consideration with every adminis - tration, and should be a subject for open discussion at this meeting. When the state fair was "peddled" about from one city to another, prior to the time of fixing our permanent home, it was considered necessary for the enterprising citizens of the successful city to contribute large t.tions in money and material to secure the location. Now that the is permanently located, why should not the welfare of this organ - on be subserved, and the loyalty of the citizens of Lincoln be con - tinued, not in the direction of donations of money, but by making it Ktter of honor and pride to purchase tickets for the entire fair, and Bist with all their individual ability to make it unpopular for any citizen of Lincoln to secure admission by pass. The location of the state fair brings to the business interests of Lincoln an amount estimated at more than three hundred thousands of dollars each year, and whenever a surplus is secured to this State Board of Agriculture, it is practically all ex - pended for Improvements on the fair grounds; the Lincoln business man furnishes the material and the Lincoln artisan provides the labor and spends his money in Lincoln. Public opinion is a great factor in any reform, and I would urge upon the business men of Lincoln the neees sity of united and intelligent action upon this pass problem. SUPEBINTKNDENT OF CONCESSIONS, ETC. A year ago it was deemed expedient by this Board to create a new office, that of Superintendent of Concessions, Grounds and Advertising, and the benefits resulting to this organization show the wisdom of such a move. The concessions this year were handled in a most satisfactory manner with increased receipts; and the attractions presented to the public were clean and wholesome, and Tor the first time since the speaker has been connected with this Board there was no clash or petty annoyance resulting from the assignment of ground space. I think this condition shows the wisdom of the creation and warrants the continuance of the </seg>
            <seg id="p013">We realize that the needs along the line of Improvements on our fair Minds are many, and the same must be provided as quickly aa possible. which we consider the most pressing, have been outlined by the &gt; of ttils Board at a recent meeting, as follows: Amphitheater 4,000 00 Poultry building . . 3,000 00 Administration bulldinr 4,000 00 Sidewalks and sewerage 1,000 00 Total $37,000 00 Of this amount it was State Board of Agriculture mid be able to furnish $12,000 and that we ask the Legislature for an the permanent location of the grounds, the live stock depart i received more attention and improvement than all other i of the fair combined; still, we realize that a stock judging greatly needed and should be built at the earliest possible attraction which is viewed by more people than any other on unds is the fine fish exhibit shown annually by the Nebraska Fish Commission, the present quarters for which are entirely to make the display, and illustrates the importance of that SPECIAL ATTR.V Bcial attractions in the speed department are to be continued, at least double our grand stand capacity, as it is absolutely im - to accommodate the crowds on special days with our present arrangement.

All agriculturists of Nebraska feel an especial pride upon the res I to our citizenship at the Universal exposition of 1904 held m ■ii is.

Excluding these items, the total net earnings Eird for 1904 were $38 $14,087.46, and $18,441.20 for 65; leaving a balance on hand $15,617.40 on hand. Deduct from this, paid for other expenditures; total paid to date, $6,429.51 for 1904.

It goes without saying, the state fair for the year 1904, in i was without precedent, and exemplified, most thoroughly, its sion as an object lesson school of the highest grade, and thu duringly impressing itself on the minds of the whole people. I exception could be tolerated, it would be In favor of the magnificence of Agricultural Hall. Whatever may, and ju of other factors of the farm — live sto&gt; : hey cannot exi Lhe direct product of the soil. Hence, its incalculable imi value to the wealth and success of any region. Nebraska ho continue to hold, a commanding position in the world's &lt; wealths from an agricultural standpoint. </seg>
            <seg id="p019">Some sort of state legislation should be had to stimulate our count agricultural societies. The old law that gave positively and definitely certain sum to aid these societies in holding fairs, it will be rememberet was repealed, or rather amended, leaving the whole matter optional with county commissioners whether county societies should have anything or notMng. This had a bad effect. Many of the best societies hav been driven out of existence. Others are eking out a precarious exis ence. This is not right — not justice to the men and women who spen weeks and months getting up and installing exhibits for the so benefit of every citizen in the county. Such failure to recognize the valu of agriculture in Nebraska should not longer remain on our statute book The counties that hold fairs should be encouraged and such inducemen held out that will cause every county in the state to hold fairs annuall cbop &lt; - fob 1904. hout here attempting minute details which cannot be presented \m date, suffice it to say, all things considered, averaging the state, fanning interests were never more satisfactory than for the season of 1904. The early season, true, was not, in some respects, as propitious as desired. The acreage of the staple crop, corn, was, in many instances, late being put in; some fields, in fact, abandoned. The total acreage vated, however, was much larger than usual. It was feared the late planting would be caught by the ordinarily early frosts. The ripening period was, beyond precedent, favorable, and thus, substantially, the whole crop was cribbed in excellent condition. There was never a year in oar history when the corn crop was so abundant, with such gratifying prices. The most reliable estimates obtainable, of the corn crop in Ne - braska for the year 1904, place the grand aggregate yield at 212,430,603 bushels. The average yield per acre, 1904, 34.23 bushels. The corn acreage increase was, as is 6,174,040 acres for 1904 to 5,964,048 for 1903. Fall wheat. Less acres were planted for 1904 than for 1903. The acreage estimated for 1904 is 2,096,011. Total bushels, 70,110,214. Acreage yield, 31.11 bushels. Irrigation, always of importance and value to our western lands, has, of late, received a new and more vigorous impetus than ever before, and brought into more use, under the new and advanced system, many thou - sand acres most valuable lands. Eradoxical as it may seem to some, there are thousands of acres, st soil we have in Nebraska, the bottom lands bordering on streams, less without subduing, vast areas being ditched under modern, nd more improved processes, and at comparatively trifling expense, ius utilized and brought under cultivation. .NEBRASKA AHKII I I.1URAI. EXPERIMENT STATION Outside the state, at expositions where our products were shown in the year past, we have more than sustained ourselves. </seg>
            <seg id="p020">21 I would be recreant in duty did I fail in this connection, and on this occasion, to renew attention to the valuable service and standing of the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, in whose shadow we a moment stand. At the National Live Stock Exposition at Chicago last month, where was awarded the grand first prize to Challenger 1st, in 1903, under the care of that same expert purveyor and caterer to bovine appetites and needs, Professor Smith, of the station, Challenger 2d took second pre - mium, and only by a scratch failed to secure the first. Really, under all conditions. Challenger 2d, in 1904, won higher honors, or rather his feeder did, than did Challenger 1st in 1903. He was beaten by a thoroughbred animal, and took first as a grade in his line. The contest in 1904 waa much sharper, and with a much greater number of contestants, than tor the previous year. SEED CORN. The free seed corn railroad trains by the Burlington System in braska the past month is a grand, good move in the right direction for Nebraska farmers. It is an object lesson school on wheels. The n alone of the enterprise calls quite as loud for attention to the obj&lt; view as do the sample ears and short, but impressive, lectures. Millions of bushels of corn are lost in this state annually by the use of poor seed corn. It costs just as much time, labor and money to cultivate a half stand as It does a full one. It is authentically reported that Iowa near doubled her corn crop last year by the use of properly selected, cured and cared-for seed. Every - thing in this progressive day tends to maximum results with minimum labor and expense. The University of Illinois will, this winter, ask the legislature of that state for one million dollars, for her agricultural schools alone. This for higher grades of work along that line. By the more advanced system and use of best seed that Btate quadrupled her corn crop in what is known as her "bad lands." Nebraska's wi \T st. louis exposition Through the favor of Secretary Shedd, of the Nebraska Commission at St Louis Exposition, I am enabled to give the official winnings o* Nebraska. In transmitting, Secretary Shedd says: The Nebraska Commission of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition takes pleasure in sending you a complete list of the awards to Nebraska ex - hibitors in the various departments in which entries were made. In all departments the state was wonderfully successful, carrying off hun - dreds of prizes, and taking first rank among the states exhibiting a Exposition. </seg>

Hamilton, of the Agricultural Department at Washington, and all reputed laborer in this field, addressing the agri al students of the Nebraska Experimental farm last winter, pre - his address with these words: "Some weeks ago I received an &gt;n to address an association of agricultural students of your imi - and supposed that it consisted of a class of a dozen, or perhaps agricultural students in attendance at the college. You can t my astonishment to find a hall filled with 400 young men, 200 members of the agricultural class of your university." This the source it does, is a marked compliment to the it may not be expected to go outside our own state in lal report, I do so because agriculture is as general and as the air we breathe. This, too, to show that more than keeping up in the procession as to increased is and work in agriculture. Sharing, as I do, in the of those who are elated over the advanced and more re - us and increased promise of agriculture, I quote briefly President Roosevelt and the official report of Agriculture Wilson. </seg>

            <seg id="p024">25 The president says to the present congress: I Department of Agriculture has grown into an educational ia - i with a faculty o: -pecialists making research into all of production. The congress appropriates, directly and in - $6,000,000 annually to carry on this work. It reaches every ii territory in the Union, and the islands of the sea lately come ur flag. Co-operation is had with the state experiment sta h many other institutions and individuals. The world is carefully 1 for new varieties of grain, fruits, grasses, vegetables, trees and suitable to various localities in our country, and marked benefit producers has resulted." "The activities of our age in lines of research have reached the tillers of the soil, and inspired them with ambition to know more of the prin - ciples that govern the forces of nature with which they have to deal. Nearly half of the people of this country devote their energies to growing things from the soil. Until a recent date, little has been done to prepare these millions for their lifework. In most lines of human activity, col - lege-trained men are the leaders. The farmer had no opportunity for special training until congress made provisions for it forty years ago. DurHtg these years, progress has been made and teachers have been pre - pared. Over 5,000 students are in attendance at our state agricultural colleges. The federal government expends i &gt; annually toward this education, and for research in Washington, and in the several states and territories. The Department of Agriculture has given facilities for post-graduate work to 500 young men during the last seven years, pre - paring them for advanced lines of work in the department, and in the state institutions."

With 8 crop the farmers could pay the national debt, and the interest thereon ear, and still have enough left to pay the expenses of the national for a large fraction of a year." "Hay and wheat are contending for the third place in point of value, for many years one, or the other, has held second place, or been n. It is expected that these crops, hay and wheat, will, to r, be worth, on the farm this year, nearly as much as the corn crop. Bnly more than one billion dollar now seems probable that potatoes and barley reached their highest tion in 1904; that the oats crop was never so large by 60,000,001) « principal crops that are valued annually by the department, or aJ houses, have an agregate farm value this year, which is writing apparently amounts to $3,583,339,609.

            <seg id="p026">27 more particularly in Nebraska, la most gratifying as showing the deter - mination to reach higher modes and standards. It is a matter of very great satisfaction and pr ose who have given thought and attention to the higher planes and intense processes of agriculture to witness the strides made of late, the results of our agri - cultural educational institutions. This, particularly, in the new west, that portion of the national domain situated between the western banks of the Missouri river and the eastern base of the Rocky mountains, oar own Nebraska. Not confined to the base of the mountains, but permeating all the smaller valleys thereinto, where an acre can be tilled is utilized with grandest maximum results. Kslieving as I do and always have that agriculture is the basis of all itries and advanced civilization, and that without the aid of highest tiflc processes, we know but little of its worth and importance, tally iK obtaining greatest yields from the soil and advantageously utilizing them. My lifework with this Board, and in this line, has been spent under intense efforts to obtain, for the farming interests of Nebraska, that higher order of advanced, progressive agriculture that will enabl followers to compete successfully in their calling — "Lift agriculture from the slough of chaos and contempt" to a higher plane of excellence and dignity that justly belongs to it; that they might live on a higher level of comfort and happiness; that they might "help the weary hand with a better trained mind," and to elevate this Board of Agriculture i work to a corresponding plane where its labors to this end might be bo recognized. This largely, in the exercise of what may, perhaps, be deemed an unfortunate pro bono publicu characteristic, without hope of fee or reward other than a consciousness that the state might be a moiety the better for my having lived and. labored in It The work has been to me pleasant because I loved it. The more so because of grand accomplish - ments for a common good. Along this line of thought, another and more able writer has said: "The agricultural colleges have made wonderful strides during recent years, and, with the experiment stations, are greatly extending the scien - tific knowledge of the young men who are preparing themselves for farm life and future usefulness. As the trained young men establish them - selves, and begin to apply their knowledge, we may expect to see the farm houses better cared for; the fertility of the soil better preserved stock better selected and fed; the yield of the farm increased by wise management of work. The experiment stations are becoming an im - portant element in the government co-operative w&gt; Eurther I might profitably enlarge. Let this suffice, with the u : "The demand for advanced, intelligent agricultural teachers was r so great in the history of the world." To this may be added: the never so near when non-progressive, unskilled tillers of illy informed custodians of agricultural interest*, will, inevi forever, be relegated. </seg>

REPORT OF BOARD OF MANAGERS. To the President and Members of Nebraska State Board of Agriculture: Upon entering upon the duties that are required of your Board of Man - agere it was with some doubt and anxiety as to the financial out - come of the past fair. On account of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition held at St. Louis the past season we had every reason to believe that it would cripple our attendance. But, thanks to the loyal people of Nebraska, did not let the big fair at St. Louis interfere with our fair, and it U with some pride that we are able to show so large a balance in our Treasury. The weather, barring the first day, was perfect, and the ex - hibits in all departments were larger than any previous year. And just one word to the exhibitors of live stock. I believe the breeders of tnta state are the most congenial and best natured lot of men that I have had the pleasure of meeting anywhere. If we are crowded for stalls or pens they are always willing to double up and discommode themselves so that no one will be shut out, and when they have to show in a tent or a the boiling sun they do it without grumbling, which goes a long way towards making everything pleasant both for themselves and the Board of Managers. And as long as this feeling exists it is a pleasant recreation to assist In this worthy enterprise. Iie permanent improvements that were put on the ground the pas are as follows: Three new cross-walks of cement at a cost o 16. Four new water closets. Casing up the inside of Art Hall am Ing same at a cost of $555.50. The iake, fountain, flowers and shrub - put in by the Horticultural Society adds much to beautifying ou ids and is a step in the right direction for us to follow. And-w to express to the Horticultural Society our appreciation for wha lave done and trust they will continue the good work. RECOMMENDATIONS. E Board recommends that we add a third and fourth premium in lium list on live stock on all animals one tear old and over on and B, and six months and over on Class C and D, and that all s be paid in full, cutting off the 20 per cent discount. We also recommend the building of a new Administration building at a cost of about $4,000. The building of a new poultry building at a cost of about $3,000. The enlarging of amphitheater at race track at a cost of about $4,000 N«w cross-walks and sewers at a cost of about $1,000. In the last items of walks and sewers special attention be given to carrying the water from cattle and swine barns so as to keep all ap - proaches to same dry and clean. We also recommend the allotment of space of ground north of swine barn No. 9, to be used as camping ground for swine exhibitors. </seg>

President Mellok: The attractions of agriculture come nearer im - parting actual satisfaction and true happiness to the human being, than any other vocation in life. This may be regarded by some of my hearers as a broad assertion; but to my mind satisfaction and happiness are primarily enjoyed through the combination of several conditions; the greatest of all conditions is good health, which is obtained to the most perfect degree by the outdoor life of the agriculturist. Interest and pleasure is derived daily by the farmer in noticing the development of animal and vegetable life with which he is constantly thrown in contact. Did you ever reflect upon the pleasure derived from the improvement in your horses and cattle; the development of the hogs; the growth of the crop; the budding, blossoming and maturing of the fruit upon tht - and tree; the exquisite beauty and fragrance of the flower; and in fact everything upon which your eye may rest shows forth buoyancy, hope and life. To this day the traveler who visits Italy wends his way to the farm of the poet Horace, who, when cloyed with the frivolities and pleas - ures of Rome, rode his horse to this land in quest of that quiet repose and nearness to Nature's God, so dear to the average human heart.

Chancellor E. Benjamin Andrews. ADDRESS OF WELCOME. Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: When I came to It ■Mimed to me — without wishing to impeach anyone and admitting tha good work had been done to that time; I dare say all people had don best they could — it seemed to me that the agricultural work of our versit y was not in keeping pace with the rest. I remember saying to on of our regents, "Why haven't you done more for the farm?" He sai&lt; the legislature had always refused to give the necessary money. I saw a legislator and said: "Why haven't you given the University a reason able amount of money?" He replied: "They haven't done anythii agriculture with what we did give them." I then turned to my colleagues in that department, saying, "Gentlemen, for the time being we must tak upon our shoulders the work of the Children of Israel; we must mak bricks without straw." Splendid men were already at work in that great department. They were loyal to the state. They declared it a great that they had so little to do with. They felt they had received nothi: what they deserved; "but," they said, "we will do the best we can. consequence, the next legislature saw great things accomplished, con - sidering what we had to work with, and was very liberal to our agricu tural work. I hope the present one will be as liberal. As they visit th farm and look about there they will see many fine buildings already com plated. They are not as capacious or costly as some at Ames, but the are as good as any agricultural buildings in the country built at so low a cost. I believe the legislature could well give us more than the las legislature did. They will see by investigation that the state loses noth ing by such investments, but always makes net gains in the experimental work the University is doing. Safe to say the University gives the state back $10 for every dollar it receives for this purpose. If I didn't believ this; if I didn't think the University a living asset instead of B thought the University was a narrow affair, existing without regard he great interests of the state, giving salaries to mere ornamental if I didn't believe the University put back into the state a great more than it took from the state.

I repeat, the University is not a liability on the state; it is a live aaset of the state. The money you put into it is an investment on &gt;u realize more and more with every passing year. It is not Bore improper, but in the highest degree patriotic for the taxpayers le body politic to insist upon liberality toward the University. It is not a losing but a profitable policy. I believe the great majority of people wish the state to be liberal in this great interest. Ladies and gentlemen, we welcome you to this hall and to all the parts and premises of this great ook about. If you find anything •hink wrong, let us know and we will try and amend it. With the state has given us we are trying to do the best we can. Our Bng is sometimes criticised. We catch it from two directions, from rst-class farmers and from the other sort. Here is a well read r. a kind of agricultural newspaper. Reading all the experiments we have carried on at the farm he ought to be very successful agricul- My and well informed, and he is so. If our teaching at institutes or on seed corn specials gives such a farmer nothing new, he is apt to say we are no good. But we don't pretend that the Uni- rything and the other people know nothing. We don't suppose that all the people who listen to us are in need of everything -ay. Of course we repeat some things that good farmers knew irs ago. But while there are. and we thank heaven for it. a siderable number, and we are glad to know It is increasing. Bp to date, who know their business, there are still a great mini vho don't, and when we speak to a great crowd we try to make our n such as will do the most good to the greatest number. There hose who haven't given much study to farming. They form the extremity of our difficulty, reproaching us with talking over their beads. They say we don't want German or Latin or classical terms; what we want is plain farmer language that all can understand. When you address a general crowd, talking only twenty-five minutes, you can't hit Bie conditions of all minds. You must aim at average conditions. ■k and standard intelligence of the audience you face. This ir effort. At the farm, in work, in our classes at the Uni - i all our varied teaching, we are trying to hit the largest number an. If there are any in my audience now who have borne down on ly, I beg them remember the story of the organist in a Dead- wood church some years ago. The rector of the church told me the story. ■ 1 high up over the organ was the legend, "Don't shoot the organist, he is doing the best he can." If we may regard the University as in some Ban organ and us instructors as a body the organist, we beg of you not loot the organist; he is doing the best he can. Maybe we shall sing and play better at the end of the oratorio, </seg>
            <seg id="p070">71 Thanking you for attending and again welcoming you to our pre- Im, our privileges and our hospitality, I gs President Meixob: When I was a boy, on my father's northern In - diana farm, down in the edge of the pasture stood a sturdy, rugged oak, lowering above its fellows; a hero of many storms, who- emed but id impart strength and additional grandeur. Its leafy, wide-spread i an branches furnished a desirable protection from the heat of the sun and a shelter from the storm. Its fruitage provided many a winter's supply. Such sturdy oaks are typified in men. One of such whom it has been my privilege to have known Intimately for the past twenty years, has kindly consented, in the enforced absence of Mr. Hervey, to respond to the ex - cellent address of welcome to which we have just listened. I take pleasure in introducing to you. Senator Wall, of Sherman county. RESPONSE TO ADDRESS OP WELCOME Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I am indeed glad to be here tonight, glad to receive the cordial and heartfelt welcome extended by the chancellor that I hardly know what to say in response to the friendly greeting to which we have just listened. I remember a story about a con - stable down in the state of Massachusetts; he was a little fellow and took a warrant to arrest a big fellow; when he sot down where the big fellow was the big fellow slapped him first on one side of the head and then on the other, and the constable said to him, "Do you know who you are hitting, sir? " "Yes," he said, "I am slapping Bill Parker." you aren't, you are slapping the commonwealth of Massachusetts." Now we wish to say to-night that we farmers think we are it. tha we are the commonwealth of the state of Nebraska; so when I am called upon before this splendid gathering, without a moment's notice, to r spond for an interest as magnificent and splendid as the farming inte ests of this great state. I certainly feel like shrinking from the task, realize, and we all realize, that the farming interest is by far the greates interests of Nebraska, that it outshadows and outweighs every othe consideration. Did you ever realize that we live in a state that in th few years we have been undertaking to develop it it has arisen to th importance which ours has? I was commissioned to act as a delegate the other day to a live stock convention in the city of Denver. Wl started there 1 gathered a few facts to use before that mighty gathering and I have them with me here to-night. One of the foremost fa ed is that the state of Nebraska is second as a corn producer. W not only have corn in the state of Nebraska, but we are fourth in th Union in producing wheat; we are fourth as oat producers; we are fourt as growers of cattle; we are fourth as swine owners, and 1 wish to sa here to-night that we farmers have come from the grandest corn flel&lt; in the world. I wish to say to this bodv of men and women that w have planted with our own hands.

            <seg id="p071">If you please, upon the four winds. As I was coining down here this gathering I came through the greatest feeding station for cattle the United States; I came past the greatest sugar factory and refinery there is in the world. Did you ever realize that in consequence of money that the farming community of this state has invested — you know what that means — you know that the lands of the state of ■La are assessable at one billion dollars. Did you ever realize that the amount of taxable land within our state? Did you ever that there are twenty-five billion acres of good arable land within e which has never yet been sullied by the plow. Have you ever realized that the farmer and the herder of this commonwealth are keeping upon those lands a herd of live stock worth more than one hundred million dollars? Money enough to buy the war fleets of the world; money enough to equip an empire. Did you ever realize as a result of this stock growing interest that there has been built within this state a stock mar - ket that is third, that ranks third among those Industries of the world? you ever realize that you, in the state of Nebraska, are the owners of more live stock than is owned in all Europe, Asia and Africa? Did you ever realize that of the twenty years the live stock market in the of South Omaha has been in existence it has handled seventy-three Klion head of live stock? Did you ever realize that in that market, ch is the result of your limitless energy and enterprise that they some - es handle 40,000 sheep in a single day? Did you ever realize that handle in that market (a very large portion of which comes from your pastures and fields) 15,000 head of cattle in a single day? Did you ever realize that the farm products of the state of Nebraska this year of our Lord represent an aggregate value which would equal $140 per head per capita for every man, woman and child in the state of Nebraska? Did you ever realize that there is upon deposit in the banks of the state of Nebraska more than flOO per capita for every soul in the commonwealth? I wish to say, Mr. President, that we have no reason to complain; I wish to say that the farmers of this commonwealth are not mlty howlers. We invite you to our rural homes, to our schools, to colleges filled to overflowing with Nebraska's sons and daughters. in the bright sunlight of American prosperity and possibilities, where freedom provides a free atmosphere and rides upon the of Annobin. This state, this commonwealth, is safe in the hands farmers; there is no grander protection than that furnished by dn rural homes that dot our prairies. There will be security for l when the barracks have been deserted, when the flag is gone, drum-beat shall fail to bring a response from the soldiery; this find protection in the arms of the men and women who have this mighty commonwealth from the west of desert wilderness. it the mecca of the nation of men? Our farmers have taken s, the white man's burden, no iron rule or kings, of serf and sweeper, the tale of common things — ye shall not enter, the roads ye shall not tread; made them with their living and marked them with their dead." </seg>

The comn on arrangements having faith in the truthfulness of this saying, and possibly foreseeing the necessity of soothing the "savage breast" of some representative of allied agriculture at this gathering, have provided meeting with some music, and the name of the organization renderin same is a guarantee of its merit. We shall now have the pleasure of listening to the glee club from the Agricultural Experimental Station. The glee club, after rendering an admirable selection, respond' two encores. President Mellor: The organization of the various bodies represented here is an outgrowth of a desire for more extended knowledge along each particular line or branch of agriculture. Such education can only be successfully obtained by constant and consistent research by those who devote their lives to this class of work with a purpose of imparting deductions for the general welfare of the public. As a class, we appreciate these great men and the great good done for agriculture by them; however, we are here demanding a closer view of these men and a closer understanding of their greatness. It has been our good foi to secure the services of one of this class of men for an exposition of the subject "Agriculture of To-day." I am reliably informed that our speaker for the main subject this evening is devoting his life to a practical dem - onstration along this line, and is a past master in the art of sci* agriculture. I now take pleasure !n introducing to you Prof. Samuel B. Green, of the Minnesota College of Agriculture, who will now address yon. Mr. Green spoke as follows: AGRICULTURE OF TO-DAY. Mr. Pretident, Ladies and Gentlemen: It is a positive pleasure to be at once so enthusiastically received. Two years ago I visited your ex - perimental station and I visited it again to-day; and I noted the im - provements; I noted the new building upon the campus, and it looks Just like this — as though you had been experimenting with agricultural educa - tion long enough and had made up your mind to it that it had come to stay and were endeavoring to get a house to put it in. Now I am wrongly put down for the title of my paper, I very m regret that I am put down for the subject of agricultural education, there wasn't time to make the change so I appear before you to mil talk upon a subject a little different from that upon your program. the first place I am partial to agricultural education, I took rse in 1875 and graduated in 1879, and after that spent eight or nil </seg>

Seventeen years ago the first of April, at the time I came bark to the University of Minnesota, we were in a pretty bad way, and 'hink agricultural education was pretty bad in Nebraska, but it could he worse than in Minnesota at that time: *-e didn't have go much as student in the whole agricultural department, not only that but the rimental station was looked upon with contempt, not only by the people generally but by the farmers themselves.

When we put it to them they knew a good thing and tha °d us wonderfully, well, the name as you are doing here. But why ate along agricultural lines? In the first place I think that can be answered by saying that agriculturists are creators of wealth, more so than any other class: not wholly so. but are almost. Without exception are a conservative and reliable class of citizens whom it is good to have in a state — men who appreciate good things and are rather slow o after the novelties. Then there is another phase to it, our cities and countries are practically in the control of the boys brought up on the farm, and it is to them that we must look to solve this problem of the But the social problems of the cities of Chicago, San Francisco Paul.

A great many ers disagreed with the court, but they actually decided that question way: but you know better, and. as your learned chancellor has told to-day, an education is an investment of the state; it is not a charity 1; we don't think that way at all; it is a duty the state owes every I believe that education should be differentiated: I believe that a boy whose father is a mechanic should be educated along that line; and a farmer's boy along that line. But you may say everybody is equal. Never - theless, even in America something of that sort would be the best for us. so many of you are educating your boys along agricultural lines. Aeri- al education in Europe is on a substantial basis, no one thinks a novelty. Here it is a novelty; a great many of us feel that it Is on an experimental basis, and we are feeling our way along a safe basis upon which we can stand; but in Europe they have passed that stage, and you find agricultural schools and colleges in pretty nearly every »rsity, and in Germany pretty nearly every university has its agri - lral course; then there are hundreds of high schools, and of the r grades there are very many; then there are special schools for teaching horseshoeing, dairying and the handling of building materials, </seg>

            <seg id="p076">connected with the arts and industries of agriculture. Agricultural edu - cation in this country began along in the latter part of the sixties. In every state in the Union was granted a certain amount of land scrip. funds from which were to be used for agricultural, mechanical or other lines. In many of the states this became the basis of the universities, and perhaps it was as good a use as could be made of it — in fact it was made a basis for agricultural colleges. Conditions at that time didn't seem to be ripe for the farmers to take hold of agricultural education. I think one cause for this may be found in the fact that we are working new soil, and the problems of older soil had not come to us. We had not upset the plans of Nature so much that we were troubled with insect pests and fungus diseases, and soil exhaustion. Those problems at that time were exceedingly small. Then another thing, the courses that were laid out in agriculture in the best schools, were laid out by those who had their training in classic lines, and they weren't adapted to farming, and that is also one of the reasons why agricultural education at its incep - tion didn't take hold; but the farm and education, agricultural educa - tion, have come together. We farmers, by the way, strange as it may seem, believe in education. Farmers always believe in education, but they don't believe in agricultural education; they said we don't want any book farming; the only way to learn fanning is on the farm, and the con sequence is that agricultural education made little or no progress for some time. But now they have come together, and in that connection I am reminded of a story. Little Emma says to her father, "Papa, whan were you born?" He says in Boston. "Where was mama born?' San Francisco." And, papa, where was I born?" "In Philadelphia," and she says, "Well, papa, it is strange that we three ever got together." Bo looking back when education seems so far away to the farmer, it sonmi a little strange to some of us that we have come together so accurately and heartily for the mutual upbuilding of both of us. Ee appropriations for the agricultural experiment stations and the 1 appropriations for the agricultural colleges I have sometimes ht mark the most important events in modern agriculture. Sonie- I have seen a statue that represented Cheresking as waking up a thousand years to take her place among the mighty nations of rth. I think we can go back to that time and entitle that time when this case of granting to the colleges and stations the funds, and call the awakening of American agriculture. Iiny of you remember the kind of agricultural liters; i the founding of the agricultural experimental static 1 with good results throughout the country, and we had in them, but to-day we would turn it down, iltural literature is a wonder; it is full of meat and hing I doubt if the originators of that bill had any &lt; literature we stations and and the klni as to its possible outcome. Then the effect of that agricultural to make agriculture a teachable science. Then it gave an open! whole lot of young men to ge't into agricultural and experimental </seg>
            <seg id="p077">78 and to teaching, and those men in all of the states have united together to build up a system of instruction and a system of text-books, a collection of books and literature which is not to be excelled anywhere; and the progress is simply marvelous, if you will look back and see what has been done within those sixteen or seventeen years. An agricultural education, I think, should be divided into two classes. The first is that of the education of the farmers that are now in the field. Next, the education of the farmer's sons. It won't do to just educate the son and say to the farmer that he isn't in it at all, and so institutions like this university and ours in Minnesota and Iowa, in every progressive department, is offering opportunities for the farmer where he may come and get the education he needs; also farmers' institutes are being held; there are traveling teachers going over this country and fitting their in - formation into that of the farmer and giving him that which he most There is another class, in taking up tne education of the farmers, and I want to refer to the education in the common schools, it is with us in Minnesota. I don't know how it is here, but if it is not the same here, it will be soon. We are now talking about the consolidation of the rural schools. It is a grand thing. If we can only consolidate several of these so as to have several rooms and several teachers, where we can get spe - cialists and grade our scholars; in those schools there is going to be a little chance to add an agricultural education. I don't want you to think this is another fad I am going to put into the' public schools, not at all. We have in our public schools a sort of desultory education. I think that instead of studying about a spider or a worm or something of that sort, the children would be toned up a good deal if we were to talk something about agriculture. Instead of studying about the spider, why not study the potato-bug, the chinch-bug and the moth; it would help to direct the boys' mind into a useful channel. A few years ago I went into a school and there was there a picture of the San Jose scale; that was the way they were reaching the pupils, and there is no beter way of reaching the old folks than through the children, the young people. Then, in our city schools, I think our city teachers would be glad of the chance of teaching something in the way of agriculture; I am quite well acquainted with quite a lot of teachers that do that, I know they like the interest which comes with those economic subjects, and for tochers to teach those subjects we have got to have teachers who under - stand it. There is no use giving the teacher a book, we must have some - thing in the way of agricultural science taught in our normal schools, and in our high schools. 1 don't mean to teach them there much on the breeds of cattle, but the general principles of agriculture, sufficiently so that they will be able to call the attention of the children to the great truths of it, and especially their economic bearing, so that they can think intelligently about the life they are surrounded with. There is another class of schools that I think should receive special attention, I think they are the most helpful of all classes of schools that </seg>
            <seg id="p078">79 cultural high schools. I think one of the original mistakes was in putting the standard too high, and too many of them got the idea that they bad to maintain the standard. There are comparatively few hoys in Nebraska that are going beyond the high school. We are going to have to look to the great universities to educate our leaders, and a good high school course is within the reach of almost every boy; and I believe, as a remit of a whole lot of experience, that the agricultural high school is the best fitted for our farming, and I wouldn't have these agricultural high schools have too high a standard. I would have that school with just high enough standard so that the boys from the district schools from the country could come into it; that is where they should go instead of to the busi - ness colleges; and when those district schools raise their standards — and they ought to do it, as soon as they can — then I would raise the standard of the agricultural high school where the majority of the farmers of the future will be educated. INow, I said the farmer boys were the leaders of the nation; I am per - tly consistent in this; the extraordinary boy will take care of himself, you educate him for agriculture, and if he is designed to be a great ryer, he will take care of himself anyway. I suppose yon will think of .niel Webster, who complained of his scythe, that It wasn't hang right, d finally his father, who was in the field with him, says, "Well, take It out and hang it yourself." Daniel hung it up in a tree and went home; he wasn't cut out especially for a farmer; he had a greater work to do than that on the farm. My idea of an agricultural education anyway, for that matter, is that it shall have lots in It about agriculture; lota about rural life. I would have a country boy, or any boy educated for the farm, have a knowledge of the possibilities of his surroundings. As he goes over his farm I would have him feel the possibilities of creating bow forms of life in corn, in small grains, and especially swine and cattle and other of our domestic animals. I would have him know that all this Is plastic and can be moulded by the hand of him who knows how to do it. When he is so in touch with his surroundings as that he will be able to get enjoyment out of the country — and your farmer has got to get en - joyment out of the country — he isn't going to be a. man that most run to the city for his pleasure, he isn't liable to do us very much good if be does. When I say educated towards the farm I don't mean that in a small way, I mean it in a big way. There is nothing too good for us who are farmers. On the other hand, we want so much technical knowledge of our subject so that we can be successful. I think Lord Chesterfield said that "a gentleman should know everything about something and some - thing about everything." My idea of a farmer is that ne should koov every thing about farming and should have a good practical training that. would make him a good citizen. Oftentimes, if a boy is too long away from the farm, he will lose his industrious habits. My idea of this agri - cultural school is that he should be educated six months in a year at a time when a boy can be spared best from the farm, that is, in the winter. </seg>
            <seg id="p079"/>
            <seg id="p080">was one who opposed that in our high school, I thought it would make a whole lot of discipline, but we hare a whole lot of less trouble and the boys are a good deal better for it. Would you think it right to bring up the boys and girls of a family and separate them? Don't they have a batter appreciation of things to be brought up together? The thing to do is to educate them together. In our Mining-hall, and we have one that seats 600, we have about 575 enrolled, and in our other courses it will ran up about 800, but we have steady about 475, and we don't put .he girls off there at a table by themselves with a Lady Superior to look after them, bat we mix them up just where they belong, with the boys. Now as to what to teach the girls. Most of the studies take the girls just as well as the boys — botany, bookkeeping, horticulture, general agri- culture, and occasionally we have a girl that wants to take stock raisin's Just as well; we have girls who came there that Just wanted stock-raising subjects and nothing else, but in place of those subjects we give them sewing, cooking, how to avoid tawdry cheap colors in the home, and perhaps in place of the cheaper chromos, the etchings of the better artists; household art; how to cook a meal economically; lots of things about dressmaking and sewing and such things that are helpful to the farmer, and the importance of having a helpmeet that can appreciate his point of ▼lew; if he has got to get his pleasures out of the country, his wife should, too. Now as to agricultural colleges. Colleges are going to be for the few, but there are going to be great openings for those who graduate front the agricultural colleges; I think there are not a sufficient number of students in them to supply the demand that is sure to come for teachers of agriculture within a short time; there is always quite a demand for those who have had theory training, and it is going to increase, to become editors of papers; and then again, any young man that can get a college course certainly ought to get it. If I was a young man of means and had a farm, I would get a college course if I could; but I am speaking of the nunntn When I speak about a special high school education, a great deal of agricultural instruction given in the agricultural colleges during the last fifteen years has been given to those promoted from the ranks through the high grades of the colleges. You remember when the war broke out it called lots of lawyers, generals, and statesmen, but the kwas fought out and won by graduates of West Point. That time has by when there is much room in this land of agricultural education for i to have promotion from the ranks; those who are going to take i places as teachers, editors, and so forth must be technically educated, e is no time for agricultural schools which operate the full year, there ry little time for it; I think there is no time for them here in these western, states. I believe this agricultural education is as good traini as a boy can have, who is going into a general business, but don't kn what he wants to do, especially if he is going into a new country, he going into a store and later turns his mind to agricultural pursuits, meets farmers and is able to converse with them in a helpful way. </seg>
            <seg id="p081">he is going to be a lawyer, that agricultural training won't hurt him. I know of some of my friends at college that have become doctors, who have told me that the agricultural training and studying natural sciences has been most helpful to them, and that if they had to take preparatory work over again they would take it in an agricultural college. Agriculture makes men independent. It makes me feel good that I can get my living off of the land, but I think a man has a chance to be more honest if he has got an agricultural training, more so than the man who has not got it, for the simple reason that an agricultural education will make farmers content to stay in the country. I want to tell you a story. I.«st June I went to a town in Minnesota to Rive a lecture, it was a butter convention. The town was all decorated with yellow, they had yellow flags and streamers, and badges of the creamery having on them ■ paid our patrons $45,000 last year for butter-fat." They met us at station, and at the head of the procession was a Jersey oow, and on cow was a black silk flag and on it in gold letters these words raised the price of land in McCloud county to $100 an acre." Just think, the people were willing to give that cow the credit that belonged to her. Behind that cow were fifty little girls, all dressed in white, with yellow sashes about their waists and yellow bows on their shoes and blue sun - bonnets. Bach one carried a milk-pail and followed behind th;r n we got to the stand where the addresses were to be made those chil - dren came up and went through a little exercise illustrating scenes in Klife, driving the cows home, milking them, driving them into the making butter, and such incidents of the farm life. Didn't that show suitably than if they had gone to Paris and got some little frivolity and tried to work it out? IThe best men of all ages have enjoyed a study of agriculture. You t find that our brightest men of to-day are interested in agriculture. m inclined to think the time has come when a man can hardly be sidered well educated if he don't know something about agricultural mce. I never knew anyone to study it as a science who didn't become •rested in it. I don't need to cite to you Washington, WebBter, Jeffer - and a whole lot of others, because you know it is true of so many your best men and leaders in the business world to-day; they have tost without an exception come from the farm. Perhaps you will tell that President Roosevelt is an exception, that he was born in a city and icated at Harvard, but he could afford to take a course in broncho iting on the prairies of Dakota. I feel that I have talked long enough and it is time to close and I t to just leave it In this way, however: If anything I have said make you think that I have an idea that an agricultural education should not be broad, then construe -it just the other way. I stand here road culture and the greatest helpfulness in education and for excel- in and elevation of country life to its highest and best develop- I thank you. </seg>

The following proceedings were bad and done at the State Farm: Ileetlng called to order by President Mellor, who asked if there war* delegates present who had not yet presented their credentials. Hopping, of Furnas county, was the only delegate who responded to an. Secretary Furnas: We haven't the list or report of the committee here, and if there are any persons who are delegates from county socle- ties let them so announce their names at this time. C. E. Laverick, of Furnas county, was so announced. Roll-call by the Secretary showed a quorum present. Ee Committee on Credentials reported the following additional : Mr. Hopping, of Furnas county; Mr. O. E. Hefford, of Franklin Whereupon President Mellor announced that the Board was ready to proceed to busineas. The report of the Committee on Resolutions was called for. REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON RESOLUTIONS. To the President and Members of the State Board of Agriculture of t State of Nebraska — Gentlemen: We, your committee upon reaolu - i and recommendations beg leave to make our report upon the rec - lendation of our President, chairman of Board of Managers, and chair- man of the Auditing Committee. FIRST PLATTING Or GROUNDS. Efter diligent inquiry, we find that a plat is now made of the grounds, that this committee recommends that the Board of Managers have brought up to date. Also the naming of streets and putting up i be left with said Board of Managers, as they deem best. Tour committee further finds by close investigation that the recom - mendations of the President to build a stock pavilion at the oast of 116,000 is one of the urgent necessities, and we fuller believe that a $10,000 fish building is a necessity that at this time we cannot ignore, and therefore would recommend the two buildings. We learn that the legislative committee of this Board has already introduced a bill fi'fttfrg the appropriation of $25,000. Therefore, we would urge that every member present would urgently press upon their members of the legisla- ture the necessity of this appropriation, and use all honorable means for the passage of same. I Your committee further finds, upon the recommendation of the Board Managers, through their chairman, Mr. Rudge, that an administration lding to cost about $4,000, a poultry building at a cost of about $3,000, the enlargement of the amphitheatre at a cost of about $4,000, n cross-walks and sewers at a cost of about $1,000. In the last item </seg>
            <seg id="p085">86 cattle and swine barns, so as to keep all approaches to the same dry and clean. The cost of all above improvements to be paid for from the funds now in the treasury of the society. We would further recommend 1 , in addition to the above, that the expense or cost of any one of the buildings, be left entirely in the hands of a Board of Managers, v may think best. K, to the recommendation of the President for a toilet building for only, we would leave this in the hands of the Board of Managers ild, if they can see their way clear to do so. We believe this to e of the urgent necessities of our ground. Ke further find that the recommendation of the President as to ing a model speed barn, while there can be no question about the sity of the same and many other buildings, we find that there is no available at this time. I our committee finds upon the report of the chairman of the Auditing ■ that the Secretary's warrants should specify what they art) n for. If for premiums, they should state the number of entry and ; to which they pertain. If for general expenses, they should state what for. Your committee would recommend that the proper s be furnished the Secretary to carry out these instructions. All of which is respectfully submitted. I. W. Haws G. R. Williams M. B. Atkin 11 concluding his report for the Committee on Resolutions Mr. Haws, hairman of said committee, added: I might say that the reason for ng the building unlimited in amount of cost was because the gen -n who waite&amp;on us suggested that the cost might exceed a specified mt; if the amount was limited they would have to stop and draw plans again. Mb. Haws: I move the adoption of the report of the Committee on Resolutions. Seconded. Eon the motion being put Mr. Hendershot addressei the chair as s: If I understand the reading of the report, it included the diture of the funds on hand for the erection of this fish building, t right? Mb. Haws: No. sir. Mk. Bahskit: If I understood the President in his recommendation -anl to grounds, that it is not so much that we need a plat of the 'Is at present, but we need a plan whereby we might follow it in rection of buildings on the grounds an-.l we have nothing of that prepared. Personally, I am in favor of employing some one, a landscape gardener, or some one to take those grounds and plan out what they will be when finally completed, where the buildings shall stand, where the streets shall run, where the trees shall be planted, and when </seg>
            <seg id="p086">87 that is done and it shall have been presented to ar Board, then I am in favor of making it obligatory on the Boar Managers, when buildings are to be erected, that they be erected as the plan prescribes; but from the reading of that report I only understand that we follow the plan which has already been made in regard to the grounds, which merely gives the location of the present buildings, and streets and so forth. I don't think that is what our President contem - plated: therefore, I don't wish to adopt that report with that under - standing. I want a plan made of the grounds for the future; where the buildings shall stand, and where the trees shall be planted and where the streets shall run. And I don't want it in the power ol Board of Managers to alter these plans. I think that should be made like the laws we read about, because unless we do th- f when new members come in not conversant with what has bee* done they may go on and entirely destroy the unity of what has heem planned. T say this all due respect to the Board of Managers, because I hai nor of being a member of the Board, but I take it there is to he a plan we are to follow, and I am no landscape gardener, very few of us are, and I don't want to adopt this report without it carers that. 1Mb. WnxiAMs: The understanding of the committee, after making igent inquiry among the members that met last night they thought it s already platted as far as it went, but it didn't cover all of the iund. Now those streets are permanently located, but not the coming ldlngs that may be built in the future, of course, they are not located, : as to the streets and rows of trees they are already located as far the ground goes, and as one member of that committee I thought H s foolishness to destroy what had already been done; therefore, w» Jed that the Board of Managers have power to exfend and further plat ! ground as it was necessary; that was as far as we went after diligent juiry. ■ President Mixlor: Wouldn't it cover the matter if it was Just stated that report and report at the next annual meeting? Mr. Bassett: Wouldn't it be better if we were to employ a petent person to plat the ground and then approve the same? It might necessitate the changing of certain streets and it might mean that cer - tain buildings would have to be moved. We couldn't tell what the man would plan out; the present plan is merely a blue print of the gr&lt; as they are to-day, and don't contemplate what might be done in the future. JMr. Haws: We, in considering the matter, took the recommendations presented to us, and we acted on them in a way we thought covered ground. Now, if it was the intention of your recommendation to ploy a landscape gardener to lay out the grounds, I believe It should re stated so in your report, but that is the way we took it; it wa» our a to have that just as you wanted it. We believe this, it is a perma - lt thing; if there is going to be any tearing up and overhauling or changing to be done, we better do It now; that was the intention of the </seg>
            <seg id="p087">wanted it, and we thought we the committee and he saM as far as it goes, I think it gardener would preserve the trees growing there now, but Mr. Haws: That was our intention to make it Just as you wanted it. Mr Ewi n&lt;; : I would like to impress the fact that we had better make in preparing this ground permanently. It is the intention to make as near an ideal a ground as we can and I think s clear on that subject. There ought to be a competent per- to the thing for probably twenty-five years in the future, and (Zest as he also bms, that after a competent person has made : be left to the discretion of the Board at that time. If I to begin with the buildings before us not make a blunder now, that the future; let us even go to the expense i and have something definite to build upon. I suggestion la right, the Board of Managers is year and it might destroy the whole thing. There .g back of them more than just the change of the rs for one year. Let us make no blunder for the Morse: We all seem to think along the same line and that the reported just what we want. I move that the question be get a landscape gardener to fix it up all right. Seconded Hendebshot: Has there been a committee apointed to introduce Ions in the different associations now in session, regarding our &gt;ns for the state fair? It seems wise to have a committee on on tap to get the sense of the different asociations.

KPretident and Board of Managers Nebraska State Agricultural At the annual meeting of the Nebraska Historical Society held the undersigned were appointed as committee — with full power — to make such arrangement as shall be satisfactory with your society and the State Horticultural Society in order to secure co-operation and Joint action to obtain a permanent fire-proof home, centrally located, for the use of all three societies. Ky virtue of previous arrangements, for the past ten years the pub - ons of your society and the records and publications of the State icultural Society have been kept in the rooms of the State His - torical Society and distributed by its staff. For a number of these years there has been felt an urgent need by all three societies for safe, con - venient and permanent office quarters and store-rooms. We therefore make these propositions to your society: 1. That it join with us in asking from the present legislature an ap - propriation sufficient to erect a building — fire-proof — and large enough to care for the present pressing needs of the three societies. Said build - ing to be erected on satisfactory ground donated by the city of Lincoln, in lieu of the old Historical Society Block. 2. That the State Agricultural and State Horticultural Societies shall have ample office and store-rooms in such building for their own exclusive use and occupancy and joint use with our society of halls therein for public meetings. 3. That your society appoint a committee with full power to present the need for such a building before the state legislature and city of Lincoln; to plan for its construction and arrange details for division of office room Sbcbetabt Fubnab: I don't know how to make this matter any plainer than this communication. We have had no place to store oar archives, in fact none of the three societies — the Agricultural, Hortlcul tural and Historical Societies. These other societies are moving now for a place at the capitol where they can hold their meetings. I think a move in the right direction, and I hope this Board will accept the proposition and appoint a committee of three to act in conjunction the committees appointed by the other two societies. I therefore move that this society appoint a committee, of which I shall not be a member frn-ann*» I am a member of the Historical Society committee, to a conjunction with the members of the committees of the other societies Seconded, and remarks called for. </seg>
            <seg id="p089">FUh Haws: It seems to me that this is going to operate against us. ile I don't deny the justness of the demand, at the same time we realize that the heavier you load a wagon the more liable is it to break down. It is going to be a considerable task to get an appropriation, and if we go and tie ourselves up with other associations and ask for more, we are Jeopardizing our rights. I don't think it is wise at this Let us get our own matters arranged first and then we can help our neighbors. ISeckktakv Fuk.nas: I think there is nothing contemplated in this lmunication; this is to simply secure the good will of these associa - xs, and especially as the Historical Society has provided for us liberally the past. Mr. Haws: My understanding Is that they want our support to posh this bill through? Secretary Pukkah: Well, yes, they want our kindness and good will Mb. Mouse: I am in favor of the motion of the Secretary, for the reason that if we help them we will get the money and the other fellows won't; the legislature will give us the money and let the other fellows {iIk. Rudge: I have been feeling the pulse of the members of the slature, and especially the members of the senate, and as near as I figure it out the state senate is not going to make any appropria - s this year of any kind unless, they can do so after they have taken of all the public institutions. If there are any funds left to make appropriation with, now, in my judgment, the work will have to be — both in this bill and in our own bill — will have to be done generally in the senate, and the feeling of the senate is practically unanimous that are not in favor of putting up new buildings this year. I believe it will be a laborious task, both for the Historical Society and ours, to get any bills through the senate this year that will carry any appropriations for new buildings; in fact, they have said that after they have taken care of the public institutions around the state, if there is anything left we lo it, but we won't do it if we have to go into debt. I think that is the argument we will come up against repeatedly, and it is well taken. The only question with me is something such as the gentleman from Minden has spoken of, if we use our efforts in the way spoken of, if it would not work to some detriment to the bill we have introduced; I think if we just recommend it, I can't see as that is going to hurt our bill at all, but if we go there and use our personal efforts, it will in some way cripple the bill we have introdu. ili:. Sheldon, representing the State Historical Society, asked and was n leave to speak, as follows: So as to remove any misapprehensions ud of the members of your Board, let me say in the first place suggestions embodied in this resolution came, not from any of the ibers of our own society, but came from a member of the Horticultural ety.

Ton may adopt the plan presented or not, it makes not a great deal of ference to us, although we would rather have your good will. We am going to make a combined effort for a building for ourselves; we shall make it before this legislature, and if we fail, then we will make it before the next legislature. We shall keep on until we secure what we want. Now then, we shall be glad to have your good will and co - operation so far as you feel inclined to give it and for a feeling of interest on your part.

We 'on't ask you to make our fight for our building, but we expect to make it for ourselves Just as you will have to do for yourselves. Now just this word, first, so as to correct any misapprehension as to this being a plan or scheme to get you to carry our burdens. I want to say that we shall have to carry our own. And, second, as to the object of this resolution, the plan is to get that cordial co-operation so far as you &gt;M lit to give it. I thank you, gentlemen. KMb. Morse: I think that Mr. Rudge has been talking to the senators m Douglas county mostly. Now the Nebraska senate was elected by farmers, all excepting Douglas county, and the Nebraska farmer la always willing to go down and run a little bill, if he hasn't sold his steers, to shelter his cattle, and I think when these farmers go up then and say we won't pay this debt thi/year — we don't expect to, but those farmers in the senate, and the lawyer who is there also, got their votes from the farmers, and I think when we go there and tell them tha state of Nebraska demands it, that we are going to get it without much trouble. We all know that they can't pay the state debt this year and f[R. Williams: I live in Douglas county, but I am not a lawyer. &gt;times I think I am not more than half cracked, but Brother Morse assailed our county and I am obliged to stand up for it. The truth of the matter is that we are taxpayers, whether we live in Douglas Inty or whether we live in Furnas county. We are taxpayers and we re an eye upon the legislature; they are our servants, and when we. taxpayers, get together in these different societies ani form, what do i call it — an amalgamation, or some other word, to bring pressure m our servants to do what we will condemn the next time we go to polls to vote, I say it is not just; it is placing our servants In a I position at this time when we are more than two million dollars In it. I tell you when you go home and talk with your neighbors your tinual story is economy; why come down here to force open your te treasury; I say it is time for us, whether from Douglas or any er county, to be level-headed. 1Mb. Cook: The Historical Society and such other societies we shou take pride in as it grows older; it is not an absolute necessity bat </seg>

We are helping to educate the people up to a with the products of the soil that will pay the debt; all this they have got to have too. It is absolutely necessary to build on lation for the good of the centuries. All the senators Mr. Rudge has spoken of are level-headed fellows and they want to do the right &lt;. and when this is presented to them right we are the fellows that are going to get the consideration. Let us work right along that line and let us keep our hands off of any other appropriations as near as we hair.

He is employed here in our fniversity at the very small salary of $2,100.

He said: "If this matter were put in the hands of the state entomologist, it would be handled so that our farmers would ge rid of it. There is only one way and that is to institute a warfare again* the fly." I asked him what will that cost. He said: "Approximately &gt; a year to carry on this warfare." 1 said, "Will a $2,000-a-year salary to the state entomologist and his assistants be sufficient?" He said it would be the means of keeping in check all of the insect pests fo all time to come. I simply made an estimate of what we have already lost on this last crop, and we have simply lost, on his estimate. $5,000,000; that would employ Mr. Bruner and his assistants and successors years at $2,000 a year and here is the proposition, it is a test of the pie* onomy that the legislature means; it means money; it means re - trenchment. Resolution being put to a vote carried unanimously. Mr. Bassett: I desire to offer the following resoi ace it is important to have, and the statutes require, the subject of agriculture taught in the graded and rural schools of the state, anl this can only be accomplished by teachers who have had training in elementary agriculture and who are interested in the sub. ■ •■((. That we earnestly recommend that the board of educm f the state normal schools establish a department of elementary lture such as will prepare their graduates for the most eftV ig of this subject in the public schools; that the depar lture be placed in the hands of a man in each school thoroughly 1 in this subject and a man capable of adapting the work to of teachers of the rural and graded schools. Be recommend further that the board increase the amount in ' I te for equipment in agriculture for each school to at least Mb. Ba Ir. President, Please allow me to discuss, !•■ resolution which relates to the teaching of agricu rural and graded schools. For nearly thirty years many farmers in this stat have prayed that there might be a reasonable number of students in attendance at the agriculture college of the university, and for Ion years their prayers remained unanswered and in fact there never was a respectable attendance of such students until there was establish. ", a high-school course in agriculture, so arranged that a from the eighth grade in our rural schools could enter such agriculture high-sohool course; it might be mentioned, incidentallly, that the grea sa of the Iowa agricultural college is due to the istory of that college they established such a big -e. The true reason why there were so few students in our agricultural college was, that neither In our rural or high schools did we ha anything relating to agriculture, and it was the most reasonable thing in the world that children graduating from our I ing the state university, should i-ontinn - already pursued. </seg>
            <seg id="p095">in the vp«r 1901 at the reaueat of the members of the state board of the legislature of our state amended the law relating to qualifications of teachers, so as to require teachers to pass in addition to other studies, "A satisfactory examination in the elementary principles lture, including a fair knowledge of the structure and habits of plants, insects, birds and quadrupeds"; it was provided that the law should not take effect until one year from the next July; this, in order to give teachers an opportunity to qualify themselves in this respect teachers already engaged in teaching, did by reading and from to the subject delivered at teachers' institutes. When the amendment quoted became a law, the state superintendent of public instruction made inquiry as to text-books which could be used to teach the elementary principles of agriculture in our rural schools, and neither in this state, nor any other, could there be found a text- book which could be used for such purpose. I mention this to show that up to the time this law was enacted in Nebraska, that nowhere in any of the states had there been any general •Sort to teach the elementary principles of agriculture in the rural schools. At the request of Superintendent Fowler, Professors Bessey, Bruner and Sweezy, of our state university, prepared an elementary text-book, of the class I have mentioned, for use in our rural schools, and incidentally it might be mentioned, that the book has met with a steadily increasing demand; not long since the publishers wrote me that they had already received orders from more than one thousand school districts in this state, for copies of the book to be used in their schools; in addition to this a large number of orders have been received from other states; while four years ago there was no such text-book at this time there are numerous publications, by different time the most important matter in connection with the this subject in our schools, is the education of the teachers when this law, to which I have referred, first went into our state normal school placed "agriculture" in its course of b but no provision had been made for the employment of teachers especially prepared to teach this subject and so the teachers already em - ployed at the state normal school to teach other branches, taught this ; that tne teaching of this subject in our schools is of great it is desired that the board of education of our normal schools the teaching of agriculture in such school, a department, showing its importance and giving it the same prestige as is en other subjects in the course of studies; it is also desired that competent person be placed in charge of such department. has been especially fitted and trained to teach the subject, further desired that a sufficient sum be appropriated to est&amp;b- suitable laboratory for the use of the department. good fortune, while in attendance at the St. Louis exposi- </seg>

On the roll-call of slates each delegate was requested to give a brief statement of the In stitute work in hit, state, the number of institutes held, amount o money expended, workers employed, etc., and lastly any new feature bearing upon improvement in agriculture, and almost without excep - tion, each speaker mentioned that in his state or province, an effort was being made to teach the elementary principles of agriculture in the rural schools and that it was bound to be of great benefit to the cause of agriculture. Secretary of Agriculture, Hon. James Wilson, in his last annual report, speaks at length of the subject; in fact he is one of its most ardent supporters and has organized a department, devoted to farmers' institutes and the teaching of agriculture in the rural schools and has placed in charge of the same Professor Hamilton, who devotes his whole time in co-operation with people in the various states en ptjnil in work of this nature; also President Roosevelt, in his last message, calls attention to the importance of the work. I mention these things to show how wide-spread is this new feature in education and the hearty endorsement which it is receiving at the hands of those fully qualified to judge of its importance and usefulness. In this connection permit me to say, that our own Dr. Bessey neve had a more happy inspiration than when he worded the amendment to which I have referred, and which is now a part of our laws relating to schools. Let me repeat it, "A satisfactory examination in the elementary principles of agriculture, including a fair knowledge of the structure and habits of the common plants, insects, birds and quadrupeds, there anything covered by these words, that every teacher ought not to know something about and be able to teach? Is it not important and necessary that our children be taught something about the common plants — corn, wheat, grains, grasses and vegetables, upon which they must all their lives depend for food and support? Should they not be taught the habits of the common insects, some of which are useful and many of which are annoying and destructive? Can they be taught too much about the common birds, including the "helpful hen" or the common quadrupeds, including the motherly cow who has been a "we nurse" to untold millions of the human race? It was, I repeat, a happy inspiration, for it is always necessary, always useful, always importan to know as much as possible about the common every day things, plants and animals, with which we have constantly to do. Mr. Bassett's resolution, upon being put to a vote, carried unanimously. Mr. Rcdoe: I ask leave to return to the Historical Society motion. I believe if that was put in a little different language this Board would perhaps endorse it. I feel it will do us no harm to give them our beat wishes and to recommend it as far as we can.

Seconded. Slckltaky Fuknas: I never was more surprised than when this ques - tion was presented and met with opposition. I think Mr. Rudge's motion is a little better and would be satisfactory to the Historical Society. The rical Society has taken care of this Board for years, and now, when it is seeking to go before the legislature as they are now and simply ask for an appropriation to put up a permanent building for these two socle - ties, it seems to me it would be the simplest thing in the world to do what they ask of us. I repeat that the Historical Society has been given room by the regents for years, and they have looked after this society years, and it is their purpose to further look after this society In re years, and we can endorse this matter by simply adopting this resolution I think Mr. Rudge's resolution will soften it down and urge it more practically than Mr. Schappell's. Mr. Cook: The ground I took on this matter awhile ago was this We don't want to send out any of our strength chasing around after any - thing that will tire out these senators and representatives before they get at us, and I think Mr. Schappell's motion covers the ground that our friends asked for a little while ago, and if we give them our good will and sympathy, that is all we can give them.

There are 2,500 or 3,000 of these, and we had about 800 brought out here to be distributed to the members and delegates, and others, and if the members and delegates would leave their address with the Secretary and state about how many of those re - ports they can use, I think the Board should provide some means of boxing them up and sending them out. There is no doubt but lots of the members here have neighbors who would be pleased to receive &lt;■ these reports; these should be disposed of in some way. I think that as the state has not provided for the distribution of these reports Board should stand the expense or pay the freight on them, or le man to whom they are sent pay the freight.

We agriculturists were highly delighted when we that we were to be favored with the magnetism of his presence this lg. I do not desire to introduce, but to present to you ex-Governor Hoard, of Wisconsin, who will now address you. Address on the subject of "A Plea for a Wider, Closer, More Discriminat- ing Thought, Reading and Judgment on the part of the Dairy Farmer Concerning the Problems that Concern Him." Mr. Hoard spoke as follows: Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: It takes a pretty smart man to talk up to that introduction. It reminds me of a few yean ago I was giving a lecture in the Scotch town of Leisterwell, in the Province o Ontario: The chairman introduced me with so many kind encomium that I began to fear lest the advertising would be bigger than the show After getting to my feet, after thanking him for his very kindly intro - ductory, as I do now, I said there was one thing lacking at that momen to complete my happiness — I said I wished so much that my wife coul hear the chairman talk about five minutes; and then from an old gra head in the audience came a gleam of sympathy for me, and from th farther end of the audience in the broadest dialect came, "Aye, mon, I ke she knows you better." The topic I have chosen to talk to you upon to-night I have intended to make intensely practical; it is a plea for a wider, closer, more discrim - inating thought, reading and judgment on the part of the dairy farmer concerning the problems that concern him. I am not certain that it la coins to be in harmony with Nebraska, for a good many things that we believe in Wisconsin we find that you don't believe in Nebraska; preju - dices sometimes stand as a veil between our ideas and the situation; but after all, good friends, what we are after is the truth, the whole truth. and nothing but the truth, for the truth will care for itself.

She managed the hired men. laid out the farm work and looked after cattle, and attended to all the details, and never for a moment thought that she was forsaking the womanliness of her nature. She was not; she was In her proper sphere. If you see a manufacturer remarkably success - fnl in his business, you naturally inquire what was the cause that led to it. Did you ever know of an eminent manufacturer in his line who kept himself in ignorance of the management of his business; who kept his mind darkened like a sick-room; who dreaded the light? Did yon ever know of a successful lawyer who was ignorant of the law? Do such men suceed before the courts? Did you ever know a man who wan cessful as a mechanic who didn't make a hard study of his business who didn't understand the terms which are used In the Hteratur - his trade? Go where you will In every line of human effort, outside of farming, and It Is universally recognized that to be successful In It a man must be educated to It. This education should come in way or another, but come It must or he goes down. This thing we call education is nothing more than comprehension or understand There Is not a farmer In Nebraska to-day, who. If he thinks of making a lawyer of his son. will send him to school: he admits that his boy must have a mental training; must be educated to see and understand business. So it Is in medicine, theology, engineering, and everything In Yet, no farmer would dare to make himself so ridiculous as to sneer against book law, or oook medicine, or book engineering. Why is It that the farmer will recognize the value of a trained, intelligent mind in &lt; profession but his own? How do we get this mental training, this insight? By studying and reading what other men have found out aoout the facts. , Second, by studying them for ourselves. Both systems are absolutely necessary to intelligence and profit. I have visited, as I said, nearly every state in the Union and the provinces of Canada in an effort to determine why men succeed as dairy farmers and why they fail. It is not because of a lack of hard work; indeed, some of the hardest workers are the greatest failures, but I do find, without exception, that the succesafnl men are the students, and readers and thinkers, the intelligent ones, find that they spend money on their own enlightenment. I am goin bring up an individual example, one that has presented itself to me as a marked illustration of what I wish to say I know a man by the name of H. S. Griswold. of West Salem. Wls.

Mr. Griswold happens to be the sort of a farmer who is bigger than his farm; that is, he has educated himself to that size. He is a constant reader and student of what other men are doing. He makes good joints. I once knew an old cooper who had an apprentice. I said to him one day, "Uncle Tom, will Jimmy ever make a cooper?" "Lord, no." he said. "Why?" "Well." said the wise old man. "yon see he hain't got any idea about making jints " Mr. Griswold makes "jints." Consequently good results don't leak out between joints. He made a first-class joint in his calculations by selecting for his dairy machine a breed of cows that are bred to dairy work. He is not a "dual purpose" man. A railroad man once gave me a good illustration of the way thib "dual purpose" nonsense plays the mischief with men who are vainly trying to make a good profit with cows bred to no purpose. He said: "It rests Iderable money to run a passenger train to New York on a fast nle. We can make a profit if we carry good loads and make good We will never have a profitable load if we make slow time; so we have engines built for speed. Such engines will make the distance s lowest consumption of fuel consistent with the time we must make, old prove the biggest nonsense in the world for us to undertake to make a freight engine do such work. It is not constructed right. It hasn't the speed form. Everything in this world that has a purpose in life or a fitness to that purpose, has a form fitted to its purpose and the form is the outward indication of its purpose." Mr. Orlswold has sought all the light he can get. How is it with Nebraska dairy farmers? Are they seeking the light? Now, Mr. Gris- wold, with his cross revenue of $2,500 from twenty-five cows, or a net revenue of $60 apiece above the cost of feed, is one among scores of men who are doing nearly, if not quite as well, by letting the light shine into their minds. Why don't more farmers look at their business from the same standpoint? Speak to them about it and you will hear them aak: "Suppose everybody had such cows, what would butter be worth?" Did Kever hear the story of the old maid? She was found in a flood of srical tears one day. When questioned as to the cause, she replied: ms thinking if I got married and should have a baby, and it should I into the hot oven and burn to death. Oh! how I would feel. I am sure I shall never marry." Yes, suppose everybody had such cows. What KWell, it would require only one-third the number of cows to make ch butter and give as much milk as three-thirds do now. Take off irds of the expense and keep the product at the same figures, and then reckon what the increase in the net profit would be.

What do these fanners do with their surplus of land and their surplus of poor cows? To-day I heard the complaint go up repeatedly, "We can't get help in Nebraska." And everything at an uneconomic range in dairy work. My friends, you can profitably employ help when you have the farm in Nebraska in eco - nomic harmony with the purpose of dairy farming. The great tend' in modern dairy thought is to force us to get right down to an under - standing of dairy economy. We must let in all the light we can. That is Mr. Griswold's plan. His ambition is to see how much, in straight dairy work, he can make fifty acres earn. So he makes that little farm &gt;y a dairy of twenty-five grade Guernsey cows, and they earned h said, around $100 apiece in the production of cream alone last year, know of plenty of farmers with 300 acres of land and herds of fifty ■ows that did not do as well. Mr. Griswold invests, say, $3,000 in land — for land is not high about West Salem — and makes it earn more than some other men with six times more land and twice as many cows. Ther* must be some reason for this. And rationally all these propositions appeal to you and to me. What is it? Mr. Griswold uses four times as much dairy intelligence; he does four times as much dairy thinking; he read* four times as much on dairy subjects. Consequently he can do just as much business on six times less capital in land, one-half as many cows. Light is cheaper than darkness. But that is not all. The expense In hired help, in farm machinery, in fencing, in horses to do the wor the fret and worry of body and soul, in the risk against losses, in all these things and more, is a great deal less with the Griswold class of farmers. But Mr. Griswold made a different man of himself to start with. Now the men who don't believe in farming according to plenty of light, they have been growing smaller every year. Those are the men who have made the rich old Wisconsin farms grow poorer every year. They started from the Atlantic coast, and the pathway of the American farmer has been a pathway of destruction to fertility and from that on to the rugged mountains. Old New York farms that I remember once selling fifty years ago for $125 an acre, with an abundance of buildings — beautiful old farms they were — I can buv to-day for $30 and $40. Why? Because of the absolute paucity of brains in the men who have succeeded to the trust of fifty years ago. Those old farmers were a magnificent body of men. The yeomanry of New York never were exceeded in the his of the country in intelligence according to the light they had, yet New York has lost in thirty years fifteen hundred million of dollars in the decline of the value of her farm land.

Neither could the manu - re if thev run their factories on the same ideas that prevailed years ago. or the railroad men if they ran their railroads as it was twen ars ago. But many dairy farmers all over the nation ' as expensively as was done fifty years ago; no not a ray of light has shone into their minds, with no better cows.

So I spent $1,100 last year in tile drainage, and in building a horse barn that cost $1,300, that must come out of the following year's revenue. I could have done none of these things if I had refused to employ labor. I must not refuse that farm labor. In my printing business I keep fifty people on the pay-roll. I am looking all the time for a place where I can profitably employ another person. That is the only way I make my business earn more. So it is with the farm, crowd it up to its best economic work all you can. But you cannot make labor profitable with unwise management. There is where the use of modern methods, modern intelligence, modern thought, comes in. You can't afford to be ancient if you expect to earn the modern dollar. There is such a lot of men who seem to be as afraid of progressive ideas as they would be of smallpox. There are two kinds of conservatism — that which is born of fear and ignorance, and that which U born of knowledge and courage. The first dreads the light; the second asks for more light, better light. In the summer of 1901 occurred the worst drought in the west we have ever seen. Milk at the creameries shrank 30 to 50 per cent. A great pro - portion of farmers let the matter run without any effort to help it. They said it would not pay to buy feed. They had no summer silos and bu little in the way of soiling crops, for the drought hurt that *s well as the rest. I happened to have fifty tons of old silage left over. As soon as the cows commenced to shrink, this silage was fed to them night and morning, say fifteen pounds to the feed. They held right up in their milk to the usual flow for that time of lactation. I made handsome money on the investment. One experience was enough with me. 1 built the nex year a summer silo. I have neighbors who haven't yet been punished enough. They are looking for the saving grace of another drought. Thei cows have not yet recovered from the ill effects of their refusal to feed when they should have fed. Sometimes these effects follow a cow fo three years. An old German friend of mine by the name of Fiebieger took a nice heifer to the county fair. He was leading her home when I met him and asked, "Did you get a premium?" He leaned wearily back against the heifer and said: "You know vat I dinks?" "No." "Veil. I dinks dot i a man haf the bestest heifer in de world und he go py de goundy fair and he got not a goot head, den, py shimminy, he got not a premium.' For eight miles that stolid old Dutchman had walked to the fair groum and had reasoned out the truth that the heifer was not to blame, Feibeige was to blame. Probably he hadn't interviewed the committee. Sometimes I think I am a good deal of a crank. I seem somehow very much dissatisfied with the way a large proportion of the men about me are carrying on this business of dairying. My wife tells me to let them alone. But at them I go whenever I get a chance. A thousand or eleven hundred of them bring me milk every morning, I have got a set of men to study and their money goes through our hands.

A rigid course must be pursued, which I call the Wisconsin rule, but by and by, after several years. I succeeded and now fields of alfalfa are al&lt; 'ut a host of men complain of failure. Look into their case and you will invar find that they will not read and study, they ha proposition with fifteen cents worth of brains. One man, a German, had a beautiful stand of young alfalfa. His pastures were short and he turned In his cows. I said to him. "Chris, you hav alfalfa, I will not stand pasturing in this climate." Then he "Oh! vat does a newspaper man know about farming?" The next spring he foun when the alfalfa was all killed. That man was a type of thousand others. He could not learn anything from anybody ■ to fry in his own fat. It is a very uncomfortable manner of fi some men prefer to furnish the fat and fry too. Others have killed alfalfa by cutting the fourth crop, which should never be done in Whf coBsin latitudes. Last spring I plowed up thirty-two acres of alfalfa soil irn and seeded twenty-two acres with thirty pounds to the acre and a bushel and a peck of barley. At the same time I seeded eight acres of red clover, twenty pounds to the acre, and the same amount of barley. The clover nearly all summer-killed and the alfalfa lived.

Had I shut it out of mind, or despised it as book fanning, would the light ever have shone for me? Too many of our farm - era do no original thinking: they wait until some other man has demon - strated the truth and then take it up. Could they not be readers and doers of the word? On thirty-two acres of alfalfa last year I harvested 150 tons of beauti - ful hay — all of it nearly of the value of wheat bran as a feed for my cows. With a daily ration of thirty-five pounds of corn ensilage and ten pounds of alfalfa hay — cured, mind you, in the hay-cocks under hay caps — I made milk at the lowest possible cost, from four to eight cents per day less than the other 110 patrons at the Fort Atkinson Creamery. hose men were not looking at the farm end, they were looking at the market end. What is the price he may go and get for the butter, and though a man take thought of his life he cannot add one penny to that price, but the farmer end, this end is in the control of every man, and if he can reduce the expense of producing the milk or butter by wiser demonstration of economics, who then is the master of the situation? And every penny he reduces in cost Is as though another cent was added at the market end. What helped me to do this? Reading up on the feed question. That was more light. There are a lot of things to learn concerning this feed question. Follow this calculation for a moment. We bay and use — if we don't buy we grow — all of these concentrated feeds for the sake of the protein element they contain. If we have let the light shine in on our minds, we will know that the feeding value of any kind of feed is in proportion to the amount of protein it contains. See how this applies to a few of the feeds that dairy farmers buy. Bran contains twelve per cent of digestible protein, or 240 pounds of protein to the ton. If you pay $19 a ton for it, you are paying, say, eight cents a pound for the protein. Ajax flakes — dried brewers' grain — contains 30 per cent protein, or 600 pounds of protein to the ton. If you pay 924 a ton for the flakes, yon are paying four cents a pound for the protein. Every dairy farmer ought to be shrewd enough to cultivate an understanding of the chemical analysis of feed and determine by their protein contents and the price which is the best feed to buy. Did they do this you would not see them ng protein at eight cents a pound when they can buy it for four cents in another form. This is a good illustration that often the cheapest price is the dearest in expense. The various cow censuses which have appeared in the columns of Hoard's Dairyman throw a strong light. 1 have sent a man into the field in the states of Iowa, Wisconsin, Ohio, New York, Indiana, Penn - sylvania, and Vermont and have accurately measured over one thousand herds of cows, containing 11,000 cows on the whole, accurately measured every cow, in the light of what they cost at the farm end, and what they &lt;l at the creamery end. This investigation I call cow census; I have ■peat over $2,000 in striving to get at the evidence in this particular, </seg>

Number 4, made a profit of $29.18 over and above the cost of feed. Number 17, living right alongside of Number 4, taking his milk to the same creamery, did his work so blindly that he lost $10.17 per cow. Number 4 received from the creamery $29.18 more than the feed cost per cow; Number 17 re - ceived $10.17 less per cow than the feed cost. In that cow census out of forty-eight farmers taking milk to that creamery, ten of them, almost one-fourth, absolutely received less money from the creamery than the feed cost them. In addition to the forty-eight, there was taken a census of twelve cheese factory patrons, and the result was still worse, for out of the twelve, four lost money, or 33 per cent were losers. What is the matter with these men? If you study them and the way they live, you will see at once. They do not use their brains. They do not read or .study enough on this business of keeping cows. Take the measure of their minds and you will take the measure of their profit. I tell you it baa a wonderful sight to do with a farmer's profit whether he reads con - cerning his business or not. Here are some hard facts to prove it. IW. H. Jenkins took a census in 1901 of fifty farmers who were patrons the creamery at Mont rose. Pa. Twenty-five of them read dairy papers; •nty-five did not. The twenty-five who did read dairy papers averaged .23 per cow for the year. The twenty-five who did not read averaged .95. Here is a difference of $17.28 per cow. Did it pay the twenty - ■ to read? Did it pay the other twenty-five not to read? That is not Those who did read averaged a profit over the cost of food of $15.0ti cow. Those who did not read averaged a profit of 66 cents. These hard facts worth thinking of. Here is another: Mr. Jenkins took another census of forty-five pat - rons of the Onondaga County (New York) Milk Association. The tabular statement was printed in Hoard's Dairyman of February 27, 1902. Here were forty-five farmers taking their milk to the association where the weight of milk and cash records were kept. What is the record of these men? Thirty-one read agricultural and dairy papers. They aver - aged a profit of $1.35 for every dollar they spent in feed. Fourteen of these patrons did not read either agricultural or dairy papers. Where a farmer does not read such papers you will also find, as a rule, that he does rot read books devoted to his business. These fourteen averaged for every dollar spent in feed, or 15 cents loss on every dollar. Now the average cost of keeping their cows was $42.66. Multiply sum by 15 cents, and you have as the loss per cow $6.40. Suppose a man had a dairy of twenty cows; then there would be a loss of annually. What can we say for a man who will not stop a $128 leak with $10 good reading information? </seg>

            <seg id="p124">125 that there is a very close connection between the amount of profit a herd of cows yield and the amount of reading and study the owner gives to this subject. The average farmer does not think so, but the average fanner has never taken a thorough census of over 1.000 dairy farmers, and 10.000 cows in various states, to know whether this is true or not Mr. C. P. Goodrich, of Wisconsin, was commissioned to undertake th task of taking this census. I need hardly say that th' that census were a great eye-opener. Every reader of imn has a chance to read and digest this report. It created a profound im pression upon all those who came within the light. Of course, nothin could be done for those who stay in the darkness. If they ever know o will be a wonder. I will just simply give the averages. The num her of cows kept by these fifty patrons was 282; average cost of feed pe cow, |24.96; average returns in butter-fat per cow. $32.20; average num ber of pounds butter-fat per cow. 166; average price of butter-fat, 19. cents: average amount for one dollar's worth of feed, $1.29; average net profit per cow, $7.24. There were five patrons having forty-five cows wh fed silage last winter, and their average net profit was $16.74 per cow There were forty-five patrons having 237 cows who did not feed silage and their average net profits per cow was $5.57, $11.17 less. Forty-fly out of fifty owners gave their idea of the value of skim-milk, and the! valuation ranged from 10 to 25 cents, which is about the range between ■sen who stand in the light and know how to handle skim-milk an&lt; those who are in the dark about it and don't know. But one or two o these men, though they were dairymen, had ever instituted any close experiments to determine the value of skim-milk. Consequently it was a guess-work with the rest of them. "I felt curious," says Mr. Goodrich "to know whether those who took dairy papers made enough more profl out of the business to pay the subscription price of the papers.

            <seg id="p127">Some men accomplish a great deal in their work; some almost nothing, wonder why? We all think we are weak and some men keep on think ■that after they go to sleep; we think all the while we are weak, you t help it, I defy you to stop even while I talk. We think around and around in a circle. We think what we did yesterday, what John said and what Jim said. We don't go forward, do we? Just try thinking along a line, about something new. You think enough during your life time and plan it all the years through. Now try putting your thought in a new channel; I find it hard. It is so much easier to listen to a man who is tig what we already know. Take a man like Darwin. Darwin was not a remarkably brilliant man who had in him the infinite capacity for work, but he thought along new lines, just a little further, and then a ■ more, and got a grasp on the truth; that is the way he did it. The other day I went to see an inventor in this city. He was showing me a machine and talking with me about it; he saw me looking at it of my own account and he took a pencil and began to draw, and I stepped aroun.l and looked over his shoulder, and what did I see? His mind was running on an improvement on that machine and he had to put that thing on that paper: it grasped his mind; he was completely saturated with his subject. Some day he will be rich, I hope, or famous. That is the way things are Ehere is a man at the Agricultural Experimental Station — I won't tell who he is — who has done some wonderful things. I don't know her you know that there is a man there whose words and works are led for all over, in Germany and Austria. He is at the College Farm, and while I was talking to him yesterday I saw him putting down some letters and figures on an envelope, G plus GY plus Y, and he went Bith some figures. What did that mean? I said, "What are you doing?" he said. "Pardon me, when you cross a green seed bean with a yellow ?d bean there will be one of them green, two will be a mixture of n and yellow and two will be yellow." What did it amount to? Do you know what the beans when crossed that way would amount to? Why. that man is getting hold of one of the fundamental laws of nature. Some day that will amount to a great deal; it will prove a lot that we want to know about heredity. That is the way things are done in science. The best thing in the world for a young man to do is to learn to give; the way to get is to give. The men who have gotten the most in the world are the men who have been always giving; giving faithful services at one time or another, not money — I don't mean that, give that if you have it, but yourself. I wonder if you haven't thought of this, that you are giving yourself whether you know it or not; you are giving because you don't Kit 'sometimes.

I don't k the mayor of this city, but I don't know whether he is do more noble work than that man, because that man is doing right.

Breakfast when you are away from home isn't a happy meal at best. She spoiled that breakfast. Presently an came up to wait on me, no handsomer than the other girl, a little brig' and cleaner, she leaned down so she could see me in the face and says, "Good morning;" that clarified the whole dining-room. I gave my 01 to her, and when she brought it it tasted good, and we all talked of it and told little stories about our own home and breakfast table; that woman had given herself to us. We didn't care whether we got an egg that was stale or not; not so awfully much. It does make a difference, I will admit that. I don't believe there is as much difference in men.

Infection will not take place above the ground. — When the infection threads have gained their entrance into the young plumule of the plant, they develop into hyphae, and these Into a ium which lives on the Juices of the plant. They grow entirely internally, following the stems up to the very top, thus explaining why head in a stool of diseased plant is infected. Iruitinrj. — When the wheat begin? to form its fruit the hyphae of ungiis follow and enter the ovary and begin to develop their fruit at amp time that the wheat is trying to mature its grain. The vegeta - period of the fungus is now practically ended, the mycelium in the stem loses its protoplasm and septates.

The fact tha diseased plant is usually shorter than the healthy plant is proof of physio - il disturbance. It is also quite likely that the stomata are more or lf-ss clogged by the mycelium, thus shutting up partially the food fa e, — The lo this dispase varies greatly and ma i small percentage of the crop, while in some instances almost the rrop is lost. The character of the "stinking smut" is such that mall arr.ount present the value of the crop may be much &gt;-d, as by no means all the smutted kernels are broken in threshing. So while the yield may not be great) 1. the small amount of smut at may greatly reduce the value of the threshed article, as naturally millers do not care for smutted wheat for flour making. I'xtilu Miuit of Wheat ). This smut is more common than the stinking smut, but not so readily ta in this case the mycelium not only enters the ovary, forming its spores, but runs all through the chaff also, replacing this also with spores, thus turning the entire grain head into a loose mass of es which readily fall off leaving only the empty stem standii I is the smutted kernels and chaff fall off before threshing, or at least rely during threshing, the presence of loose smut is not noticed in grain. Another difference between the two kinds of smut is that the s? smut is odorless. </seg>
            <seg id="p190">190 iiomage. — Since the loose smut completely destroys the kernels, Its ence does not lower the milling qualities of the grain, so the net est is marketable. On the other hand, the spores are left behind in fields and may readily infect seed planted in the fall when thf been removed. This makes the loose smut more dangerous than the king smut, and all the more so, as the loose smut will infect wheat, ey and rye, while stinking smut infects only wheat. An idea of the minuteness of these smut spores may be had by stating that it has been computed that it. would require 25.000.000 spores to cover a superficial square inch. The spores of stinking smut are larger than those of loose smut. Etae method of germination of spores of loose smut is like that of ;ing sniut. excepting that no H-form conidia are produced. The man - of growth, general effect on host plant, etc.. are the same as for ;inp smut and need not be repeated.

Infection in ltoth kinds of must take place as in that of wheat, that is. at the time of germi - i, or very shortly after. Eie loss in crop due to smutted oats does not seem to be as great as due to smutted wheat, though on account of the character of both i of smut they may be readily overlooked in the field. Then again s are not supposed to be as fastidious in the choice of their food TREATMENT FOR SMUT OF WHEAT AND OATS All of the smuts of both wheat and oats can be considered together under one heading as the treatment must be alike for all. Infection. — In order to prevent or cure a disease successfully it is necessary to know how infection takes place. It has already been noted that infection must take place either at the time of germination of grain ry shortly afterward. Evidently the epidermis is too resisting or the germ tubes of the spores too weak for the fungus to gain a hold on the plant at a later stage. </seg>
            <seg id="p191">191 In case of the loose smuts, the spores of which are largely left on the ground, the chances are fairly good that a fall crop, if planted soon after harvesting the preceding one, will become infected, though infc is much more certain when unclean seed is used. In a dry condition the smut spores will retain their power of germination for years, when once lodged in the soil, however it is doubtful that they can last from one year to another. itamination. — Unlike many other plant diseases, smut is not con - tagious, and one field, be it ever so badly infected with smut, cannot con - gnate an adjacent field while the fungus and host are vegetatively e. Neither is it likely that a field may become infected through the jf fresh stable or barnyard manures, as any spore finding its way to would here find a good medium for germination and so would run itself out before it could do any harm. Prevention. — There being absolutely no cure for the disease when once present in a plant, the only recourse is prevention. As infection can take place only through the seed when it germinates, the seed is the thing to look after, so the one thing of greatest importance is clean seed. Irobably the best way to obtain this would be to grow a small patch of i entirely free from smutted heads and when threshed kept in a place utely clean until seeding time. It has been recommended that grain grain sacks, and fanning mills, should be kept clean and free from ts. Also that in threshing a clean grain should not be followed by utted grain. These points are, of course, of value if strictly lived up at all who have had experience on the grain farm know how imprac - ie these preventive measures are. The farmer can never know whether his grain bins are spore free or his grain sacks sterile. When once smut has gained a hold on a farm, there are numerous ways in which the tiny spores may become lodged on the kernel. If a small patch of grain can not be raised for seed, the seed, in order to make sure of getting rid of the spores, must be treated in some way so that the spores shall be killed and the germinating power of the grain not destroyed. Many remedies have been tried and reported in the bul - letins of the experiment stations, such as copper sulphate, potassium sulphide, Bordeaux mixture, formaldehyde, ceres pulver and others. All of these have advantages and disadvantages. Of the above mentioned remedies copper sulphate is probably the best, being cheap and effective, but when applied strong enough to kill the smut spores, it is also found that the percentage of germination of the grain is lowered, because a characteristic of this salt is that it attacks the young radicle, killing it in many cases. This can be prevented by treating the grain immediately after soaking in the copper-sulphate solution, with lime. This forms an insoluble salt with the copper, copper oxide, which will not injure the grain. The other remedies mentioned may be passed over, as, while they are of theoretical importance, they do not promise to become of practical The most important method that has been put into use in late years </seg>
            <seg id="p192">192 Bhot water treatment. This is especially suitable for oats, as the obtain good protection within the thick chaff. It is recommended e seed be soaked in water at 132° to 135° F. for five to ten minutes sat. and ten to fifteen minutes for oats. This treatment not only .lly kills the spores, but also hastens germination of the grain, thus tly protecting the seed against attack by insects and fungi when The last remedy which has but recently been reported upon by experi stations is the treatment of the seed by means of vapors. All the other wet methods are cumbersome, even the hot water method, which is the most efficient of them all. The seed when thus treated must also be used almost immediately after treatment, thus preventing seedsmen from furnishing guaranteed clean seed. The vapor method recently re - ported upon by the South Dakota Station consists In permitting vapors to diffuse through the grain mass. Formaldehyde vapor was found very ;ve for stinking smut and will prbably also be effective for the loose smut spores, which are more resistant. This method promises to become of importance as in this way large quantities can be treated a entailing but little work and time. Kther caution that might be mentioned is not to follow a loose i wheat crop with a wheat, barley or rye, as these are all subject same disease. Either some other crop or a year of fallow should rted to. Lastly it may be stated that with clean seed and a clean field a clean will be obtained. RUSTS OF WHEAT AND OATS. Ms are among the oldest troubles of the agriculturist having been known, or rather recognized, for centuries. They have always been a fruit ful theme for speculation and are at present the cause of some interesting exchanges between different investigators. The grain rusts have receivec considerable attention of late years, though some of them were worked ompletely nearly half a century ago by De Bary. Eriksson, o Sweden, Marshall Ward, of England, and Carleton, of this country, have been active in this field of late years. ids. — Eriksson claims twelve or thirteen distinct series of rusts in &lt;~n, and subdivides these into thirty-five to forty separate "form species." The investigators of this country, however, have not seen the necessity for so extended a subdivision, and consequently the distinc •s in this country number less. According to Carleton we have only seven, viz.: rown rust" on rye. — Puccinia dispersa, heteroecious on Anchuxa. 'range leaf rust" on wheat.— P. rubigo-vera trii range leaf rust" on rye. — P. rubigo-vera seea/is., rown rust" on oats. — P. coronata, heteroecious on Rhamnus frangula </seg>

"Black stem rust" on oats. — P. graminis avenir. The last two have their aeeidium stage on the barberry. Of the twelve or thirteen species established by Ericksson in Sweden, he claims that only four are heteroecious, viz.: P. gramini* on Berberis, P. coronata on Hhamnus fravgula, P. dispersa on Anchusa, and P. coroni - fera on Hhamnus catharticus, and that all but P. dispersa germinate teleutospores in spring, the latter in autumn. The rusts, or at least some of them, have the distinction of requiring two hosts, that is, plants on which they live parasitically, for the com - plete development of their life cycle, and this relation is called heteroecism. Some of the rusts, perhaps the majority, are able to perpetuate themselves by the use of one host only. The life history of the rusts should be under - stood that their treatment may be more intelligently handled. The com - plete development of the Uredinese — the rusts — is rather complicated, owing to their requiring two hosts, and the fact that they produce four distinct forms of spores. The classical rust, P. graminis, will be chosen as an illustration of their development, and the following diagram may well precede the detailed description, the development being in the direc - tion of the arrows, and each form giving rise to the next succeeding one. •Meutospore is considered the starting point.

The sporidia must now seek K- proper host, as they can not infect wheat directly, and this host is common barberry. The sporidia lodging on this plant will, in pres - of moisture, germinate and send its little germ tube into the leaf, once entereu it proceeds to establish itself firmly by its intercellular i* branching into a mycelium which lives on the plant juices. Having secured a proper hold, the mycelium sends out branches 10- ■1 the lower surface usually, forms a peridium which assumes the i of a cup with the open end toward the outer surface, inside of which ium branches, abstracting numerous spores, arranged in chains. i is the "cluster cup" and when mature the epidermis over the cup is ured, allowing the free escape of the aecidiospores, this whole stage lie barberry leaf being called the aecidium stage. ■ust before this stage is developed pycnidia are formed, usually on the ■i surface of the leaf. These are oval-shaped, flask-like bodies, formed w the epidermis complt-tely filled, when mature, with very small .idiospores, which escape through a rupture of the epidermis, this ire being smaller than in the case of the aecidium. The purpose of the pycnidia is not understood, their relation to the aecidium not being known. Their spores germidate readily under suitable conditions. The aecidiospores are now blown onto the second host, the wheat. where they germinate immediately, sending their germ tubes into the siomata and now develop an internal mycelium which feeds on the plant s containing the proper plant food. In a few days the mycelium forms Its spores by sending out hyphae toward the surface, which rupture the epidermis, and the spores are abstricted in large numbers one after another from the same hypha. These are the uredospores or summer spores, are usually yellow or brown, and form the familiar rust spots on the leaf. These uredospores are ready for germination as soon as they t formed, and when blown to a new plant, or to other parts of the i plant, they germinate and in turn produce a mycelium after en- trance, and again form rust pustules, and so on as long as the vegeta- tive period of the host lasts. When the host is maturing, the same mycelium which formed uredospores now form the teleutospores, or resting spores, which is the. last stage on the host. These spores are usually not matured until late </seg>

When the teleutospores are d, the uredospores cease being produced. The characters of the rust pustules of the uredo am. itosporM correspond with their purposes. The uredo pustules are made up of a loose mass of spores easily dislodged and blown about, as their purpose is to quickly disseminate among the plants and spread the disease. The pustules of the teleutospores are hard and solid and cannot easily be rubbed off, in fact can be removed entirely only I plant tissue. This enables them to remain intact on the host until time for germination. Effect on Host. — Owing to the fact that the fruit of the grain is not attacked, the farmer is apt to, and generally does, think that the rust is not at all a serious enemy unless very abundant. There can be no doubt that the loss in any case is considerable, but as it is an hid loss, it would be difficult to form an accurate estimate. In 1904 the loss in some cases was as high as 50 to 75 per cent in s&lt;&gt; Dakota, where rust was particularly abundant. Th&gt; plant must live and grow vigorously in order to produce spores so pro - fusely, and in order to do this, the plant food must necessarily be drawn upon. This source of loss to the plant is, however, probably the lea«t one. Every rust pustule represents so much epidermis with its stomata thrown out of commission, and as the leaves, and ' stems, are the only factories in thf plant where starch can be manu - factured for transport to the kernel, it is evident that any serious dis - turbance here will react on the grain format i The effect will especially be severe if the graiti variety, enabling the spores can form its fruit. It is also probable that pustules, the mycelium clogs the stomata at other places. It is also a common fact that when a patch of grain is very badly afff rust that the heads are small and stunted, showing the carbohydrate factory. — All of the rusts are pretty well ates except the stem rusts, which are the northeastern states west of the Alleghaniea. am! in Texas and California. ■itaminatiiin. — In this there is much differet and the rusts.

A warm moist climate increases the virulence, and some rusts, for instance. • a tritii-i. do not flourish well in dry climates. Prrprtuation. — Considerable work has been done to find out just how the rusts are perpetuated from year to year^ It will be remembered In ■peaking of the life cycle of P. firuminis that the aecidium stage on the barberry produced aeeidiospores. which, becoming lodged on the wheat. '. produce the uredo stage. Theoretically this looks very pretty and is quite clock-like in its workings, but. actually, the case is different. ist for some of the rusts, and even for the same rust in different rips. It is now pretty well established, l&gt;oth in this country and on the continent, that many of the rusts can perpetuate themselves with - out the intervention of the aecidium stage, and this is true oven of some of the rusts that typically develop the aecidium stage, for instance the aminit. There has been considerable discussion of late years as to the ability of uredospores wintering over and germinating in spring. Some differ - of opinion has arisen in regard to this, hut it seems to be due largely to the different climatic conditions of the different places or coun - tries where investigated. Some investigators even claim that the uredo mycelium can winter in the straw and stubble and become active again in the spring. This seems highly improbable, however, on considering the nature and character of the mycelium at the close of the vegetative period of the host. It has been pretty well established though, by al investigators, that the uredospores of P. riibirjo-ycra tritiri can not winter, but continue to grow during winter, in the Southern States. and that below 40° latitude in this country the uredo is perpetual. The has been shown of P. rubirjo-vern nrralis. The uredospores of the following two are not positively known to winter in this country: P. mix tritiri. P. graminix arentr. The last named is common on two of our common grasses, and it may be able to carry itself over on these, idering the large amount of the P. tjrnminix tritiri in this country, it would seem possible that the uredospore of this may also winter, especially as the barberry is not sufficiently common to spread it over large areas. In fact some investigators claim, especially some of the con - tinental writers, that P. iiraminix can very easily, and does, dispense with the aecidium stage, and the same authorities state that the barberry does not influence the infection at a greater distance than 50 meters. This has been noticed at places in India 3M miles from the nearest known barberry. ilricksson. in common with other investigators, found that there was [&gt;erennial mycelium in the specimens examined: he found, in fact, the mycelium is rather local around the rust spot. As the bar - y is not sufficiently common to account for the rust, and also that teleutospores can not directly infect the host, there remains only the •ability of the rust being perpetuated by means of the uredospores tering over — unless the rust has some unknown aecidium. </seg>
            <seg id="p197">197 ItT OK T1IK I Marshall Ward found that the uredospores of P. dinpersa — a rye rust — retained their powers of germination after sixty-one to ninety-four day*' exposure in open winter, and it is not known how much longer they would have been able to retain their power of germination as the experiment was not carried on longer. But artificial germination is sometimes apt to lead to wrong conclusions, as the spores are sometimes very capri in germinating: and although they may germinate bad! nfect readily. For instance, it is stated by one writer that /" « will not attack rye, barley, cocksfoot. Aira, Agrostis and Poa if Inoculated artificially with the uredospores. but the rust is common on these plants. The uredospores of the rusts in general thrive better, and ger - minate better, by being subjected to drying or freezing, or both, w naturally is in their favor in cold climates. Dr. Bessey explains the perpetuation of the rusts in the On States in another way. namely, by traveling from the south to the north in spring and back again in autumn by means of the winds. He has calculated that the advance of the grain from south to north goes on at the rate of fifteen to twenty miles per day, and this in conm with the south winds would carry the uredospores along, not only across this country, but also far into Canada. .Then, in the fall, as the grain ripens late in the year, in the north, the north winds would carry the uredospores back again over the new fall planted grain fields southward, and so continue its yearly course. When one considers the ex 1 ease with which these spores are carried about in even the slightest breeze, such a process seems quite probable, in connection with the grad - ually advancing season from south to north. It might also be noticed that where P. graminis is found, it is not at all common to find the sur - sounding barberry bushes entirely unaffected by aecidium. which would indicate that this rust is adapting itself to a single host. Infeition. — When the sporidia of the promycelium of P. graminis \v the barberry, they do so by piercing the epidermis promiscuously with their germ tubes wherever they happen to fall. When the aei spores or the uredospores germinate on the wheat host, the germ enters the stoma. but not- directly. First, the germ tube swells at the tip into an appressorium. and applies itself over the stoma and sends in a delicate ou-shoot into the respiratory cavity, and there again en - larges into a sub-stomatal vesicle, and entrance is now assured. This sub-stomatal vesicle now sends out hyphae which follow the intercellular &gt;. sending out h«re and there into the cells haustoria, and infe is now complete. Mere entrance of hyphae into the stomata doe* not constitute infection as many of the Uredinese will enter hosts on which they are not parasitic, and in the cells of which they can not I or develop. Infection depends on two factors: the relation of host to parasite involving the power of attack \&gt;y means of enzymes and toxins of the fungus, and the power of resistance by means of anti-bodies of the host; and second, environment. </seg>
            <seg id="p198">198 NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. It would not be proper in considering the rusts to pass by Eriksson's theory of internal infection. He calls it the mycoplasmic theory, which is essentially this: The fungus is able to combine its living protoplasm with the Hying protoplasm of the host, establishing a symbiotic relation, both remaining alive and capable of passing from cell to cell of the host plant. This mpcoplaxm is assumed to be able to remain in a dormant condition in the leaf or seed, and wh&lt;&gt;n external conditions are favorable the fnngal element assume morphological autonomy and grows into host cells in mycelial form, and finally producing its fruit, the uredo - spores. tdoes not consider it probable that uredospores can retain their over winter: in fact he dismisses the idea entirely.

Thirdly, he claims to have found certain threads with and nucleoli. where the mycelium threads end, which he inter - b his mycoplasm.

As these tubes and cases were, of course, all supposed to b« perfectly sterile, his positive results, though few. cause him to take a strong position in the matter, and states that these cases of rnst Infection must have been internal. As, however, he had vastly more failures than successes, with his culture — in fact his successes were hut an exceedingly small percentage of his trials — and also the more significant fact that some of his cultures developed Erygiphe. would show that if Erysiphe spores could gain entrance, why not also the ur»»do spores, when he had uredospores on plants surrounding the cases and tubes. Aphides also gained entrance into some of the cultures,- so It would be necessary, according to his mycqplasmic theory to suppose internal infection of Erysiphe and Aphides! tit might also be possible that the microscopical structure of his see - 18 could have been sufficiently disarranged by the complicated process embedding and staining, to enable a misinterpretation of what he aally saw. In the present state of our knowledge of the infection of ts, their perpetuation can much more easily be explained by blaming mischief to the uredospores, where the aecidlospores are not present. Immunity. — It is generally understood that immunity of grain to rust is correllated with thick epidermis, absence of hairs, the character of the cuticle, etc., but work recently done seems to change our Idea of Immunity. Marshall Ward, who has been working on this, obtained some Interesting results. Securing some so-called "immune" wheat, and some other variety known to be very susceptible to attack, artificially inocu- </seg>
            <seg id="p199">199 lated both. The immune variety was not attacked, that is, the fungus had not succeeded in properly infecting the plants. The susceptible variety developed abundance of rust. On examination be could find no difference in thickness of epidermis of the two varieties, nor any other mi - croscopical structure suggestive of difference in any degree. But the ex - amination showed that the immune variety had been punctured numerously by the germ tubes leaving numerous small brown spots, but the hyphae had not succeeded in establishing themselves in the host cells. Ward, there - fore, concluded that the immune variety was really the more easily attacked, readily permitting the germ tubes to enter, but that the host cells fell . such easy prey to the attack of the fungus that the latter starved itself out by consuming, too voraciously, the cells within reach. On the other hand the susceptible variety was really the more resisting of the two to the fungal attack, the hyphae of the latter gradually working Hiir way into the tissues, and so secured a permanent hold, Ward there - e concludes that the epidermis, stomata, hairs, bloom, etc., have no ation to infectlbility, but that infection depends entirely on the physiological reaction of the protoplasm of the fungus to the host cell. On the other hand, workers in this country claim that immunity does depend on thickness of epidermis, of absence of hairs, which can hold the spores in place, of presence of bloom, etc. Remedy. — Obviously, treating the seed in any way, will have no effect on rust, as the seed is not responsible for the trouble, and it is equally obvious that any kind of spraying is out of the question. There re - main then only two practicable methods of combating the disease, vis., rotation of crops, and selecting or breeding rust-resisting varieties of grain. As some of the rusts have specific hosts, following wheat with oats, or vice versa, would perhaps insure a less virulent attack on next year's crop. As, however, the spores are so easily blown about from field to field by the wind, of which Nebraska has a goodly share, this can not be considered a successful remedy. The selection of immune or resisting varieties seem the most logical way of fighting the rusts. There are very few varieties, or none at all, that are absolutely immune under all conditions, but there are varieties less susceptible than others. In Australia, the fight against the rusts has assumed almost entirely this form and they have succeeded fairly well in breeding wheat true to name that will resist attacks by the fungus. Carleton, of the Department of Agriculture, who has become the cereal expert in this country, gives the following varieties that resist orange leaf rust (P. rubif/overa tritici): Turkey, Mennonite, Odessa, Relti, Pringle's No. 5 and Pringle's Defiance for the hardy varieties, and Hayne's Blue-stem and Saskatchenan Fife. Any ordinary variety of wheat may rust badly if sown late, but the following (spring grain), on ac - count of their early maturity, may escape: Early May, Zimmerman, Early Baarb, Allora Spring, Roseworthy, Yemidy, Kathia, Canning Downs and Japanese No. 2 ; but some of these are not hardy enough for northern latitudes. </seg>

As alfalfa and clover are two very important forage crops for our state, and especially alfalfa, it is certainly of interest to us as NV - braskans to know a little of the enemies that may or already do threaten welfare of our crop and thus bring disaster into our camp. tis an old saying that a stitch in time saves nine, and while we yet fairly safe and our pet forage crops fairly healthy, it is well to that the enemy is harassing our stronghold and the sappers are ng our lines. 1 wish especially to speak of the diseases that have already been found here affecting the clover and alfalfa plants and which are likely to en us the most. And 1 wish to state that this is partly my own investigation, but the discussion of the diseases largely a summary of the work of mot' eompt stigatore. CLOVER DISEASES. El diseases I have found affecting the clovers here are the Rust ..'hi. and the Black Mould if-tlythrinvium trifolii), and have noi yet done much damage, they are capable of gr&gt; ing the hay crop, and even of killing the plant. Bit- rust does not spread to plants other than the clovers, and is most ful in its summer and winter spore stages which develop almost simultaneously in June and July. They make their appearance in the In of pustules of different shades of brown, and these pustules burst &gt;ugh the epidermis of either surface of the leaf and consist of close ly ted spores. I have seen them even along the stem of the plant when plant was badly affected. These spores being thus liberated of course . around in the air, and in the case of the summer spores light on r leaves of the clover and immediately send out their little filaments austoria. which penetrate the tissues and form a new growth; while winter spores take up their winter quarters on stems or stubble and e out fresh and vigorous for their summer campaign. The Black Mould appears in thickly scattered black spots on the under surface of the leaves with corresponding light green spots on upper surface. Each one of these dark spots is made up of a multitude of dark threads or filaments that bear on the free end a two celled spore. These when liberated act in a similar manner to the rust spores. The black spots are often followed by a black crust on the affected leaves. </seg>
            <seg id="p201">REPORT OF THE BOTANIST. 201 This is supposed to represent the perfect form of Phyllachora trifoUi bnt if such is the case the winter spores of this, which should develops, have nevpr been described. E:h of these fungi greatly reduce the feeding value of clover, and considerable reduction in the size of the leaves and the general of the plant, so are consequently the source of real loss where the es have spread to any great extent. As a remedy, where the disease is only found in small patches the crop might be cut in early summer and burned. But it may have a fair start in a meadow before it is noticed and can quickly contaminate the whole Held. So perhaps the only salvation is to cut early in the season before the summer spores have matured, or pasture closely till midsummer or later. ALFALFA DISEASES Iilfalfa. that prime favorite of onr western country, the plant that tamed and populated the wilderness, that has lined the pockets of the ■her. the farmer, and the packer, and has given better meat to the ramer: this plant, like progressive and aggressive people, seems to » more enenlies in the field that do more damage than to the clover t. Its most virulent enemies are Leaf Spot ( Pxeuodnpeziza medi - n{#). Leaf Blight (Cerronpora helvola medicaginis) , and Dodder truta. of several species). AI.rAT.FA LEAF SrOT. Leaf Spot was first described by Libert in 1832: Fuckel mentions it as common In Germany in 1869 Its first mention in this country was prob - ably in 185B when Sprague found it In New England and Pennsylvania. The disease is most common on the alfalfa but the complete form of the disease is not common. It attacks the plants any place from four to six inches from the seed. Small blackish-brown spots appear on the upper surface of the leaf, which in a few days enlarge to about one-sixteenth of an inch in diameter and extend through to the lower surface and have the same color. The intervening tissues also become brownish. In the renter of each well developed spot a small blackish pustule appears, usually on the upper side of the leaf. These pustules soon rupture the epidermis of the leaf, which rolls back or falls off. A cross section of the pustule greatly magnified presents a cup shaped mass of colorless, long club-shaped, sac-like bodies standing upright. Each one of these contains eight egg-shaped, one-celled bodies, each containing a nucleus and two oil globules. A little later the enclosing sa&lt;- bursts, and these spores es - cape from the tube and like the spores of the clover rust, are carried to the leaves of other plants by the wind, where a drop of rain or dew will cause them to germinate. And again like the rust, threadlike filaments or projections are sent out which puncture the epidermis and ramify among the cells, drawing nourishment and sapping the plant food from the plant. Thus it retards the growth and saps the strength of the plant, and when it attacks young plants it prevents a good stand. It </seg>
            <seg id="p202">202 Is thus capable of doing much damage, haying in Iowa caused a Iosb of fully 50 per cent, of the crop. It survives the winter, and Is carried by the wind as dust, so that burning the affected field in late fall or early spring is recommended. Another remedy is to treat the alfalfa seed with about ten per cent, solution of copper sulphate. But with this remedy ure may be as bad as the disease as there is danger with so strong a solution of weakening the germinating power and vitality of the seed. 80 It would be safer to use a weaker solution or experiment with a little of the seed thus treated in a germinator before sowing. Another very ual remedy is to drill the seed with a press drill instead of broad - casting, as this buries the spores beneath the ground where they cannot come in contact with the leaf of the plant. Frequent cutting will also hold the disease in check, as it prevents many spores from developing. But the best remedy is a preventive rather than a cure. Do not tow teed from an affected field or region. LJEAF BUG II T Leaf Blight appears on the surface of the leaf as a sub-circular spot of a smoky brown or nearly black color, equally visible on both sides and varying in size from one-sixteenth to one thirty-second of an inch in diameter. These spots have no well defined borders, but on close exam - ination are shown to be quite irregular, and shade into the surrounding tissue. They gradually grow together and cause the leaf to turn yellow and brown and completely destroy it. The disease is caused by a fungus which is Cercotpora helvola, and the name medicaginis has been added by some investigators. What appears to be the same species is found on the red and crimson clover, doing much damage to the latter. As in the other diseases, branched sparingly septated threads force their way through the tissues and between the cells of the leaves, causing the dis - coloration and wilting which are the external manifestations of the dis - ease. These threads form a thick growth just beneath the epidermis and form a tuft of stout conidia or thread-like spores, these arise from a tubercular base which occurs just beneath the epidermis, and they have crow walls or septa varying from one to five. When these conida or threads are placed in a drop of water they quickly germinate and send out a thread-like sprout which penetrates the leaf and thus starts a new growth Eh la disease may do much damage on young first year plants. The remedy is to cut and burn, which may be effective, as the disease does spread as rapidly as in the case of the spores that escape and are *n about by the wind. Another remedy is to compost with an excess me. Both of these diseases appear on our alfalfa, but I have not found either in a very virulent form. ALFALFA DODDER. The dodder is a plant that comes from a seed germinating in the ground, but since it Is a parasite living on other plants and sapping their </seg>
            <seg id="p203">203 disease producer and one that is becoming very dangerous in many sec - tions of the country. There are some twenty-five species of dodder found in the United States. They are all annual plants with yellow, orange, white or pink thread-like sterna, small yellow, pink or white tlowers, usually in clusters, and minute scales in place of leaves. All grow on green herbs or shrubs about which their stems twine, drawing nourish - ment, from the plant through rootlets or suckers which penetrate the bark of the host plant. Some are confined to particular kinds of plants. Some grow only on the clover family, others on shrubs and weeds, while a few appear to thrive on any kind of green vegetation. The majority of those that grow east of the Rocky Mountains are found on the luxurient vegeta - tion of bottom lands and do little harm, but there are a few which grow on alfalfa, clover and flax that do much damage. KFlax dodder (C uncut a epithymum) is a species common to flax but Lhe most prevalent species on alfalfa in Wyoming and Idaho, and is letimes found on it in the states farther east where flax is grown. B Warty dodder (Cuscuta mdecora) is a native species sometimes found clover and alfalfa in the southern states and in the prairie regions. It also grows on many other plants. Clover dodder (Cuscuta racemosa chiliana) infests clover fields of the Mississippi valley. It lives only on clover and closely related plants. Field dodder (Cuscuta arvenais) is the most injurious native species in the east. And it is found in less abundance in nearly all parts of the country farther west. It grows usually on dry upland meadows and pastures and thrives best on clover although it lives on many host plants. There is a species of alfalfa dodder that has been imported into this country in alfalfa seed, it thrives best on alfalfa and clover but will grow on a variety of plants. These species are practically indiscernible to the naked eye and can be distinguished from each other only by technical characteristics. While certain species are more partial to one host plant than another, their manner of growth and habits are similar. They have been most widely spread by importation in impure seed, and can thus be easily introduced into a field. The seed is small, being only about one twenty-fifth of an inch in diameter, and having the color of the clover or alfalfa seed. They resemble very much the white clover seed in size and general ap - pearance, although under a microscope they show a rough coat, and are more globular. The seed is much scattered locally by being blown over the snow in winter or over the frozen ground with bits of alfalfa or clover stem when stock is being fed. These are the artificial means of scattering. When the seed is placed in the ground it germinates under much the same circumstances as alfalfa and clover, but instead of two green leaves appearing, a slender yellow shoot pushes through the ground. This, when, a little distance above the surface, bends to one side and swings slowly around until it comes in contact with some green plant. If it fails to reach and become attached to any plant it dies as soon M </seg>
            <seg id="p204">204 NBBBASKA 8TATB BOARD tiK AUB1UULTUBB. the seed nourishment is used up. But if it reaches a congenial host plant it twines closely around it in some places and in others loosely. Where it wraps closely about the plant many little rootlets or suckers are sent These penetrate the epidermis and push through the tissues of the host to the very heart or pith of the plant, and thus feed on the food elements intended for the plant. These rootlets serve a double purpose of support and feeders for the dodder plant. Deprived of its proper amount of nourishment the host' plant is dwarfed and in the clovers the plant is often killed. But the dodder continues to grow and as the upper part becomes attached to some other part of the plant or to an - other individual, the lower part dies and new branches are sent out from the upper portion. These in turn twist about for a new victim, a new source of food supply, and the older part dies. Thus like an advancing army burning its bridges behind it, the dodder from a single seed con - tinues to advance from plant to plant until a number of clover or alfalfa plants have fallen a prey to its ravages. If not further molested the host plant might produce a new crop from its roots. But soon after the dodder establishes itself on the host and begins to branch it produces era of tiny white or yellowish flowers, and to mature seed, and a succession of flowers and seeds are produced by the advancing vines until frost kills all. This seed ripening and falling to the ground all through the season, will retain their germinating powers for five years or more, but many will germinate the same year under the same conditions that will cause the roots of the clover to send up new shoots and they are thus on the field ready for the tender shoots when they appear, and thus the host plant is finished. If the dodder plant is undisturbed a good supply of seed is left to be scattered by the winter winds, but if cut and raked with hay they are scattered over a much wider area. This hay being fed to stock makes possible a still wider distribution. And if the seed is threshed with clover it is very hard to separate and make pure seed. In fact it is never safe to sow seed from dodder infested fields. METHODS Oi &gt;.KAbU Ailu.N. ■When small dodder-infected spots are found in a field they should be mediately destroyed and not allowed to spread. I One good way is to mow very close with a scythe a short distance all und the infested spot and either feed to stock or rake to the center the spot and after drying saturate with kerosene and Be as eful in the work as if handling a deadly poison, for even a piece of dodder plant falling on a clover stem on a damp day is likely to rt a new growth. After about a week examine the spot for any new iwth that may appear, trom pieces or seed left on the stubble, as there likely to be growth low down. Strong brine, sulphate of lime and dilute sulphuric acid may be used. Sulphate of iron, potassium and copper are most effective when dissolved iu water and liberally applied as a ten per cent, solution. They should be used in this strength, because the whole plant is to be destroyed as well as the host. This will kill all down to the ground and the clover and </seg>
            <seg id="p205">205 HKi'oKT UK THK BOTANIST. alfalfa will usually come up again from ihe rooi. Such ireatmem is more Live if applied after the patch has been mowed, although it may kill loroughly applied without mowing. Another effective method when seed has been prtxi o hoe or cultivate the soil frequently, after removing the vegetation. Do this for three or four weeks, and it will encourage seed to germinate and the frequent stirring will prevent any growing. A deeper cultivation would tend to bury some seed so deep it would not germinate but would retain its vitality until the field was plowed, then brought to the surface would grow. Jj The seeds on the ground may also be destroyed by burning light wood or chips over it, straw not producing enough heat close to the ground. When whole fields have become infested one of the best means of I initiation is by close grazing with sheep, not allowing them to go to other fields and carry the seeds or stems in their wool or hoofs. 1&gt; can also be destroyed usually by cultivating the tield iu corn or some root crop for two successive seasons. For alfalfa and clover dodder any crop but leguminous plants can be grown. But for destroying all kinds only such crops as admit of clean cultivation will be effective. Is mentioned before, the four species of dodder discussed here are lly introduced through the medium of impure seed. Every on should be taken therefore to plant only pure seed. The gi dealer should be required to furnish a guaranty of purity. But beat 11 examine the seed for yourself, learn what dodder looks Uki i the seed if impure. Ee very good way is to sift through a sieve of proper mesh; — one jut twenty meshes per inch will separate the seed allowing the r to fall through. Baled hay that is shipped is another means of distribution as it often contains the seed. Care should therefore be taken as to where the refuse of such hay goes. Also be slow about spreading manure on the fields, where such hay has been used around the barns. There are no laws in force in this country relating to dodder. Where there are dodder intested districts there should be laws enforced com - pelling careless farmers to eradicate the destructive dodder from their farms, but not necessarily those harmless ones found on low ground along ravines. And road overseers and those in charge of highways should be authorized to destroy the dodder along the roadside. And a heavy penalty should be attached for the selling and handling not only of impure rs but other adulterated seeds and grains, as untold dama. wrought to the farmers and the country in general every year t»j criminal carlessness and dishonesty of some seedsmen. </seg>

Many trips for purposes of ex - ploration were planned, but very few extensive trips were executed. Eight trips in all were made: two of them were for the purpose of securing flies of old newspapers, and six were for purposes of exploration. Five lectures were delivered during 1903, and five catalogue numbers were added to the museum from all source*. The study of the year has systemized the Indian tribes of the state more fully and has gathered into available form some valuable data.

The flint quarries, referred to in my last report, have attracted W much attention that it became necessary to chart them accurately: to that end I made a trip to Nehawka.

This rwmlt was obtained by a careful measurement of the iregular surface of tkt different fields in the vicinity of Nehawka. These fir 'larked on the accompanying chart (marked Plate II.

The following account of thU inter - esting site I prepared for the Schuyler free Lance of May 29, IMS: iyler is one of the thriving towns north of the Platte river, on the main line of the great uverland route, the Union Pacific railway. It is situated near where Shell Creek joins the Platte from the north. Shell Creek rises between the Klkhoru on the north and the Loup Uiver on the south, in the western part of Platte county, flows across Colfax county and has an eastward trend. It is a short stream, but at times carries a vast quantity of water, as I observed when visiting it a few days ago. Shell Creek is separated from the Platte by a low range of sandy hills, ris - ing about sixiy feet in the highest places. This range is not over two miles wide in the widest place, and at Schuyler the range comes to a point where the valley of Shell Creek joins the valley of the Plane immediately nun h of town. Beginning at this point of hills, and extending westward for a distance of three miles, is the ruin of an extensive Indian village which 1 nave named the Gray siie" in honor of Mrs. Robert Uray, who tirst called my attention to it. May 1» 1 accepted Mrs. Gray's kind invitation and made a careful exploration of the site. I This site belongs to the Stone Age. Bear in mind the Stone Age in oraska extended down very nearly to historic times. Many of the ives met by Lewis and Clark in 1804 were still in the Stone Age. The &gt;ple who inhabited the Uray site met and trafficked with white men ore the site was deserted, but most of the time it was occupied by pimple o had never come in contact with whites, as the artifacts strewn over i site indicate. As soon as redmen saw the implements of civilization ■y abandoned their own clumsy stone implements and procured thaw Ue by the whites; peacefully, if possible, but by force if necesary. By the larger portion of the relics found on the Uray site are stuue. Only ew bits of copper and very rarely a scrap of iron is to be found. This &gt;ves that there had been little contact with the whites. Sherds of pottery are abundant. The pottery found in the state may be divided into three general classes: Basket ware, which is the oldest and is found on the Omaha sites; decorated ware, which is found on Pawnee sites; and a rude ware used by the later tribes which is burned to a red color in many cases. There are various subdivisions of these three general classes. The basket ware having fabric impressions on the outside, is not found on the Uray site; all the specimens are of the decorated kind, having handles of artistic design. No whole specimens have come under my notice. The chipped stone implements are quite numerous and cover a wide range of material. The blue chert, found in nodules along the Blue Hirer, is abundant. Some specimens are made of material from the banks of the Kft""f&gt;" River. The flint quarries of Nehawka, on the Weeping Water, furnished by far the greatest quantity of the material.

Mr Dibbles related some stories of early times in that part ;e county. A camp was made at Holmesville and the Hollingworth site reviewed 1 visited the home of Wm. Meyer, who lives a mile south of Holmes viile. He found a very fine stone axe on his farm. Between Holmes ville and Blue Springs is another more extensive site, near the northeast corner of section 5, town 2 north, range 7 east. This site has not been thoroughly explored. A camp was made on the farm of C. E. Rice, on the east side of the Blue, from which I drove over the surrounding country. Mr. Walter Rice accompanied me to the Wonder site, one mile north of Blue Springs where we secured a number of relics; a carved rock was found which is of interest; this rock is oval in form and three inches in diameter It is about half an inch thick and of a soft gray sandstone. Upon either side are marks evidently made by man, which doubtless mean something If they could be translated. No one has yet offered an explanation of these marks. An account of the Wonder site may be found in my report of 1902 (October 1). There is little doubt but this rock will assist in tracing the obscure history of the people who once occupied the Wonder site. (Plate VI.) The most notable result of this trip centers around the Rice site whica was discovered March 11, 1902. This site has aroused mor interest than at first thought possible. Upon it is found many stone im piemen Us of very rude design and ruder workmanship; they are really paleolythic in form and show a very low order of civilization. For tha reason they are interesting; artistic stone implements, those which show a high degree of skill in making, are common in all parts of the world but the fields where such rude specimens are to be obtained are limited in extent. In the east half of Kansas and the southeast part of Ne - braska, covering an area about 150 miles in diameter, one may nni these rude implements. The form and workmanship both suggest an early stage of the stone age, and as the attention of students is called to them and as they are studied more the interest will grow. Walte Rice was inspired by my first visit to explore the surrounding country and in consequence the area of the site has expanded until it is found to cover the highest points for some distance along the Blue River Jus east of Wyniore. Mr. Rice sent a hundred specimens to the museum which are very interesting. There is abundance of flint in the limeston which crops out of the hills near this site; it is found in the form o nodules, and rude tomahawks and other implements were made of tha material by beating one rock against another. By this process man firs wrought out his weapons of defense, and by this process man firs fashioned his arrows with which to secure his food. Not a single sher of pottery is intermingled.

Mr. James Crawford loaned a very fine specimen of Quivera tomahawk, which T illustrated in my report, for 1902. He also furnished some very valuable specimens of other stone-ape implements. The Rice Rite has been mapped (Plate V). An account of my trip to Council Bluffs in June was published in a paper of that place and attracted the attention of Mr. Norman Joseph Miller of that place, who opened correspondence with me relative to a rain of an extensive Tndian village situated immediately across the Missouri Rtrer from the mouth of the Platte. After a number of letters had passed between us. October 27 was selected as the date for a careful exploration of this village site Mr. Miller, who was thoroughly familiar with the locality, accompanied me as guide. An area of country having a river front alone the east bluffs of the Missouri for three miles and extending back into the blxiffs for nearly a mile, was once more or less thickly strewn with Tndian habitat. It seems that few. if any. extensive groups of lodges were ever found here: but scattered here and there over this area are small groups of rains showing that a few tepees had ocmpled every promi - nent point throughout this area. Tfpon this field I found pieces of flint containing the same fossils found In the Nehawka flint, and naturally concluded that, at la»t the chipping field for the Nehawka auarrles would be found, but while ex - ploring near the base of the bluffs, near Hintons station. T found flint nodules in the same carboniferous limestone found on the Weeping Water In Nebraska. This Is the most Important discovery made on this trip, as it shows this geological formation to reach across the Missouri River Into Iowa. The artifacts found on this village site do not show contact with whites, and the village site doubtless antedates the T^ewis and Clark expedition of 1804. Some specimens found show much skill In their manu - facture, and potterv is quite abundant. Upon a part of this site resides Otis IB. Aliis. son of Rev. Samuel Alils. who was missionary to the Pawnee* in Nebraska fn 1S34. Mr. Aills sent (o the museum the gun used by his father at that date, and also a cane which Rev. Samuel Allis cut from his claim near Papllllon In 1S4S. He gave also a number of Tndian relics found on his farm, among them a very ancient clay pipe moulded In the form of the human head *nd face. Mr. Miller and I put in two days exploring in the vicinity. We partook of the hospitality of Otis K. Allis and listened to many stories and early reminiscences of life in Nebraska. Mr. Miller proved a very efficient guide and Is himself a very interesting and unique character. According to Mr. Miller's own statement, his father came from Hamburg, Germany, and was in the employ of the Hudson Bav Company near the head - waters of the Mississippi.

Link, of Millard. one of the early pioneers of Nebraska, informed society that he had a number of files of early newspapers, complete incomplete, stored in his attic which should be added to the files now ed in the historical society fire-proof rooms. On the 3d of March I ped at Millard and partook of the doctor's hospitality. About pounds of newspapers were packed and sent to Lincoln. O. Howard, who publishes the Milforrl "Krbraskan. had the bound volumes of that paper and the Plewiant Dale Quiz reaching back a num - ber of years. These papers Mr. Howard kindly consented to loan to the society, and on April 1 I packed these papers and shipped them to Lincoln. LECTURES. The lectures delivered during the year were a fruitful source of benefit to the society, inasmuch as this brings to the notice of the public the needs of the society and adds to the list of our acquaintances I suggest that a number of lantern slides be made and an illustrated re on "Nebraska Archeology" be prepared.

The answer to these questions may, in time, be possible. The valley of the Blue must be explored farther north and a list of these rude village ruins must be completed before one dare venture an assertion. Mr. Rice has done much to throw light on the mystery in his locality, and each year we add some new information and many new relics. The second exploring trip wai made to Beatrice in hope of interesting some local archeologist in the work farther up the river. I hoped to get a start at Beatrice from which I could begin to chart the Blue valley from there to Crete, but in this trip I accomplished little or nothing. The work must be commenced from some point farther up the river. tngnst 11 I visited Bine Springs again and completed some details chart of the Wonder site and vicinity, which I have made from time me as I visited this interesting ruin. This chart I wish to present part of this report (marked Plate I). Just north of the Wonder site, in the same section of land, is another extensive ruin which I have named the "James site" in honor of the man who owns the land. This is not so large as the Wonder site, and has not been explored to any great extent, but enough has been learned to classify it as the same kind as the Wonder site. Mr. Wilson, who was one of the first pioneers in that part of the state, told me on my first visit to that site that in an early day there were roads leading from this ruin in a northern direction — one due north and one northwest. There was also a well-defined trail twenty feet wide leading nearly due east to the river brink. He said the sod wall, which enclosed about thirty acres of ground, and which surrounded the village ruin, as well as the. ruins of the lodges, made the ground so uneven that it had to be graded with a team and scraper before it could be farmed. From another source at the same time I was informed that these were made by a company of surveyors who wintered there: but the person who informed me. and whose name I have forgotten, did not Ir when the surveyors were there. The relics found prove that if eyors did winter at this point they used an abandoned Indian vil - for their camp. There are no relics left to indicate that white men occupied this place for any considerable time. This is an interest - itudy, but the work has not progressed far enough to determine what i of Indians occupied this ruin, nor at what date. Before this fact be definitely determined it is necessary to have a chart of the prin- Indian village ruins in the state and a collection of relics from each, lat the whole area of the state can be studied. Then one must deter - s the Hass of relics commoh to each tribe, and the tribe which occupied Klage by the relics foun.i there. The time can only be determined &gt;ximately at the best; but when a given locality is known to be the i of a given tribe, the approximate date can be found.

As part of this report, I present a detailed account of this celebration marked A). It was planned by some of the members of the Quivera Historical 8ety to celebrate an occasion at Manhattan, Kan., by dedicating a ument to the memory of "Tatarrax," who, according to the Spanish atives of the expedition of Coronado in 1541, was then the king or chief ruler of "Quivera," and wore about his neck a copper disc — the only if metal at all resembling gold found on the trip. Tatarrax is well worthy of a monument, and as I was invited to assist in the program of the day, 1 made a trip to the little town of Manhattan. monument is a granite shaft of imposing appearance, and much Mt was manifest by the people of the place. Such dedications are of al value and should be oftener indulged. The office staff of the Historical Society insisted .that I should take a week in which to make a study of the anthropology exhibited at the -iana Purchase Exposition, held at St. Louis. Among the many s for study brought forward by this exhibit, one alone can be '1 in this report, owing to lack of space. In the exhibit made by the Missouri Historical Society was a collection of very superior chipped These implements were found all together in a cache in Tennessee -liow the aboriginal art in the greatest parfeettaa I have ever seen. were over a hundred of them found in the same cache, and tlMj all made of the same dark-brown jasper. I am not able to find where material conies from, nor has any one found like specimens in any locality, so far as I have been able to learn. In the Nebraska State Historical Society museum is a specimen and owned by Mrs. Hannah Larson, which with the specimens shown in the Missouri His exhibit at the fair. This specimen was found on a site once ied by the Pawnees and is one of the most perfect specimens in our museum, the material is the same, so far as the eye can determine, and the individuality of chipping shows the same. One would think it part of this Tennessee collection. Now the curious part of this similarity is how did this peculiar specimen, so unlike any other found in this and so like the others found in Tennessee, come to be in Nebraska? incident will serve to show the value of great expositions in bring - ing together great books of object lessons. MUSEUM By far the most important work of the year, and that which con - id most of the time which has heretofore l&gt;een devoted to explora - and lectures, was the museum. </seg>
            <seg id="p225">225 Early in the year 1904 a complete change was made in the arrange - ment of the museum rooms. The four new upright cases were arranged on the east side of the room, and the two large flat cases were arranged on the north side, while the four show cases which stood on tables across the center of the room were mounted above the flat cases with the backs together and the boards removed; this arrangement gives much more floor space and makes a very desirable case in which to place articles when either side should be seen. Three cases were built of the glass - fiont boxes and placed in such a way that the light is very good in all parts of the case. This gives the museum twelve large cases in the museum room proper, and three in the outer office. Nearly every speci - men is under glass, except large spinning wheels, the ox-yoke, plow and like things that dust does not injure materially. It required nine hun - dred square feet of glass to cover the specimens we are exhibiting. While the museum is so crowded, I think it best to store the leas inter - esting material and exhibit properly that which is shown at all. While mention has been made in these reports of the collections brought to the museum each year, no detailed catalogue has been pub - lished owing to the lack of space. The public, prone as they are to for - getfulness, is not familiar with the contents of this museum. The thou - sands of visitors from this and other states, who visit the museum, hare a conception of the rapid growth of this department of the state his - torical society work, but the greater number of the citizens of the state who should be interested in this work never visit Lincoln, and the only knowledge they get of what is being done is through the medium of printed reports. It is impossible at this time to devote the necessary time to a complete catalogue of the whole museum, but a brief review of the general classes of relics and a brief reference to the most inter - esting specimens is a necessity, that the general public may learn to appreciate the work being done and the necessity of preserving the rare specimens which indivduals may have in their homes in the fire-proof rooms of the Historical Society. The specimens which you may send here as a loan or as a gift are, in the first place, perfectly safe from fire; in the second place, you may loan your specimens and have them re - turned to you at any time, or, if they be old heirlooms, they may be placed here and the ownership pass by will to all the heirs while the article is here as a permanent loan and well cared for. The specimens which you send here are not buried in oblivion, as they are in your possession, but every distinguished visitor from this and other states, who happens to sojourn in Lincoln for a few days, visits our museum. This condition will always exist, and as our museum is made more at - tractive it will grow in interest. Your relics will assist in making it more attractive, and each year thousands will see and enjoy them. This is not the strongest plea for you to send them here. Remember, this great university has many students who are making special study., of almost every subject; they do not study from books alone, but go to the sources and use original material; all the rare documents, all the ancient im- 8 </seg>

Your specimens, so long as they are buried on your &lt; • table or in your cabinet, are retarding the study of the Nebraska ab - origine. Your name and ownership need not pass from them when they are sent here. There are one hundred people in this state, now. who will live in the history of the state simply on account of specimens which they found and loaned to this society for study, without which their names would have been forgotten in fifty years at the most. Will you add to the world's stock of knowledge? Will you become worthy of a place in history by assisting in this work? Overcome the petty selfishnesses of life and let the little mite you can contribute to the study be used as a stepping stone for some other student to carry the work to com - pletion Send us the specimens you have and let the world know of them, and of you. ■As part of this report I present a. brief review of the museum, together h a Hat of the donors (marked B). The Nebraska Commission of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition solicited this society to send a representative exhibit to St. Louis&gt;^Jn consequence, thirty-eight cases were made seventeen by twenty-nine inches and four inches deep; these were fitted with plate-glass covers, and In them were mounted relics from the museum, statistical maps and charts and representative photographs taken in the state. These cases, after being filled, were crated securely and sent to St. Louis In the car with other Nebraska material. Mr. Barrett went to St. Louis and placed these cases in the agricultural exhibit as wall decorations. Some time later they were removed from the agricultural exhibit, without our knowledge or consent, and sent over to the educational exhibit, where they were kept during the remainder of the fair. Part were on exhibition and part were stored under the curtains, owing to lack of room in which to exhibit them. Some of the most breakable articles I removed from the cases when I was at St. Louis in November and brought them home with me. The rest of the exhibit arrived at our rooms after the fair. Aside from a few broken specimens and a few lost specimens the exhibit is safely returned. Could this exhibit have been placed where it belonged, in the buildng of anthropology, it would have made a credible snowing. iFhe mounting of coins and other material in the museum is a difficult ter when all sides must be seen and studied. Nothing can be found the market which will subserve this purpose, so, with the assistance Hr. Barrett, the curator, we have devised a case wherein such speci - is can be mounted and all sides studied at pleasure; we only lack time necessary to make the cases, and hope to have all our cola ections so mounted in the near future. </seg>

One of the greatest evils we have had to combat In the past Is the dust which penetrated the windows and arose from the floors of the 100ms, settling on the exposed specimens and glass of the cases. I required the whole time of one man to keep the museum in presentable shape on this account. While 1 was at St. Louis I saw the effect of a kind of patented window strip which effectually kept the dust from coming in: I called the attention of the university authorities to the matter and they kindly consented to fit my museum with these strips, so the dus from that source is effectually overcome. The floors I have thoroughly cleaned and have dressed them with a material which I have dlsroverei and which causes the dust which falls on the floor to become too heavy to rise, and is easily removed with a broom. These two precautionary measures have given splendid results in saving of time and in cleanliness The Academy of Sciences holds a meeting once a year. At these meetings new discoveries of interest and merit are brought to the atten tion of the public. I have been asked to treat of "New Forms of Flint Implements Found in Nebraska" at the coming meeting. As these new forms of flint implements really belong to this report, no more fitting place can be found than here in which to report the substance of th&lt;&gt; matter which I have prepared for that meeting: Three new forms of flint implements have been discovered and studied in this department since 1900. One which I shall name the "Hopkin Groover." was first brought to my attention by Mr. A. L. Hopkins, of Oak dale, Antelope county. This gentleman suggested the use to which they were put by the aborigines, and I have failed to find a better explanation so will accept his until a better is offered. These implements have a shape somewhat like a hawk's bill, and Mr. Hopkins suggests that they were used to put the three grooves length-wise of the arrow-shaft. These grooves are made on all arrow-shafts, and since the Indians have used steel arrow-points they use the point of another arrow or a knife with which to make the groove. So far they have not been noticed excep In Antelope county. The point of theimplement is its only peculiar fea ture. One side of the implement is left flat, or with the concoidal fractur of the flint chip of which it is made in plain evidence like the flat sid of a scraper; the other side is chipped oval and tapere to a point like bird's bill. There is often considerable curve to the flat side. We have number of specimens in the museum and many more may be secure* In Antelope county, as few local archeologists recognize them as anythin but a chance form; however, too many are found to so consider them. Ir. Thomas Marwood first called my attention to the second type o flint implement; I am at a loss for an appropriate name for this n my dilemma shall simply name it in honor of its discoverer, "th 'ood." It is round at the center and tapers toward both ends; it i •wo cones placed with their bases together; however, in most of th mena one or both of the ends are out of true — that Is, the point to one side. Mr. Marwood has a number of specimens and Mr :1ns has a few. We hope some one will evolve a probable theory as </seg>

The home of the material I do not know and they are all of the same kind of material. So far they have not been noticed In any other place than Antelope county, and the material is different from other specimens found there. The last of the three I found on the Gray site, near Sohuyler. Mrs. Gray has a large collection, and a gentleman at Neligh has a number found near that town. This implement is flat (or concotdal) on one side and chipped oval on the other: the end is chipped round, and I would call them a form of scraper, as the finished end so much resembles that implement, but they are too small and much longer than wide. The width of the implement is from a quarter to a half Inch, and the length is from one and a half to two and a half inches, while the proportion Is nearly the same in all. The workmanship is very superior: much too fine for a scraper. I shall call this Implement "the Gray" to distinguish it from others, and suggest that these curious specimens were used as tweezers with which to pull beard from the face. Can any one suggest a more likely use? I hope you will keep on the watch for new types of implements: this field was the middle ground between the tribes of the far east and th*&gt; tribes from the far west: the plains of the Mississippi valley are strewn the implements of theso people, ami you mav be sure the mingling of the tribes gave new ideas to each which found expression In new and different forms of chipped flint. Khree very fine specimens of the knife known as "the Stocton C' h has only been found in California heretofore, have been found in state. One I found near Genoa, and the other two were sent by Mr. er and were also found near Genoa. During the latter part of 1904 this department had a number of lantern - slides made to illustrate the work. These will be used in lectures that the public, far removed from our museum, may enjoy some of our fine specimens and realize the necessity of sending the specimens they may have in their private collections where they will be of greater value to science. One of the ir.any points of study and classification which is under way in this department is a card niilogiie of Indian chiefs and other proml - inriinns of this state A card was printed and sent out to men who r-av have known those crVs personally: these cards are intended to give complete bibliography of the Indian name, that students of Indian his - tory will find such a catalogue of inestimable value: it will greatly aid me in the work of my department.

            <seg id="p231">&gt; REPORT OF THE VETERINARIAN. TUBERCULOSIS. BY A. T. PETERS, D. V. 8. This disease is one that has been recognized more or less for several centuries, yet it is said that the more exact knowledge of its nature has practically all been gained within the last few decades. The discovery of the tubercle bacillus was a great advance in the study of this disease among cattle. This germ is a parasitic vegetable micro-organism, which under the microscope is seen to be a minute rod with rounded ends, usually slightly &lt;1. It is about ten times as long as broad, and measures on the average about one-thousandth of an inch in length. It has great vitality resisting heat, cold, moisture, decay, and often the process of digestion A short exposure at 212 degrees F.. or a longer continued heating at ISO degrees to. 170 degrees F., is sufficient to kill the germ. A piece of rare steak or roast, if from a tuberculous animal, may contain live germs capable of causing the disease in the person partaking of the meat Milk may be used with safety if heated for an hour at about 160 degrees F. Higher temperature would be better, but it coagulates the albumen, gives the milk a boiled taste, makes it less digestible, and tends to constipate. After having lived for many weeks in ice, the tubercle bacillus was found virulent on thawing. Since moisture and decay do not affect it wells, drinking troughs, and burial grounds (human and animal), in fact wherever tuberculous matter has been placed or exposed, are all liable to r'eeted. The manner in which the disease spreads from animal to animal and from animal lo the human being is very interesting and is worthy of consideration. It is transmissible from one animal to another through the medium of the respiratory, digestive, and sexual organs, anc the skin, and from animals to human beings by the use of milk, butter chwic, and flesh as an article of food. In order to be infected through the respiratory organs, the animal must be brought in close contact with others suffering from the disease Infection through -the digestive organs may arise from having tuberculous attendants, who unconsciously expectorate upon the hay or other food and this sputum, filled with hundreds of germs, enters the digestive organs of our cattle. It may also enter the digestive organs by allowing healthy animals to feed in troughs in which tuberculosus animals hav been fed. Infection through the skin is rare, and usually takes place through an abraded surface. </seg>

E'oms vary according to the parts affected. Mankind at - lorni generally shows it by failing health. Cattle, on trary, seldom give external evidences that they have the disease.

            <seg id="p233">233 REPORT OF THE VETFHIN I The animals, as Is well known, produce no sputum, so that, during their life, no tubercle bacilli get from them to the onter world by means of respiratory passages. Also in the excrement of tuberculous animals the bacilli appear to be only exceptionally present. On the contrary i is a fact that milk of tuberculous animals can cause infection. With the exception of this one way. therefore, (that is. through milk), the tuber culous virus can only have effect after the death of the animal and can only cause infection when the meat is "eaten. Iie same conditons hold for the milk of cows suffering from "perl - ." Before all things, if infection is to take place, it is nee wry the milk contain tubercle bacilli: but this appears to be the case when the milk glands themselves are affected with the disease. ng experiments have been made on puppies with milk from a tuber - s animal. The puppies were fed for five months with all the milk could drink, and upon post-mortem no signs of tuberculosis were I in any of them. Neither were nodules or bacilli found in the Infection in this case could not take place by the use of milk, as only the lungs and mesenteric glands were affected. Of fifty-two cow« which were treated with tuberculin the writer found tubercle bacilli in the milk of only two, and upon close examination these two were af - fected with tuberculosis of the udder. Recently Dr. Salmon, of the Bureau of Animal Industry, and his corps of workers have made some very extensive investigations with tuberculo - sis. Dr. Salmon's Bulletin No. 33. entitled "Relation of Bovine Tubercn losis to the Public Health." is a masterwork and demonstrates beyon the 4»ssibility of a doubt the infectiousness of bovine tuberculosis to th human being. The doctor has cited a number of cases which clearly sho that people have been infected by partaking of milk that contained tube ole bacilli. Therefore all cows should be tested and those reacting be - yond m and 3 degrees should be regarded as tuberculous, especially the udder is affected. In his Bulletin No. 44 he clearly setg forth th Infectionmess of the milk of cows, which have reacted to the tuberculi tmt, and shows conclusively that such cows are dangerous and shoal be destroyed, and furthermore that their milk should not be used. I another bulletin (No. 52). entitled "The Virulence of Human and Bovin Tubercle Bacilli for Guinea-Pigs and Rabbits," he shows that bot perms are capable of producing consumption in other animals, clear showing that animals affected with this disease are capable of infectin a whole herd and also the human family when consuming such milk. Frequent tests have been made among dairy cattle to ascertain the contagiousness of this disease. Some few years ago the writer was re - quested to examine an animal in a herd which the owner suspected to be affected with lump-jaw. Investigation proved the animal to be tuber - culous and it was destroyed. The post-mortem examination revealed an advanced stage of tuberculosis. This led to a test of the whole herd with tuberculin and two-thirds of the animals were affected. This clearly </seg>

Observation has convinced the writer that a large ty of the cows kept by private families in large cites are more or 'ected with this disease. TESTING CATTLE WITH TUBERCULIN. Tuberculin Is prepared by growing the tubercle bacillus in a pure culture until highly concentrated, and until a large amount of its ptomaines is developed. Carbolic acid and glycerine are then added, and th mixture is filtered through a porcelain platp to remove the germs. Thi filtered fluid is heated to a high temperature to destroy the vitality o any germs that might have passed the filter and is then evaporated a a low temperature in a vacuum until concentrated. It is diluted wit nine times its volume of a 1 per cent, solution of carbolic acid, and from 1 to 4 cc. is used for Injection. The tuberculin made by the Bureau o Animal Industry is put in 12 rr. bottles, and is used without betn diluted. The fluid is injected under the skin of the neck or shoulder wit a sterilized hypodermic syringe, the parts having been first disinfected. Ke reaction in tuberculous cattle following the injection of tuber - begins from six to ten hours after injection, reaches maximum one sen hours after injection, and returns to normal eighteen to twenty - iure after injection. The following is the procedure for testing animals: The normal tern perature is taken per rectum with a fever thermometer four times befor injecting tuberculin. About 2% cc. of tuberculin is injected beneat the skin by means of a hypodermic syringe. The region of the neck 1 preferable for this operation. It is desirable that ten to twelve hours should intervene between the injection of tuberculin and the subsequen taking of the temperatures. For this reason it is customary to inject th tuberculin at night and begin taking the temperatures early the next morning, say 6 o'clock. They are taken at intervals from two to fou hours, at least eight times during that day. If the animal is tuberculous one expects a rise of temperature of 2% or more degrees within twenty four hours. TUBERCULOSIS OF THE HOG. BT DR. H. JENBBN, ASSISTANT DEPUTY STATE VETERINARIAN. Iberculosis means an Infection with the tubercule bacilli in any part body, producing what in the human family is commonly known as tnption. This the most insidious of all diseases has become so ingly prevalent among our domestic animals that it has becom ary to familiarize the stockmen, as well as the general public the rapidly increasing danger of this disease: as it is now con ely demonstrated that this disease is communicable to the human r by consuming meat and milk from tuberculous animals. </seg>
            <seg id="p235">235 It may be of interest to look into the ways through which the animal may become infected, and also to learn how these infinitely small bacilli destroy life. Let us understand that the saliva, as well as the excrements. from all infected animals usually contains the bacilli in large numbers. Being dropped upon the ground, it is soon dried and scattered broadcast before the wind, thus infecting every living being in its way by in - haling the dust. The danger of infection through the consuming of tuberculosis meat and milk is even still greater. Cows apparently in the best of health may be badly diseased and endanger the lives of every one that uses milk, be it man or animal. In the larger cities the rf^mtr of infection through the consumption of diseased meat is not very great, owing to a very rigid system of meat inspection under the supervision of the Bureau of Animal Industry, but in the outlying districts where the meats are not inspected the danger of infection is great. I nave seen a beef in one of our country towns, offered for sale in a butcher shop, with generalized tuberculosis. I was present on a farm near this place last winter while butchering hogs, and found one hog afflicted with tubercu - losis. At first it was difficult to convince the people that any real danger existed, but after showing them the different diseased conditions they were only too glad to destroy the animal. L«t us follow this little bacillus and see how it develops and destroys life. A lot of hogs may have been fed on milk from cows afflicted with tuberculosis, the germ being ingested. It generally passes througn the stomach into the small intestines, where it may either locate or be absorbed and carried through the lymph stream to the different parts of the body; thus we find tubercu - lar deposits in lungs, liver, kidneys, heart, linings of the chest and abdominal cavities, and all the glandular structures. After finding a suitable location they at once begin to multiply themselves. Germs multi - ply by simply dividing into two; thus in a very short time the system may become literally filled with bacilli. The irritation caused by the motion of the bacillus and other pathological phenomena gives rise to a small nodule, in size from a millet-seed to a hemp-seed; this is what is known as a miliary tubercle. These miliary tubercles undergo did stages of degeneration: 'thus we find in the first stage they appear aa ■mall, hard, shiny elevations; in the next stage they have a grayish color and if cut into will be found to contain a cheesy mass; this is what is known as the stage of caseation. Now at this stage nature, in her effort to protect life, sometimes forms a wall of lime salts around this tubercle, and, so to speak, shuts the bacilli up within this wall and hinders their further destructive progress; this is what is known as the stage of calcification. If this last mentioned process does not take place these tubercles soon change from a cheesy mass into pus and then break and destroy the surrounding tissue. The blood vessels are, so to speak, eaten in two, causing excessive hemorrhages, and death soon ends the scene. When Kobert Koch, the renowned German pathologist, a few jmn ago declared that tuberculosis in man and that of the lower animals were two distinct diseases and not communicable to one another, the entire </seg>
            <seg id="p236">236 medical world was amazed. This assertion of Prof. Koch's, however, prompted several investigators to become clear on this point, and it is now proven beyond a doubt that Prof. Koch was wrong. I shall submit a few authentic reports absolutely proving this point. In the city of Philadelphia in a certain district the death rate from tuberculosis among children became so great as to call for an investigation, and it was found that the milk used in that district was furnished from a certain dairy; the cows were submitted to a tuberculin test and were all found to be badly affected. A grandson of Mr. Moody, the noted evangelist, died from tubercular meningitis; the infection was traced to the milk of two cows of whose milk the boy had drank and which proved on autopsy to be tuberculous. An aged couple in the east had a Jersey cow that was the pride of the household. They had retired from the farm and purchased this cow after coming to town. The old lady had remarked very often that she had a cow that gave the richest, yellowest cream of any cow in town. In a short time the old gentleman began to fail and died shortly from tubercular meningitis; the old lady fol - lowed him a short time afier, dying from tuberculosis scattered through I: her system. The cow was at once suspected and destroyed. Post - rtem examination revealed a tubercular udder, and the rich, yellow am, the old lady's pride, had a liberal amount of tubercular pus ted in with it. Now the assertion may be made that I have not kept my text. It became necessary, however, for me to allude to the cow tbe propagator of tubercle bacilli. Having seen how the disease is transmitted to man from the cow, we will now look up the records of swine tuberculosis. Very little interact was manifested in regard to the prevalence of swine tuberculosis until a few years ago, when it became so prevalent as to necessitate a very rigid investigation as to its source. In the year 1900 there were inspected at the different packing houses in the United States 23,428,996 hogs, of which numbri itire carcasses and 1,061 parts were condemned. In 1901, 2 hogs were inspected and 8,650 entire carcasses and 44 parts condemned. In '.11,781 hogs were inspected and 14,927 entire carcasses and 4,700 parts condemned. I have not seen the records for the last two years, but from the above figures there will be noticed an annual increase of nearly 100 per cent, a terrible increase. This loss from tuberculosis is greater than from any other disease. Nearly all of these condemned hogs came from dairy districts and had been fed on separator milk. The tuberculin test was applied to the cows in these icU and a great number were found to be tuberculous. The remark has often been made, when a person of seemingly good health would take ill and die from consumption, "There never was consumption in the fam - ily; 1 have known them for years." I wonder how he became infected. Are you still in doubt when you consider the frightful frequency of tuber - • is among the meat and milk producing animals in the country? How may I know a diseased animal or am I supposed to abstain from the use of meat or milk? To those of you living) in the city I should advise </seg>
            <seg id="p237">237 boiling your milk, as this effectually destroys all Infectious germs. Under our excellent system of meat inspection there is not much danger in the city of infection through the meat, especially if it is thoroughly cooked. In the country, however, the danger is greater; you have no meat or milk inspection; hence you are thrown entirely on your own resources and you should be sufficiently posted to differentiate between good and bad meat, and also know something about a suspicious milker. I will briefly attempt to give you an idea of the tuberculin test, what it is and what tt does for us. Tuberculin is an extract of bacilli of (rcuiosis in glycerine, and was at first intended as a cure for con - jtion, but this it failed to be; but its value as a diagnostic agent not be overestimated, for with this agent we can positively ascer - the presence of tuberculosis in the living animal. fie tuberculin test is performed in the following manner: The normal erature of the animal to be tested is ascertained, a certain amount e tuberculin is then injected under the skin, and if the temperature two degrees or more within twelve hours we know to a certainty the animal is tubercular. On general principles a cow thin in flesh, with a rough staring coat and an occasional cough should be regarded with suspicion. In hogs, however, it is impossible, as a rule, to discover any traces of II if sn during life, except sometimes swellings of the neck and legs. I am not prepared to say how reliable the tuberculin test is in swine; thus we may find a good thrifty porker badly diseased at butchering time. Now the following post-mortem conditions apply to both cattle and hogs: Examine the glands of the neck on each side of the windpipe to see whether they are enlarged and contain a yellowish, cheesy substance and whether the other glands of the carcass are similarly affected. Always cut into them. Examine the lungs, heart, the lining of the chest cavity, diaphragm, liver, and lining of the abdominal cavity for those little nodules, known as miliary tubercles, described earl) in my paper. Also examine the udder closely. Now you may not find in one animal all of these con - ditions mentioned, but only some of them. You rarely find all these con - ditions in one animal. Should you, however, be so unfortunate as to have tuberculosis in your herd, separate the suspected animals and have them tested, and promptly destroy all that re-act and burn the car- CMses, then thoroughly disinfect with hot formaline solution all feed boxes, watering troughs, mangers, stalls, etc. Any new animal added to your herd should be tested with tuberculin before being admitted to your place, or should be bought subject to test, then, with proper feed - ing, in good buildings with proper sanitary surroundings, we may live to see the day when tuberculosis will be a thing of the past. </seg>

I will reduce my report to simply show the work done during the period covered, and the financial report of the condi - tions of the department, omittne commentations and recommendations for future work. I point with pride to the fact that during the year and a half I have had charge of the department not a single newspaper criticism has come to my notice. On the contrary, the press has treated us with courtesy and many times have we been commended for the manner in which tha affairs of the department was conducted.

On account of the funds for the department being bunched, I cannot tell exactly how much money was used for this branch of the department during the period covered by this report, but can safely estimate that the receipts exceeded the expenditure over $3,000. 8UMMABT OF THE WOBK OK THE DEPARTMENT.

REPAIRS AND IMPROVEMENTS Hatching house raised up, part of the foundation and sills renewed. • sitait'd the tearing off about four feet siding clear around the building and the piecing out of most of the studding and joints, and re- quired new siding to replace that torn off. Some repairs were made to the floor, and both the interior and exterior of the building painted. The dwelling has undergone extensive repairs, including a new veranda on the east side, and being newly papered inside and painted outside. The barn and sheds were raised up, new sills added, barn floor renewed, new •tails and mangers, barn reshingled and painted, including the driving shed. Ice house reshingled, likewise the shop and spring house, and exterior of all three buildings painted. For the first time since their construction, the roofs of all buildings at the Hatcheries were painted, adding much to their neat appearance and durability. A new board walk laid around the hatching house, and the bridge over the culvert in front of Hatchery rebuilt. The circular picket fence around dwelling taken down and rebuilt from the dwelling to barn, a new plank retaining wall put in around goldfish pond, and the plank retaining wall on the east side of </seg>
            <seg id="p245">245 hatching house rebuilt. A new landing platform erected in the pike pond, and two plank cribs built in the upper trout ponds; additional seats and tables and closets and hitching racks erected in grove (or convenience of visitors; new picket gates at the west entrance and the at east entrance to grounds rebuilt; ten rods of new fence and hundred new posts put in fence around fishery grounds; roads leading to grove and barn graded down; three hundred feet of new supply pipe laid from second stone dam to bulk trout hatching troughs in hatchery; a new plank drain box, large enough to permit mud and leaves to be flushed out of lower trout ponds, put through enibaukinent near public road; new two-inch drain pipe from lower tier of ponds to I'latte river; underbrush cleared off several acres between public road and Flatte river; new telephone wire strung across old river bridge, and Hat boat constructed to transfer fish over the river; tweity ten-gallon iug cans; eigut twemy-gallou snipping tubs, and twenty thirty-gallon tanks have been added to the shipping equipment. One 100-foot and one 75-foot seine, eighteen fine mesh nets and three minnow nets have bean purchased for handling different sized fish, also eight sectional live boxes for holding live fish, a new McCormick mowing machine, and an oscillating air pump and connections installed on the fish car. New fulcrum and bottom rods, high speed brake attachment and air signal, erne new set of wheels and new smoke jacks, also interior of fish car painted ;.nd varnished; new waste screens placed in twelve of the ponds, and a large amount of mud, leaves and moss removed from all the ponds. One hundred 1. ing nays and needed repairs to hatching troughs and aquariums. Repairs to windmill, including new copper pump, linings for pumps. All work in making repairs and improvements done by regular employes, except repairs to fish car. BLACK BASS Thirty-nine thousand fry aud 2X.475 flugerling bass were planted. This number has not t een sufficient to supply the demand, which increases year, bi. -ems to be well defined limitations to the number of bass that can be produced in such ponds as we have. About the only way to supply the demand will be to plant a larger number of fry, or lease or construct additional ponds. Some nice strings of bass have been taken the past summer from Cut-off lake, Douglas county; ,tl and Jackson lakes, Dakota county; Saunders lake and Elkhorn ■ lar river, in Nance and Wheeler 'counties, and Lodge Pole creek in Deuel and « counties, as well as many other points over the state. At every point where the conditions are favor - ihis king of game fish is holding his own, but the growing sea of the bass, and the high pri ommand on the market, make them a special target for law breakers, who take many chances to secure them, in my opinion, a long step towards their preservation would be the absolute prohibition of their sale at all seasons of the year. </seg>
            <seg id="p246">246 ROCK BASS. Only 1,200 rock bass, six months old, have been planted, and from what I learn from observation and inquiry, these fish are not proving as successful as the black bass, or crappies. The breeding stock in the fry ponds aie very healthy, but their growth is extremely slow, and I deem it unadvisable to attempt to extend their culture. CRAPPIES. Almost if these excellent pan fish have been planted. No flsh introduced into our waters, with the exception of the carp, have n as successful as the crappie. They appear to be equally well adapted to the muddy water of eastern and southern Nebraska, as to the clear water in the central and western part of the state. Ten years ago one was rarely taken, except in a few lakes and ponds bordering the Missouri river, subject to overflow, but as a result of the State Hatch - supplemenied with a few small plants made by the National Fish Commission, they are now distributed over practically the entire state. The excessive rainfall of the past three seasons caused the most of the streams to overflow their banks and has introduced the crappie in many localities not directly stocked by the Commission. They are a prolific breeder, and in some lakes already outnumbering all other game fish. For some cause that I have not yet been able to fathom, they seem to propagate better in murky than clear water, and apparently the carp do not disturb their spawn, as I had better success the past season with i appie spawn. TS placed in an almost barren pond with carp than with those placed in a clear water pond where the vegetation and insect life was abundant. Further experiments along this line will be made the ing summer. STRIPED PERCH Sixteen thousand five hundred and 13,350 perch were planted, nearly the entire number in 1903. Either the change in temperature or the excessive number of crayfish in the perch pond last spring caused the failure. We do not handle the eggs artificially, but allow the perch to spawn naturally on brush underlaid with sand or gravel. About the usual number of eggs were deposited, but the eggs were either affected by the sudden changing temperature or the crayfish. As I was absent at Bay City .collecting pike eggs, I did not notice the trouble until too late to remedy. They spawn late in March or early in April, soon after the ice melts off the ponds. While at Bay City, Mich., I collected five pairs of the Great Lakes yellow perch and shipped them by express to South Bend. Five came through alive, but on account of rough handling, and the eggs being almost ripe in the flsh, they did not hatch, but I shall K another attempt the coming spring getting the spawning fish earlier hope better success will attend, as the perch have proven well ed to our waters. </seg>
            <seg id="p247">247 RAINBOW TROUT. Three hundred and forty-six thousand fry, 6.450 flngerlings, and yearlings was the output of this variety. Of the total number, the United States Fish Commission furnished practically all the flnger - linga and yearlings; also 100.000 eggs. I regret to report that owing to a gill disease that appeared among our breeding stock in the hatchery ponds in February. 1904. we sustained a loss of about 800 of our brood fish: hut fortunately we 8*111 have an ample number left to collect at least 150.000 from the coming February and March. There is an eTer - inoreasing demand that the trout streams be stocked with flngerlings. or yearlings fish instead of fry: and it must be admitted In streams that are subject to spring freshets the flngerlings have made a much - showing than the frv planting. Encouraging reports come from nearly every vicinity where the rainbow trout have been planted. BOOK TROUT IJwing to the small stock of spawners in our ponds, they having ded - pd by disease In 1S95. and again in 1900. our output was somewhat ailed. 292.000 frv. 3.750 flngerlings and ROfl yearlings being planted — flngerlings and yearlings being furnished by the United States Fish mission: also 50,000 eyed eggs. We also purchased 100.000 eggs from •ivate hatchery. Wp now have about 2.000 yearlings in the ponds, these will be available for stripping in the fall of 1905. which will, jpe. enable us to collect enoueh eggs to supply all reasonable de - ds. While the brook trout have thrived fairly well, they seem not e as well adapted to our open prairie streams as the rainbows. BROWN TROUT E&gt;m a few brown trout spawners held in the ponds for exhibition state fair we have follected about 40.000 eggs in the past two s. They were planted with the rainbow trout and counted as No effort is being made to extend their culture, as experience has the rainbow and brook trout best adapted to our streams. WATX-EYKT) PTKE Eighteen million nine hundred fifty-six thousand fry and 300 flnger - lings were planted the past two season?. tb&lt;» eggs being collected as usual from the spawning grounds on Saglnaw bay. Lake Huron. I hare ex - perimented for several years in an endeavor to rear a part of the pike to flngerllng or yearling size before distributing them, but I have been unable to discover anv food on which they would thrive except live min - nows, and the expense and time required in breeding minnows in ponds or seining them from the Platte river is too great to make the rearing of pike either practical or profitable. They are exceedingly cannibalistic. 8nd when the supply of minnows In the ponds become low they do not </seg>
            <seg id="p248">248 hesitate to swallow their smaller, or weaker, brethren. If our fish laws are to remain as stringent as at present. I question the wisdom of con - tinning the hatching of pike on a scale as extensive as we have in the past. Comparatively few pike are taken with rod and line. Whether this is mused from the fact that most of our streams teem with myriads of the minnow family, or on account of the murky condition of the water in the streams. I am unahle to decide: hut it is noticeable that about the 'Imp they afford any angling in Nebraska is just before the Jnne rise and in October before the ice begins to form, when the water is "omparatively f^nr. As an evidence that the pike is worked successful. but are not belne caught under present conditions. I will cite one example. Not more than a doren nike have been taken with rod and line at Ashland, the past summer, from Salt creek or Clear creek, yet Deputy Biggerstaff. while seininc for carp and Buffalo fish, in a few hauls In November, caught over 200 with a seine from these streams. Thev weighed from one to three pounds each, and the number would doubtless run Into the thousand* had the mesh of the seine been fine enough to take immature fish. Some nic? strings of pike have been caught from Crystal lake. Dakota countv. the past summer, with rod and line, but from an aneier's standpoint the returns from the pfke hatching has not been a success, and. under our present law. not eom - mensnratp with the money that is being put in their propagation. CHANNEL CATFISH Twenty-two thousand two hundred vearltngs and 23.440 elghteen - months-old catfish have been planted during the period covered by this report. They were practically all taken from the Platte river with fyke acts during April and May in the sprinsr. and September and October in the fall. As the catfish is our most numerous native fish, the benefits to be derived from transplanting them into lakes and streams not now stocked with them, or where, owing to millions of other obstructions, the fish cannot distribute themselves in nature's way, cannot. I think, be questioned. Quite a number have been furnished for farm ponds, yet the state furnishes them to pond-owners at a nominal price, and at the age and siee when there is no further danger of their dying from natural causes, and they can be cheaply fed on almost any kind of grain or vegetable which trout, bass and crappie will not subsist upon. Catfish planted in Armour's artificial lake at Memphis In the spring of 1898 were seined out In August, 1903. and specimens taken would average about nrne pounds. They would weigh about five ounces each when planted. No young channel catfish were found in the lake, thus showing there had been no increase. Gratifying reports as to the success of plant* made in mill-ponds and small streams at many points are on file at the hatcheries. </seg>
            <seg id="p249">249 YELLOW BULLHEADS. Sixteen thousand five hundred and ninety have been planted. Those of 1!&gt;' hed and reared in our ponds, at the hatcheries, the major portion of the output the present year being secured from an overflow-pond that was about to dry up a few miles east of La Plane. Sarpy county. Like the catfish, the bullhead is a good practical fish for pond culture. They can be fed on any kind of grain, or table scraps. and when not disturbed by other fish, are prolific breeders. It will prob many of our to know that the yellow bullhead commands a higher price at fishing points on the Great Lakes than the wail-eyed pike, yet such is the case, and the supply is unequal to the demand. Many people confuse the little black bull-head which is found all over the state, and rarely ever attain a weight of over six ounce*, with the yellow bullhead. The latter weighs as high as a pound and a half, and will average when full grown at least a pound. If more private ponds were stocked with the bullhead instead of the high-toned trout or bass, we would have less failures to chronicle in this branch of flab SUNFISH. Two thousand and four hundred were planted from the hatchery ponds, .■rottably as many more distributed that were secured from overflow - l, and li- tish. Many lakes and ponds in the eastern s« or fifteen years ago, were well ■d with sunnsh are a pleted, and restocking will essary to keep up the supply.

            <seg id="p250">250 Ttaey communicated their find to a man who made a business of fishing In the Missouri river, and a few days before the pond froze to the bottom, when the carp were all crowded to one spo". he removed the ice and took out more than 4,000 pounds of marketaDle carp, while thousands of immature fish were left to perish. During April, 1904, Chief ued a permit to special Deputy H. H. Biggerataff to carp and Buffalo fish from Salt creek, near Ashland. He reports having taken 6,660 carp averaging two pounds weight, or 13,100 pounds of carp. At present prices they should have sold for over $900 and those taken out of the overflow-pond at La Platte nearly $300, making i for carp taken just at two points. These catches of carp were both made within a few miles of the hatchery, and can be substantiated by iiiauy reputable citizens. I merely cite these instances to prove the growing commercial value of the much maligned carp in our waters. GOLDFISH. Five thousand three hundred and nine colored gold, silver and pearl fish :&gt;een disposed of, and nearly half the income derived from fish sales is from this source. The excessive rains and cloudy weather the past three seasons have not been favorable for goldfish culture, as but a small per cent of those hatched have colored and a large number of the uncolored has been utilized as food for the bass and trout. They are of no value as a table fish, but as a revenue producer more than pay for the trifling cost of their production. SEINING OVERFLOW-PONDS. Owing to the excessive rainfall of the past two years many streams owed their banks, and as a result large numbers of fish were left in shallow ponds when the water receded to its normal level. Quite a number of requests came in to have these ponds seined and fish returned to the streams. All these were investigated, and where fish of sufficient value were discovered the ponds were seined, but lack of funds prevented this work from being prosecuted in a thorough manner. About 2,000 sand pike were secured out of ponds near Plattsmouth, and about 5,000 miscellaneous fish at other points. If the carp, buffalo fish and bullheads had been seined out of the ponds investigated in a systematic manner, it would have required the services of a crew of three or four men and the fish car at. least three or four months each year, and with the limited funds at my disposal I could not incur this expense, although there is not a doubt of the value and feasibility of this work. The State Fish Commission of Iowa depends entirely on seining the overflow-ponds along the Mississippi river for fish to stock interior waters; and the state of Illinois and Minnesota also get their bass and crappie to stock interior waters from the same source. </seg>
            <seg id="p251">251 REPORT Oh FISH CAR. About $300 has been spent in repairs and improvements on the fish car during the biennial period, including the aerating pump and con - nections, and about the same amount of expenditure will be required the next two years. In April, 1904, the Union Pacific railroad established a rule that no more coaches with cast-iron wheels would be attached to their passenger trains. As a result, we traveled over this line the last trip on a freight train, and it will now be necessary to have the ear equipped with steel or compressed paper tired wheels. A gasoline motor should also be installed to operate the air pump, and the exterior of the car should be painted and varnished. STATE FAIR FISH EXHIBIT The usual fish exhibit by the Commission was made at the state fairs of T9O3 and 1904: among the special attractions at the last fair being an albino catfish, large silver catfish, and specimens of deformed trout and ear-fish. I understand an effort will be made to induce the legislature to appropriate $5,000 to build a suitable fish exhibit building. This is certainly needed, as the present building is discreditable to both the fair grounds and the state. I also think we ought to ask an increased amount for the collection, installing and maintaining the fish exhibit. The amount now allowed for this display is about equal to the second purse in pacing race, which proves an attraction for about fifteen minutes, while the fish display Is a drawing card from the time the gates open to the close of the fair, and I see no reason why the Commission should longer continue to spend money out of the hatchery funds In making this display. STOCKING PRIVATE WATERS. A marked decrease In the demand for fish has been evidenced since the present law has been in effect, imposing a charge for fish for this purpose. I think pon&lt;1 fish culture should be encouraged, but the free distribution of fish, regardless of the kind of water to be stocked, has largely been a prolific source of waste. The assertion of theorists, and I regret to say some fish culturists, that trout, bass, pike and crappie can be profitably reared In small ponds by those inexperienced in this line of work is pure claptrap. Where one man has made even a moderate success, at least one hundred have made failures. A great many people have the erroneous Impression that all that Is necessary is to scoop ont a hole that will hold water, get a few small fish, and dump them in, and your fish supply is assured. But experience, in many cases dearly paid for, proves that fish will not thrive in a small barren pond without food or attention than will the farmer's hogs or poultry thrive on Nebraska ozone. If the ponds are properly constructed, and an intelligent selection of fish is made that are suitable to the water to be stocked, supplemented with reasonable care and food, success, in most cases, will attend the same </seg>
            <seg id="p252">252 Ii other undertakings, but in no other event. The kinds of flsh beat d to farm pond culture is carp, bullheads, channel catfish, buffalo and sunflsh. in about the order named. These all can be fed on t the same kind of food as is given to hogs and poultry, while bass. , crapple, perch and pike, require minnows, crayfish, insect, or a meat ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF THE STATE FISH CULTURE The question is often asked. Does fish culture pay? Is the net resul commensurate with the cost? The people who entertain doubts on th point are. as a rule, not of the ignorant class by any means, but thos who have not taken the time, or had the opportunity to familiarize themselves with what has been accomplished. Much evidence can be readily produced to show that state flsh culture has been of immense benefit, and the result from the plants of some species are so apparen that It would be almost as ridiculous to question them as to discuss th v or value of agriculture. According to the United States geologica y. Nebraska has G.485 miles of streams and 11.160 acres of lakes, an the greater part of this water has. at various times, been stocked by tl '•ommission. but under existing laws it is impossible to collect statist! to prove the value in dollars and cents of the flsh caught. Prior no carp existed in Nebraska, hut no one can possibly question tl •access of the introduction. The same is true of the rainbow trout, an( to a leaser extent, the brook trout. The limits of production of th latter species are somewhat curtailed by the lack of suitable wate adapted to their cultivation, but no state in the Union has produce finer specimens of trout than has been taken from the spring streams Wobtern Nebraska. The bass, crappie and perch have done equally we when placed in suitable waters With the pike and channel catfish it ■tore difficult to determine what has been accomplished, as they a native to our state: likewise the bullheads and sunflsh. One thing that is very noteworthy to all who have had the time or ta.ken the trouble to investigate is that the kinds. of flsh that are not receiving the benefit of propagation and distribution by this Commission a wonderful decrease, especially the pickerel and buffalo flsh. Twenty rears ago the waters of this state were alive with both species. To-day the pickerel, with the exception of a few localities in the sand-hills, are extinct, and the buffalo fish is decreasing at a remarkable rate. E outlined in my last report, it was my intention in the past two to make a systematic examination of lakes and streams that had stocked with various kinds of fish, but the imposition of a charge andling the fish car by the railroads absorbed all the allowance aveling expenses in the regular work of fish distribution, and this •t had to be abandoned. </seg>

A new cement floor is urgently needed in the hatching house. This will necessitate the tearing off of the two large nursery tanks and re- building of same, as well as several supply and hatching troughs. The building will also have to he reshingled and repainted, interior and ex- terior. True economy would consist in tearing down the present hatchery and the erection on its site of a one-story sandstone building, which material we have in an abundance on the state grounds here. This kind of building would last a lifetime, would cost less to heat, and would pat an end to the endless expense of repairing the present barn-like frame 'ure. The fish car shed will have to be torn down and rebuilt at boom point, not yet selected, in Sarpy county. A gasoline motor should be purchased to operate the air pump on the fish car, and the car should have an entire new set of wheels, and be painted and varnished, Interior and exterior. The dwelling, barn and sheds, ice house, shop and spring house should all be repainted. During the coming two years considerable repairs will be needed to the two lower stone dams. Some new drain and supply pipes, new curbing and flumes for the windmill are needed. The ponds should be deepened, embankments strengthened, and sodded. Fifty new shipping cans, twelve new shipping tubs, and a new work team, harness and wagon, the present team having passed the age of usefulness, should be furnished.

            <seg id="p255">255 CONCLUSION. We have labored under discouraging conditions in the operation of the hatcheries the past two years, mainly as a result of the complete destruc- tion of the old wagon bridge across the Flatte river, at this point, in the spring of 19U2, compelling us to load the fish car and haul all supplies from Gretna and Lmiavile, a distance of nine miles. Fortunately these conditions will not continue, as the Lincoln and Omaha interurban railroad will cross Sarpy county within three miles of the hatchery, and the Rock island system will build a spur to the stone quarries within one-half mile of the hatchery, thus giving us better shipping facilities. Notwithstanding the handicaps we have labored under, the hatcheries have been improved and the number of fish planted will compare favorably with the work of former years. W. J. O'Brien.

            <seg id="p271">271 NEBRASKA DAIRY INDUSTRY BT 8. C. BAS8ETT. SECRETARY NEBRASKA DAIRY ASSOCIATION. Ki growth and development of the dairy industry in the states has, past two years, been somewhat remarkable in view of the fact that ka has been a dairy state for many years, creameries having been shed in the eastern portion of the slate more than twenty years ago. ordini? to the statistical returns of the United States Depar ment of Agriculture, Nebraska had, in (he year 1903. 649,839 milch cowb valued at $17,240,229: in the year 1904. there were 669.334 milch cowt valued at $17,288,897, an increase in the number of milch cows o 19,495, or 3 per cent. As secretary of the Nebraska Dairymen's Asso ciation, statistics are gathered each year of the amount of creamer butter manufactured; in 1903 the amount thus manufactured (by cream - eries) was 16.158.298 pounds, and in 1904 21.646,270 pounds, an increas ■-87,976 pounds, or 29 per cent — a considerable increase when w take into account the fact that there was very little increase, in th number of milch cows, only 3 per cent. It is also interesting to note that this increase comes when there has been abundant grain crops and price* for the same above the average, such conditions, abundant crops an higher prices having a tendency to decrease rather than increase th number of those engaged in dairying. This increase is largely due to two causes of factors. First, the passage by congress of the so-called "gou bill" which increased the tax on oleo to ten cents per pound for tha colored yellow, in imitation of butter, and reduced the tax on the nn - colored oleo from two cents per pound to one-fourth of one cent per pound. While the passage of this law has not materially increased th of butter it has given a stability to the dairy industry which before the passage of the law was lacking, the previous increase in the man ufacture and sale of oleo or imitation butter threatening to entirely d stroy the dairy industry, causing many dairymen to quit the business ant discouraged others from engaging in It. The second, the greatest causa of the increase in dairying has been the introduction of the ham separator. With the establishment of the creamery system of dair ing came the use of deep cans or palls for setting the milk to sep - arate the cream. In the use of these deep cans the best results con only be obtained by setting the cans of milk in ice-colfl water, an as most farmers could not or would not store ice for this purpose the common practice was to set the cans of milk in a tank of wate drawn from the well, which was, at the best, at a temperature of 5 ■es F.. instead of 35 degrees needed for securing all the butter-fa in the milk. The analysis of hundreds of samples of skimmed milk proved most conclusive that in the deep can setting of milk, on an average o </seg>
            <seg id="p272">272 NEBRASKA STATE BOABD OF AGRICULTURE. 25 per cent, or one-fourth of the butter-fat in the whole milk was left In the skim-milk: that is, that while in 100 pounds of milk as drawn from the cow there is an average of about four pounds of butter-fat, by the deep can system only an average of three pounds were recovered, and one pound. 25 per rent, was left in the skimmed milk. Lest some may think this statement of loss too high it might be said that two of the most ienced dairymen in the state. F. H. Vaughn, of Dodge county, and Temple, of Lancaster county, both of whom had used the deep can and separator systems, stated at a meeting of the Nebraska Dairymen's Association that the use of the hand separator instead of the deep can system had increased their butter yield at least 15 per cent. As both of these men had used some ice in the deep can system it is no exaggera - tion to say that the average dairyman can save 25 per cent more of 'fat from the milk of his cows by the use of the hand separator as compared with either the shallow pan or deep can system. Tn fact a good hand separator, properly handled, takes all the butter-fat out of the milk, there being left only about one-tenth of one per cent, one-tenth of milk as compared with one-fourth of the whole 25 per cent. As the loss under a pound of butter-fat in 100 pounds of the old system fell en - tirely upon the dairyman, and as no business can flourish or even long where one-fourth of the product is allowed to go to waste, the result was that while numerous creameries were established over the state none of them were in a flourishing condition. Patrons dropped off and the dairy industry was at a standstill. Then came the hand separator and ival of the Industry, an Increase of 29 per cent in the past year as r-ompared with the year previous. About one year ago Prof. A. L. Haecker. of our State Experiment Station, secured some statistics as to the num - ber of hand separators in the state, finding the number to be approximately 20.000; and doubtless there are approximately 25,000 in use in the state at this date. The use of the hand separator has resulted In the develop - ment of dairying in the western or range portion of the state where before se no one thought of milking any more cows than necessary to supply the needs of the family. Starting March 24. the Burlington ran an alfalfa, dairy and soil culture ■pedal over its lines in western Nebraska, giving an opportunity to study the dairy industry in that part of the state at close range, to see the country and meet the people engaged in the business. The start was made from Ravenna, in Buffalo county. At Ravenna is the headquarters of the Ravenna Creamery Company, which made more than 800,000 pounds of creamery butter in 1904. Buffalo county has 985 square miles and about 11,000 milch cows. There is not a business center in the county in which there is not a cream receiving station and the shipments of cream amount to thousands of dollars' worth each month. Custer county has 2,595 square miles and more than 15,000 milch cows, and dairying is fast becoming one of the principal industries. The raising of macaroni wheat is interesting the people of the western portion of the state and it was interesting to learn that a flouring mill in Broken Bow. </seg>
            <seg id="p273">273 NEBRASKA DAIRY INDUSTRY. r county, has a contract to furnish an eastern firm 10,000 barrels of macaroni wheat flour. Grant county is in the range section, has 760 square miles and less than 1,000 milch cows, yet considerable cream shipments are made. Box Butte, with 1.078 square miles, has over 5,000 milch cows and also furnishes large shipments of cream.

The value of the hay and forage crop of the United Slates may best be presented by reciting a few facts taken from the agricultural statis- tics given in the Report of the Twelfth Census, where it is shown that in 1899, out of a total valuation for all crops of $2,910,138,663, the value of the hay and forage crop was $4- per cent. The value of this crop is greater than that of any other, with the single ex- n of corn, which had a valuation that year of $82- From the same sour at out of a total valuation of all crops grown in Nebraska in 1899, the forage crop was worth $11.2X0.901. or 12.2 per cent.

DURATION. Perennial*. — This group includes those plants which live more than one year. The forage plants under consideration are all herbs, of which most of the portion above ground dies during winter, but the roots liv* and throw up new shoots the following spring. For most purposes It is manifestly an advantage that a crop should yield returns year after year without the expense of reseeding. On the other hand, the a yield of forage the first season is almost always less with a perennial than with an annual, and furthermore, a perennial may not lend itself a most desirable rotation. The important perennial forage crop* braska are alfalfa, clover, brome-grass. timothy and bluegraas. Some of these, such as timothy and clover, are known as short-lived per - ennials: that is, as a crop they tend to disappear in two or three years to such an extent that they need reseeding. This is also true of such grasses as Italian rye-grass. </seg>

Common examples of this p are the grains, corn, sorghum, millet, cowpea. soy bean and rape.

Where irea is unfenced ami consists of native vegetation it is called open e, or simply range. In some parts of the United especially southern states, the range consists of forest, but in Nebraska the e is the unfenced portion of the Oreat Plains region, the vegeta - consisting of native grasses. The subject of the range w'll be idered in another part of this bulletin. Ethe ordinary and popular sense pasture refers to fenced areas of e or cultivated perenn'al forage crops upon whi'-h stock feeds at All the perennial forage plants are used for this purpose, although 'a anO clover must I e used with caution in order to prevent bloating. Bnother important class of -&lt;-ial ly where land is rela - ys valuable and a more intensive system of agriculture is employed, it of temporary or annual pastures. In winter-whrat regions it is a common practice to pasture the grain drrfng favoraHe portions of the fall and winter. In this case the pasturing is incidental. On the other hand it is a not uncommon prac - o sow wheat or, more frequently, rye in the fall for pasture pur - poses alone, a crop of grain, if secured at all, being secondary. Tem - porary pastures are used for two purposes. (1) To extend the pasture season over a greater portion of the year than can be done with ordi - nary permanent pasture. For this purpose wheat or rye give early and la'e pasture, and certain summer annuals can be used to supplement erm-.npnt pastures during the dry summer season, which usually s in July or August. ( 2 ) By successive sowing of the proper plants lent feed may be provided through the season so as to yield a maximum crop from each area. This is particularly applicable to dairy It is often convenient and economical in growing a succession nt crops to cut the green feed and supply the stock either in the permanent r^sture or in the stalls or yards, as will be referred to under soiling.

The advantage of soiling is the : with pasturing upon the same field, as from trampling. This is especially ■ irse fodders, such as corn and sorghum. Other advantages of minor importance are that by soiling the rations of animals may be definitely controlled, that fodder may be taken from fields a part for other purposes, and that this method avoids in pasturing the fields of subdividing them by erecting permanent or temporary fences. The great disadvantage of soiling Is </seg>

Near cities, where Ian able, it often pays to have such a suc - cession which, combined with silage during the winter, will give green feed the entire year.

Alfalfa The well-known perennial legume alfalfa (Medicago tativa) is the most valuable forage plant grown in Nebraska. Every effort should be made to extend the culture of this plant to all parts of the state. Being a legume it is highly nutritious: being a perennial it produces a permanent meadow; being palatable it is relished by all kinds of stock. Although valuable as a pasture plant it is not entirely suited to this purpose. Close pasturing is likely to kill it out in spots. The great value of alfalfa lies in the production of hay. The reader is referred to Farmers' Bulletin 1, United States Department of Agriculture, for details in regard to this plant. I may be briefly remarked here, however, that in growing alfalfa the id should be well prepared, as free as possible from weeds, and the should be sown when the soil is in favorable condition for germina- The seed should be sown alone at the rate of about 20 pounds per broadcast or, better, in drills. Where possible Nebraska-grown seed d be used, or at least seed grown under about the same conditions. COOl'EBATIVF. EXPERIMENTS WITH ALFALFA. Eess Bulletin No. 16 of the Nebraska Experiment Station, entitled Ifa Experiences." gives the following summary of results obtained owers of alfalfa in that state: During the winter of 1902 a list of between 600 and 700 successful alfalfa raisers in this state was collected, and to each was sent a report blank calling for a definite statement regarding a number of the pro - cesses he employed in obtaining his stand of alfalfa, and also regarding his subsequent care of the crop. More than 500 satisfactory replies were ved. representing 80 counties in the state. A study of this large number of reports from successful alfalfa raisers gives some valuable rmation respecting alfalfa culture. There were 288 stands reported upon upland, and 273 upon bottom land. Even in the western portion of the state the amount of alfalfa on the upland is shown to be considerable, and very satisfactory results are ntly obtained, although naturally the yields of hay are smaller than on the bottom lands of that region. In the eastern part of the state somewhat heavier yields appear to be obtained from bottom land, but loss winter killing or other cause is greater. Twenty-three reports state that upland is more satisfactory than bottom land. These come principally from the eastern portion of the state or the irrigated land of the western </seg>

            <seg id="p295">295 An astonishing feature of the replies is the large amount of alfalfa that they show to be growing on land with a clay subsoil. Sandy clay, clay loam, clay and lime, etc., were not counted as clay. In spite of this limitation, 245 clay or gumbo subsoils are reported. A clay or even a gumbo subsoil does not appear to be a barrier to successful alfalfa Eie seed bed was prepared by plowing and further working in 373 , and by disking or cultivating in 75. Among the latter Is one method appears to be popular and satisfactory. This consists in thoroughly disking corn land after all trash has been removed from the field. In the western part of the state there are a number of good stands of alfalfa, obtained by breaking prairie sod, disking it, and harrowing In the seed. Also by disking the unbroken sod and harrowing in the seed. The latter commends itself as an easy way of supplementing the native grasses In pastures. The tendency to dispense with plowing on unirrigated land uses with the distance westward from the Missouri. A study of the dates of sowing alfalfa seed in the spring shows a range from early March to late June, although where advice was volunteered it was practically unanimous in favor of early sowing. There were only 8 reports of summer or fall sowing, of which 1 was sown in July, 4 in August, and 3 in September. In 108 cases a nurse crop was used, while in 393 cases the alfalfa teed was sown without that of any other crop. The use of the nurse crop was largely confined to extreme eastern Nebraska and the Irrigated land of the west. Many persons who used a nurse crop say that they would not do so again. It has been recommended to use a light seeding of small grain, sown earlier or with the alfalfa, to prevent damage by severe winds. Khen sown in this way the nurse crop is mown when 8 or 10 inches high, prevent it smothering the alfalfa. In 55 cases the seed was put in with a drill, and in 447 cases it was sown broadcast. This is at least an indication that if a drill is not avail - able a satisfactory stand can be obtained by broadcasting and harrowing in, provided the other conditions are favorable. b There were 138 reports of less than 20 pounds of seed per acre being d, and 336 reports of 20 pounds or more being sown.

E persons having practiced disking alfalfa in the spring or at other 138 report that beneficial results have been obtained, while 7 that disking has been ineffective or injurious. By disking alfalfa tut going over it in the spring with a disk harrow before growth or during summer immediately after cutting for hay. It is cus - tomary to set the disk at a slight angle. This cuts the crown root and stirs the soil. Some of the correspondents prefer harrowing to disking. Where positive objection was made to disking, it was based on the claim that it caused the crowns to become diseased. The great bulk of the evidence was. however, in favor of disking. Of the persons who have manured alfalfa, either by plowing in the manure immediately before seeding or by spreading it on the field after a stand had been obtained, 110 obtained beneficial results, and 13 found it to be ineffective or injurious. Objections are based on the claim that plowing in manure causes the soil to dry out, but objections to spreading manure on alfalfa are rather indefinite in their nature, except that on low land it makes the growth too rank, and the alfalfa falls down. Many of those who advocate its use specify that the manure should be rotted and fine. One man suggests harrowing after spreading, to fine it. The </seg>

ALFALFA SEED FBOM DIFFERENT 6OUBCKS. Turkestan Alfalfa. — One plot of one-fifth acre was sown alone with pounds of seed April 8, 1901. There was a good stand and no loss fro winter killing in 1901-2 or 1902-3, thus showing its superiority in re spect to hardiness during the winter. On the other hand, this plot was injured by the wet weather in the summers of 1902 and 1903 to a great i than common alfalfa. On June 12, 1903, a crop of hay was obtained ling 605 pounds (3,025 pounds per acre), and a second crop o IS, weighing 500 pounds (2,500 pounds per acre), making 2.75 tons of hay per acre, besides fall pasturage. It was noted that this pi© started one week earlier in the spring than the ordinary alfalfa, but d not continue growth so late in the autumn. At no time did it grow so tall as ordinary alfalfa, but the stand was much thicker, and there ap - peared to be less tendency for the crowns to become large and crowd ou weaker plants, as is the case with ordinary alfalfa. As compared with the latter the leaves and especially the stems are smaller. I. second plot, one-tenth acre,* drilled in rows 6 inches apart May 24, i gave a good stand, with no loss from winter killing the first year yielded 215 pounds of hay (2,150 pounds per acre) on June 17, 1899. third year the yields of hay from one-eighth acre were as follows: 14, 515 pounds; July M. Ml pounds: August 20, 305 pounds, or a for the season of 5.64 tons per acre. In 1901 the yield on the one-eighth acre was: June 5, 645 pounds; .inly 19, 160 pounds; August ,&gt;ounils; a total of 3.22 tons per acre. &lt;2 the yield on June 9 was 445 pounds; in 1903, June 11, 475 pounds. 23, 3G5 pounds; a total of 3.34 tons per acre.

The results show that there Is little difference in the yield tinder the different treatments, and that there Is no advantage In planting alfalfa In rows and cultivating It. at least under the conditions at the Nebraska Station. The Individual plants tend to grow larger and the stems fall over, filling the srmee between the rows.

The light seed yielded of 2,500 pounds per acre, and the heavy seed at the rate of per acre. The notes made at the time show that both plots the first year, but the second year there was a much thinner plot from light seeds. To test the effect of seeding at different times plots of common and Turkestan alfalfa were sown by drilling and by broadcasting from spring till fall, in 1902, on the following dates: March 10, March 24. April 8, April 21. May 7. May 19. August 7. August 19. September 15. October 1. October 21. On account, of lack of seed the experiment with Turkestan alfalfa w«8 discontinued after August 19. The plots of this variety showed a good stand in almost every case and no injury during the succeeding ilie sowings of common alfalfa during March, April, and on May 7 i a fair to good stand, hut were all seriously Injured the following er. Later sowings gave good results and not much injury from er killing except that the sowing of October 21 was a failure, as plants did not reach a sufficient size to withstand the winter. Tt also observed that of the fall-sown plots those sown broadcast gave nch better stand than those that, were drilled. These experiments, as well as the experiences of alfalfa growers, show that alfalfa may be sown at any time of the year from spring to earlv fall, provided the soil is in the proper condition as to tilth and moisture. Tn the eastern part of Nebraska summer and fall sowings may be ad - vantappons because of the weeds. The soil may be freed from weeds during summer and thus the alfalfa Is given a chance to get a start. To test the relative value of sowing seed alone or with a nurse crop two one-flfth acre plots were planted with R pounds of seed on April 8. 1901 On plot No. 1 the seed was sown alone A good stand followed, with vigorous growth, though some plants were killed during the winter of 1902-3. The result was entirely satisfactory. The plot was disked In the same manner as No. 2. On plot No. 2 the seed was sown with 3 pecks of oats. On June 28. 1901. K8 pounds of oats were gathered, fol - lowed by a fair stand of alfalfa by October. In the spring of 1902 the stand was very poor, but after being disked and harrowed (March 5?&gt; there was some recovery and a good stand resulted In the spring of 1903. though there had been some loss during the preceding winter. The results show that a good stand Is more certain to follow sowing alone the growth of alfalfa being vigorous the first season, while if sown with a nnrse crop the alfalfa does not reach its maximum till the second season and there is some risk of a poor stand. The poor results the first season are partly offset by the oat crop gained.

In the spring of 1901 plots one-fifth acre in size were sown with the following mixtures: Alfalfa, 5 pounds; brome-grass, 3 pounds. Alfalfa, 4 pounds; brome-grass, 4 pounds. Alfalfa, 4 pounds; bluegrass, 3 pounds. Alfalfa, 4 pounds; meadow fescue, 5 pounds. Alfalfa, 1 pound; brome-grass, % pound; red clover, V4 pound; whit* clover, M pound; bluegrass, % pound; meadow fescue, % pound; orchard grass, V4 pound; timothy, 1 pound; perennial rye-grass, 1 pound; tall oat - grass, % pound. Alfalfa, 4 pounds; timothy, 5 pounds. In all cases there was a good stand of alfalfa the first year, and scarcely any of the grasses could be found. All of the plots were disked and harrowed in the spring of 1902. During this season there was a good growth of alfalfa and only a little grass to be seen. This result is especially noteworthy for the plot containing only 1 pound of alfalfa, with several grasses. It was not till the third year that the grasses began to assert themselves. In all the plots the grass constituted a con - siderable portion of the plots except in the case of the mixture with timothy, which appears to be unable to compete with alfalfa. In the mixture of several grasses it was the orchard grass that took the lead, the plot being estimated to consist of about one-third of this grass. Another plot of alfalfa and brome-grass sown in equal parts in 1899 has had a similar development, but at the present time the brome-grass has succeeded in nearly crowding out the alfalfa. In the plots where brome-grass was sown with alfalfa — both the common and Turkestan — it was noted that the grass appeared more vigorous in those places where the alfalfa was thickest, and that the grass in these plots appeared also to be more vigorous than in adjacent plots where there was no alfalfa. It would appear that the brome-grass derived some advantage from the fertilizing effect of the alfalfa. It will be of interest to record here the results obtained by two cor - respondents in sowing alfalfa upon native grass in the sand-hill region. William Fagan, foreman of the Robert Taylor ranch at Abbott, Hall County, states that he disked the sandy sod three times, hipping the disk half each time, and sowed 20 pounds of seed per acre. This was in the spring of 1902. A good stand was obtained, and in 1903 a crop of hay was cut consisting of about one-third prairie hay and two-thirds alfalfa. The alfalfa succeeded better on the knolls where the sod was more thoroughly broken. Mr. H. W. Sullivan, Broken Bow, Custer County, states: "Beginning in the early spring and continuing up until August, I caused light sandy soil to be broken. I disked this well, harrowed it down smoothly, put seed in with a press drill, 15 pounds to the acre, and got a splendid stand on every foot of it." He remarks that the best stand seemed to follow the August sowing. </seg>

It can not compete with hy where the latter is at its best, but being more drought resistant, its range is somewhat more extended in the west, as indicated in the paragraph upon orchard grass, it is more common in the middle south, where it is grown as a winter grass, being sown in the autumn. Ei Nebraska it is recommended that it be sown with orchard grass e spring. It can also be sown alone or with clover, and in Nebraska 31 adapted for pasture, though it can also be used for hay. For the ' purpose, however, brome-grass or alfalfa give better returns. fay seedsmen sell meadow fescue under the name of English blue - but the latter name is inappropriate, as the grass is not a blue - and the term English bluegrass is sometimes applied to a different A. closely allied grass is tall fescue (b'extuca elatior). Botanically they are usually considered to be the same species, but agriculturally there is lerable difference, and, for Nebraska conditions, in favor of the meadow fescue. For further notes upon this grass see the paragraph upon grass 1 ires. One plot, N by 132 feet in size, sown in the spring of 1900 and manured in uie fall of 1901, gave on June 23, 1902, 750 pounds of hay, or 3,450 pounds per acre. The grass was injured somewhat by the drought "1, but recovered sufficiently to give good fall pasture. The fourth year, June 10, 19o3, this plot gave a cutting &lt;k hay of 670 pounds, or at rate of 2.836 pounds per acre. E other plot (one-eighth acre), drilled in rows on May 25, 1897, gave ne 27, 1900, a cutting of 300 pounds of hay, or at the rate of 2,400 s per acre. The growth in the following years was good, but the show that the grass does not start to grow so early in the spring me-grass. Eight growers of meadow fescue have reported upon their results. All report that their fields are now in good condition, but the reports are equally divided as to the advantages of spring and fall sowing, while fire state that it is easier to obtain a stand of this than of other grass.

Orchard grass is one of the most nutritious and palatable of thr tivated meadow grasses. It thrives in more shaded situations than other meadow grasses, for which reason it is often planted in orchards: hence the name. It withstands drought better than timothy, and consequently can be grown farther west in Nebraska than can timothy. The chief dis - advantage of orchard grass is the greater expense of the seed. Orchard grass and meadow fescue, sometimes combined with rpd clover, are to be recommended especially for pasture in that part of Nebraska west of the timothy belt as far as about the ninety-ninth meridian, be - yond which the summer conditions become too severe. It is true that fields of these grasses usually dry up more or less during the middle of summer, but the same is true of all available pasture grasses, it being necessary to supplement them during this season with green feed, such as cane or com. On the other hand, orchard grass and meadow fescue furnish green feed in early spring and late fall, seasons when the wild pastures are not available. The seed should be sown in the spring at the rate of about 2ft pounds of orchard grass and 15 pounds of meadow f - per acre. Tnless the ground is free from weeds it will be necessn mow once or twice during the first season to keep the weeds down until the grass is well established. When grown for hay the grass should be cut in blossom, as at a later period the value of the hay rapid! Orchard grass has been grown on the Nebraska Station farm for s*v - eral years and has given very satisfactory results.

Timothy (PhPhim praten**) is a native of Europe, and is said to have been brought to Maryland in 172" by Timothy Hanson, for whom it was named. The history of this standard meadow grass is somewhat obscure, however.

            <seg id="p304">304 gradually pushed westward, and there are many fields that give fairly good results as far west as the ninety-ninth meridian, or even farther when there is an abundant water supply near the surface. However, these are isolated cases and represent localities where the conditions are especially favorable, and it can not be said that timothy is to be de - pended upon much west of the line indicating 30 inches of annual rainfall. Timothy is chiefly used for meadows, but may be also used for pas - tures. When sown alone there is some danger of injury from close pas - turing, as stock are likely to pull up the bulblets at. the base of the stems and thus destroy the crown. It is usually sown, when intended for- pasture, with red clover. When used for hay it is also frequently combined with clover, which is very satisfactory for home use, as the clover increases its feeding value. Upon the hay market, however, pure timothy brings a higher price than mixed; hence when grown for sale timothy is usually sown alone. It may also be remarked that the soil conditions of Nebraska are not suited to the bpst development of timothy, even where the rainfall is sufficient, as the soil is of a sandy type rather than clay. Timothy may (own in the autumn or spring. If sown alone it is best to sow in the as a full crop can then be obtained the following year. If sown in spring there is not generally a full crop till the second year and hence » time is lost. It is usual in Nebraska to combine it with clover and with a nurse crop, the object of the latter being to obtain more from land the first year. As the timothy and clover may not reach their full development the firsr season, the grain crop is thrown in for economy. Where winter wheat is grown it is common to use this as the nurse crop, sowing the timothy and wheat in the fall and the clover the following spring. The wheat and timothy can not be sown mixed in a drill on account of the difference in the size of the seed, but they may be sown at the same time by using a wheat drill having a special attachment. The timothy may be sown in the spring, but in that case should be sown early, about the time the snow is disappearing and while the ground is wet. If there is no snow and the ground is dry the timothy is likely to fail. The clover is sown in the spring in either case and later than is suitable for timothy, usually the first part of April. The amount of seed used is from fi to 8 quarts of timothy and 8 to in pounds of clover. When combined with grain the timothy and clover Buce a good growth after the grass is cut, and may be lightly pastured same year. The following year one or more crops of hay may be or the field may be pastured, according to circumstances. When thy is sown alone there is some danger in Nebraska of injury to the i after the cuttings, as they may be unduly exposed to the hot snn- Sne during dry weather. There is less danger of this when clover is &lt;1 in combination. Cr.ovERS. Red clover (Trifolium pratense), the standard forage legume of the northeastern states, can be grown in the eastern counties over about </seg>
            <seg id="p305">305 I samp area as timothy. As clover is usually combined with tlm for both pasture and meadow, its cultivation has been considered inflection with the latter plant. In the census returns cited in th iduction to this bulletin mixed timothy and clover are included •r "other tame grasses." As Nebraska is credited with 42,000 acres over and 92,000 acres of other tame grasses, it is quite likely that ! proportion of the latter area is devoted to timothy and clove *1. Red clover has been grown upon the Nebraska Station farm fo y years with great success. Mammoth clover is a variety of red clover of more vigorous growth and longer lived than the ordinary kind. The seed was sown at the Nebraska Station in 1900, and gave a good stand, a vigorous growth, with good fall pasture. The following year tt was subjected to a severe test by drought, but withstood this better than any other clover upon the farm. It was about half winterkilled in the winter of 1902-1903. Alsike clover (Trifolium hybririvm) is a perennial clover, in size and appearance intermediate between red and white clover. It Is adapted to more moist ground than red clover and Is recommended as a con - stituent of wet pastures In Nebraska it does not usually grow tall enough for hay, but Is a fine clover for pasture. On the station farm alsike has given good results In low spots in pastures and has withstood drought well. Kentucky Blutbbass Kentucky bluegrass [Poa pratensis) is a native of Europe and of the northern part of the TTnited States, but it is now widely cultivated; It is also found as a wild grass throughout all the northern portion of the United States, ecept the arid regions. Bluegrass is essentially a pasture grass and can scarcely be excelled in regions where it reaches its greatest development. In Nebraska it thrives only in the eastern counties over about the same range as timothy, though it Is gradually spreading west - ward. However, in many places lying west of the normal range it is a common constituent of pastures, and is then usually established in the more shaded situations. If there are shade trees or hedges, the bluegrass is quite certain to obtain a foothold and spread outward, hold - ing Its own very well with even the native grasses. It gives early and late pasture, but dries up in summer. The seed should be sown very early In the spring, on the melting snow if possible, at the rate of about 25 pounds of good seed per acre. If the seed is chaffy more must be used. It Is customary to sow with blueprass a little white clover — 2 /or 3 pounds. The latter, however. Is usually widespread in the bluegrass region and soon comes in Itself. E suits at the Nebraska Station show that bluegrass furnishes con - ble pasture, especially during spring and fall, as Indicated In the •aph on pastures. Esely allied to Kentucky bluegrass is Canada or Canadian bluegrass compressa). This differs from the former in having a distinctly ed stem, being of a bluish-green color, in having smaller flower </seg>
            <seg id="p306">306 iers, and usually growing less tall. It Is the common bluegrass of New England and northeastern states, and in some localities is d wire grass and also English bluegrass. It is adapted to somewha* s sterile soil than Kentucky bluegrass, but on the whole is scarcely p recommended for Nebraska. The station trial of this grass was tisfactory. RlDTOP. Redtop {Agrnntis alba and A. vulgaris) is a native of Europe and also of the northern parts of North America. In the eastern states. especially from Pennsylvania southward, this grass is more commonly known as herd's grass. Redtop is widely cultivated and is now found growing wild through all the region indicated for timothy. Like blue - grass and white clover, it is now a common constituent of meadows and pastures even where it was not sown. It is particularly adapted to moist soils and is always recommended as a constituent of meadows or pastures on low ground. Tt Is, however, inferior In quality to the other Trasses mentioned, and also on ordinary dry ground It Is inferior to them in quantity. It is to be recommended for moist meadows in the rn part of the state and also for those localities In the sandhills an&gt;1 other portions of western Nebraska where the soil Is too moist for the growth of ordinary meadow grasses. As the seed obtained In the market usually contains a large amount of chaff It If necessary to sow a correspondingly large quantity of seed. \ half bushel of clean seed per acre is probably sufficient, but it may be necessary to increase this to 2 bushels If the seed is chaffy. When sown In mixtures, as is usually the case, a much less quantity may be used. A common mixture is 3 pounds cf alsike clover. 4 pounds of timothy, and 4 pounds of redtop. Botanically there is a slight difference between Aprnntin alba and .4. vulaarin, but the seed upon the market may be of either rariety. A variety known as creeping bent (A. xtolon&lt; fpra. of the seed catalogues) Is often used as a lawn grass in the eastern states. A related species. Rhode Island bent (.4. ranina). is also used as a lawn grass, but in Nebraska both these grasses are inferior to blnegrasa for this purpose. Redtop has been grown upon the Nebraska Station farm for several years and has been found to be entirely adapted to this region. Sn&gt;E-OAT8 Grama. The first seeding of side-oats grama (Bouteloua rurtipeiifiula) . also called prairie oats and tall grama, was made In 1897. It gave the same year a yield of hay amounting to nearly two tons per acre, and the following year the product was nearly four tons per acre. The grass waa partially killed during the unprecedented!)- cold winter of 1899. Being a native, it is not injured l&gt;y ordinarily cold weather. Seed sown in 1900 produced a good stand the first year but no crop. During the second season, 1901, which was very dry during the late summer, thf gran continued in good condition in spite of the drought, and produced </seg>

This plot continued to give good results during but aa it tma not form a close sod it gives a chance for various i to become established between the bunches. In 1903 the plot had ly deteriorated and the grass was finally driven out by weeds. Taking everything into consideration this is a very promising grass for the drier regions of Nebraska. It is a native of the plains and fur - nishes excellent forage for pasture and also promises well for hay. An important point in its favor is the fact that the plants seed abundantly and the seed is easily gathered — of good quality, and easily sown. On account of the tendency to grow in bunches it may be best to sow this with some other grass, such as brome-grass, or even with alfalfa. Much nf the success in growing this grass depends upon securing good seed in the experiment noted above, the seed was obtained from a plot pre - viously grown upon the farm. Other plots of the same grass sown with seed obtained from the Department of Agriculture were failures on account of low vitality. The Kansas Experiment Station reports good results in the culture of this grass (Bulletin 1 Wheat-Grasses. I Western wheat-grass (Agropyron occidentale) is commonly found in western portion of the Great Plains, extending into the mountains, ropagates by stout creeping rootstocks, but does not form a close sod, he west, from Colorado to Montana, it is called bluestem, Colorado stem, or Colorado grass, and it forms the bulk of the native hay bis region. It grows on bench land or bottom land, and though the i per acre is not large it furnishes more hay than any other com - i grass of this region. The foliage is stiff and harsh, but the quality lie hay is good and it is readily eaten by stock. The trials on the plots at the Nebraska Station were satisfactory. Where a good stand was obtained the plant showed that it could with - stand drought and produce a good crop of hay. One plot of one-fifth of an acre, sown in 1901, and on account of the poor stand resown the following year, produced on June 23, 1903, 457 pounds of hay, or at the rate of 2,485 pounds to the acre. Wheat-grass is in fact one of the most promising of our native hay grasses. The seed is produced in abundance and is easily gathered Experiments at stations in the arid regions have usually given good results. The rootstocks soon fill the soil and the field may require re - juvenating. This can be accomplished by disking or harrowing to cut up the rootstocks. as is often done upon the native meadows. Although Agropyron repent, known as quack-grass, quitch-grass, and couch-grass, is a pestiferous weed in the eastern states, yet for Nebraska it shows many qualities which recommend it as a hay grass. The grass is nutritious, palatable, drought resistant, and thickens up readily to form a good stand. It is true that it may tend to spread where it be - comes established, hut in the semiarid regions such a quality in an </seg>

Four yean' g of this grass upon the station plots shows that it recovered easily the drought of 1901 and formed a good growth of hay in 1902 and Slender wheat-grass (Agropyron tenerum) is a native of the north western states from western Nebrasna to Canada and westward. Thi has been recognized in the region to the north of Nebraska as a valu able wild grass and has already been brought Into cultivation, so tha the seed can be obtained of several seedsmen in the northwest. It re sembles A. occidentale in many respects, but differs in the important fac that it is a bunch grass and does not spread by creeping rootstocks Like the other wheat-grasses, the seed habits are good, and it gives promise of meeting the requirements of a hay grass for the northwest One plot at the Nebraska Station, sown in 1897, was apparentl much injured by the drought of 1901, but the following spring it quickly recovered and produced a quick stand of excellent hay. Another plot one-fifth acre in size, sown in 1901, had a similar history, but it was renown in the spring of 1902, produced a good stand, and gave a cutting of hay on July 23 of 4£7 pounds, or at the rate of 2285 pounds to the acre. Gbassks and Legumes of Less Importance. Big Bluestem (Andropogon furcatus). — This is one of the tall grasses common over the prairie region and forms, probably, the most valuabl constituent of native bay produced in eastern Kansas, eastern Nebrask and Iowa. It is usually called bluestem, or bluejoint, and is character ized by having the seed in crowfoot clusters at the top of the stem, b . it may be distinguished from the bluejoint of Colorado, which is a wheat-grass, and from the bluejoint of Minnesota, which is a grass of low grounds rather than prairies. The station plot gave rather un satisfactory results on account of the poor stand obtained, but the bunches that were produced grew well. Although a valuable grass, the Mft habits are such that it is not likely to adapt itself to cultivation. Th seed is produced in small quantity, is of uncertain vitality, and the seed stalks vary so in height that it is not readily harvested. The allied A. scoparius, which is another important native hay grass, called little bluestem, or, on the plains, "bunch-grass," has not been tested at the Nebraska Station, but the above remarks concerning the seed habits apply nearly as well to this species. Idian Or ass (Andropogon nutant). — A tall grass growing in the rn states and westward nearly to the mountains. It forms an im nt constituent of all the wild hay of the prairie regions excep rd the north. It is of especial value on account of its numerous roo g. The plot of this grass tested gave finally a luxuriant growth o ;e, although it was injured somewhat by the drought of 1901. The seed habits of this grass stand in the way of its cultivation. The Is usually not very abundant and is often of low vitality. Tall (tat-Grass (Arrhenatherum elatius). — One of the European meadow </seg>
            <seg id="p309">grasses which has been grown on a small scale in this country for many years. As it is a bunch grass and does not form a close sod it should not be used alone, but doubtless it will be a valuable addition to a mixture such as orchard grass and meadow fescue. It is fairly drought resistant, and has the quality of producing a comparatively rank growth the first season, for which reason it has found favor as a winter pasture grass in the south. In general, however, it seems to be better adapted to meadows than to pastures. The station plots gave a good growth of forage which produced excellent hay. One plot, one-fifth acre in size, sown in 1901 and resown in 1902, produced on June 23, 410 pounds of hay, or at the rate of 2.050 pounds to the acre. After the cutting a fine after - math was formed. In 1903 the same plot yielded (June 16) only 310 pounds, or at the rate of 1,550 pounds to the acre, bearing out the ex - perience elsewhere that a meadow of tall oat-grass reaches its maximum development early and then deteriorates. Blue Grama (Bouteloua oligostachya) . — Blue grama is one of the im - portant constituents of upland grazing regions of the Great Plains and is often called buffalo grass, but it should be distinguished from the true buffalo grass with which it is usually associated. Blue grama does not produce so large a quantity of seed and the seed is not so easily gathered or handled as side-oats grama, but ranchmen state that it is superior to this grass in nutritive qualities and palatability, and further - more that it forms a thick sod, while the other does not. The growth is short, usually about a foot high, and hence this grass is not adapted for hay except under favorable conditions, though for pasture it is ex - ceedingly valuable. Seed was sown on one plot (n 1898 and on a second plot in 1900. The grass was slow to start from seed and the growth In the spring was slow even when the plot was established, but the stand thickened up well, and during the dry season of 1901 it was the only grass besides side-oats grama that gave sufficient growth for pasture during the period of extreme drought. Western Brome (Bromus carinatus hooker ianus) . — Three trials of this gave negative results on account of the failure of the seed to germinate, but one plot sown in the spring of 1902 with seed from the grass garde* of the Department of Agriculture at Washington gave good results and showed that the grass is at least promising for the semiarld regions. Trials at stations in the northwest have also shown that this species gives much promise. This grass is cloely allied to B. marginatus. Western Brome (Bromus margxnatus). — Four trials of this grass showed that it is well adapted to the conditions In Nebraska, giving a good growth and resisting the dry weather of 1901, and that it is not injured in the winter. The foilage is rather coarse and not as leafy as would be desirable, but the grass is well worth an extended trial. Buffalo Grass iBulbilis dactyloides) . — Buffalo grass is the common 'short grass" of the Great Plains, and forms a close, thick sod by means of its numerous creeping stolons. It is entirely resistant to drought, it is very nutritious, and it cures upon the ground, thus furnishing winter </seg>
            <seg id="p310">310 feed to the range cattle. The grass forms the seed close to the groun in little nut-like clusters that are likely to escape the casual observe The staminate or male flowers are produced in little spikes or flags which are raised a few inches a1x&gt;ve the ground and are much more easily distinguished than are the pistillate or female flowers that pro the seed. The seed, however, is quite fertile, but is so difficult t gather that it will never be practicable to grow buffalo grass from th tmd. If it is desired to produce a field of buffalo grass it should be started from the cuttings. For this purpose the sod should be cut int small pieces and planted upon prepared soil. The pieces can b* dropped upon the surface of the soil and forced into the ground b stepping upon them. The distance apart depends upon the desirabilit of obtaining a thick stand at once. If the pieces of sod are placed 2 fee apart each way, they will thicken up between fairly well in one seaso In experiments at the Nebraska Station the seed failed to germinate. M Rye (Elymus canadensis) . — A common grass in many parts of the ■ 1 States and extending over a large part of Nebraska, where It is found chiefly in draws and low places. It produces a large amount of hay of good quality, though rather coarse. It resists drought quite well and seems well worth an extended trial as a meadow grass. One plot on the station grounds, sown in 1901, was cut on July 26, 1902, and yielded at the rate of 5,875 pounds to the acre (1,175 pounds on one - flfth acre). The same plot yielded on July 23, 1903, at the rate of pounds per acre. The shattered seed from the plot germinated in the autumn of 1902 and produced a good stand the following season. The cutting was made after the grass had headed out, but for the bast hay the cutting should be made much before the heads appear. The form here cultivated is sometimes referred to as E. robustm. Elymus virginicuH. — The same remarks apply to this species as to K. canadensis, but this grass shows the effect of drought more quickly than that species. Blymus virginicus svbmuticus. — The results with this variety are more factory than with the species. Erogrostit tenuix. — This grass has given good results In the plots, promises well as a hay grass, although the foliage is rather wiry, grass is a native of sandy regions of the plains, and It may prove ible in the Sand Hills. Wild Timothy (Muhlenbergia racemosa). — A native grass found in moist places through the northern states west to the Rocky Mountains. In Nebraska it is a common constituent of slough-grass hay. The re - sults upon the station plots show that this grass can be cultivated and i fair quality of hay produced. Japanese Barnyard Millet (Panicum crus-galli). — An annual grass of much nutritive value which gives a luxuriant growth of fodder suitable for coarse hay. The station plot of this grass, one-fifth acre, sown March 22, yielded on July M, 1902, 1.100 pounds of hay, or at the rate of 5.500 pounds to the acre. The yield should have been much higher, </seg>
            <seg id="p311">311 but the stand was not of the best. There Is no doubt that this is a good annual hay crass for portions of Nebraska which are not too dry. but as it has no espeHal advantage over millet and Is Inferior to sorghum it probably will not be used extensh - ely. Some seedsmen have sold this under the name of Billion Dollar Grass. itch-Granx (Panicum riraatitm) . — A bunch grass which is one of the Important constituents of prairie hay in Nebraska and is well worth cultivating. The plot at the station was unsatisfactory on account of the poor stand, but the bunches present procured a Rood quality of hay. The grass Is quite resistant to drought and produces a quantity of seed which is usually of good quality. fteett Canary Grass (Phalaris nmnilinarea} . — A native of marshes and sloughs through the northern tier of states. In the northern portion of the Oreat Plains it forms a large part of the native hay. which is generally recognized as of excellent qualitv. Although a native of w«» soil it gives good results on comparatively dry soil. it is to he recom - mended for cultivation in the states from Minnesota to Washington, and south probably as far as northern Kansas, but in the southern portion of the ranee is adapted only to low mepdows. The great disadvantage of this grass at present is the difficulty of obtaining good sped Ordinarily the seed shatters easily at maturity. The results of the trial at the station were unsatisfactory from the fact that there was a very thin stand, which was prohablv due to poor seed. The com - mon ribbon grass of gardens is a variety of this species. •Npa rnhiista. — A native of the Rocky Mountain regions and the western portion of the Oreat Plains, where it is a common constituent of the native hay. The station plot sown in 1807 withstood the drought of 1001 and gave good crops of hay in 1002 and 1003. This grass Is worthy of an extended trial. PASTFRKS ANTt MEADOWS NATTVF OKASSr.S. Since the native grasses and forage plants play such an important role in the agricultural eeonomv of Nebraska it will not be out of place to discuss them briefly. They have been very thoroughly studied i'v Dr. C E. Bessev and other l)otanlsts of the state and for detailed information the reader is referred to articles by Dr. Bessev in the re - i&gt;orts of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture from 188fi to 18M. to the Phytogeography of Nebraska, by Pound and Clements, the Flora ' ihe Sand Hills, by Rydberg. and to various articles on the f.ra— e» of Nebraska by Webber. Smith and others. The agricultural grasses are divided into two tvpes. according to root formation — bunch grasses and sod formers. The bunch m—w form a crown which increases from voar to year and beomes in time a raised tussock. Where hunch crrasses abound there is no continuous sod, but a succession of tussocks with bare soil between whl^h ■■p- </seg>

Sod have rootstocks or stolons by which they spread, forming a con - sod. Buffalo grass and Kentucky bluegrass are examples of Bbe grasses may also be divided into those which grow tall enough ake hay, and are sometimes called "tall grasses." and the strictly ng grasses of the western plains, called "short grasses." Hay Is made from the tall grasses which are found on all unbroken prairie of the eastern portion of the state. In the wet places or sloughs, there are various swamp grasses (chiefly slough -grass. Spartina cymoturoidet) , which, when cut young, furnish a fair, though coarse hay. The most important hay grasses are: Little bluestem (Andro - pogon scoparius Michx.), Big bluestem (Andropogon furratus Muhl.) Indian grass ( Andropogon nutant L.), Switch-grass (Panicum virqntum L.), and Side-oats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula Michx. ). These five liiMH form the great bulk of the prairie hay throughout the eastern half of the state. In the western portion these grasses are confined to the river bottoms, draws, and other moist spots, and often are found in sufficient abundance for mowing. These same grasses are also used for native pasture. But in the grazing portions of the west, except the Sand Hills, the important grasses are: Buffalo grass (BuTbilis darty - loides Raf.) and blue grama (Bouteloua oligostachya Torr.). R important grass in the west, especially for hay, is the wheat - {Agropyron orcidentale). This spreads by extensively creeping round stems. The foilage is stiff and rather harsh, but never - it forms a very nutritious hay. This grass is more resistant to t than any of the hay grasses of the west. There are many other grasses which are of more or less agricultural importance, but, compared with those mentioned, they are insignificant. CAKE OF ICATTVE PA8TTTRE8 AWD MEADOW8. Unless proper precautions are taken to prevent it, both meadows and pastures tend to deteriorate. In pastures the stock are contin - ually eating off the most palatable plants and avoiding the others, which are In this respect weeds. To prevent such exhaustion it is necessary to limit the number of stock to the forage-producing power of the pasture. The same is true of the open range. Great harm has resulted in many instances from overstocking. Particular care must be exercised in this respect at what might be called critical periods. or when unfavorable conditions, such as drought, curtail the produc - tion of grass. In pastures this exhaustion can be avoided by supple - menting the grazing by soiling crope. An excellent way to encourage the recuperative power of the native grasses is to give the pasture a r«rt by providing two pastures, which may be used alternately for periods of from two to four weeks. With meadows deterioration is less marked, as the weeds are cut at </seg>

It is a bad practice to pasture the -math during the autumn, as this encourages the growth of weeds. Ee burning on of pastures or meadows is not to be recommended, perience has demonstrated that though a green growth can be &gt;d earlier the final results are harmful. The crowns of the Classes jured and the fertilizing effect of the ,;ried leaves is lost. On the other hand, the practice of mowing the weeds in pastures in summer is good, as they are thus prevented from going to seed. If the number of stock limited to its capacity is allowed to use the pasture, the manure thus distributed tends fo keep up fertility; but meadows are constantly giving up nutriment drawn from the soil, the loss of which must in time visibly affect the capacity. Therefore, wherever the value of the hay is a sufficient recompense, it is wel! to supply barnyard manure to make up this loss. TAME PASTURES AT THE NEBRASKA EXPERIMENT STATION. A field of 30 acres was sown in April, 1899, with a mixture of 2 pounds each of orchard grass, timothy, bluegrass, tall oat-grass, perennial rye-grass, and white clover, 4 pounds of red clover, and 1 pound of alsike. Three pounds of alfalfa were added to 5 acres of this mixture. In 1900, 30 tons of hay were cut and excellent pasture was obtained through the fall. In 1901, the pasture was in excellent con - dition, supporting 25 to 35 head of cattle and giving 14 tons of fine hay. This pasture has been top-dressed with barnyard manure about every other winter, and during the summer the weeds have been mown two or three times. In the spring of 1900 the field was disked and sown with brome-gras8 and meadow fescue. These grasses have gradually gained the ascendancy until now the alfalfa has disappeared and there little to be seen besides the grasses mentioned. This tendency for certain grasses to predominate in a mixture la shown by the history of a 30-acre field of native pasture. About 1887 irtion of this pasture on the south side was sown with bluegrass white clover. The bluegrass has gradually spread over the whole and at present the pasture appears to be mostly bluegrass, which penally in evidence during early spring and late fall, while during summer, particularly if the season Is dry, the native grasses are picuous. This is the usual tendency where bluegrass is able to thrive, olds its own with other cultivated grasses, and may even crowd tits competitors; but when combined with native grasses, these able to hold their own in the prairie region of the state. The ;rass starts to grow much earlier than the native grasses and gives arly spring an excellent quality of pasture. In the dry part of summer the bluegrass dries up and becomes dormant while the r e grasses continue to vegetate. In the autumn as the weather lies cooler the bluegrass again starts up and gives late pasture. experimental pasture had been topdressed with barnyard manure </seg>

In 1898, 4 acres of the above fields ware plowed and sawn to brome-grass. In the spring of 1901, 3 acres o alfalfa were added from an adjoining field. This portion was disked the following spring and sown with brome-grass and meadow fescue These grasses have driven out the alfalfa, and now none of the latter can !* found in the field. During the season of 1903 this field carried 40 head of cattle all summer, and also yielded a crop of hay estimated at one - fourth ton per acre. Another field sown with timothy, orchard grass, bluegrass, meadow ■ and brome-grass is now nearly all brome-grass. THE 8EED BED FOB ORASSES AND CLOVERS. The ideal seed bed for grasses and clovers is a firm but friable lowe soil, with loose, well-tilled top soil. To produce this condition require careful tillage for several years preceding the sowing. The soil should contain sufficient moisture to insure the young plants a good start in case there should be a deficient rainfall after sowing. Seed sown on dry soil may receive sufficient rainfall to germinate, but not enoug to supply the young plants with the necessary moisture. Carefu preparation of the seed bed is more essential in seeding grasses than ii seeding almost any other crop, and failure to obtain a stand entails greater loss. Land that has been planted to a cultivated crop, fo which the soil has been well tilled and which has received clean and leve cultivation, may in most cases be well fitted for seeding grasses b :ig and harrowing without plowing, provided the trash be removed When disking the disk should always be lapped one-half on eac round, thus covering the field twice, and generally it is well to go ove the field a second time at right angles to the first disking. A smooth ing harrow should follow the disk. Well-cultivated land has thes advantages: The weeds have been exterminated, the moisture has bee conserved, and the top soil is in good tilth. Fall plowing is desirabl on land that settles well through the winter and that does not blow liadly, but there is much soil on which fall plowing can not be don advantageously when spring seeding is intended. In any case as Ion a period as possible should elapse between plowing and seeding, bu during that time the top soil should be kept loose and clean with th disk or drag. During this period the soil settles, the large spaces ar filled, and the moisture is diffused through the plowed soil. Diskin the soil before plowing is advisable, as it cuts up the trash if there i any, and pulverizes the soil turned under so that it settles more quickly The use of the subsurface packer or the disk set straight and run i the direction of the furrow also helps greatly to firm the soil. The use o either of these implements should follow the plow by the least possibl number of hours. Stubble land for fall seeding may in some cases bes be plowed and in others disked, depending on a great variety of clr ■ u instances, but in any case the sooner the soil is prepared after cuttln </seg>

Sour, mm. Sorghum ( Anriroporjon sorghum) is one of the most important annual forage grasses of the United States. It is grown throughout the south and well to the west on the Great Plains. It resists drought better than any other succulent forage prop and gives large yields of excellent hay. Sorghum may lie used for soilng and for pasture, but its most im - portant use is for cured fodder or hay. For this purpose it may be sown thickly and mowed with a mowing machine. The hay is succulent and requires some time for curing, but in the drier portions of Nebraska it can be thrown into hunches or cocks and allowed to remain until cured Ilafir corn, a variety of nonsaccharine sorghum, is also quite drought itant and is frequently grown for forage, but under the same eon - is the sorghum gives a greater yield of fodder. Sorghum can also latned in rows and cultivated. The forage can then be gathered by ing and shocking, preferably with a corn harvester. The ordinary r sorghums, such as Early Amber. Colman and Orange, are used this region. Sorghum is frequently referred to as "cane." ■)ther races of sorghum are milo maize. Jerusalem corn, and dhoura, in Nebraska none of these is equal to sorghum for fodder. iorghum was tested in the series of pasture tests already mentioned letin fin of the Nebraska Experiment Station), as were also white r corn and milo maize. One-fifth acre of sorghum gave twenty - days' pasturage and was. along with ryp. one of the crops giving greatest quantity of forage. Some experiments were also tried with hum for soiling, which indicated that the quantity of forage thus Kined was two to three and one-half times as much as when the crop pastured. The possible injurious effects of pasturing sorghum have already been alluded to in another paragraph. (See also Bulletin 77 of the Nebraska ■riment Station.) E.n acre of Early Amber sorghum, drilled with a corn planter in ile rows, fi inches between rows. 3 feet apart. June 12. was cut on ember 19 with a corn binder and shocked in the field. The weigh* Ms. taken December 1, was S.71 r&gt; pounds. A similar plot was treated in the same manner, except that the seed was planted with a grain drill in rows 8 inches apart. The forage wms rut the same as the other plot but with a mowing machine, and was pat in cocks, where it remained till December 1. The weight was then fonnd to be 12,350 pounds, or over fi tons per acre. En the drier portions of the state where it is necessary to conserve moisture, it is advisable to plant the seed in rows in order to admit ultivation. The crop is thus made more certain. </seg>

It be cut in about two months from the time it is planted, and is an llent hay plant. It should be cut between the time of heading out that of late bloom, for If cut too early the hay is too laxative in its t and if cut too late the seed has injurious effects, especially upon ss. The hay is succulent and requires more time to cure than does thy. About one-half bushel of seed per acre is used. Different va - » are called Hungarian grass, German millet, Siberian millet, etc In the pasturing tests (see Bulletin 69 of the Nebraska Experiment Station) millet gave eighteen and a half days' pasturage for one cow and was available at the same time as sorghum, Kafir corn, and cowpeas "It did not have as favorable an effect upon the milk flow or butter fat production as did any of these crops or as did the mixed grasses." Eom-corn millet (Panicum miliaceum) is a different species, some - called hog millet. This gives good results in the Dakotas and northern states and also promises well for Nebraska. In 1903, a If acre plot of Red Orenburg (S. P. I. 9423) sown June 12 and cut t 15 yielded at the rate of 3,250 pounds of hay to the acre. Cowpea. Cowpea (Vigna catjang) is an annual legume which has been grown in oriental countries for an indefinite period. It is now one of the standard forage plants of the south, being extensively cultivated as an annual summer crop for hay, pasture, and green manure. During recent years its range has been steadily pushed northward, until now it is grown with more or less success as far north as Wisconsin and New York. There are a large number of varieties, differing greatly in their method of growth, time necessary to reach maturity, hardiness, and many other characters that affect the adaptability to conditions. ilthough one of the standard hay plants of the south, it is not adapted lay in Nebraska. It is difficult to cure and can not compete with fa and clover. It is an excellent soiling plant, but under present itions of agriculture it is not likely to be needed for this purpose in ask a in the near future, except possibly on a small scale in dairy lets. It is not well adapted for silage on account of its succulence, has been used in this way when mixed with other plants. (See liar 24 of the Division of Agrostology, U. S. Department of Agricul (he chief field of usefulness of the cowpea in Nebraska is for pasture ng the autumn. The seed must be sown when the ground is well ned, which in Nebraska may not be until June. Although late sties, which produce no pods in this state, can be untilized for forage, the plant gives best returns when the pods are forming. Hence. e varieties should be grown which mature at least a part of the seed </seg>

This is especially advisable, because of the high price of Where adaptabilty to climate is so important as in the case of the , growers should endeavor to use home-grown seed, which always i such adaptation. For pasture the cowpea is well adapted to sheep, and, especially when the pods are ripening, to hogs. Poul .dily eat the seeds. I 'he pasture tests of 1900 (see Bulletin No. 69 of the Nebraska Kx - mental Station) showed that one-fifth acre furnished twenty days' ure — July 24 to August 13. There was a highly favorable effect upon milk flow and the butter fat produced, in which respect "the forage surpassed all of the other crops except alfalfa, and was even slightly •rior to that very valuable forage plant." In this test the variety 1 was the Whip-poor-will. Two plots of the above variety were sown in 1897 to test the yield of fodder. They were harvested on September 23 and gave at the rate of 4.37 tons and 4.62 tons to the acre. A plot grown in 1896 gave a yield of green fodder amounting to 22,850 pounds per acre, or something over two tons of hay. Small Grains. For late fall and early spring pasture nothing excels the winter grains in palatability, nutritive qualities, and in quantity of forage. It is cus - tomary to utilize winter wheat incidentally for pasture at such noaso—, of the year in localities where this crop is grown for grain. Rye is frequently used for pasture, and this plant is to be highly recommended wherever it can be grown as a winter crop. The grains can also be used to advantage as a spring crop, but in this case the pasturage comes later in the season when the want is less keenly felt. Rye sown in the autumn produces pasture at a season when permanent pastures are dor - mant or giving only meager returns. rthe pasturing tests, a one-fifth-acre plot gave about twenty-seven pasturage. "It furnished the earliest pasturage of any of the an - forage crops and could have been pastured in the fall." K'he small grains make an excellent quality of hay and in Nebraska not infrequently used for this purpose. In California the great bulk he hay upon the city markets is grain hay made from wheat and riis and rye are also used in Nebraska as soiling crops during spring early summer. Although the amount used by each farmer in this may be small, yet the aggregate must be considerable. OOBN\ I his is by far the most valuable plant grown in Nebraska, as it is of the United States. It is grown chiefly for the grain, but in this (tin we are concerned with its forage value. Where corn is grown the grain there are two common methods of utilizing the stalks, corn may be allowed to mature in the field and the ears husked </seg>
            <seg id="p318">318 from the standing stalks during the aniiimn, or as soon u convenient. After the ears have been harvested, the remaining stalks are utilized by turning cattle, sheep, or horses upon them to secure what they can from the waste grain and the dry fodder. The nutritive value of such fodder is slight, especially during the winter. The second method of harvesting corn is to cut the stalks a short time before the grain is mature and while the foliage is still green. The stalks are placed in shocks to cure, after which the ears are husked out and the remaining stalks may be reshocked, or placed in stacks or barns, and constitute what is usually known as corn fodder or, more properly, corn stover. Properly cured corn stover is quite nutritious and compares favorably with hay. When the fodder is shredded a greater proportion is utilized. There is considerable deterioration in the nutritive value of stover during storage in the field or even in barn. I'he value of corn grown for hay should not be underestimated. When ted thickly so that the ears are reduced to one-half or one-fourth normal size and the stalks cut earlier than when grown for grain, fodder is large in quantity and very excellent in quality. Besides ralue for hay, corn is one of the best plants for silage or ensilage for a soiling crop. I'he pasturing tests at the Nebraska Station show that one-fifth acre gave eighteen and one-half days' pasturage for one cow, but though may be of value to furnish feed between the periods of rye and hum pasturage, it is not equal to either of th&lt; Soy Bean Soy l&gt;ean {(Upcuif hispirla}* is a leguminous plant srown for forage and for grain. For forage it is much used in the middle south, but has not thus far given much promise for this purpose in Nebraska. For seed or grain it has given fairly good results in Kansas. (See Bulletin No. if the Kansas Experiment Station.) In that state the Early Yellow variety has given the best returns. There is some difficulty in harvest - ing the crop, as a special harvester is required if the beans are raised on a large scale. Ei beans (American coffee berry) were tested in 1898 to determine value as summer feed, but the results were not sufficiently satis y to warrant the continuance of the experiment. (See Bulletin the Nel&gt;raska Experiment Station.) In 189(&gt; a plot of soy beans 1 at the rate of 15,000 pounds of green fodder per acre. Everal varieties have been grown at the Nebraska Station to teat seed production, but the results were not satisfactory, as none gave iciently high yield to be profitable for this purpose. Rape (Brassica napus) is a succulent plant, resembling the turnip, which is used for pasture in the cooler parts of the United States.

It is also useful for calves and growing cattle, but there is much loss from the trampling of the larger stock. The milk is likely to be tainted when rape is fed to cows, although this may be avoided by feeding (soiling) just after milking. The chief value of rape in Nebraska, however, is as fall pasture for hogs and sheep. It gives succulent feed until frost or even somewhat later. A succession of pasture may be produced by planting the seed at different dates. U is ready to use about ten weeks after planting. For further information as to rape see Farmers' Bulletin No. 104, United States De - partment of Agriculture. Canada Fuxu Pea. Canada field pea (Pitum arvente), a legume, resembling the garden pea, has proved very successful iu Canada and the cooler parts of the luiietl States. It is adapted to a cool, moist climate, thought it can be grown with some success in the middle south as a winter crop. It is usually sown with grain, especially oats, the grain serving to hold up the peas, the combination being very satisfactory for forage. The peas ana oats are usually made into hay, although they may be used for pasture or soiling. Kxperiments were tried at the station in the pasture tests. (See Bulletin t&gt;9 of the Nebraska Experiment Station.) One-fifth acre plot of oats and peas gave twenty-one and one-half days' pasturage, which was available in June, somewhat later than rye. Although peas can be used iu this way in moist years, the conclusion was reaclnd that Nebraska • tar south for the best results with this crop. Vetch. Hairy vetch i \ ivia villosa) is an annual legume more drought re - nt than the common vetch and better adapted to sandy soils, for which reason it is sometimes called sand vetch. It has proved successful in eastern Washington and is much used as a winter crop in the middle south. It gives the best results when combined with grain. Although it can be grown in eastern Nebraska, experiments show that the forage produced is inferior in quantity, and that it can not com - with other legumes. Ering vetch (Vicia sativa} is not suited to Nebraska, as it requires , moist climate. Winter vetch ( Lathyrut hirsutut) is not to be ree - nded for that region. PLANTS WHICH CAN NOT BE RECOMMENDED Eie following grasses and forage plants have been tested, but the ts are not such that they can be recommended for Nebraska. Sole e trials were failures because the seed did not germinate. In mch judgment upon the value of these plants must be reserved. The </seg>
            <seg id="p320">320 rments were based upon trials extending, in many cases, over as as six years: Agropyron caninum. — The tests with this wheat-grass were unsatis - factory on account of a mixture of seed, but it showed no evidence of Agropyron divergens. — There was no stand produced with this grasa but experiments at other stations in the northwest, notably at Pullman. Wash., have shown that it can be grown successfully from the seed and is well adapted to the semiarid conditions of that region. Although with seed of good vitality it may prove successful here, it probably has no advantage over Agropyron occidentale. Agropyron divergent inermis was also tried, but it produced a poor stand and was not promising. Agropyron violaceum. — Several trials were made, but the results were unsatisfactory. I'jhnson Grass {Andropogon halepensis). — A common and valuable grass for the southern states, but it has shown itself to be a difficult t to eradicate, and hence has become in many sections a great pest. Nebraska it will not usually survive the winter. This grass was l at the station in the spring of 1897 and survived the winter of 98, but it was killed out during the next winter. Other attempts lise it resulted in continual loss during the winter. Eieet Vernal Grass (Anthoxanthum odoratutn) . — This grass has little g value anywhere, but it is sometimes used in the eastern states part a pleasing odor to the hay, for which purpose a small quantity •s. Australian Saltbush (Atriplex semibaccata) . — This forage plant has proved quite successful in California and in some other parts of th southwest, especially in alkali soil. However, in states as far north as Nebraska it is unable to survive the winters, and hence must be grow as an annual, but the uncertainty of germination and the rather meag growth the first season render it unsatisfactory as an annual forag plant. The trial at the station extended over four years, but in no case Sthe results at all promising. The plants were killed out every r except in 1900-1901. Even the second year's growth was too smal of much value. amp-Chess (Bromus ciliatus). — The plots gave a fairly good stand, but the plants do not thicken up in the plot, and the individuals are coarse and not leafy enough for hay. Although this grass might be grown for hay, it shows nothing to recommend it to favor compared with other grasses better adapted to the purpose. Rescue Grass (Bromus unioloides) . — A fairly good grass, but it will not endure the winters in Nebraska. Bluejoint (Calamagrostis canadensis). This is a common prairie grass of the northern states, extending west into eastern Nebraska. In Minnesota and Iowa it is a valuable wild hay grass and there called bluejoint (not to be confused with the bluest em of Nebraska, Andropogon fur cat us, nor the bluestem of the foot hills, Agropyron occidentale).

The Italian rye-grass (Lolium italicutn) was not tried at the station, but its characters are similar to those of perennial rye-grass. Both are short-lived perennials and are not well suited to permanent pasture. Where the climate is adapted to their growth, they have the advantage of giving an abundant early growth, for which reason they are to be recommended for mixtures, as they give a luxuriant growth the first season and then give way to the other grasses.

In teaching the art of stock judging it is necessary to have models of animal form tor purposes of illustration. In the University of Nebraska judging begins by placing before the students finished beef steers possessing a conformation and quality which meet the requirements of the dressed beef market and certain other characters which indicate profitable growth to the feeder. In other words, the work begins by giving the student the proper conception of high quality in the finished product and thrift in the feed lot in order that he may have something tangible as a standard to strive for in his feeding and breeding opera- Such knowledge is fundamental to the producer of high class as well as to the feeder of market stock. During the past four years ihe Department of Animal Husbandry of the University of Ne - ;i has had each year two or three choice steers bred on the farm or purchased when young within the slate. These steers are carefully &lt;&gt;r class room work and not for experimental data on the relative value of rations. To give the general public as well as matriculated students an oppor - tunity to see these si&gt;ecimens it has been the custom of the department to exhibit at the .stale and International Live Stock show each year. That a fair degree of success has been reached in selecting and fitting such individuals it will not be out of place to state that out of MM I exhibited at the Chicago International Live Stock Exposition dur - ing three years six have been prize-winners, varying from third in •.Is to the grand championship over all breeds, the whole amounting 10 $77ii in prize money. At the last International show Challenger II, a full brother to the grand champion of 1903, and Stanton were exhibited. The former won first in Hereford special, second in the open class of two-year-old grades and rross-breeds, and third in the college special.

Individual records ok each steer were begun February, 1904, at which time Challenger II weighed 1,200 pounds, and Stanton 960 pounds. During the twelve months following the former gained 780 pounds and the latter 500 pounds. The gain made by Challenger II was good for a two-year-old, taking into consideration the fact it was made during the summer season after the steer had taken on considerable flesh and had received two or three set - backs by having been transported for exhibition purposes. Both would have shown larger average monthly gains had they not been held three months after having become ripe to be used in stock judging. Challenger II gained well until he weighed 1,800 pounds, because he was larger in frame and on the later maturing order. Stanton was STANTON. CHALLENGER II strictly a baby beef type, short, very compact, extremely broad on the back and naturally thick fleshed.

Stanton consumed 4.990 pounds in that time, re - quiring 10.6 pounds of grain for each pound of gain. This shows that Stanton was placed at a greater disadvantage by virtue of being held over. He was eight months younger than Challenger hut matured four months earlier, making him mature one ypar younger. This was due in part to early feeding, but largely because of his more compact build. The illustration showing the rib and loin cuts of the two steers in comparison with a medium grade furnished by Swift ft Co., South Omaha, brings out the fact already mentioned that Rtanton was too fat. having a layer over the lean one and a half inches thick, while Challenger, the larger steer, had but one inch. Nevertheless Stanton showed a remark - ably high percentage of high-priced meat. Challenger TT was somewhat lower and the medium grade considerably below, as shown by its size in the illustration. The fat and lean in Challenger's carcass were perfectly mixed, giving the marbling sought for in dressed beef. The presence of the large flakes of fat in the lean made his meat tender, juicy and at the same time less wasteful than though more fat had been distributed outside the lean. Tn the marbling the medium grade was deficient. rhe carcass demonstration was made in connection with a fine dis - of packing house products prepared for the students of the T T niver- School of Agriculture through the courtesy of Swift ft Co. The rations fed the two steers are as follows: February 3. 1904. Challenger was receiving Ifi pounds of grain per day. This was increased In IS pounds March 3. and to 21 pounds April 30. He was then given grass pasture during the day. on account of which the grain ration was dropped to Ifi pounds per day. This was again increased to IS pounds June 3. 21 pounds August 3. 23 pounds October 23. and 27 pounds Novem - ber 3. During the latter part of November the ration was again re - duced on account of the trip to the Chicago show. At no time was more than 27 pounds fed per day. This was considered a very heavv ration and It was necessary to&gt; be extremelv careful about being irregular. He wm heavily fed because of a lack of flesh shortly before the stock show. Stanton received Februarv 3. 1904. 13 pounds of grain per day. This wu increased to 15 pounds April 30. when he also was given grass pasture and the grain ration dropped to 12 pounds per day. This was again In - creased until 16 pounds was fed in November. At first, both steers were fed fhe same ration consisting of corn 50 per cent, oats 20 per rent, bran 20 per cent, and oil meal 10 per cent. They were given in addition a few beets June 9 the bran wan reduced to 10 per cent and 10 per cent of wheat added.

Kirough the recent general use of hand separators by farmers anU men of the stale, the interest in calf rearing has been greatly j n . K'his industry is by no means a small one, as some twenty thousand ■rators are now bein^ used throughout the state and each hand rator rapraaeata a farm where calves an reared on skim-milk. To this valuable by-product to the l&gt;esl advantage is a problem worthy in li study and investigation. §,iring of ISH'.i the Department of Dairy Husbandry has been ict ing experiments in calf rearing by using hand separator skim - and light rations of grain. The first test was published in Bulletin No. 68 of this Station and with a comparison of calves reared by hand with those sucking their dams. The hand-fed calves were reared on skim-milk, ground flax - seed being used to replay the lacking butter-fat. This test resulted in lot of calves reared at a very low cost, but it also brought out the fact that much more data were needed in the way of comparing rations used witli skim-milk. THE EXPERIMENT THE FOODSTL t KS THAT WKKK COM I II the fall of 19(11 an experiment was planned to test some rations in fat to replace the absent butter fat in skim-milk. Owing to com - its from feeders that flaxseed-meal was often difficult to obtain, it thought advisable to use the commercial oil-meal for one ration, this ? a product mtf to procure in almost any part of the country. The other feeds were by-products of glucose factot . germ oil-meal 5 one and corn-oil the other. The corn-oil is pressed from the corn-germ and resembles a light oil in appearance but has a strong corn flavor. The corn-germ oil-meal is what is left after the oil has been pressed from the germ. This meal con - tains about ten per cent fat and resembles corn-meal but has a more uniform grain and a higher per cent of digestible nutrients. •Bull. 87. Agr. Exp. Station of Neb. Vol. XVII. Art.

This could not be done, as the oil was much lighter than the milk and would not mil by such a slight agitation. A twenty-gallon lorrel churn was then used to emulsify the oil and milk by churning. This was successful, and a very palatable emulsion could be made by churning; from four to five minutfs The emulsion whs not lasting but would hold for about twenty minutes which was long enough to last while the calves were being fed. It was found necessary to make a two per cent mixture instead of three as the food proved too laxative and even at the lower per cent it was difficult to feed.

MKI.K K Pure milk is a subject of public interest, and of all our common foods l&gt;er!iaps none is more easily contaminated. The recent custom ii braska of grading cream )&gt;y &lt; lie acid test has aroused added interest in enting the product from touring or accumulating bad flavors. Eilk contamination takes place largely during the process of milking, ially when the cows are kept in the barn. It was. therefore, thought j.rt with investigations along this first and most troublesome e of infection, namely, milking. The plan of the experlakmt was to test a number of advocated methods of lessening mill; contamination. To do this, four cows were sei i he University dairy herd, all uniform in breed, weight, and time of lactation, so as to avoid, as much as possible, variation among in lal animals. They were treated before each milking in the follow ing man: The udder of cow No. 1, Diana, was sponged with water. The udder of cow No. 2, Annie, was sponged with a five pi -olution of car acid. The udder of cow No. 3, Hattie, was rubbed with vaseline. The udder of cow No. 4, Cora, was not treated, but the dust merely brushed off with the milker's hand as in the usual way. The animals were tested both in the barn and out-of-doors. Exposures also taken to compare cement and wood floors with and without Exposures were also made in the barn, both when the cows • nt and when they were absent, to determine the condition of , r.

SOIL AND CIJMATK OK KHKKSON GOVERNMENT IN RUSSIA IThe Kherson government of Russia lies in the Black Earth region ernozem). The soil is, tl in general the ordinary rich k earth common in that region, which is very similar to that of own Great Plains. In general, the soil of Kherson is well adapted grain growing, this province being, in fact, a |&gt;art of the great grain uring region of the country. I 'he climate is interesting in certain features. It is similar to thai r Great Plains, but possesses I ner extremes of heat and and is more uncertain as to rainfall. The average rainfall for June and July, the three wettest months in southern Kherson, is . 5.5 inches, and the average rainfall for the year is 16 inches. The all, therefore, for the ihree months mentioned is more than one - as much as that for the entire year. This corresponds to similar res of the climate in Nebraska and Kansas, but the entire annual ill is much less than in this country. At North Platte, Nebraska, distance west of the 106th meridian, the annual rainfall is nearly •Bull. 82, Agr. Exp. Station of Nebr. Vol. XVI, Art. III. </seg>
            <seg id="p349">347 ." inches. In southern Kherson, therefore, where the Kherson oat originated, the climate is very much drier than in Nebraska as far west &gt;rth Plat I p. The variety, therefore, ought to be adapted to a large portion of western Nebraska." DESCKIITIOX OF THE KHERSON OAT The plant is a vigorous, lmt not a rank grower. The, straw is shor and on the same land it squids slimier than any other oat tested at th • &gt;n, although the "Sixty Day," another Russian variety, lately im ■ I by the United States Department of Agriculture, j 3 nearly as short. The leaves are very broad, and expose a large surface. Th iireadinu:. i. e., it is not a side oat. The lorries are ligl yellow in color, small but numerous, and have a very thin hull.

The Kherson oat is peculiarly suited to central and western Nebrask on account of its habits of growth.

In the three papers printed below the president of the United States ury of a great lumber company, and the chief of the Bureau o ]&gt;■ show that forestry is necessary for the' perpetuation of the • r inilusiry in this country. The statement is not new, but never • has il been, given such authority, nor has the urgent ne. iy on lumber tracts been so emphatically set forth. Three men in positions thai ampaj them to regard such a question from differen points — the president regarding it as a national problem, Mr irmick from the standpoint of a lumberman. Mr. Pinchot from tha of a forester — have reached practically the same conclusion. Presl Roosevelt declares that forestry is "in many ways the moat vita internal problem in the United States," and that "the very existei. lumbering depends upon the success of our work as a nation in putting ■al forestry into effective operation." Mr MK'ormick calls atteu iion to the critical condition of the lumber industry, recommends th i.e of conservative lumbering wherever it pays, and calls the work lans for limber iracls prepared by the Hureau of Fon best business paMef for their management, based on a thorough ex per inalion."

            <seg id="p354">352 NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AUKIi 'Ul-TURE. ■ ■. ation of Um woods of the United States. I am glad to ■ae here this evening not only the officials, including the head of the Department of Agriculture, but such men as Governor Richards, who most concerned in carrying out the policy of the Department of the Interior, because the forest policy of any country must be an essential part of its land policy. And now, first and foremost, you can never afford to forget for on moment what is the object of our forest policy. That object is not I preserve the forests because they are beautiful, though that is goo in itself, nor because they are refuges for the wild creatures of th ness, though that, too, is good in itself; but the primary objec of our forest policy, as of the land policy of the United States, is th making of prosperous homes. It is a part of the traditional poll home making of our country. Every other consideration conies an secondary. The whole effort of the government in dealing with th s must be directed to this end, keeping in view the fact that it i .iily necessary to start the homes as prosperous, but to keep them That is why the forests have got to be kept. You can start •runs home by destroying the forests, but you can not keep prosperous that way. And you are going to be able to make that policy permanently th policy of the country only in so far as you are able to make the peopl at large, and, above all, the people concretely interested in the result in the different localities, appreciative of what it means. Itupres upon them the full recognition of the value of its policy, and mak them earnest and zealous adherents of it. Keep in mind the fact tha in a government such as ours it is out of the question to imi&gt;&lt; like this from without. The policy, as a permanent policy, can come only from the intelligent conviction of the people themselve that it is wise and useful; nay, indispensable. We shall decide, in th long run, whether or not we are to preserve or destroy the forests o the Kocky Mountains accordingly as we are or are not able to mak ■eople of the mountain states hearty believers in the policy o forest preservation. . That is the only way in which this policy can be made a permanent success. You must convince the people of the truth — and it is the truth — that the success of home makers depends in the long run upon the wisdom with which the nation takes care of its forests. That seems a strong statement, but it is none too strong. I yourselves have got to keep this practical object before you to remember that a forest which contributes nothing to th progress, or safety of the country is of no interest to the gov it and should be of little interest to the forester. Your atten ust be directed to the preservation of the forests, not as an en If, but as a means of preserving and increasing the prosperit nation. ""Forestry is the preservation of forests by wise use," to quote a </seg>
            <seg id="p355">353 minds that definition. Forestry does not mean abbreviating that use; it means making the forest useful not only to the settler, the rancher, the miner, the man who lives in the neighborhood, but, indirect!;?, to the man who may live hundreds of miles off down the cours3 of some great river which has had its rise among the forest-bearing mountains. ihe forest problem is in many ways the most vital internal problem tie United states. The more closely this statement is examined more evident its truth becomes. In the arid region of the west ■ulture depends first of all upon the available water supply. In a region forest protection alone can maintain the stream flow ssary for irrigation, and can prevent the great and destructive s so ruinous to communities farther down the same streams that in the arid regions. Ihe relation between the forests and the whole mineral industry is •xtremely intimate one; for, as every man who has had experience he west knows, mines can not be developed without timber— lly not without timber close at hand. In many regions through - the arid country ore is more abundant than wood, and this means if the ore is of low grade, the transportation of timber from any ince being out of the question, the use of the mine is limited by imount of timber available. Ee very existence of lumbering, of course — and lumbering is the i great industry of the United States — depends upon the success r work as a nation in putting practical forestry into effective ion. Is it is with mining and lumbering, so it is in only a lees degree transportation, manufactures, commerce in general. The relation 11 of these industries to forestry is of the most intimate and Ddent kind. It is a matter for congratulation that so many of &gt; great industries are now waking up to this fact; the railroads ■ially. managed as they are by men who are compelled to look d, who are obliged by the very nature of their profession to ?ss a keen insight into the future, have awakened to a clearer zation of the vast importance of the economic use both of timber of forests. •■n the grazing industry, as it is carried on in the great west, h might at first sight appear to have little relation to forestry, is nevertheless closely related to it, because great areas of winter range, available and good for winter grazing, would be absolutely useless without the summer range in the mountains where the forest ■ ves lie. Pi all of you know, the forest resources of our country are already usly depleted. They can be renewed and maintained only by the prat ion of the forester with the practical man of business in all ypes. t^ut above all, with the lumberman. And the most striking encouraging fact in the forest situation is that lumbermen are 12 </seg>
            <seg id="p356">354 hat practical lumbering and practical forestry are allies, not .ind that the future of each depends upon the other. The resolutions passed at tiie last meeting of the representatives of the -is, which occurred here in Washington, were a strik - ing proof of this .act and a most encouraging feature of the present ion. So long as we could not make the men concerned in the realize that the foresters were endeavoring to in their interest and not against them, the headway that could le made was ijut small. We shall be able to work effectively and . about important results of a permanent character largely in mivince those men, the men at the head &lt;&gt;f tl. business, of the practical wisdom of what the foresters -sates are seeking to accomplish. tthe last analysis, the attitude of the lumbermen toward your will he the chief factor in the success or failure of that work, ler words, gentlemen, I can not too often say to you, as, indeed, i not bo too often said to any body of men of high ideals and training who are endeavoring to accomplish work of for the count ry, 'hat you must keep your ideals high and yet seek to realize them in practical ways.

Nowhere else is the development of a country more closely bound up with the creation and execution of a judicious forest policy. This is. irse. especially true of the west, but it is true of the east also. . nately, in the west we have been able, relatively to the growth of the country, to begin at an earlier day. so that we have been able to establish great forest reserves in the Rocky Mountains instead of having to wait and attempt to get congress to pay large sums for their on. as we are now endeavoring to do in the Southern Appalachians. In the administration of the national forest reserves, in the intro - duction of conservative lumbering on the timber tract of the lumber - man and the wood lot of the farmer, in the practical solution of forest problems which affect well nigh every industry and every activity of the nation, the members of this .in unexampled field before them.

You have made a good beginning, and I congratulato upon it. Not only is a sound national forest policy coming rapidly into being, but the luml&gt;errr.en of the country are proving their interest in forestry by practicing it. Twenty years ago a meeting such as this to-night would have bee impossible, and the desires we here express would have been treate&lt; as having no possible relation to practical life. I think that since th present secretary of agriculture first came into congress here there has been a complete revolution in the attitude of the public mind toward th question. We have reached a point where American foresters trained in American forest schools are attacking American forest problems wit Ms. That is the way to meet the larger work you have before you You must instill your own ideals into the mass of your fellow-men am at the same time show your ability to work with them i practical an&lt; business fashion.

Statistics point Estimates of timber resources still remaining point to it also. But rongest proof lies in the conditions which already affect our industry. It is just cause for congratulation that so far as the actual harvesting </seg>
            <seg id="p358">356 NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. of timber and its manufacture Into lumber is concerned, American lumber men are far ahead of those of any other country in enterprise, Ingenuity and skill in methods and machinery. But in spite of the money saved in lumbering by better methods, we are obliged to charge more and more for our lumber in order to manufacture it at a profit. In every operation in the woods and in the mill rigid economy is necessary now instead o the loose and lavish methods under which it was possible formerly to make lumbering a profitable business. We have gone so far already tha it is probable we can not materially lower the cost of our product in the re. Labor-saving devices can never in themselves prove an adequat remedy. The trouble lies, not in the cost of manufacture, but in the dwind ling supplies of the timber Itself. It is not necessary to turn to statistics for proof that the supply o certain kinds of valuable timber trees of the United States is rapidl failing, of others is practically gone, and of still others has entirel vanished as a factor in the lumber market. For example, ten years ago M of balsam in the manufacture of paper pulp was practically nn n. The eastern hemlock is now valuable for its timber as we as for its bark. A more modern instance is the gradual rise in impo of the western hemlock, until very recently altogether discredited as a timber tree, although, in fact, of great commercial power. Th red fir of the northwest and the southern pines are rapidly invadin markets formerly controlled altogether by the white pine of the nort il states, while species of peculiar value, such as black walnut ant cherry, have practically vanished from the market in the grades •i once were common. The southern pines are being destroyed wit idity which finds its parallel only in the case of northern whit pine. It is true that the list of commercial timbers lengthens from yea ar. Just as the balsam is taking the place of the spruce, so are tutes coming in for other woods which no longer exist in sufficien quantity to supply the demand. But neither can this prove a sufficien remedy. The supply of the substitutes will be exhausted in its turn, an the final situation will be worse than that which confronts us now. is no longer a question of methods of manufacture, or of substitutes fo exhausted supplies. The time for us to look after the trees themselves has in many cases already arrived. ■istics of the merchantable timber still standing in this couiftry are difficult to make because the forest area is vast, and for large portions we are without accurate knowledge. But in Mr. Henry Gannett's report upon lumber, in the Twelfth Census of the United States, he has made good use of the data at hand, and he presents facts which are Meant, based upon information sufficient to sustain them I wish to call your attention to a few of these. There is probably no forest in the world so immense, so accessible, so easy to lumber, and so regular in the high quality of its timber as was the great pinery which occupied the region of the Great Lakes and of the Upper Mississippi. The forests of Michigan, Wisconsin, and </seg>
            <seg id="p359">357 Minnesota originally contained a stand of about 350.000,000,000 feet Of this Michigan had about 150,000,000,000; Wisconsin, 130.000.000,000; and Minnesota about 70,000,000,000 feet. Lumbering began in Michigan and Wisconsin during the thirties, and was of small importance until arly seventies. Since then the great pinery has been cut over in a way unprecedented in lumbering. In 1873 the cut was about 4,000,000,000 feet It reached high-water mark in 1892, when it was over 8,500,000,000 Since then it has steadily fallen, and in 1902 it was a little over To the enormous total of about 188,000,000,000 feet cut In the last thirty years there must be added about 28,000,000,000 feet, or 15 per- cent, for laths, shingles, and minor produce, making a total of 216, - 000,000,000 feet. Fifty billion feet were probably cut prior to 1873, which would bring the total product of the lake states to about 265,000,00&lt;X^OO As the estimate of the original stand amounted to about 35/ ■&gt;0 feet, it would seem that after the cut of 1902, exclusive of second growth, there were 85.000.000.000 feet standing. There are, however, by careful estimate, not more than 35,000.000.000 feet of merchantable timber, which also includes undoubtedly a considerable amount of second growth. Of the vast discrepancy only a part can be put down to error, since w« know enough of the fire history of these states to ascribe the loss of "00 feet to fire. These figures show that it is a safe an'! servaMve statement that the end of the white pine is near, and that ten - will see it disappear as an important factor in the lumber trade. ihe present stand of yellow pine in the southern states has been d by Mr. R. A. Long, in a paper read before the annual meeting of Southern Lumber Manufacturers' Association, to be about 137 00 feet. About 163,000,000,000 feet have probably been lumbered idy. For the census year of 1900 the total cut of yellow pine was l as nearly 10.000.000,000 feet. These figures show that at the present of consumption the present stand of longleaf yellow pine will b« listed long before a second crop can be produced to take its place. It is not necessary to multiply instances. It would merely be to pro - vou with facts of which you have a keen realization already. The lumber industry ranks fourth among the great industries of the TTnlted States. It has, in my judgment, done more to develop this country than any other private enterprise except the railroads, and the rapid growth of the latter would in many cases have been impossible without the par - allel development of lumbering. But in lumbering, as in all other great private industries, the necessity for care is not seen until the harm has been done and until the results of it are bitterly felt. We have reached the point now when we are often unable to supply the enormous demand for lumber which we have fostered. We must look to the production of a ,&lt;1 crop upon lumbered lands or prepare to stop lumbering when the first crop is gone. In the old days it was easy to lumber one forest and then turn to another. To-day, however, we can not count upon new fields to turn to. We must make the best of what we have, and wherever it pays we must lumber conservatively. </seg>
            <seg id="p360">358 Practical forestry means conservative lumbering. The question whether conservative lumbering pays depends upon whether the value of the second crop upon lumbered lands is sufficient to make it a profitable en - terprise to foster and protect it, and in many cases the time has already come when practical forestry is a good business investment for lumber - men. We have received a good deal of abuse for what has been called our vandalism — abuse which was unreasonable and which was not ac - companied by pertinent suggestions for reform; but now the Bureau of Forestry of the Cnited States Department of Agriculture puts the ques - tion of conservative lumbering in a way which makes it worthy the at - tention of lumbermen. It is the attitude of this Bureau that forestry and lumbering are allies, not enemies, and that the interests of one de - pend directly upon those of the other. The Bureau does not claim that forestry is the panacea for every lumberman's troubles, nor that it is now applicable to every timber tract in this country. It simply holds Itself in readiness to assist lumbermen in applying practical forestry to their holdings in those cases in which it is evident that conservative lumber - ing will pay. The Bureau of Forestry does not deal with forest problems merely in a general way. It gives each timber tract upon which its as - sistance is requested a careful study on the ground, and it draws up its final plan for management with due regard to the purpose and point of of the lumberman. In other words, its work is eminently practical and businesslike, not purely scientific and theoretical. Krhe advice given by the Bureau of Forestry in its working plans the handling of timber tracts is, in a word, the best business policy their management based on a thorough expert examination.

It is only a few days since President Roosevelt, speaking to the y of American Foresters, a body of professional foresters, said that in the final analysis the success of forestry must depend upon the &lt;!e of the lumbermen toward it. That view is accepted and be - lieved by no one more completely than by the foresters, and it is, first of all, for that reason that I am glad of this opportunity to say a word to you. I realize that the great majority of the timber lands of the 1 States will pass through your hands first or last, and that upon your attitude toward them will depend the final result not only to you in your business but to the nation at large in the perpetuation of ita • Address delivered before convention of National Lumber Manufac - turers' Association, Washington, D. C, April 20, 1903. </seg>
            <seg id="p361">359 One of the recent tendencies in the lumber business has been to reduce waste in every possible direction. You have taken this up first of all in the mill; it has gone from the mill to the woods and the methods of logging, and in many parts of the country has already begun to affect methods of cutting. This tendency to avoid waste, to make better use of natural resources, is not confined to the lumber trade by any means. It is characteristic now of all the industries of the • 1 States, and is the logical outcome of the economic situation. Just as, in my belief, the interest of the lumbermen in forestry must necea - sarily be the logical outcome of the economic conditions under which the lumber business is placed. You have naturally and logically moved forward step by step in this progress of eliminating waste, making more out of the material with which you have to work. It is perfectly logical and natural, therefore, that the next step for you to consider is the use of your standing timber, not merely for itself alone but also In relation to the value of the land to you later on. That is the whole essence of forestry. As President Roosevelt has phrased it, "The principal idea in forestry is the preservation of forests by wise use." and the conception upon which the w.hole matter is based is simply the question of whether or not you intend to get a second crop. Eie old idea that the forester was the enemy of the lumberman, and, i all, the enemy of cutting timber, disappeared long ago from the b of foresters, or rather friends of forestry — for no true forester vnr it — and is rapidly disappearing from your minds and those of other srmen. And that is perhaps the happiest aspect of the whole situa for the perpetuation alike of your industry and of forestry depends your attitude toward this single question: Do you or do you not d to get a second crop? I am very far from wanting to discuss with you the supplies of stand - timber or the prospect of a timber famine — questions with which yoo more familiar than I am: hut it is perfectly obvious that the supplies srtain kinds of timl&gt;er are rapidly disappearing, that the lumber trade ailing hack year by year on poorer material and longer hauls, and the question of its continuance is already demanding an answer. This is purely a business proposition which I want to lay before you, to be considered, accepted, or I on a business basis. Forestry deal with the forest in some ways with which you have but an indirect interest. I am not talking now at. out the effect of forests on the flow of streams, on winds, or on the general prosperity — matters of vital im - portance in their place; but the question I want to bring to you is simply this: Is it worth your while, from a commercial point of view, to con - sider the forest as a part of your plant, and from that point of view should you cut off your timber and let the land go back for taxes? tet us take an illustration. Suppose any one of you has a tract of er land in Arkansas, for example — for we have some good figures that state. You find that under certain conditions, which make tically no difference in the cost of getting out your logs — and it is </seg>
            <seg id="p362">360 NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. the business of the Bureau of Forestry to ascertain what those condi are — you can get a second crop of the same amount oft that land in forty years. It will be a man's tendency, as it was mine when begin this work, to think of forty years as a very long time, a period •ul ordinary calculation, hardly worth while to figure on. Neverthe - less. if I interpret the economic tendency of the country at all rightly look farther ahead now than they once did, and it is very wel h their while to do so. We will say that in forty years you can ge a second crop on that land equal to the first. We take the stumpage a resent value, with taxes as they now stand, and we estimate the f protection against fire and theft. We find in this particula case that the returns on the capital invested for those forty years is 6 &gt;-nt net. That is calculated on the basis of the present value o ac*. W« all know that the value of stumpage will increase largely in forty years. The matter becomes, then, simply a question of whethe or not it is worth your while to take the incidental risk and hold your land for forty years rather than to put your money into something else I is not a question of whether you will put the money back into you land after taking the timber off of it, but whether you will take the r off in such a way that when you have cut over the land it will be •idition to go on producing timber without further expense. Either niter land Is part of the manufacturing plant, or it is not, and tha whole difference. If you are the owner of a mill, as of course you all are, you must ■esessarily consider, if you want to keep that mill in permanent opera tion. how much land you need to grow timber to supply you with your cut. Then you have a complete plant which is like a machine turning out material for its own needs. From the point of view ■ forester, where a business question is as clear cut as that, it be - comes as foolish to destroy the productive capacity of your land as it : be for the owner of a machine shop, when he had an order for a shaft or a cog wheel, to take that shaft or cog wheel out of his own/ nery and sell it rather than make his machines produce it. As ! -aid. and repeat, this is purely a business question. The Bureau of Forestry offers certain assistance to lumbermen in ihe basis upon which such questions can be most intelligently ■il. What it does is simply to put a certain amount of trained skil •ur command. You pay the expense and we prepare for you the recessary figures. The way we do it is to send a man to the spot who out what there is on the ground, with special reference to the sma; how fast each diameter class of trees grows, how much will be left of certain sizes after cutting out others, and how much wll be standing to the acre after a definite number of years. We put the thing purely and entirely on a business basis. ■ese methods of forestry are not at present as fully applicable every - in the United States as they will be later on, and it is as far from Hile to want to urge any man to adopt the methods of forestry </seg>

The arrangement we make with timber •ra is never that they shall be compelled to apply the plans we sub - hut always that they shall* apply them or not as they find it wisest &gt;. I would be exceedingly sorry if any man should take up a propo - n in forestry and apply it if he was not confident it would turn out because this is not a question of a few days or merely for present itions. What I have been describing to you is, of course, only one of the ways in which the Bureau of Forestry is attempting to serve the lumber in - terests of the United States. Another is a very extensive series of timber testa which we are just taking up to learn the comparative merits of different timbers for different purposes; and there are many others, some dealing directly with the lumber interests and some indirectly. But the essence of what I have to say to you to-day is simply that this matter of practical forestry is presented to you as a business proposition, to be accepted or rejected as a business proposition, and that my interest In it and the object of my presence here is simply to ask you whether it is worth your while to consider your forests as a part of your plant or whether it is better worth your while to abandon them after they hare I shall be very glad, indeed, if I can answer any questions which may come up now or later on, and I shall be especially glad if I or any other member of the Bureau of Forestry can be of use to you, individually or collectively, in any possible direction. There has been too long a feeling that the foresters were trying to force the lumbermen to do something or other against the lumbermen's will. I think it is time for the lumbermen to give the Bureau of Forestry a chance to do some things which they would like to have it do. </seg>

Our exhibit as a whole was fitted up for us. Some of the states paid from two to three thousand dollars for the artistic work done in putting up their dairy exhibit.

That exhibit inem something like $3,000 for the artistic work. Indiana came with a very fine exhibit, a commercial exhibit of butter, but showing no artistic frills or anything of the kind. The next was Nebraska's dairy it whirh is thus described in the report of our state commissioners: "It consisted of the usual space assigned each state in the refrigeration in devoted entirely to the greatest display of butter and cheese made in the world. Nebraska's display in reality consisted of two ex): installed at different times during the season. The first was strictly a commercial exhibit wherein was shown the wonderful growth and de - ment of the dairy industry of Nebraska during the last five years. A map showing the position of the. 2t&gt;,OuO hand separators in the state that made a part of this exhibit, attracted great attention. Later in the season a cornucopia modeled of butter, from which flowed a stream of yellow butter, was substituted, with the legend Nebraska's liquid gold, $20,000,000 annually.' "In the installation of this dairy exhibit the Nebraska commission was assisted by the payment of |500 on the part of the Beatrice Crea: Company of Lincoln, the Hygeia Creamery Company of Omaha, and the Fairmont Creamery Company of Fairmont. This money was subscribed with the understanding that it should be used only to pay the cost of refrigeration during the season." In recognition of the excellence of its dairy exhibit Nebraska was awarded a gold medal. * Read before the Nebraska Dairymen's Association. </seg>

I stayed with the exhibit four months, or until November 3rd, when I was ordered to turn over its care to the general committee after which I returned home, arrivng on election day. What was done with the material of this exhibit I do not know nor do I know its cost and maintenance. As a commercial and instructive exhibit it was the equal of any. We paid less than $100 for labor of ta and decorations while some of our competitors paid thousands of dollars for such labor and materials. Of one thing I am thoroughly convinced: If you wish to make an exhibit as an advertisement for products or for the state don't smother your exhibit with artistic work; K e products speak for themselves. The butter exhibit was one of the most attractive on the exposition grounds. It was viewed by thou - sands of visitors every day and often a thousand to two thousand — by actual count, passed in one hour between our table and our exhibit and day hundreds came inside our railing to ask about Nebraska. Our r was only bait, as it were, to get people to stop and lnauire. and it ■1 its purpose well. Being nearly always there, we could talk Ne - braska and her facilities to an appreciative audience. In the butter Rooring contest we only had a sinele trial. The dairy industry, or the butter making part of it, Is conducted In such a man - ner that private dairies were not seeking a market for a few pounds of high scoring butter and so would not have been materially benefited by having butter adored: neither did our State Commission feel Justified in expending monev for expenses to have a large butter display, so that when the cush premiums were awarded Nebraska was not in It. Our state is making rapid strides in her advancement in the dairy line of work. Located as we are and with our rich feeds, there is no reason why we should not take the front seat, and keen it. too. Last year our dairy product was worth twenty millions: this year let's make it five millions In agricultural hall th»re was in operation what was termed "The Model Dairy." Here all the modern machinerv and appliances were In active operation, and here one of our Nebraska boys, Charles Mellick. was chief buttermaker. In the cow barns was the center of attraction: a battle going on there to which the world was looking and in which cow keeper was to some extent interested. There were kept fifty or sixty cows of different breeds, selected as representatives of dairy la to fight for 120 davs .to decide which was the better breed. These had been selected by experts and on account of their known work. Every device that ingenuity could suggest or money buy for their comfort was obtained. Every feed that the chemist thought might add another ounce to their milk and butter production was given them. The whole conntrv was scoured to find attendants to suit. v milking was weighed: all the feed weighed or measured: each milking tested.

This was also a battle of brains; the care given there was all that could lought of and in no other way could such results have been obtained. The question is often asked, "Of what use to the farmer has this contest been?" It has demonstrated to every one the fact that to do her best the cow must be given comfort, rest and feed and that such attention pays; that sometimes fairly good cows, by having extra attention and care, can be made to pay pretty well: that the cow that is bred right and fed right will pay a handsome Income to her owner.

            <seg id="p372">370 HINTS ON PROFITABLE DAIRYING.* HENRY C. GI.T88MAH, OMAHA. Erying in our state, within the past few years, has undergone a change. The general system of dairying has changed from that ne dairying, or the making of butter on the farm, to that of rcial dairying, or the shipping of cream to some centrally located &gt;ry or butter factory, and there made into butter. R taken an a whole this change has no doubt been a change for the !, for in the short snaee of ten years. Nebraska has advanced from twentieth to the tenth state in the rank of butter production. Great aa this change in the system of dairying has been. I believe that there are still many places where home dairying can be practiced at a greater profit, than can be had by selling cream. Location as to market and natural surroundings for the proper taking care of cream and butter must be considered: an article enual to. or superior to. the best creamerv butter must be produced and private customers for onr product must be secured, and to make the greatest profit we must sell direct to the consumer. ■for over twentv vears. at home, we have operated a home dairv. and aa vet have not been able to figure out bow we could make more money out of our cows than bv makine 35-cent butter. BeVnsr located near * laree city we have no trouble to get customers for all the butter we can produce, and what is more, we do not fear the competition of "Idelwild." "Meadowpold." or anv other brand or make of butter. Tn the production of our butter we use the following method: Im - mediately after eacb milklnf. the milk is separated and the cream cooled to a temnerature of at least KR decrees Fahr.. skim milk being fed to calves, niers and rmultrv while worm. The cream 1&lt; riiwnert In 8ve-p»11on shoteim cans and Is churned in a dasber churn, onerated bv horse-nower. Twenty to thirty pounds of butter are usually rhnrned at a time. Immediately after churnlnar. the butter is salted and worked and put un In rolls or crnrV-s. We make dpllvprv everv Saturdav. and along with the butter sell all the eggs, poultry and vegetables we pro - duce, alwavs getting a good margin above market prices for the same. hHeflv. is the method Vn vo«me at our borne dairv. aid one that no doubt can be profitably followed bv a good many others. But how to make tbp dairy business In Npbraska. as a whole more profitable, is perhaps the homing question of the day. And to this ion I would answer, oduc^to our rx&gt;onle In tho nr1n&lt;*1nles of dalrv - ing and brine to bear on them the necessity of culling their dairy For there are too manv "star boarders" in the herds of oi" state that must be replaced by cows that will yield a profit.

And it is iuv conviction that the time has come when we t to have a closer weeding out of the dairy herds of our state. Another important course that must be followed is the grading up of dairy herds. More pure-bred dairy sires must be placed at the head of the dairv herds, and the owners must make up their minds whether they are going to dairy as dairymen or just milk for pastime. The milk producer must specialize in the selection of his cows and must noi txnt-'t to make a very large profit out of the milk produced il a beef herd.

(he education of the people in the principles of dairying, is perhaps most ot.stinate barrier to profitable dairying. "It is hard to teach &gt;ld dog new tricks" is an old saying, but it is nevertheless a very It is hard to get the older dairymen interested in anything tends to the uplifting of the dairy industry, for but comparatively of the so-called dairymen of our state realize what an enormous lint of wealth the old cow is bringing to us; and it remains for us to ti the younger men, who are in the formative period of existence, principles of butter making and thereby hope to get an interest in png that we cannot get in any other way.

To qualify for this degree, I do not that one must simply be able to make good butter or cheese, ae able to handle scientifically every branch of dairying, from g and care of the cow in the barn to the proper marketing of the milk and its products. Before closing.

The point to l:e covered by this talk is the necessity of judging or grad - ing cream according to the quality. There was some question raised, par - iily one this morning in regard to the grading of cream for butter fat, and I shall sneak on that point first; for instance, the charge was made that cream is tested sometimes incorrectly, and sometimes not at all and frequently by incompetent men. If this be true, it is a serious it is on the Las is of this grading and testing that the r fat is paid for.

One case in particular came to my attention Tt occurred on Decoration Day In the town of Arnold. Custer countv. Nebraska. The operator went away on that day and It was found in chewing over his test for that day that It didn't hold out investieation showed that he had not made the test but that he had e-uessed at the whole bunch, and he was discharged. E. Barrett: Did you look over the records of these stations from i day with a view to ascertain whether the per cent of fat was the or nearlv so. from flay to day. or did the records show that each cream received was tested. Mr. HrvMAv: I have not done that In every m ; n some ease* T have and the results have been satisfactory. Khe charge ?s sometimes ma^e that the cream does not run uniform after day. one day the cream will test high, another dav it will test There are plentv of reasons for that but I have not time at pres - o go into that branch of the subject. In the matter of grading the nuality of cream we are a very con - servative people. We do like new thiu&lt;rs. An^tMne that is new we are likely to question We are famillnr with the sradfne bv qual ; ' cattle, of anvthlng and everything that we sell except cream. We know that butter made from the hand separator is not of good r in the market. We know that our sister states of Minnesota and Wis - consin produce better butter than does Nebraska. Kansas or even Iowa. In these states of Minnesota and Wisconsin the hand separator is not In as common use as in Nebraska or possihlv Iowa. A prominent creamery company in this state and \v Kansas have always been behind In the quality of a considerable per cent of their product. They have w*i this as an excuse for paying less monev for butter fat than is paid in the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin. They say they canno* butter for as much owing to the condition under which they are obliged fiake it out of that kind of cream and say that thev are not warranted Hying as good prices as th"y would otherwise for butter fat. 'W «k I asked the manager of one of our large creamery companies why comuanv did not pay more for butter fat. He said if we got all </seg>
            <seg id="p378">376 Eality cream we could pay more for butter fat, but -we do not get -class quality cream. If this be true, and it Is true, they could pay ' they got all first-class quality cream. It is a sufficient excuse grading; of cream as to quality. Let us consider what happens when we do not grade cream fo quality. If there is a person present, a merchant who does a cred business, he knows that the men who buy roods and pay their bills, pa not only their own bills but also the bills of the men who do not pa If the merchant makes a profit he makes it from the man who pavs h bills and he must therefore charge enough so that the man who pav his bills shall pay for the wan who does not pay. The same is true 1 the case of producers of good and bad cream. The bad finality of crea lowers the quality of the butter so that it sells for less 'n the marke If that is true, then it must be true that the creamery company whic will make a profit, must pay enough less to cover !t. Th" man wh furnishes cream capable of making better butter, or butter which woul sell for more, must take less for his cream than it is -worth in orde that the man who is furnishing cream which makes poor butter sha get a little more for his cream than it is worth. So I maintain that there is fmt as much justice in the grading of cream for auslitv as there is for grading your cattle in the market, or »re Is for grading anythine. How does it work out? Since this erartlng of cream, as it is now practiced in Nebraska, has been put into operation, everv creamery company of those who have adopted this svstem of pradrnp. have cut down their receipts of second prade cre&lt;im from forty per cent to elphteen per cent The difference in price for creamery butter varies from two to eipht cents a pound, showinp clearly that thev are gettinp more for their butter on the market. The difference of two cents a pound between the first quality and seronfl quality of cream has stimulated producers to produce enough more first claas quality so as to cut down second esrade butter from fortv to eighteen per cent. I was told that the pradinp of cream was not fair at Then I have been told there would no* be anv objection to grading ei-esm were it not that thev do not pay more for first class cream. simply cut down the price for a low quality of cream and'pay two a pound less for second grade. The creamery companies who do are are still paying the first prade price for all sorts and conditions «am. Still these companies that (Trade, admit that they have in - creased the quality and therefore the selling prices of their product. I have nothing to say In reply to this argument. As I said I am not here to apologize for anv creamery company. If the system of grading Is nsed, as these men make this argument say. to take still larger profit &gt;f the man who furnishes first prade cream, then It Is an abuse of the system and not a criticism upon the Justice or expedieticv of that m.

That being true, ust be true that the creamery company can afford to pay more for .an they did. Whether they are doing this or not I do not know, i not a part of my topic here today. I am simply speaking about the i of grading. The necessity of grading cream can be Hummed up in mree or four points as it is necessary to produce a high quality 01 n order to command the price for it. You cannot get a good price for butter fat unless the butter made from the cream is of good quality. The quality is increased by the system of grading* &gt;!. This is a matter of experience. What are the grades of cream? constitute* Brat grade cream and second grade cream? The system now in use of usins cream which tests thirty or more per cent of butter fat, and which shows less than eighteen cubic centimeters of alkali, by Mann's acid test, or less per cent than thirty-two one-hundredths of 1 per cent of hustle acid, which is about the same thing, and which con - tains no b^d Uavur, they call first grade cream, and they call secom. grade cream thai which testa less than thirty per cent of butter fat and more than thirty-two one-hundredths per cent of lactic acid and which has no Lad tiavor which would render it useless for making a food quality butter. Oni ;or leyuiring thirty per cent butter fat is that there is no necessity for transporting to the creamery an unnecessary quantity of milk and there is, therefore, no use of taking cream that will not test thirty per cent of butler fat. In the second place butler fat does not sour. Therefore the more skim-milk you get, the less per cent of butter fat in the cream and the quicker that cream will sour and the more ptible ii will t&lt;e to bad flavor and odor. Acid in cream is mined by the alkaline tablet. This has been tested in our station, and other stations have tested it. 1 can say that those tablets are all right. They do just what they say they do. They show, perhaps, not in every Ise to an absolute mathematical certainty, but they show approxi - itely in every case of 1 c. c. or 32-100 of one per cent of lactic id. That is what they are intended to show. I think they are right saying that, considering all the circumstances, it is not too much nsk that the cream shall not contain more than 32-100 of one pt acid in order to make it first grade cream. In support of this ■ say that from Purdum, a station about M8 miles distant from Lincoln, during ihe months of July and August of last year the busi - ness of receiving cream only showed 1 per cent of second grade cream. Some of this cream was hauled eight or nine miles to the receiving station and then hauled Mt miles by rail to Lincoln, where It tested only 1 per cent of second grade cream. If this is true, then there is no real reason why the farmers of Nebraska, wherever located, cannot produce first grade cream when they have sufficient instruction on this point, with this system of grading. There are people, one man I know who lives loss than five miles distant from this city and keeps a herd of </seg>

If you have ever ridden over that railroad branch you would wonder that any cream could reach the central station and be sweet. So far as I am able to state, after an impartial investigation of the butter test at ream receiving stations I think they are as just as the present &gt;d of testinir will admit. I do not think the method is right. The grading of cream is a necessity in order that hand separated cream of Nebraska shall be a reasonably good standard article in the market; and in order that this butter made from this cream shall sell in the open market at a fair and living price for the butter fat. The present system of testing cream for first and second quality seems to me to be just, so as far as it goes, and I do not think they are asking a bit too. much, except I would chanee the method of testing for butter fat. If there is any miestion that anyone would like to ask I would be pleased to answer. K. Can you take thick cream running higher than 30 per cent, which claim is necessary for first grade cream, and test it accurately by tipette? A. No, sir. Q. Then it seems to me. until they are willing to change the system of testing, not only from the standpoint of the farmer, but from one who has done testing. I think it is entirely unfair to demand above 30 per cent test. I think the thicker -you get it, the harder it is to test it with the pipette. Mr. Hinman : Yes, I think I would advocate a change in method. I think it is necessary to take 30 per cent cream. I would not advocate taking higher than 40 per cent, as you cannot get a good sample. II you run the separator at over 40 per cent, the separator is less likely to skim clean. I think the creamery company would be justified in demand - ing a heavy cream if they would be willing to test it differently. I also think that the present method works just as much of an injustice to the creamery company as it does to the patron. Mr. Hinma.n: It is to the advantage of the local operators to give Just as satisfactory a test to the farmer as he can. He is paid for the butter fat he receives and it is to his interest to keep his patrons satis - fied. I am aware that creamery companies frequently pay for butter fat they never get, just the same as they do not pay for the butter fat lo get. They claim that they pay for so much more butter fat than they get that they frequently do not get over an eighth or a tenth of run. In some cases I have teen told that from some stations they have not made anv more butter than they have paid for butter fat. It is certainly to the advantage of the operator to get as satisfactory a test for his patrons as possible. Q. Why do they object to the weighing? </seg>
            <seg id="p381">379 A. The only objection I have heard to it was that it was too much work. That the operators in many oases a small amounts of cream and do not wish to go to the trouble of weighing the test samples. Eighteen drams of cream requires quite a little bother and they say that is the reason that they o&gt; ause it is so expensive in time. Mr. Bassett: Is it not a more delicate matter to use scales and weigh a small amount of butter fat? Does it not require more skill to test by weight than it does by the pipette? Hinman: I do not think it does for the same degree of accuracy providing he had a perfect scale fixed for that purpose. If he had ordinary scales. I admit that it would be. There a: made for this particular purpose and I think that if he use these that the ordinary operator — they will have had more or less training— but the ordinary operator would be able to eet as accurate a test. t Voice: I would like to have you go out into the country and a week or two on your theory, and see if the results are not much mt. Mr. Hinman: I cannot go to-day. Q. What is the difference lptween lipette and 18 grams on 30 per cent cream test? i[R. Hinman: I don't think ouhi be very much differ I can tell you this, that the 17 fi pipette, which many nery companies, does not give you 18 grams cream. I know it is by one of our companies, and it does not test 18 grams of cream l weighed. Therefore, the more butter fat you get in the cream, less you get in the pipette. I have forgotten now. but if I am ig Professor Haecker can set me right, that is, that 18 c. c. of 30 •ent cream would weigh about 18 grams. Professor Haecker: Cream testine 2R per cent butter fat will come close to 18 grams by weight. Mr. Hinman: Then you vould have to have a trifle over 18 per cent pipette. Of course this is all worked out — the richer the cream, the more bulky it is. the lighter it sets. Kan operator who is receiving cream at the station and is testing along savR that he can test that cream with the pipette and get as and accurate results In every case, as fair and accurate as can ne by weight or by the weighing system if he says he can do that, ly that he is a good deal better guesser than I am. B. Is it fair in the grading of cream to take flret class and second cream and mix them in the same can? ■ r. Hinman: No. sir: if you do that you are likely to injure it for grade cream Mr. Bassett: Let me say a word in regard to the grading of cream. Do not let us have any heat in the discussion of it. What we want Is to discuss these matters in such a way that we will get the most benefit out of it. It is only a few years ago that we started into the system of </seg>

In the introduction of the hand separator an shipping of cream, the policy to begin with was to pay one price fo ream. I do not know, but I presume that if the people who a engaged in the creamery business who began in that way, won begin that way now. At that time the hand separator fvrnished only a small Drooortion of the cream which was used in the man facture of butter. To-day 15-16 of the creamery butter made hi th state is made out of hand separator cream. It is another conditio •ly. They soon began to receive large quantities of hand sepa cream of not the best Quality, the result was that there was put onto tl market a great deal of low grade butter. The fact that one price was paid for cream regardless of quality did not encourage any dairyman take any particular pains with the cream that be furnished. It was a paid for at one Drice. Why should any farmer take his cream to tl al stations six days in the week when he eould take it one day the week just as well and get the same price for it? All dairymen d not live within a mile or two of the cream receiving station. Some ■ ream was carted in wagons eighteen to twenty miles. The resu was that a great deal of the cream that was brought to the station was ••k old and was of inferior quality. In time the amount of this inferior qualitv of cream, second grade cream, became the major portion of he cream that the creamery men bought. So as when as in the be - ginning, they started out with the proposition that they would pay the man, or farmer, within four cents of the hi- 4 York quota - tions of creamery butter, they found thai it was an impossible thing to do and live at the business for the major portion of the cream they received would not make first grade butter. These are the facts and is no use beatine a! out the bush in regard to it. Then came the ion: "What can we do in the matter?" Shall we buy cream at or not? Any man who will sit down and give five minutes honest thoueht to the auestion will say that it can not be done, or r ought not to be done. No man expects to sell wheat weighing fifty-six pounds to the bushel at the same price that he would n for sixty pound wheat. We have been so educated along these lines as regards selling grain and stock, and why should there be any question in regard to the iustice or right of selling cream accordingly to quality? rst attempts to grade cream created a great deal of oppositon and it seemed some times as if considerable per cent of the men engaged in cream selling would go out of the business. The creamery man wants your cream. He is anxious for it and he is not going to do any - thing, if he can avoid it, that will tend to decrease the quantity of cream that vou will bring. He could not do business without the cream. . you talk about this question of grading cream to men, in a reasonable manner, they concede it is the proper thing to do. I want to mention one or two things in this connection, that the dairymen have some reasons for criticism in this matter of grading. It relates to </seg>

I said at home when the ques - tion of gradine cream came up, that we will deliver cream at the station every day and there will not be any question about it being first grade cream. I said I would rather throw the cream out doors than to have the operator tell me that the cream brought was second grade cream. Suppose I take mv cream each day to the cream receiving station; suppose the ouerator is an honest and efficient man and takes pride in his work and tests mv cream as it should be tested, and puts my cream into a can of first grade cream and ships it to the creamery at Lincoln. Suppose alone about three o'clock in the afternoon of July or August, when the sun is hot and shining, the drayman takes it to the station and places it uoon the platform to wait for the way freight to start it for Lincoln or Omaha and it stands there hour after hour in the hot sun and the train does not get there until six o'clock or even later; under such conditions stri'-tly first grade cream delivered at the cream ving station becomes a second grade cream long before it reaches the central creamerv. I urged that Mr. Hinman should discuss this question lv insist upon the grading of cream because it is just and right. I do not do it for the purpose of developing any heat between the creamerymen and the dairymen, but because it is a great big question In this state to-day, the question of buying cream according to its quality and paying for it accordingly. While as dairymen we should use ■ effort to deliver first quality of cream we should insist that the facilities of getting it to the creamerv are s-ich that it will contini sweat cream when it eets there. We can do this by publishing the facts and demanding that the railroads furnish better facilities for the transporta - tion of cream. THE IMPORTANCE OF ALFALFA TO THE DAIRY INDUSTRY OF THE STATE.* En order to make plain the great importance of alfalfa to the stry of the state, it seems best that I compare earlier ;-onditions with e of the present time. tin the year 1871. I took a homestead in the central tart of this 1 upon which I have continuously resided. We raised in the early s so little hay upon the 160 acres of land, that we had to go ce of several miles to the Platte river bottoms, to cut hay and haul iome. We would go down there in the summer and cut the hay and n during the winter haul it home. We did not know at that time • Read before Nebraska Dairymen's Association. 8. C. BA8SETT, GIUIM&gt;n </seg>
            <seg id="p384">382 t there was any plant that we could raise profitably as a fodder plant, had not come to understand the importance of the corn plant or we could cut the corn up and use it. The people who live out in central and western part of the state are under entirely different itions from the people who live in the eastern part of the state, or ■wa. Wisconsin or farther east. As you go east, if they cut up their , they must make small shocks of it in order that it may dry out, and in New York we had to spread the husked corn over the floor or on the scaffold sometimes, to dry it out. We do not have any of those conditions here. Our corn fodder dries out no matter how large shocks you make and the leaves are all gone by the time you can get the stalks to where you can feed them. We never have made very much use of com fodder because of the usual dry condition of the atmosphere in the fall of the year. ' A large portion of shocked corn is wasted in spite of every effort For years we were hoping and praying for a plant that we could r" : -"&gt; that would produce the necessary and desirable kind of food for thp iiry cow. There are no more nutritious grasses that grow than our na'ive grasses, but they are not grasses that produce a large flow of milk or a great quantity of Hitter. From them can be made very firm butter, butter that will stand shipping long distances and under not the most favorable conditions. While our native grasses are very nutritious and make the best of pasture in their season, yet in a pasture of native grasses, there is not sufficient feed for a dairy cow until about the first of June, and such pas - tures begin to fail early in Sentember. In this paper let it be understood that I speak largely of conditions which prevail in central Nebraska. more especially in Buffalo countv. None of our native grasses are what are termed succulent and therefore, neither as pasture or fodder (hay) are they so desirable or profitable a food for milk and butter production as the more succulent, cultivated grasses and clovers; during all these years we have experimented more or less with tame grasses and clovers as pasture for dairy cows: at the present time our Vest pasture for such purpose 1s one of natural prairie In which Is a considerable per cent of blue grass, but during the entire pasture season our milch cows are fed. morning and night, all the alfalfa hav they will eat: alfalfa Is not a pasture plant. It is never safe during the growing season, to attempt to pasture It with either cattle or sheep, but there is nothing better than good alfalfa hay to supplement a pasture such as I have mentioned, or in fact any kind of a pasture found in the state. For many years we supplemented our pasture with sowed corn, and raised millet and Hungarian grass as fodder or hay; but these plants are all annuals, and there was always the expense of plowing and fitting the ground each year and also the item of seed: they each and all make good feed for dairy cows.

            <seg id="p385">383 time when there was considerable discussion in regard to the grea advantages to be derived from subsoiling; so, in order to do my ver best, as I thought, I subsoiled, in the spring of the year, some ten acres harrowed it down fine and sowed to alfalfa; the season was rather dry and while the alfalfa came up and made a fine stand, it gradually di appeared, and with good reason, and as I now understand, I don't blam ie ground being subsoiled was open and porous, the moisture soon evaporated and of course the young plants soon perished; some of th plants lived and thrived and that satisfied me that alfalfa would gro if given a fair chance. The next attempt was on a field that had been in corn the previous year; we broke up the stalks, disced the ground five or six times, going both ways, then harrowed thoroughly and sowed twenty pounds of seed per acre; we mowed it twice during the season to keep down the weeds and secured a most excellent stand; the next year we seeded a field that had been in corn the previous year and secured a good stand, hut on an adjoining field, which was plowed in the spring about four inches deep and thoroughly harrowed and fitted, the crop was a failure; since then we have seeded to alfalfa in the fall of the year and consider that time of year by far the lest; when alfalfa is sown in the spring there Is a continual fight the first season with weeds; it is necessary to mow them and mowing the weeds cuts off the alfalfa at the same time, and that weakens the plant so that it makes but little growth the first year; if sown in August or early September on ground thoroughly fitted, it comes up quickly and there being no weeds to interfere it grows rapidly, be - comes thoroughly established so as to live through the winter and will cut a full crop of hay the next season; wherever winter wheat can be grown I think there will le no difficulty in securing a stand of alfalfa sown in the early fall. f! you wish to raise a crop during the summer it is not objectionable, might raise a crop of oats or a crop of wheat and when ripe take tie crop and as soon as possible prepare the ground just as though were going to sow winter wheat. Plow early and then disc it down — I like to disc with the disc set straight because it tends to firm the ground and break up the air chambers. I disc it three or four times the disc set straight and then harrow so as to retain all the moisture possible. Then in August or early September I sow the alfalfa seed and it springs right up. There are no weeds, there is nothing to exhaust the moisture tit will come right up and get to be good height before frost comes, the next year you will have a crop of hay without any difficulty, and y have lost nothing in the way of receiving returns from the field, f you want to do better than that you might summer fallow the field see that no moisture escapes, keeping down the weeds, that would a excellent way. and then sow in August.

            <seg id="p386">384 from the effects of the extreme heat and drouth, yet alfalfa remained gree and fresh, a most enjoyable and pleasing sight; we harvested from th field a heavy crop of hay saving the second growth for seed which yielded six bushels of seed per acre; in 1902 this field yielded a heavy tonnage o hay; on June 5 the first cutting was made, the alfalfa averaging thirty aches in height: on July 5 the second hay crop was cut, the averag height being the same as the first crop, thirty-six inches; a third cu ting about twenty inches in height, was cut in September. The year was not a good year for alfalfa, being too wet; we made three cu tings from this field, the first and second contained quite a large pe of water grass, making an inferior quality of hay, the third cutting while light, was of fine quality; in 1904 this field yielded four cuttings o the last I eing cut late in October; when you consider the rapi growth which this plant makes in the months of May, June and July it can readily be seen that there must not be any delay in cutting whe roper time comes, and that, for hay, is when the first blossoms begi on-; as soon as the plant is in full bloom the lower leaves begin t drop off. the stem becomes woody, and a second growth starts from th roots, this second growth, grows at the rate of an inch or more each da so it will be seen that the sooner the preceding crop is removed from th field the better. The most valuable part of alfalfa is the leaves, an therefore it should be put in the barn or stack as quickly as possible an with as little handling as possible; of course the best plan is to stor In a barn, but if there is not barn room, then the stack; it will not do t when wet from rain or clew, but if not thus wet, it can be stacked quite green, in fact as soon as it can be satisfactorily handled wit rakes and stackers: the fact that it turns I Town in the stack, when stacke* green, is not objectionable as its feeding value is not thereby ■ sanly Injured; in fact one of our largest and most experienced shee feeders, pays more per ton, for alfalfa hay of a dark brown or quite blac color, than for that which comes out of the stack green and fresh looking lurk colored has a higher feeding value and that shee are mu&lt;-h more fond of it; with us, if the stacks are well put up an topped out wiih quite green hay, the greener the better, and then covered for a day or so with a tarpaulin, or stack cover, until the stack becomes there is very little loss from stacks wetting in. g'-d, the leaves are the most valuable portion of th and as, even in stacks or the barn, the hay becomes dry enoug ■ uml.le to some extent in handling; it follows tha hay should be fed in tight mangers or feed racks so that th may not be wasted ; the most wasteful manner to feed this hay 1 aw it on the ground, for the stock running over it knock off th and they are thus wasted.

            <seg id="p387">385 t, when established it becomes a permanent meadow. The raisins ;d seems most uncertain, as far as my experience goes, as we hare able to raise only one profitable seed crop; the plant may bloom sely, but not a seed pod form, and if left to bloom and for seed to form, it is then worthless for hay. Alfalfa is a plant which adapts to the locality in which grown, therefore it is best, in buying seed w, to procure that grown in the immediate locality if possible. Let me compare briefly the changed conditions which have come about on my own farm in the keeping of dairy cows, and, if these changed con - ditions are for the better, in that milk and butter can be produced much easier and cheaper than before, the same change can be made on practi - cally any dairy farm in the state, for I see no good reason why alfalfa can not be successfully and profitably grown on all of our tillable lands. Erst, in our own case, the making of hay from native grasses many distant and spending much of the winter months in hauling hay ; next the plowing and tilling of the land and raising millet, Hun - a, sowed corn and such annual plants; now the alfalfa plant, a perennial, which when established, means a permanent meadow at least for a long term of years and producing each year two or more cuttings of hay of the finest quality, succulent, palatable and when fed with corn making a perfect or balanced ration. Is it any wonder that those who grow this wonderful plant become enthusiastic when discussing its merits? The question is sometimes asked whether a plant, which produces annually so large a tonnage of hay of high feeding value, will not quickly impoverish the soil? In reply, it might be said, that alfalfa is a clover, a leguminous plant, which draws much of its support from the atmosphere and increases rather than decreases the fertility of the soil, but on K sands of farms in this state we have an almost inexhaustable soil for support of plants of the nature and habits of growth of alfalfa. In my own farm it is sixteen feet to water, and every foot of this sixteen feet is fertile soil, which if brought to the surface and exposed to the elements tot a few months, will support a luxuriant vegetable growth; alfalfa is a plant whose roots burrow deep down into the earth, just how deep I can not definitely say; this I know that in the alfalfa fields we have dug down six and eight feet and found the roots appar - ently of as large size as at the surface and there is no doubt, in my mind, that on the farm, plants of full growth extend their roots down the full sixteen feet to water; this habit of extending its roots so deeply into the earth, not only enables the plant to withstand extremes of heat and drouth, but on our deep fertile soils to produce annually, and for a Ions term of years, enormous crops of the best of forage for the dairy cow; alfalfa, corn and well bred dairy cows, can you think of, do you desire, any better combination for profitable dairying? The general cultivation of alfalfa on the farms of Nebraska would add millions of dollars annually to the productive wealth from the farms and also to the state. 13 </seg>

I am so closely attached to the dairy cow that when I am at home and in the office I spend a good deal of my time with her. I study each individual animal closely. I try to get intimately acquainted with her. I try to have her like to see me around. I believe that every cow in my barn would rather see me come in to see her than the man who feeds her. When I go by her I say "Topsy, good morning," and I give her a gentle touch and she likes it. The average farmer would avoid that. We are dealing with animals exceedingly sensitive. We are dealing in her product in a commercial way. I find if I can draw her attention to me that she will do better for me than she would otherwise. I have kept an accurate record of each cow, during the past fourteen years. I have been in close touch with her for over a quarter of a century; I have given my attention to the business of rearing calves, thorough - bred calves, and incidentally, to make some butter; and during the last fourteen years I have kept an accurate account of each cow and studied her. So what I shall have to say to you at this time is simply what the cow says in return to me under the conditions that I have given her. We find from statistics that the average cow gives barely 140 pounds of butter a year. Now, the average educator berates that common cow and blames her for all her shortcomings; he spends his energy in try- Ing to get the average farmer to purchase a kind of cow that is adapted for dairying. That is very good, provided the conditions on the farm are such that the dairy cow will do her best under them. During the first eight years of my work in dairy education I spent much time in trying to persuade the farmers to employ this cow that I find so very profitable. After spending that much time in the state of Minnesota and looking around and talking about what I had accomplished I began to become discouraged, and I stopped advising the farmer — the average farmer — to get this cow. Now, why? It is not because she does not do, or would not do exactly what we claim if her conditions were right. With me the conditions are right and the dairy cow returns to me about ounds of butter per year. Her feed does not cost but very little 'he maximum and the net return somewhere in the neighborhood of $60 per year over and above the cost of her feed. Many farmers have said I believe your records are correct an.d that this dairy cow is such a money-maker, that I am going to breed dairy cattle after this. I have known a good many farmers to start a nucleus of a dairy herd, but not one out of ten who make it a success, and I have ceased advocating it. • Read before Nebraska Dairymen's Association. </seg>
            <seg id="p389">387 Now, I want to take up and define the average cow as we find her on the farm, and give you some suggestions as to how she should be handled, and what we may expect from her under proper treatment. The common cow, we may say, has adjusted herself to farm conditions. She is a common cow because she has had good care under common environment. I have had now 40 of those cows in my yard that I hare kept records of. The average daily yield of milk is 6,000 pounds. She has given me on average of over 275 pounds of butter. What doea it mean? It means that if the cow you now have on the farm gets intelli - gent care and is treated properly, that you can add at least 125 pounds of butter to her annual yield. That is something that is within your means. That is something that you can aim for with the animals that you have, and if you please, the same with the accommodations that you have for that animal, very little change is needed. Now these common cows that have been in my yard were not selected animals; they came to me merely incidentally and probably, possibly and quite likely are fair representatives of the common cow as she is on the average farm. The question arises, why does the common cow that gives to the average farmer only 140 pounds of butter yield 275 pounds under the conditions that she receives, we will say, at the Ex - periment Station, or any institution of this kind? There is some reason for it. The first point that is generally raised by the farmer is, "You have got the state and the general government back of you. If I could afford to have this thing and that thing — to have things you hare, probably I would get the same results, but I cannot afford to buy all these expensive meals and feeds. If I did the bills would be as big as my creamery checks." Now, I think there was something in it. I did think several years ago that the common cows in my herd made such good returns because I fed them what was called a balanced ration. This is the fifth year I have tried to find if the common cow would do as well on the ordinary rations she receives on the farm, that is, good, solid hay, green plants and roughage, and then a little mixture of farm - grown grains for her meals, and I find she makes just the same returns to me as she did when she got this more expensive ration. This means a good deal to the average farmer; it means that he has a cow on the farm that can produce about 275 pounds of butter a year; it means that she can do it with the feeds he has on the farm. Now, why doea she not do it? You have the cow and you havp the feed. As it cannot be that the difficulty is with the cow, it must be with the man who handles her. The man who handles the common cow is not as good a dairyman as the common cow is a dairy cow. If you want to talk about breeding, breed up the common farmer and make him a better dairyman *o that he can set the best results possible out of the common cow before we ask him to get a better or a thoroughbred dairy cow. If he does not know how to care for the common cow and how to gc beat out of her, or, as I should put it, if he is not a cow-man and haa </seg>
            <seg id="p390">388 I the industry and perseverance and painstaking necessary to take care of the common cow to get the best out of her, how can we et he will do it with a higher bred dairy cow that requires better and better accommodations and environment? It is natural that a should do his apprentice work in dairying with the common cow, then, when he gets her up to the greatest maximum yield, is the for him to begin to use stock that is adapted to their work. So 1 for the common cow. Just a few words now in regard to the profits that we may expect in dairying when it is conducted along intelligent and advanced methods. You remember that I told you I wanted you to get the good-will of the cow — that is one point. Another one is that she must be absolutely comfortable; that is another point, because, when she is uneasy the feed she eats, the energy in it is used in driving away the cold or combatting the storm in standing out during the day shivering, the feed that is used in keeping the body warm cannot be used in making milk. So, we should keep the cow comfortable and also keep her contented. You may have a cow perfectly comfortable but not contented, because she is not receiving the same thing that she is expecting, and is not receiving the same thing she received yesterday at this time: she is in a place today where she was not yesterday at this time, and that is what causes discontent among cattle. They get out of patience and begin to hook each other and everything seems to go wrong. That means we must have a system in handling the cow. We must have her comfort - in every way; and everything we do in connection with the dairy cow must be done with regularity. Under such a system, I find that the common cow will return easily from about 250 pounds to 275 pounds of butter on an average during the year; and a dairy-bred cow will add about 100 to 150 pounds to that Of course you will see at a glance that if you are going to get 150 pounds more of butter out of the better cow the man should understand how to handle the cow, and the man who is willing to do it can then understand why he should use the dairy cow, but the average man will not meet the requirements. Just as I was summoned to come down here. I had completed my mid-winter experiments in my dairy work; that is, I had taken the last three weeks' work, added them together, the amount of feed per cow and the market price of butter for same; also added up the pounds of milk and pounds of butter fat yield during the three weeks, and found the daily average. The herd has yielded 1.1 pounds of butter per day. I do not know what the prevailing price of butter is in this state, but sume it is not far from 25 or 26 cents. I charge my cows with the feed th«y consume at these rates (which I think is rather high for this locality) : Corn, 35 cents a bushel; barley. 30; oats, 24; oil meal. $25 per ton; gluten feed, $21 per ton; hay, $6; silage, 2 cents per pound. I wish to mention that the gluten feed here is simply a by-product of the corn products factory. One group of cows are receiving that, while </seg>
            <seg id="p391">389 Eier group is receiving corn meal in place of gluten feed: that is a of the experiment, so that while I am charging these cows up with n feed the indications are that they would do just as well if I were ng them corn meal. So far the indications have been that they could make as large a yield without it. If my cows are yieldin pounds of butter daily, the cost of feed at prices stated amounts to cents; and if butter is worth 25 cents and the daily cost of the feed cents, they are returning me. at prices stated. $2 worth of butter for a dollar's worth of feed over and above what we could get for that feed at the market price. That shows that dairying is very profitable wherever it is conducted along the line of advanced methods, and that if the farmer will follow out simple rules in handling his cows, as a general proposition, he can market his feed through them at about double the price that he would get for it in the market: at the same time he will have considerable skim-milk with which to raise young hogs and calves and will increase the fertility of his farm, which is getting to be quite an important item in eastern states, and will, in time, be In Nebraska. I thank you, gentlemen, for your attention. [Applause.] CO-OPERATIVE TKSTS OF DAIRY BERD&amp;* PBOF. A. L. HAECKER. I he need of knowing more about the annual production of our cows for dairy purposes is increasing each year. The farmers of our i during the past few years have purchased two million dollars' h of hand separators. This means some twenty or thirty thousand ur farmers are in the dairy business and whether they stay in or will depend upon their profits. The profits they receive will ©w - y depend in a great measure upon the production of thefr cows. i a better knowledge of their cows respecting their individual profit, iss. as the case may be, is one of the most important features eon - ing the industry. t better the existing conditions, and show the necessity of more il study of profitable milk production I know of no better plan to conduct a co-operative herd test. K'he test should be so arranged as to Include the varied farming con - ins of the state. For example, there should be a herd to represent northwest range condition, also the southwest. The central portion, north and south, and the eastern section, wonld give a fair repre - sentation of the natural conditions whic. influence the industry believe ten herds would be all that could be successfully tested. Thii would require nearly all the time of one man. The ten herds could be • Read before the Nebraska Dairymen's Association. </seg>
            <seg id="p392">390 ao arranged as to make it possible for the man checking up the tests to all, spending one or two days with each, at which time he could check up the weight and tests and make record of the same. Each herd should be visited at least once a month during the entire year in order to get reliable data from each individual animal. EQUIPMENT For each herd should be provided spring balance scales weighing to 30 pounds; a set of sample bottles, covered preferred, and a small Bab - cock testing machine with necessary equipment. Blanks should be pro - vided also, so arranged that the name of or number of each cow of the herd could be written at the top. In the left hand column room could be left for dating eight milkings. This would require twelve blanks for the year. In each herd the milk from individual cows should be weighed and recorded one day in the week. Any farmer desiring the privilege of keeping daily records would be heartily encouraged, but it has been found impractical and almost impossible in other states to re - quire dairymen to keep daily records. By obtaining a one-day record per cow of each week in the year, a very accurate record could be compiled. Khe man conducting the test could take such notes as would be neces - in order to make fair comparisons, and by compiling all records as as they were made would be able to make a report by the end of the WORK INVOLVED BY THE FARMER. The work for the herd-owner would be slight and his trouble more than paid for by the knowledge gained in finding his profitable and un - profitable cows. The scale could be hung in a convenient place in the barn or yard and close to them the milk blank could be tacked to a board. On the other side of the scales a shelf could contain the sample bottles. Klie work of weighing and sampling requires about one minute per and figuring forty weeks to a lactation, the year's work would re - but forty minutes to a cow. If composite tests were used the inspector could make all fat determina - tions, which method would be advisable in case the owner objected to doing the testing. There is no doubt but what some of the owners would be willing to make part of the tests, fn which case the inspector would need only to check up his work from time to time. THE VALUE OF BITCH TE8T Would be great, not only to the herd-owners but also as reliable data to publish and distribute among the dairymen of the state. What could be more profitable to a man keeping cows than a knowledge of their profit? If he has animals in his herd which he is actually keeping year after year at a loss it is certainly worth much to him to know which ones they are. If he can keep five cows that will do the work of ten And with double the profit he wants to know it. I have already called attention to the heavy investment we have </seg>
            <seg id="p393">391 I&gt; In dairy machinery and the fact that we are in the dairy business likely to stay in; now let us investigate the six or seven hundred land cows we are milking and find, if possible, which are paying which are not. It is important work and we cannot do anything will be of greater value to the dairy interest. The time has come, large portion of our state, at least, when more attention must be to economic production. i.and and food products are becoming higher priced each year and petition is growing more keen. With more intensified methods of ling the importance and value of dairying increases. Speculative ling and lottery must give way to knowledge and facts. It is strange true that nine out of ten cow-owners do not appreciate the great dif - nce that exists between individual cows. It is also true that to e men see the value of a good cow is one of the hardest problems renting advancement in dairy farming. The proposed demonstration would do more to bring about improve - ment in live-stock than anything I know of. It cannot be hoped that such a demonstration would in any way revolutionize dairy practice, but it would undoubtedly create much interest and start, at least, some in the course of better dairying. The pledge of two nundred dollars made so liberally by the directors of the Dairymen's Association could be invested in purchasing milk scales and milk record blanks. There would also perhape be enough money to buy sample bottles and a few small testing machines. If the board of regents could be induced to furnish the Dairy Department of the Experiment Station with a competent man to do the work, the test could be easily made, and the Dairy Association and Experiment Station provided with valuable data. The material would make an excellent bulletin for the Experiment Stat'on and could be published in a 25,000 edition. This, with 2,000 Dairy Association reports, would dis - tribute 27.000 publications among the most Interested farmers of the state. There are many more things I might mention for such a test, but thought it not worth while because if a test is to be made the men who are going to make it will, perhape. find it necessary to change the plan with the conditions that they need. But I would like to say this, that as an association I would like to have your endorsement and also a mo - tion to send to the board of regents favoring such a cow-census in our state, or such a co-operative test, so that we can point to some figures. The world is getting skeptical. The time has come when we don't care to hear a man get up and say what he thinks or pleases, but we want is, figures. It will tend to more good than the mff knowledge that have one or two thousand cows in the sfete that are being milked, night create result In showing some men that they are engaged in wrong business. I believe it would be all right. It is not so much ncrease the number of dairymen in the state as it is to have them »me better dairymen. I think we have some 20,000 or 30,000 men in </seg>
            <seg id="p394">392 ■ state who are dairying to some extent, but I think we could cut many of these and not miss them at all. fe cannot all be dairymen; we cannot all be producers of milk and but whatever we are let us go about it in a sensible and logical and know what we are doing. I think the moral effect would be good, only to give us a little money and a little time to test your cows and find out which is 100-pound cow, which is 250-pound cow, and which is 300-pound cow. Too often we hear it said that that is a good cow. She was a good cow in the owner's eyes. When she was fresh and she pave a pailful of milk she was the finest cow in the herd, but be did not know what she tested; she gave milk five or six months, perhaps, and then went dry and became a stripper. She was not then a paying cow. In Nebraska so many people do things so different from what they should; they make butter when it is cheapest and at the hardest time of the year to take care of the cream and milk, just at the time when we have no time to attend to it or to be in the dairy business. We are in the corn belt where we are awfully busy in the summer season raising corn. You ought to be dairying in the winter when you have lots of time to take care of the business; when cream and butter are high, and when there in money in it. We don't want to be dairying with range cattle. Let us find out where we are at. [Applause.] </seg>
