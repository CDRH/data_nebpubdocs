Lincoln, Nel. rear Sir — This office- is in leceipt or a communication [ram you. ■ an opinion oil tl.e fdlpwtpg questiou: "Should the articles of incorporation of a loan ami savings association l&gt;&lt;- approved without having the amount of the author ized capital stock stated in the articles?" Ender the incorporation l:iw, prior to the enactment of the legislature 1911, building and loan associations were not required to flic their cits of in&lt; (ii -porutior with the secretary at state. (State ex rel. Bui lard v. Searles. 125 V W. :&gt;»2.) In the case just cited, the supreme interpreted section 12*, chapter IC, Conipile'l Statutes of I!*"!'. Under that interpretation, building and loan associations were not requited to file their articles with ihe secretary of state and pay tiie filini: required under section 3. article 2, chapter 83. Compiled Statut. The recent legislature, however, saw fit to amend section 12«;. supra, and by specific enactment to proviue ihat the articles of such association.* miiFt be tiled with the secretary of state as well as wttk Um &gt;tate bank ing board, i Session Laws of 1911, ch. 28. p. 179.) -&lt;(Miations of this kind are authorized to begin business upon ap - proval of their articles of incorpoiation, constitution, and bylaws by th'; state hankinr board. Nothing is said about capital stock in the act pm viding for the incorporation of Ibis kind ol associaiions. The very nature of the busiu-ss is mkJi as precludes a statement a* to capital stock. A building and loan association is one supposed to huve been organize.! for the mutual bc-neflt of its members oi stockholders. Tiieie is » mini - mum membership of five provided, but no maximum. The individual member muy not own. in his own right, more man $5.imih par value of the stock in any such corporation. The number of members, therefore and the individual holdings det-'iniine the amount of s:oc k issued by the corporation. The peculiarity as to this sort of corporation is commented upon by Judge Barnes in deciding th" case of Nebraska Centra! Building A Loan Assn. v Board of Eaualization *«S Neb 476 as follows* </seg>

            <seg id="p061">61 In submitting this, the Nineteenth Annual Report .lilding and Loan Associations of Nebraska, with such summaries and compari - sons as are necessary to set forth their condition at the present time, it is but necessary 10 direct attention to the fact that the unintemipted growth and prosperity of these associations still continue without appar ent break or check. An inert ase in ten years of from around |4.&lt;**),» 10 $25,i»iio.iMlii.iici demonstrates the fact that in the financial stnicni' the Btate a place existed for the work of those institutions, and the splendid growth shown by this repoit clearly sustains the wisdom of the Nebraska finiii'iers who hud to do with the laying of the foundation of this branch ot finance, now a |w&gt;tent influence for wealth creation in the state. Unquestionably it is true that the crucial test will come in future periods of depression when values shrink and prices fall and the confident pay the penalty of want of reasonable prudence. However, there is nothing in the condition of the associations, as a whole, or the genera! character of the management that need cause serious apprehension that the building and loan assoc iaticms ot the state will not stand a financial strain equal with ether lines at business involving the aggregated ac cum - ulations of the people. I think it Ml b« safely said that the building and loan associations of Nebraska are as safe and conservative as similar institution.- in older states where they have been long tried by all the financial \ i&lt; i~-itucl&gt;- - that come in ijftlM ot veur.- to make flnan: ial epochs. It" is not necessary for me to go into detail to call your attention to the various summaries sei forth in this report, which c learly indicate the past record, the present condition, and the future promise of these in - stitutions. I am pleased to rcpovt to your honorable body that in the supervision of these institutions this Department finds the officei the various' associations usualh willing and ready to adopt its sugges - tions made with a view to assist in conserving the interests M ; and borrowing member-. There is one practice, however, to which the Department thinks attention ought to be called, and tha' is the too prevalent effort to buil&lt;! up a non-borrowing stoc khcldcrs ttftMIK) ; this, in the opinion of the Department, is the most apparent inherent weakness ol these associa - tions Ksp"i ially is this true in the too eneigetic effort on the part of the management of ninny associations in building up a heavy list of full paid stock. This practice is not in keeping wilh the spirit of the law and is an element of weakness. The intent of the law is to entourage thrift by assisting th-? home MM*r, otherwise known as the borrowing stockholder, and by offering a depository for the savings of the wage earner, who can spare but a rot f ion of his income at regular p-riods It is not the intention of tin law to cieate institutions tor large inv&gt; who 'ire looking for mi income instead of a place to accuniiila'e --ivinf </seg>
