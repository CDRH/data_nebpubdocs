            <seg id="p003">Co-Operative Marketing of Livestock in Nebraska BY HAROLD HEDGES AND H. C. FILLEY The value of the livestock marketed by Nebraska farmers, not including dairy and poultry products, ordinarily exceeds the value of all crops sold by not less than 50 per cent. Hogs are the most valuable of any single farm product, exceeding wheat by a wide margin. The efficiency of our livestock marketing methods is, therefore, of great interest to Nebraska farmers. It is also of interest to the majority of other resi - dents of the state, since their prosperity depends upon the prosperity of the farmer. The livestock industry is, of course, very largely dependent upon crop production. When we market livestock we are really marketing the products of our fields and pastures in a concentrated form. Purpose and Scope. — The purpose of this bulletin is to describe the local co-operative livestock marketing organiza - tions in Nebraska, to present an analysis of the marketing costs of such agencies, to discuss their shipping practices, to explain their business methods, and to present some of the more important problems confronting them. It should aid in giving a clearer understanding of the management prob - lems involved in the co-operative marketing of livestock from local points. While the investigation upon which this study is based covered only one type of local livestock marketing agency, the facts obtained, particularly those dealing with marketing costs, are applicable to other such agencies — the local buyer and the individual shipper. Methods Used in Gathering Data. — There are, within the state of Nebraska, about 400 co-operative organizations handling livestock.* With the object in mind of getting pertinent facts concerning these agencies, a marketing survey was made during the summer of 1923. As limited time made it impossible to make a complete study of every organization, or even to visit each one, it was decided to get detailed infor - mation from only a representative number of organizations. The data desired were of two kinds. (1) Exact figures, copied from the shipping records of the organization, were • This number is the estimate of C. H. Withey. Manager of the Farmers' Union Livestock Commission. South Omaha, Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 209 4 required for the study of marketing costs. (2) Information of more general nature was needed for the study of organiza - tion problems and practices. For this a schedule was pre - pared and answers secured by inquiry from those familiar with the co-operative organization and its business — from its manager or its officers. Thirty-seven organizations were visited while making the survey but complete records were secured from only twenty of that number. Splendid co-operation was shown by organi - zation managers, who put their shipping records at the dis - posal of the writers and in other ways assisted them in getting the desired data. Records were not secured from all concerns visited because it was found that shipping records were often too incomplete to warrant spending the time required to ferret out the data needed on the cost schedules, particularly since other organi - zations with more complete records were available. One big criticism that could be made of co-operative livestock ship - ping organizations in Nebraska is the lack of adequate records. This is doubtless due to the failure to realize the importance and need of complete accounting records in their business. It may be well to keep in mind that the cost data were secured from those concerns having the better records, and such concerns tend to be the more efficient marketing agencies. Available Outlets for Nebraska Livestock. — Nebraska has only a few local packing plants, hence much the larger proportion of our livestock goes to Omaha and other big markets, such as Sioux City, Iowa, and St. Joseph and Kansas City in Missouri, and even the more distant markets, like Chicago and East St. Louis. During the past few years, an ever increasing proportion I Nebraska's pig crop has been moving to the Pacific Coast ckers. These western packers maintain buyers in certain :tions of the state. These representatives buy for shipment ■ect to the western packing establishments. This western ide demands the butcher or lighter class of hogs, and con - [uently the heavy hogs must still seek the eastern markets, rat of the hogs moving west are secured from the territory butary to the Union Pacific railroad west of Grand Island, th lesser numbers from territory along the Burlington lines d other roads having western connections. During recent mths (preceding June, 1925), order buyers representing stern packers have bought heavily at Omaha and other stern markets. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">Co-Operative Marketing of Livestock 5 The two main factors which determine the market to which Nebraska's livestock is sent are prices and rail connections, the former being undoubtedly the more important. If the price at a given market is high enough, nearly all obstacles will be overcome to take advantage of that high price. The fact that price differentials between markets are taken ad - vantage of by shippers is one reason why such differentials vary so little. Since they do remain so nearly constant, rail connections often seem to be the predominant factor in de - termining the market chosen. Table 1. — Receipts of the several classes of livestock orig - inating in Nebraska which reached the important markets during 1923, and the number reaching each market out of every 1000 animals shipped * Sheep Hors Cattle Receipts Number in I Receipts Number in Receipts Number in Market originating ; each 1000 j originating each 1000 originating each 1000 in Nebraska! shipped in Nebraska shipped in Nebraska shipped 5.777.000 1000.0 1,433,000 I 1000.0 1.369.000 I 1000.0 * Note : The totals in this table are taken from the April, 1924, report of the B. A. K.. U. S. D. A., on the livestock situation in Nebraska. The receipts at each market were secured by communicating with the stockyards companies. As shown in Table 1, Omaha is Nebraska's most important livestock market, taking approximately 52 per cent of the hogs, 73 per cent of the cattle, and 75 per cent of the sheep sent to market in 1923. Omaha draws its receipts from the whole Platte valley, and from the big feeding region to the northwest, west, and southwest of that market. In the northern part of the state, rail connections favor Sioux City. In southern Nebraska, they favor St. Joseph and Kansas City. Livestock from southwestern Nebraska can move either to Omaha or to the Missouri markets so far as rail connections are concerned, but usually move to the southern markets be - cause there is normally a slight price advantage in their favor. As will be noted in Table 1, St. Joseph takes many more of the hogs and sheep from Nebraska than does Kansas City, while the latter is favored as a cattle market.

Other markets drawing from Nebraska are Chicago and East St. Louis, but they are relatively unimportant. No figures are available to indicate the volume of hog shipments moving to Pacific Coast points, but the western market is quite important. History of Co-Operative Shipping of Livestock in Nebraska. — The first co-operative livestock shipping association in the United States of which there is a definite record was located at Superior, Nebraska, and included farmers residing in both Kansas and Nebraska. Mr. G. W. Jacobs, who was one of the leaders of the movement, states that the first organization meeting was held in a country schoolhouse on the Kansas side of the state line in December, 1882, with about 20 farmers present. He states that it was the opinion of those present that local buyers were taking too wide margins, with addi - tional gains by " lumping off " the stock without weighing. Other farmers from the two states joined the movement, bringing the charter membership up to about 60. It was in November, 1883, that the first car of hogs was shipped, and only five cars were shipped the first year. Mr. Jacobs reports that many obstacles were put in the way of the new organization. The railroad failed to furnish cars, price bribes were offered members, use of scales was refused, but thru it all most of the members remained loyal and, in time, the association was the only shipper from Superior. Mr. Jacobs to whom is due much of the credit for success has modestly said, " I know it took a lot of hard work until the five buyers quit the field." During the 42 years (1883-1925) that the pioneer associa - tion has been in successful operation, it has had but five managers. The second of these managers, Mr. G. W. Jacobs, served for seventeen years, beginning in 1885. Those familiar with the history of the association give Mr. Jacobs most of the credit for its rapid growth, shipments having increased to 125 cars during the last year he served. The present manager has served since 1913. Very meager information is available on the development of co-operative marketing in Nebraska. It seems that Superior was the only livestock shipping association in ex - istence until comparatively recent years. Following the success of the farmers' elevator movement, attention naturally turned to the co-operative marketing of other farm products. A large number of elevators took up the buying of livestock as part of their business. The Superior association was </seg>
            <seg id="p007">Co-Operative Marketing of Livestock 7 organized in 1883, but it was more than 20 years later that a distinct movement for marketing livestock co-operatively was started. In 1906, we learn of the organization of the Lexing - ton Shipping Association. Since then the growth in numbers has been rapid, even tho it has been erratic. Some of the earlier associations that are still in existence and operating successfully might be mentioned, together with some of the more successful. In 1908, the Albion association was organized. In southwestern Nebraska, the Edison Ship - ping Association, organized in 1907, lays claim to being the first in that part of the state. If success can be measured by volume of business, Nebraska can boast of several of the most successful concerns in the United States. For many years the Lexington association has had a large volume of business, reaching a maximum in 1918, when 412 cars of stock were shipped. Latest reports indicate that a more recently organized asso - ciation has displaced Lexington as the largest in Nebraska. The Farmers' Shipping Association of Clarkson, started in .1919, reports 501 cars of stock handled in 1923. Other asso - ciations with large volumes of business are those at Albion and Madison. The Clarkson association is one of the largest if not the largest association in the United States shipping stock from a single shipping point. Other associations may ship more cars each year, but ship from two or more ship - ping points or are county-wide organizations. Reasons for Organizing. — The organizers of the Superior association believed that local buyers were taking too wide margins, as has already been stated. It was their hope that by organizing they could market livestock so efficiently that a part of the margin going to the buyer would be saved by the producer. Altho but 37 associations were visited in ob - taining the data for this report, and altho it was impossible to talk with a very large percentage of the men who assisted in organizing the associations visited, it is safe to assume that the most important reason for organizing is that given by the Superior association. Other less important reasons are given by some of the organizations. In a number of instances where livestock - shipping was undertaken by a concern engaged in other lines of business, it was the purpose to distribute the overhead over more lines of business and thus reduce marketing costs on all lines handled. In a few cases the shipping associations were started to furnish a market at points where there were no local buyers. In other places, livestock-shipping was under- </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 209 taken because of the general enthusiasm for co-operative marketing. Back of all the reasons that might be given by the organ - izers of shipping concerns to warrant their efforts should be, one that is fundamental. That one thing which farmers hoped to gain was greater economy in the marketing of their live - stock. Types of Co-Operative Shipping Organizations. — The co - operative concerns handling livestock in Nebraska might be roughly divided into three classes. In the first class would be put those organized for the express purpose of shipping livestock for patrons on a commission basis. These are what are commonly classed as shipping associations, and may or may not be incorporated. In the second class are those organizations engaged in other lines of business but with a separate livestock department, handling the stock on a com - mission basis. In the third class would be those co-operative concerns which buy and sell livestock as part of their regular business. No sharp lines of distinction can be drawn among the classes specified above. There are some shipping associations which occasionally handle some other commodities for their members but do not make a business of it. Then, too, there are some elevator companies and co-operative stores that offer to buy outright or to ship on a commission basis, as the patron may choose. The consensus of opinion among organizations visited was that the handling of stock on a commission basis has, on the whole, proved most satisfactory and is to be preferred to buying outright, or giving the patron his choice of selling outright or shipping. Unusual arrangements have been found in a few places. At one point a local buyer had been em - ployed by a local farmers' elevator company to buy livestock. The company financed the business and paid all shipping expenses, and any profit was divided equally between the buyer and the company. At another point, where patrons were given their choice of shipping on commission or selling, a fixed buying margin was established by the company. This margin was big enough to protect the concern against all except the most unusual price declines. The practical result with the big margin was that nearly all patrons preferred to ship rather than sell. Since no state-wide survey was made it is not possible to tell what proportion of the organizations fall within each of the three classes that have been made. However, from </seg>
            <seg id="p009">Co-Operative Marketing of Livestock 9 general observation and knowledge of the situation, it is pos - sible to state that co-operative concerns buying livestock outright are least numerous. As between the other two classes, one * who is in a position to know has estimated that of the 400 co-operative organizations handling livestock in Nebraska one-third are strictly shipping associations and two-thirds are elevators or stores shipping livestock as only one part of their business, quite often considering it merely as a side line. In this latter respect, Nebraska differs from the other Corn Belt states, in which by far the larger part of the shipping is done thru the shipping association type of organization. MARKETING COSTS The casual observer — and the general public is made up largely of casual observers — usually fails to realize the com - plexities of the situation when he talks of the " spread " be - tween producer and consumer. By " spread " we mean the differential between the price received by the producer for a product and the price paid by the consumer for that product. The growing complexities of our economic system, the iso - lation of producer and consumer, and the demand of the con - sumer for more and more service are only three of the factors that have a bearing on the increase in the " spread " between producer and consumer, or, in other words, in the cost of marketing and processing. Only after a careful analysis of the items of cost which make up the " spread " for a par - ticular product has been made, should criticism be offered. To say that the producer gets 80 per cent of the consumer's dollar spent for eggs and only 5 per cent of the consumer's dollar spent for a woolen blanket is no indication that the costs of marketing wool are out of reason. On analysis of the situation perhaps it would be found that the opposite is true — the cost of marketing eggs is unreasonably high while wool is being marketed very efficiently. A comparison of the percentages found for different products proves nothing. A thoro study and analysis is neces - sary before we can say definitely either that certain practices which exist in the marketing system are inefficient and should be improved or that the system should be changed. Pro - ducers and consumers alike desire that marketing costs shall be reduced to a minimum, but it cannot be safely said that a complete change in the present system of marketing will necessarily produce any such results. Not only a careful but * C. H. Withey, manager of Farmers' Union Livestock Commission, Omaha, Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 209 a continuous study of marketing costs is needed if greater efficiency is to result. This study of the costs of marketing livestock thru co - operative organizations in Nebraska is based upon a survey of a relatively small number of organizations. Even tho it is not as comprehensive as might be desired and is far less satisfactory than would be a study based on a survey of a similar nature duplicated year after year, yet it may aid in checking similar studies made in other states and in other years and may bring out points peculiar to Nebraska con - ditions. THE INDEFINITE OR UNCERTAIN ELEMENTS OF COST When marketing costs are considered, one ordinarily thinks first of all of such definite items as freight or commission. Yet, in some respects, what are called the uncertain or in - definite elements of cost are more important than definite items — more important largely because they are so uncer - tain and variable. Farm products are practically all of a perishable or semi-perishable nature and therefore subject to waste, spoilage, shrinkage, and deterioration. Since these losses cannot be entirely eliminated, they must be considered as elements of cost for they do add to the cost of marketing farm products. Livestock is subject to such marketing costs. Any complete study of livestock marketing costs should in - clude a study of these indefinite cost elements. The reason is apparent. A change in the marketing machinery that would bring about a reduction in shrinkage of animals in transit would be as effective in reducing the cost of marketing as a cut in commission charges. In this study of livestock marketing, the three indefinite elements of cost that are considered are shrinkage, crippled animals, and dead animals. Another very important cost, but one which cannot be covered in this study, is the loss due to disease. That this is a very real item of expense is apparent when it is known that from one-half of one per cent to two per cent of all cattle, hogs, and sheep going thru the packing cen - ters are condemned for disease and " tanked." Shrinkage oc - curs from the time the livestock leaves the feedlot until it is on the consumer's table. The marketing loss due to crippled and dead animals ends when the animals are slaughtered. The data available for this study make it necessary to limit our consideration of the three indefinite elements previously men - tioned to such losses as occur while the animals are in transit from the local shipping point to the terminal market. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">11 Co-Operative Marketing op Livestock For the purpose of this study, the following definitions are offered: . , . " Shrinkage " represents the difference between the ship - ping-point weight and the terminal weight, including the weight of all crippled and dead. It is, therefore, over and above the direct loss due to crippled and dead animals. " Crippled animals " or " crips " are those which reach the market in a crippled condition and cannot be driven across the scales with the rest of the shipment. In filling out the schedules for this study, those animals crippled at time of loading were excluded. Also, those " crips " marked on the account of sales as subject to inspection and condemned were also omitted from the schedules. The reason for so doing was to have the data for crippled animals include only those which were the result of accidents and which occurred be - tween the time the animals were loaded at the local yards and were unloaded at the terminal yards. " Dead animals " or " deads " are those so reported on the account of sales. They occur between the time the car is loaded and the time the shipment is sold. " Straight shipments " are shipments made up of only one kind of livestock. " Mixed shipments " are shipments made up of two or more kinds loaded in the same car. In the context which follows will be discussed some of the factors influencing shrinkage and crippled and dead animals while shipments are in transit. Other factors just as im - portant have been omitted because the limitations of available data make consideration of them impossible. Since the losses are not the result of a single cause but rather the composite effects of many factors, the precise effect of any one factor cannot be isolated from the effects of other factors. This point should be kept in mind in the subsequent treatment of the indefinite elements in the cost of marketing livestock. The business of the co-operative livestock shipping organi - zations in Nebraska is devoted mainly to the handling of hogs. Based upon weight, shipped by concerns from which records were secured, over 85 per cent of all shipments were hogs. Because there were too few shipments of cattle, calves, and sheep to serve as a fair basis for study and because home weights were often lacking for these kinds of livestock, it was deemed best to compile data only on hog-marketing costs. The Effect of Kind of Shipment. — The data presented in Table 2 would seem to indicate that shrinkage is greater in straight shipments of hogs than when hogs are shipped with </seg>

This result is the opposite of re - sults given in a similar study made by the Bureau of Agri - cultural Economics, United States Department of Agriculture, which reported mixed shipments as showing greater shrink - age than straight shipments.* There is little reason to be - lieve that shrinkage should be greater or less in mixed ship - ments than in straight shipments. In order to find some rea - son for the greater shrinkage in straight shipments, as shown in Table 2, the time of shipment was considered. Table 3 and Figure 1, which follow, show that shrinkage tends to be greater in certain months of the year than in others. In - vestigation of the time when the shipments upon which Table 2 is based were made revealed the fact that over 58 per cent of the straight shipments were made in the six months of greatest shrinkage, while slightly less than 50 per cent of mixed shipments were made in those months. Perhaps this fact would help to account for the greater shrinkage in straight shipments. Considering crippled and dead hogs in relation to the kind of shipment, Table 2 shows that " crips " and " deads " are nearly twice as numerous in mixed shipments. No doubt the possibility of accidents in mixed shipments is greater. Care - lessness in building partitions between kinds of stock, hogs getting under the feet of cattle, greater disturbance while loading — such things might contribute to more injury and death among hogs in mixed shipments. The Effect of the Season of the Year. — Shrinkage shows a seasonal variation, as is shown in Table 3 and Figure 1.

There were two high periods during the year: The first and least of the two came in January and February, ordinarily the two most severe winter months in Nebraska ; the second and the period of greatest shrink came during the months of highest temperature, June, July, and August. The low months were March, April, November, and December — months of less severe temperature. Weather is, no doubt, a factor influencing the amount of shrinkage, but another thing that should not be disregarded is the nature of the feed at different periods of the year. Probably the high summer shrink is due partly to the fact that the feed during that period is more conducive to greater shrinkage. Figure 2 shows the percentage of crippled hogs in each month of the year. The percentage of cripples, like shrink - age, was greatest during the seasons of extreme temperature, but with the winter months showing the highest percentage of cripples and the summer months showing a percentage only slightly higher than during the months of least injury.

Fig. 3. — Hogs (all shipments): Percentage dead (by weight) of total weight shipped in each month of the year, 1922 of in the winter months as was the case with the percentage of animals crippled. What reasons might be given for the marked differences in the seasonal variation in crippled and in dead animals? In the definition of " crips " given in the foregoing text, it was stated that crippled animals marked on the account sales as subject to inspection and condemned were omitted from the data. Crippling, then, is mainly due to accidents. This would offer some explanation for the greater crippling during win - ter months. Hogs are more likely to pile up in the car during winter months. Slipping on the ice or frozen ground in the local yards may cause injury which results in the hogs show - ing up as crippled at the terminal market, even tho they appear as uninjured when loaded. In winter months, hogs are often fattened more than in hot weather and on that account are not so active and therefore more subject to injury.

Weather is one of the main factors influencing shrinkage, and loss from crippling and death. Average Weights of Crippled and Dead, Hogs by Months. — Table 4 and Figure 4 were prepared to show whether there might be any connection between seasonal loss and the weight of hogs shipped. In the winter months, January, February, and March, the " crips " were the heavier hogs and were above the average weight of hogs shipped. During the late spring and summer months, April to August, the " crips " were be - low the average in weight. Table 4. — Hogs (all shipments) : Average weight of crippled and dead hogs by months, 1922, as percentage of average weight of all hogs shipped each month Figure 4 also shows that the weights of hogs dying while in transit were opposite to those crippled in the various sea - sons of the year. The lighter hogs were killed in fall and winter months, while hogs above the average weight of all shipped were killed during the summer months. Influence of the Average Weight of Hogs Loaded in the Car. — It was impossible to get data showing the hogs of each grade or type in each carload, and then determine the rela - tion, if any, between shrinkage, " crips," and " deads " and the type of hog. However, it was possible to use the average weight of hogs loaded in each car as a basis for determining, in a rough way, the relation of average weight to shipping losses. Table 5 and Figure 5 indicate that as the average weight of the hog increases, the shrinkage tends to decrease. However, there is such a slight difference that a definite state- Average weight of hogs shipped, lbs. Average weight lbs.

Of course, if the heavier hogs were of the rough, paunchy type, such as rough packing sows, then a heavier shrink might be expected than with the smooth type of light hog. Further light on this topic will be given in a later section. Table 5 and Figure 6 show that crippling tends to increase proportionately as the average weight of the animal increases. It has been stated in a preceding section that crippling was mainly due to accident. Injury from piling up in the car, or because the hogs were fatter and unable to handle themselves as well in the car would probably be more likely to occur with heavier hogs. In the same figure (Figure 6) , it will be noted that " deads " do not show as close relationship to average weight as was true with " crips," tho the tendency appears to be to increase with the increasing average weight of the hogs loaded. The fact that the relationship is not so close as in the case of t crips " seems reasonable when it is recalled that deaths in ansit result largely from lung affections rather than from accident Therefore, weather conditions and handling methods prior to and at the time of loading would be im - portant factors influencing the percentage of dead animals. </seg>

            <seg id="p020">20 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 209 Relation of the Weight Loaded in the Car to Losses in Transit. — It would have been desirable in this connection if the dimensions of the cars loaded could have been determined, and considered in formulating the data. However, it was found impracticable to get that information. Still, since most of the cars used in shipping were the standard 36 - foot stock car, the data presented in Tables 6 and 7 do indi - cate the influence of weight, loaded in car, upon losses in transit. Table 6. — Hogs (straight shipments) : Influence of weight loaded in car upon shrinkage in transit, 1922 Other factors than weight loaded in the car influence losses, and it is impossible to segregate one from another. The num - ber of animals in the car and the average weight of those animals must be considered. Table 6 and Figure 7 indicate that the greatest shrink per hundredweight occurred in cars containing the least weight; the next greatest in cars loaded the heaviest, and the least shrink, in cars loaded near the minimum specified by the railroads. It is the consensus of opinion among those who have studied livestock shipping practices that a comfortably loaded car — one containing neither too little nor too much weight — will reach the market with the least shrinkage.

From one standpoint, underloading is the more undesirable of the two because, even tho shrinkage is no greater, freight costs per hundredweight shipped would be higher. Table 7 and Figure 8 indicate that losses from " crips " and " deads " increase proportionately with the weight loaded in the car. Loading below the minimum might, there - fore, seem desirable to avoid loss from crippled and dead animals. However, Table 2 showed that " crips " and " deads " made up less than one-half of one per cent of the total weight shipped, and " crips " and even " deads " have some value. Thus, it might be best to risk some loss from these sources by loading at least to the minimum and avoiding higher freight costs per hundredweight. Then, too, shrinkage is a total loss. If loading with lighter weights increases shrink more than a fourth of a pound ( .34 of a pound increase shown in Table 6), that would more than offset the saving because of fewer " crips " and " deads." The main factor in determining the weight to be loaded in the car should be the type of hogs shipped.

Con - sidering this fact, it would tend to show that perhaps the reason the heavier hogs shrank less was because most of the hogs in the heavier classes had traveled shorter distances to market and were in transit a shorter time. This would give greater weight to the findings in the study made by the Federal Trade Commission which was quoted previously. In connection with this study of the influence of time and distance on shrinkage, we might quote again from the report of the Federal Trade Commission. It states that " after the first 20 to 30 hours en route the shrinkage increased in direct ratio with the increase of time in transit ; that during the first 20 to 30 hours the average shrinkage varied but slightly." * The data given in Tables 10 and 11 are in line with the com - mission's report, but the Nebraska study does not include shipments in transit longer than 35 hours. No mention has been made of crippling and killing as in - fluenced by distance and time. Tables 8 and 9 might indicate that " crips " are most numerous in cars traveling less than 250 miles and in transit less than 20 hours, but it will be noted that the hogs in these distance and time classes were the heavier type, and it was previously stated that there was a tendency for crippling to increase as the average weight of the hog loaded in the car increased. As to dead animals, the tables indicate that they are most numerous in cars traveling farthest to market and in transit the longest time. Only a few of the factors that may influence loss in transit have been considered here. No doubt some of the most im - portant have been omitted because of the limitations of the available data. The way in which the animals have been fed, the methods of handling both before loading and during load - ing, and feeding before loading or while on the cars are other factors that no doubt have an influence on the amount of shrinkage and the extent of crippling and killing. Losses in transit, as a whole, are not the result of any single cause but rather the composite effects of many factors acting coincidently. It is difficult if not impossible to isolate the precise effect of any one factor from the effect of other factors. • Report of Federal Trade Commission on the Heat-Packing Industry : Vol. IV. p. 174. </seg>
            <seg id="p025">Co-Operative Marketing of Livestock 25 The data used here are for only one year and the results may therefore be somewhat different from the results that would be secured in other years under different weather con - ditions. The data are presented in the hope that, even tho incomplete, they may aid shippers in reducing these indefinite elements of cost, and thereby help to reduce the spread be - tween producer and consumer. THE DEFINITE ITEMS OF MARKETING COST Some items of the cost of marketing livestock are definite, the unit charges being definitely established. The bases for such charges vary. Some are charged against the livestock on a weight basis, some on a head basis, and others on a car - lot basis. These bases will be taken up in a discussion of the particular items of cost. Livestock handled by co-operative organizations in Ne - braska is disposed of in several different ways. By far the larger part is consigned to commission firms at public stock - yards; some shipments are made direct to packing plants, some livestock is sold for local slaughter, and some is sold to be returned to farms for further feeding. The agencies from which records were secured disposed of livestock by all of these methods, the consignment method being used in handling the great bulk of animals. The data which follow represent only the consignment method of sale, because shipping records furnished complete material on only the consigned shipments. In the case of shipments direct to packing establishments, the sales were made " on track-shipping point," so the only charges de - terminable from the records were the deductions for local expenses. The same was, of course, true of local sales. Consequently the " spread " considered in this treatment of the subject is the differential between the price paid at the terminal market and the price received by the producer for his livestock. If the percentage of gross sales value returned to the pro - ducer were an indication of the efficiency of the marketing machinery, then it could safely be said that livestock is mar - keted more efficiently than practically any other farm product. Table 10 shows that more than 90 cents of the sales dollar, received for all kinds of livestock at terminal markets by the 19 Nebraska co-operatives in 1922, was paid to producers. But the percentage relation of net proceeds to gross sales value is not a measure of marketing efficiency, as can easily be shown. </seg>
            <seg id="p026">26 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 209 Table 10. — How the sales dollar received for the several species of livestock shipped thru 19 co-operative organiza - tions was distributed in 1922 Taking the figures for hogs in Table 10, it will be noted that on the average the hog producers shipping hogs thru the co - operative agencies from which the data were obtained re - ceived over 93 cents of the sales dollar in 1922. If figures were at hand for 1923 from the same organizations, they would undoubtedly show that farmers received less than 93 cents of the sales dollar. Why is this so; and does it prove that the marketing machinery was less efficient in 1923 than in 1922? Marketing charges were not increased. In fact some charges, commission rates for instance, were reduced slightly in 1923. There is no reason to believe that services rendered were less efficient. The explanation for the lower percentage received by pro - ducers for hogs in 1923 is very simple. The main factor causing the decrease in the per cent of the sales value re - turned to producers is the sales price. In 1922, hog prices were at a higher level than in 1923, while marketing costs did not change proportionately. Consequently, marketing costs took a larger share of the sales dollar when prices were low. The point just made is overlooked or disregarded by some people, who cite a low percentage of sales value re - turned to producers as proof positive that the marketing machinery is grossly inefficient. This may at times be true. If so, critical observation and study of the agencies perform - ing the marketing services will be helpful in correcting the inefficiencies that are found to exist. We can say, then, that Table 10 has little more than informational value. As a matter of convenience, marketing costs may be grouped under three heads, namely, terminal costs, transpor - tation charges, and local expenses. Table 11 shows the rela - tive importance of these three groups of costs. Transporta - tion charges make up over 50 per cent of the marketing cost of the 19 associations included in this particular study. Local expense is the smallest of the three groups.

Total costs equal 100 per cent. The foregoing figures are averages and lack significance on that account. One writer in discussing the value of averages has said that " the average is .... frequently defective and insignificant and may be, in cases where it blankets important changes or differences within the group, seriously mislead - ing." * In taking up the three groups of definite marketing costs, the range between high and low of the figures making up the average will be considered. Terminal Costs. — The three most important items of cost in this group are commission, yardage, and feed. There are other minor charges, such as insurance and inspection. Con - sidering all kinds of livestock, Table 11 shows that terminal costs make up a little less than one-third of the total cost of marketing. These are costs incurred at a point far removed from where the producer is located and it might be expected that he would not be familiar with the services for which these payments are made. Familiarity with the costs and the services performed at terminal markets will aid the producer in judging whether charges are commensurate with services rendered. Table 12 shows the average charges made for the main items of terminal cost, and the range in the costs of the 19 associations for which figures were available. As stated in a previous connection, data are given only on hog shipments, because shipments of other kinds of livestock were so few. While the table indicates rather wide variations as between the high cost and the low cost organizations, yet variations between markets are small (see Figure 11). Charges are quite uniform at all markets to which Nebraska is tributary. The wide range between the high cost and low cost concerns is certainly not due entirely to a difference in the services * Bailey, W. B., and Cummings, John, Statistics : Chap. VII, p. 96.

Commission Charges. — As may be noted in Table 12, the commission varies from 67.1 to 108.5 cents per 1000 pounds of livestock shipped. The association having the high cost pays 62 per cent more commission per 1000 pounds of stock than the association having the low cost. A part of the dif - ference is accounted for by the destination of the shipment. The low cost association shipped to Denver, which has a lower commission rate than the Missouri River markets. The low cost association did its own prorating. This work was done at the terminal market for the high cost association, and a prorating charge included in the commission charge. Another cause for variation is the fact that commission is usually charged on a per car basis. The agency which sends light loads to market therefore has a higher commission charge per 1000 pounds shipped than the one which loads its cars with a greater weight. The administration of the fed - eral act regulating stockyards has brought about greater uniformity in the charges as between markets. Prorating charges, for example, have been lowered and made more uni - form. </seg>

Yardage. — The charge for yardage shows a variation of 15.7 cents per 1000 pounds shipped, making the charge for the high association only 39 per cent greater than that of the low association. This charge is made on a per head basis, it being the same amount at all markets considered. Varia - tion is due, not to differences in the per head charge, but to differences in the average weight of animals shipped. A concern shipping heavy hogs would have a lower charge per 1000 pounds shipped than would a concern shipping light hogs; Feed. — The feed cost varies from 26.3 cents to 42.5 cents per 1000 pounds of hogs. The principal causes of the varia - tion are three in number: 1. The price of feed varies at dif - ferent markets. Denver which received shipments from the high cost association has higher feed prices than the other markets. 2. An increase in the distance that hogs are shipped increases the amount of feed consumed. 3. Heavy hogs re - quire less feed in proportion to weight than light hogs. Total Terminal Costs. — The terminal costs varied from 155.9 cents per 1000 pounds shipped for the low cost associa - tion to 189.5 cents for the high cost association, a difference of only 33.6 cents per 1000 pounds. Taking all markets, the average terminal cost for 19 organizations, from which records were secured, was 167.5 cents per 1000 pounds shipped. Transportation Charges. — The freight cost was more than 50 per cent of the total cost of marketing livestock thru the co-operative organizations from which records were secured. 1 i 11m $ i 4 S </seg>
            <seg id="p030">Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 209 30 The freight charge varied widely among the different associa - tions, because of the variation in the distance to market. A matter of interest to Nebraska shippers of livestock is the recent change in the rate structure of the state. The pur - pose of the readjustment was to remove rate discrimination and to make distance the primary rate base. The new rates became effective July 20, 1924. Local Expenses. — The variation in the local expenses of the associations studied was much greater than in the terminal expenses. The high cost concern had a charge of 17.26 cents per hundredweight, more than 4 times as great as the low cost concern with its charge of 4.05 cents. The average charge of the 19 associations was 9.11 cents per hundredweight, but averages mean little when the variation is so wide. This matter can best be summed up by quoting from the Preliminary Report on the Cost of Marketing Livestock in the Corn Belt, 1921* which says, in part, that "This condition (the wide variation in local costs) points out the necessity of knowing the answer to the question, ' Whose costs are you talking about?' and emphasizes the unreliability of averages as representations of marketing costs.

The deduction for insuring the animals against crippling and death is second in importance to the cost of management. In making this computation, payments for commercial insur - ance have been considered along with local assessments for a sinking fund. The cost of feed fed to animals in the local yards or placed in the car is another important local charge. Other items of less importance included in " other charges " as shown in Figure 12 are bedding cars, partitions, labor, drayage, telephone, scale fees, and in a few instances yard and shed rent. Except for the management cost, none of the local costs were common to all the organizations. PROBLEMS AND PRACTICES OF LOCAL CO-OPERATIVE LIVESTOCK MARKETING ORGANIZATIONS The co-operative livestock shipping agency is a relatively simple form of organization. Even so, considerable varia - tion exists in the shipping and business practices of such con - cerns. The reason for this rests partly on the fact that local conditions vary and partly on the lack of knowledge of other alternative methods that might be more practicable. The aim of the co-operative marketing organization should be to give the service expected of it by its members with the great - est efficiency, while keeping costs and losses at the lowest possible point. Many livestock marketing co-operatives have far to go before this goal is attained. Space does not permit a full consideration of the marketing practices and problems of the local organizations. However, the writers have attempted to single out what they consider are the most important, and these will be taken up in the succeeding pages. Basis for Payment of Manager. — Practically all the co - operative shipping agencies, except those buying stock out - right, pay for management on a commission basis. Con - siderable variation exists in the ways in which this commis - sion is computed, but in one way or another volume of busi - ness determines the amount. The two most common methods are to compute it on a hundredweight or per car basis. Occasionally it is figured on a per head basis, or as a certain percentage of the receipts from shipments. Since no general survey was made, no definite data can be presented to indi- </seg>
            <seg id="p032">32 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 209 cate which is the most favored method of computing com - mission among Nebraska shipping organizations. The commission basis worked satisfactorily in all cases observed where the commission was paid to the manager. A peculiar situation exists where the livestock is handled by a co-operative elevator company, which pays its manager a regular salary. In such cases the commission is usually paid to the company. Often, where this situation prevails, the manager considers shipping an unremunerative side line which takes an undue amount of his time from other business. Consequently he pushes the paying end of the business. Some elevator associations have adopted a plan for keeping the managers interested in shipping livestock which works out very satisfactorily. Instead of paying all the commission to the association, one-half is paid to the association and the other half is paid to the manager in addition to his regular salary. The more business he secures, the larger his income. All managers interviewed who received a part of the commis - sion, perhaps one-half of a six cents per hundredweight charge, were enthusiastic about shipping livestock. Some of the other men spent considerable time in explaining that the co-operative shipping of livestock is an unprofitable and unsatisfactory side line for an elevator company. Since about two-thirds of the Nebraska organizations shipping livestock co-operatively are engaged principally in some other line of business, it is necessary that the managers be interested in shipping livestock as a side line. Giving the manager a part of the commission is one way of securing his interest. The Commodity Organization. — Under what conditions is an association that is expressly organized to handle livestock — a commodity organization — to be preferred to one having other lines of business, such as a co-operative elevator? At many shipping points in Nebraska, the livestock shipping business is of such volume that the time of one man can be fully employed to care for it. At such points the shipping association would be the preferable agency. However, at the majority of shipping points, the volume of business is not sufficient to require the full time of a manager. The manager at such a point must have other sources of income, or a very high commission charge must be made, to give him a living wage. Farmers often question the advisability of having several co-operatives at a local shipping point, when the business can be cared for by one organization and one manager. For </seg>
            <seg id="p033">Co-Operative Marketing of Livestock 33 economy, one organization would seem advisable, but there are other considerations. The commodity organization has an advantage in that the interest of the members can be main - tained more easily. At a meeting of a shipping association., livestock shipping problems are discussed. At a meeting of a co-operative elevator company handling livestock, livestock shipping may never be mentioned except in the financial re - port of the manager. Another advantage of the commodity organization is that the interest of its manager is centered on one line of market - ing, and he will naturally become more efficient when that one line receives his undivided attention. A farmer giving part of his time to livestock shipping or a retired farmer wanting something to do has been found to make a good association manager where volume of business is small. It is important that some way be found to keep the manager directly interested in livestock marketing. Observation of some of the instances in which the shipping is most successfully handled by co-operative elevator or store managers has revealed that the livestock shipping organiza - tion is entirely distinct from the elevator or store organiza - tion, holds its meetings separately, and in all ways is a separate organization except that the manager is employed under a co-operative arrangement. This plan appears to be working successfully in the cases noted and would meet the criticisms offered in the preceding paragraphs. Summing up, we may say that local conditions and the wishes of the producers interested are the deciding factors in determining the type of livestock marketing organization. Economy, efficiency of operation, and the other considerations mentioned must be co-ordinated. Incorporation. — Every co-operative elevator association shipping livestock as a side line which was visited in securing data for this study was incorporated. Nearly all were organ - ized under the capital stock co-operative law, but a few of the older companies were organized under the general corporation law. The majority of the livestock shipping associations are non-stock organizations, and probably less than one-half are incorporated. The unincorporated association is like the corporation in that it is not dissolved by the death of a member, but is like the partnership in that members are held individually re - sponsible for company debts. Probably very few of the members realize this liability, else they would incorporate. </seg>
            <seg id="p034">34 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 209 There is really very little excuse for not incorporating. The fee is small, and the articles of incorporation are easily drawn. The new non-stock co-operative law, passed in 1925, is well adapted to the needs of this type of organization. Possibilities of the Producer's Contract. — The two Ne - braska co-operative laws, stock and non-stock, legalize the producer's contract. The worth of such contracts has been proved in many lines of co-operative enterprises. In Iowa, many livestock shipping associations are using it and reports indicate that it is quite satisfactory. The membership contract serves two important purposes: (1) The company is assured of a fairly definite volume of business; (2) competitors find it less advantageous to resort to unfair practices in order to get the business away from the co-operative company. Under present practices, a person listing livestock for ship - ment often fails to deliver it or may bring more stock than he has listed. As a result the manager does not know the number of stock that will be delivered. If cars are loaded too heavily, losses are almost certain to occur. Light loading increases transportation costs and terminal charges. A member knowing that he must deliver his stock to his own company would take an active interest. All the market stock of all members, being sold thru the association, would increase the volume of business. The larger the volume of business, the better the manager that may usually be secured. Methods of Covering Losses in Transit. — Losses in transit are cared for by various methods. When the stock of each shipper is sold separately, each owner naturally bears any shrink in his own livestock. When the stock in a car is sold as a unit or by grade without reference to ownership, the shrink is prorated to each shipper on the basis of weight or number of head contributed to the shipment. Loss in transit due to crippled or dead animals is cared for in various ways. A few associations ship all stock at owners' risk; some prorate losses against the shipments in which they occur; others carry commercial insurance; and still others have an insurance or sinking fund, created by deductions from receipts, which is drawn upon to cover losses. Prorating losses against the shipment in which they occur works satisfactorily when losses are small. An unusual loss, however, if prorated against a single shipment would un - doubtedly cause dissatisfaction among the shippers. Claims covering such losses often may be collected from the railroads, but only after considerable delay and expense. Commercial in- </seg>
            <seg id="p035">Co-Operative Marketing of Livestock 35 surance is, on the whole, quite satisfactory, but is hardly as economical a method as the sinking fund. One or the other of these last two methods is the safest to follow, with the weight of opinion favoring the sinking fund. Commercial insurance companies must, of necessity, charge rates that will cover all losses that may be expected as well as overhead. The efficient shipper carrying insurance must contribute to pay the losses of the inefficient shipper. Carry - ing commercial insurance tends to greater carelessness in handling stock at local points. Several managers who carried or had carried commercial insurance were frank in admitting that they were not so careful in loading, partition - ing, and performing like services when carrying commercial insurance as they were when carrying the risk themselves. Any loss adds to the cost of marketing, so a form of insurance that will promote greater care in handling is most desirable. The points against commercial insurance are the points in favor of the sinking fund method. As a rule the latter is more economical and tends to greater marketing efficiency. The rates should be made a little higher than seem necessary until an adequate fund is created. If a large surplus is ac - cumulated because of small losses, it may be prorated. The usual method of making a deduction for the sinking fund is to compute it on the hundredweight basis; a less common method is on a per head basis. A very satisfactory method, but one less used, is to take a certain small percentage of the proceeds from livestock sales. With this method, the amount of deduction varies with the sales value of the livestock. Home Grading, or Sale by Ownership or Mark. — Perhaps the biggest question a livestock shipping organization must decide has to do with its general plan of marketing. Under one plan the animals are marked on the basis of ownership before shipping and are sold by mark at the terminal market. Under the other plan the manager uses his judgment in de - termining the grade of the animals and prorates returns on the basis of his own grading. Sale by mark was the first plan used by shipping associations, but home grading is rapidly becoming the more popular. The main argument for sale by mark, and the main argu - ment used in the early organization of shipping associations, is that the producer gets what his stock brings on the market, less the actual marketing costs. Each shipper stands the shrink on his own stock, which is sold on its merits. He need not suffer if other shippers try shady methods to get bigger home weights, or excessive fills at the terminal market. </seg>
            <seg id="p036">36 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 209 There are a number of reasons why sale by mark might increase marketing costs. Extra time and handling are re - quired at the local point in marking the animals. Separate weighing, yarding and selling are required for each shipper's stock at the terminal market. This is likely to result in excessive shrinkage, due both to the extra sorting that is necessitated and to the fact that there may be loss in weight due to the " break " of the scales when a number of small lots are weighed. Furthermore, large lots of animals ordi - narily are sold to better advantage than small lots. The average number of shippers having hogs in each car shipped by the organizations from which records were obtained was 10.3. This number indicates the extent of separate sorting and weighing necessary if co-operative shipments were sold by mark or ownership. The cost of this extra service is a deduction from the sales value of the livestock. When home grading is done, and settlement made on the basis of the grades, a more capable manager is needed. He should have a good knowledge of market grades and of price differentials between grades. Furthermore, he must have the full confidence of his patrons so that no serious objections will be raised to his work. The arguments against sale by mark are arguments for sale by grade. One further point might be made. Instructions to sell by mark do not always result in sale by mark at the terminal stockyards. A common practice among commission firms has been to sell the shipment as one lot, possibly sorting out a few of the badly off-grade animals. Price differentials are then applied in the office when the prorating is done. This is likely to result in unfair distribution of the proceeds. An association manager would be in a much better position to distribute proceeds fairly than it is possible to do in the office of the commission firm where weight differences are the basis for adjustments. The preceding discussion applies particularly to the co - operative shipping of hogs. Cattle are more easily sorted, and are handled with less shrink at terminal markets. Con - sequently, sale by mark or ownership is to be preferred. Another reason for selling cattle by ownership is the difficulty in determining cattle grades and the great variation in the value of different grades of cattle. Local conditions must again be the determining factor in choosing between the two plans of marketing. Only after the membership of the association realizes the advantages of sale by grade and is willing to entrust the manager with new </seg>
            <seg id="p037">Co-Operative Marketing of Livestock 37 duties, should that plan be adopted. Those associations selling direct to packers have found it necessary to let the manager do the grading, because that class of buyers refuses to handle shipments requiring sorting and weighing by mark. Accounting Methods. — In making this survey of local co - operative livestock marketing agencies, an attempt was made to secure exact information such as is obtainable only from the accounting records of the organizations. The greatest difficulty encountered was the dearth of adequate records. The chief reason for this condition is the failure of the managers and the directors to realize the value of an adequate system of accounting. Probably the principal reason for the neglect of accounting records lies in the very nature of the business, and the simplicity of the form of organization. No equipment is needed, and therefore no capital is required. A small mem - bership fee is usually levied to take care of incidental ex - penses. It is not necessrary that the manager have special training. Each shipment is considered complete in itself. Actual expenses and perhaps certain small assessments for reserve funds are deducted from the proceeds and the re - mainder is paid to the shippers. Each shipment is settled and closed. No record except that showing settlement is deemed necessary. The commission received by the manager is small, and he often feels that he cannot devote his time to bookkeeping — an arduous task to the inexperienced. Some of the organizations visited had neither a bound book nor any semblance of a permanent record, unless a prorate sheet, which gave amounts due each consignor to a shipment and was attached to the account of sales for that shipment, can be classed as a permanent record. In some cases some kind of a bound book was in use, but no systematic plan was fol - lowed so that it could, in any way, be classed as a system of accounting, or even be called bookkeeping. A few, and the majority of these were companies engaged mainly in other lines of business which required complete records, had a close check on their livestock-shipping business. An adequate set of records serves several important pur - poses. First of all, it inspires the confidence of members in their manager and in their association. The manager whose records are complete and accurate seldom has diffi - culty in settling differences with his patrons. The members appreciate an adequate report at their annual meetings. Such a report is news for the local paper, and the best pos - sible publicity for the association. </seg>
            <seg id="p038">38 Nebraska Experiment Station, Bulletin 209 An adequate set of records provides the management with a source of information on the relative costs of shipping to the different markets. Records will aid in determining the best methods of weighing, handling, and selling livestock. Such figures make it possible for any manager to work out for his own association such information upon marketing costs as have been considered in the preceding pages. The records may be simple and at the same time satis - factory. A livestock shipping association is not engaged in a complicated business. Various systems of records are used, but one of the most satisfactory is described in Depart - ment Bulletin 1150, United States Department of Agricul - ture, Accounting Records and Business Methods for Live - stock Shipping Associations. This system does not require an experienced bookkeeper, but it furnishes essential in - formation. The co-operative marketing of livestock is a compara - tively recent development. Despite its newness it has been followed long enough that much valuable experience has been gained. It is highly desirable that the newer associations should be able to profit from the experience of the older organizations. This study was made in order to bring together information that may be of service to men inter - ested in the co-operative shipping of livestock. </seg>
