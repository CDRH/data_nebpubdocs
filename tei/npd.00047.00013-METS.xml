            <seg id="p003">SECRETARY DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND COMMERCE 3 September 15, 1920. Hon. Samuel R. McKelvie, Governor, Herewith I submit the 28th annual report of the Build - ing and Loan Associations of the State for the year ending June 30th, 1920, indicating the condition of seventy-four as - sociations now reporting. This report shows that practically the same prosperity shown in the 1919 report has continued throughout the year just closed and the increase in receipts and expenditures have again shown a 25 per cent gain and the total assets and lia - bilities have increased 18 per cent or $12,171,277.84. Two new associations are shown in the list, the Globe Savings and Loan Association at Columbus and the Home Savings and Loan Association at Fairbury. Loans are negotiated only on real estate security or as - signment of installment certificates of stock and then only for a conservative margin of the appraised value. This report shows that the loans on real estate averages 48 per cent of the appraised value of the security compared with 53 per cent in 1919. With the return of normal building conditions and the urgent housing conditions now existing, the future ac - tivities of these associations will no doubt show greater ac - tivity than heretofore. Nebraska is justified in her feeling of pride in being the home of some of the largest and most efficiently managed associations in existence anywhere. Very respectfully, / J. E. HART, Secretary, Department of Trade and Commerce. </seg>
