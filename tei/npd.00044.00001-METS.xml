            <seg id="p041">Report of the Attorney General. State of Nebraska, Legal Department. Lincoln, Nebraska, November 30, 1918. fo Keith Neville, Governor of the State of Nebraska Lincoln Sir Herewith you will find self-explanatory report of the department of the attorney general, covering the period from December 1, 1916 to December 1, 1918. There is now in the hands of the printer, for publication, manuscript of the opinions rendered by this department and a list of the many cases now pending in the several courts, in which the state is interested. Too great an interest can not be taken in the welfare of the water and irrigation rights in western Nebraska, the magnitude and importance of which it is difficult to esti - mate. There are many well informed persons who believe that the litigation now pending effecting the rights of water users and thereby the state of Nebraska, is greater and of more far reaching consequence and effect than any liti - gation which the state of Nebraska has ever had, and it may well be doubted whether it ever will have a legal controversy of the same magnitude and importance. The appropriation of the last legislature was not suffi - cient to complete the preparation and trial of the cases now pending and which must necessarily be brought or defended in the future. There should be a special appropriation in my judgment, of $25,000.00 for this work. A suit is now pending in the federal court at Denver, Colorado, and much of the work has been accomplished in the way of making necessary surveys along the South Platte River and gathering the necessary evidence with res]&gt;ect to the same. The celebrated case of Wyoming v. Colorado which has been pending for many years and was argued in the xliii </seg>
            <seg id="p042">XLIV HEPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL snpreme court of the United States, and has been, at the request of the supreme court, re-argued, directly effects the state of Nebraska. The states of Colorado and Wyo - ming were several years in the preparation of their case before it could be brought to trial. This department has been proceeding as speedily as possible and within the limits of the appropriation heretofore made in anticipation of the final outcome of the case in the United States su - preme court. The work which was commenced under my administration should be continued and completed and it will require money to do this and properly protect the rights of the people. A careful investigation into alleged trusts or monopolies and the proper prosecution of the same, can not be success - fully continued without an adequate appropriation there - for. The appropriation of the last legislature was wholly insufficient and was not enough to meet even the general expenses of prosecution of the cases then pending, and there should be an appropriation to meet expenses not only in the future but to cover expenses necessarily accrued and not paid during this bi-ennium by reason of the failure of the former legislature to properly meet the request of this department. The natural disturbances which may be ex - pected to arise in view of the reconstruction policy, under existing conditions, will necessarily absorb much time, at - tention and expense of the legal department. 1 would rec - ommend that there should be appropriated to my successor for special prosecutions the sum of $25,000.00. There is insufficient room at the present time, provided for the department of the attorney general. Extra steno - graphic help will be required, traveling expenses, postage and general maintenance will be much greater during the next bi-ennium, for the reasons hereinbefore given, and for which purpose there should be appropriated $3,000.00. The attorney general is a member of many administrative boards of the state involving duties that can not be dele - gated to the assistants, with the result that much of his time is required for this character of the work and per - mitting him to devote but little attention to strictly legal matters. This policy of imposing such duties upon the attorney general in my judgment, is wrong. Insofar as is compatible with the constitutional provision, he should </seg>
            <seg id="p043">DISBURSEMENTS XLV be relieved of these administrative duties, thus making him in fact, as well as in name, the legal adviser of the state and its officers. Frequently the law conflicts with the de - sired administrative policy or a supposed political expedi - ency. A weak or unscrupulous person in the office of at - torney general might then become a source of danger to the rights and interest of the people of the state. While the change as is here suggested would be sweeping, I be - lieve the best interests of the public require it. The work in this office is constantly enlarging and increasing. A multitude of questions from the general public have neces - sarily been answered, not under strict requirement of the law so to do, but because experience has demonstrated that it takes perhaps less time to do so than to educate the individuals to know that it is not one of the duties of the office to advise except as provided in the statute. While adhering to the rule in a general way, it has been the policy of this department for many years to advise and aid the people whenever they feel aggrieved and thus the work may be expected to continue to enlarge. The following salary appropriations should be made: Attorney General Per annum $2,000 For biennium $4,000 Deputy Attorney (leneral Per annum $2,000 For biennium First Assistant Attorney General Per annum .'. $2,000 For biennium $4,000 $4,000 Seoond Assistant Attorney General Per annum $2,000 For biennium $4,000 Third Assistant Attorney General Per annum '. $1,800 For biennium $3,600 Legal Stenographer Per annum $1,500 For biennium $3,000 Stenographer Per annum $ 840 For biennium .... $1,680 </seg>
            <seg id="p044">XLVI REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL It is with relief and a feeling akin to pleasure that I lay down the duties of this office. My only regret is the sever - ance of the friendly and personal relations existing between myself and my associates, and the other officers attached to the Capitol. To all of these friends I wish continued pros - perity and success; the close and friendly relations exist - ing between your offices and mine have been a source of great satisfaction to me and will be remembered by me with pride and pleasure long after the cares and trials of public service have been forgotten. To my successor I extend my congratulations and best wishes for a successful administration. Respectfully submitted Attorney General WILLIS E.

This is an action brought in the district court of Douglas county by the attorney general on behalf of the state of Nebraska to question and determine the authority of the respondents to act as members of the State Board of Medi - ation and Investigation. The attorney general, the rela - tor, contended that the law wliieh was passed by the legis - lature of the state of Nebraska in 1918 was unconstitutional and therefore that the members of the board were acting without legal authority. He contended that the members of the board were executive state officers and therefore could not act on said board. The court held that the law was constitutional and that the board was a committee appointed by the Governor and were powerless to do any - thing more than file a report with the Governor, and that no injunction could be granted for the purpose of restrain - ing the relators from exercising the functions of their offices. The restraining order was dissolved and the writ of injunction denied. Pending. Requla Schelly, et al. v. Geo. K. Carlton, et al.

Nebraska State Raihcai/ Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Gentlemen: In response to your inquiry of the 29th ul - timo, in which you inquire, "Does House Roll 217 enacted by the legislature of 1915 confer on the Nebraska State Railway Commission the general supervision over the man - ner in which electric transmission lines shall cross tracks of railway companies, within cities and villages", and you make special reference to your Morse Bluff situation. Answering, will say the act referred to. among other things, says: "The Nebraska State Railway Commission shall have general super - vision over any and all wires transmitting electric current, or any other wire whatsoever, crossing under or over any track of a railroad in this state at public highway crossings." From a careful reading of House Roll 217, it is very evi - dent that the legislature intended and thereby did confer upon the Nebraska State Railway Commission, such addi - tional powers, if any, required in addition to the constitu - tion creating your body, as may be necessary for the pub - lic welfare and safety of the people; and where any wire transmitting electric current or any other wire whatsoever, crosses under or over any track of railroad in this state at a public highway crossing, it is incumbent upon you to cause the party, company or corporation seeking to cross </seg>

All assessment life associations organized in Nebraska, must deposit se - curities with the Insurance Department of the State of Nebraska pur - suant to section 78, chapter 43, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1911, as amended by chapter 31, section 151, of the Nebraska Insur - ance Code of 1913. The law does not limit the deposits of such asso - citations with the insurance department. Guarantee Fund Life Association, Edward M. Martin, Vice President, Omaha, Nebraska. Gentlemen : In re the deposit, by your association, of its securities with the State Insurance Board (lnxurnnre Depart/unit) of the State of Nebraska. This will answer your inquiry as to the construction I place upon your duty to deposit your securities with the insurance department, and advise you that in my opinion the law not only permits, but requires you to so deposit your securities. Section 78, chapter 43, relating to mutual assessment life insurance companies, as found in the Com - piled Statutes of Nebraska, 1911, is as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p122">OPINION'S 3 "Sec. 78. Investment of Funds. — Any Nebraska corporation or asso - ciation accumulating any moneys to be held in trust for the purpose of the fulfillment of its policy or certificate, contract, or otherwise, shall invest such accumulations in bonds or treasury notes or warrants of the United States, of this or other states, or in interest bearing bonds of any municipal corporation in Nebraska, or in notes secured by mortgage on unencumbered real estate in the state of Nebraska, or Nebraska district irrigation bonds, not to exceed forty per cent of the appraised value thereof exclusive of improvements and shall deposit such securities with the auditor of state, who shall furnish such corporation or association with a certificate, under his seal of office, of such deposit, showing the purpose of such deposit and to what fund the same is to be applied when paid out and also showing the aggregate liabilities of such corporation or association at the date of issuance of such certificate; Provided how - ever, That such corporation or association may invest in real estate in Nebraska such a portion of said accumulation as is necessary for its accomodation in the transaction of its business and to be owned by said corporation or association, and in the erection of any building for such purpose may add thereto rooms for rental." Under this law the Guarantee Fund Life Association, and all other assessment life associations organized in Ne - braska, deposit all of their securities representing their invested assets and accumulations. An examination of your articles of incorporation, by-laws and policies convinces me that your yearly accumulations are additions to your guaranty and reserve funds, and as these additions and accumulations are invested in the secur - ities prescribed by the laws of this state, it is clearly your duty under the law to continue to deposit such securities with the Nebraska Insurance Department. During the 1913 session of our legislature the present Nebraska Insurance Code was enacted, which went into force and effect in July, 1913. That this code did not inter fere with the privilege or duty of your association to de - posit your securities with our insurance department is clear from a number of its sections, especially chapter 31, section 151, which is as follows "But all such companies or associations as are now licensed to do bus - iness within the State on such plan, (assessment) may continue to carry on the business of insurance on the plan under which they were organ - ized and doing business at the time of taking effect of this act." Mv construction of the law is that it was a part of your </seg>
            <seg id="p123">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 4 plan of transacting business to deposit your securities with the insurance department under the prior law, and as your articles of incorporation, by-laws and policies re - quired this deposit, and as all of these had been approved as required by law, it was not intended to change your plan of doing business or your duty to continue to deposit your securities upon the passage of the present insurance code. The law does not and cannot be construed to limit your deposits with the insurance department. Prior to the enactment of this code, certain life insurance companies were not required by law to deposit their securi - ties with the insurance department, and the legislature only intended to permit the companies which had thereto - fore been denied that privilege, to make a deposit not ex - ceeding $200,000. I am firmly convinced, and so hold, that the depositing of your securities with the insurance department of the state of Nebraska, is pursuant to our law and is required by our law, and under this construction you will continue from time to time to deposit your securities with said depart - ment. Trusting that I have fully answered your inquiry, I am, Very respectfully, January 11, 1917. Attorney General. County Board — Powers. The county board may reject all bids for books, blanks and stationery, but upon so doing it is the duty of the county board to again adver - tise for the furnishing of supplies. Annie U. Heck, County Clerk of York County, York, Ne - braska. Dear Madam: Yours of the 11th instant received and contents noted carefully.

In State vs. Globe Publishing Company, 19 Nebraska, 253 our supreme court answered that question as follows: "The county board may reject all bids for such supplies; but upon so doing it is its duty to again advertise lor the furnishing of supplies." Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, Attorney General. Constable — How Elected. Where two regular constables were elected at the last election, neither election is valid and the office of constable is then appointive instead of elective. The provision for the election of constable has been eliminated completely by amendment found in chapter 29 of the Ses - sion Laws of 1915. Mr. John S. Stidger, Grand Inland, Nebraska. My dear Sir: Yours of the eighth instant received in which you say : "In 1915, a law was passed authorizing County Judges, Municipal Judges, Justices of the Peace, etc., to appoint one constable, and no more, which officer shall have the regular powers and duties of a constable as provided by law. In this county, two regular constables were elected at the last election. Is the office of Constable now appointive instead of elective, or are both regular? My own opinion is that the election as to constables was void, and that an appointment is in order." Your opinion is no doubt sustained by law. The existing laws were amended by chapter 29 of the Session Laws of 1915 in such a way as to eliminate completely the provision for the election of constables. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, January 15, 1917. Attorney General. Where School Should Be Taught — Employment of Teacher.

Dear Madam : In your communication of January eighth, you say : "In School District No. 8 of this county, there is a dispute as to where the remainder of the school for this year should be held — in the old school house or in a new school house in another part of the district, and as they cannot agree as to where the school shall be taught they are not hiring any teacher. The director wishes me to bring an action of man - damus to compel the balance of the Board to hire a teacher and have school. I would like to have your opinion as to whether I would have the power to bring this action. I do not find anything in the school laws specifically giving me this power and I am not a member of the district." The fact that this district found it necessary to build a new school house would indicate sufficiently that they did not consider the old school house suitable. The district might possibly lose its state apportionment if it failed to have the additional term of school. Your letter is not sufficiently specific upon that point. I infer that the people in the district would no doubt have had the full term of school and intended to employ a teacher if they could have agreed upon which school house was to be occupied. The objection thus far urged is without any foundation or ground and ought not be tolerated for one moment. The children of school age should not be deprived of their legal rights, where the tax payers of this state are expending so much money for the education of children of school age, and the director is right in requesting that a mandamus be instituted to compel other members of the board to em - ploy a teacher to teach school. The fact that a new school house was built precludes the fact that it should be taught in any other place than in the new school house. The di - rector in the district or any tax payer therein, but prefera - bly a tax payer who has children of school age, should and would be the relator to apply to the district of your coun - ty for a writ of mandamus to compel the employment of a </seg>
            <seg id="p126">OPINION'S 7 teacher to teach school and that the same be taught in the new school house. I do not believe that you are the proper person to be the relator, because of the fact that you are the county superintendent. I believe you should take the matter up with the county attorney, although it is not in the nature of a criminal proceeding, in fact it is a civil one, and the school district would be responsible for the employ - ment of an attorney to prosecute the action. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, January 15, 1917. Attorney General. Register of Deeds — Salary of Deputy. The register of deeds, may appoint one or more deputies when authorized by the county board, which deputies shall have the powers and per - form all the duties of the register of deeds, upon giving a bond as provided by law. The salary of such deputy shall not exceed $1200.00 per year; provided, however, that the sum total of the fees of regis - ter of deeds and deputy, shall not exceed the fees received in said office. Mr. T. C. Green, Register of Deeds of Knox County, Cen ter, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Green : Yours of the 13th instant, with refer - ence to the action of the county board of supervisons reduc - ing the salary of your deputy, from $1,000.00 to $750.00 per year, received, contents noted carefully. Answering will say section 5620 of the Revised Statutes of 1913 provides that the register of deeds shall have power to take acknowledgments and administer oaths and to certi - fy the same under his hand and official seal and may appoint one or more deputies when authorized by the county board, who shall have all the powers and perform all the duties of such register of deeds, upon giving a bond as provided bv law. At the time that act of the legislature was passed and without repealing a former law, which is found in section 5735 of the Revised Statutes of 1913, which gave the regis - ter of deeds power to appoint a deputy without the consent of the county board and which is still the law; it would </seg>

If at the time of the enactment of section 5620 that act did repeal section 5735, and which we are inclined to believe did not so repeal section 5735, then and in that case there appears to be no power to prevent your paying a deputy such a sum for his assistance as you may desire, not exceeding $1,200 per year; provided however, that the sum total of your fees and his, does not exceed the fees received in your office, and as provided by section 2433 of the Revised Stat - utes of Nebraska for 1913. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, January 19, 1917. Attorney General. Contracts — Bids for County Printing. Contracts let by a county board where the "Press Association" has filed a combined bid for the county printing, are void. It has been held that such proceeding is in violation of law and the board is required to re-advertise and re-let the contracts. If the bid is the lowest possible price which the county may reasonably expect to secure, the board might be warranted in accepting the bid. C. A. Kingsbury, Esq., County Attorney of Di.ron County, Ponca, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Kingsbury: .Referring to the conversation we had when you were in the city recently, as well as your let - ter in which you say: "Calling your attention to contracts let by a county board where all the newspapers of a county organize under the name of "Press Associa - tion" and file a combined bid with the county board for the county print - ing, including tax list, supervisors' proceedings, etc., at the highest price fixed by the statute, can a county board entertain such bid and make contract, or would such contract be illegal for reasons given and found in chapter 45, entitled "Monopolies and Unlawful Combinations" and "Un - lawful Restraint of Trade"? "Does such a combination and bid have the effect of destroying com - petition and monopolizing trade as contemplated by said statute?" "Where such a bid has been filed, what is the duty of the county attor - ney in such cases?" While our supreme court has not passed squarely upon a similar question, one of our district courts in the state </seg>
            <seg id="p128">OPINIONS 9 has held that such a combination of bids or arrangement of bids as by you contemplated, is in violation of the law and required the board to re-advertise and re-let the con - tract. It may well be doubted though, whether there is such a violation of the statute that a prosecution under the section of statute referred to, would be successful. It would seem, as a business proposition, if the bid is the lowest possible price which the county may reasonably expect to secure, the board might be warranted in accepting the bid. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, January 19, 1917. Attorney General. County — May Purchase at Tax Sale A county, acting through the county attorney, may purchase property at tax sale and then foreclose the same as any third party or individual. Gen. A. Munn, Esq., County Attorney of Valley County, Ord, Nebraska. Dear Sir : Answering yours of the 13th instant, in which you say: "Do the provisions of Chapter 112, House Roll No. 727, of the Session Laws of Nebraska for 1915, page 261, providing that the County urer shall cancel all tax sales on which five years have elapsed since the date of sale, with no demand for a deed or action to foreclose, apply to the purchase at tax sale by the County, under Section 6529 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913?" &gt; "Should the County Treasurer cancel certificates of purchase made to the County, which have not been foreclosed or a demand for a deed made and which have been owned by the county for a period of more than five years?" It is my opinion that section 6529 of the Revised Statutes of 1913 was intended to permit the county, acting through its county board, to purchase and own the property and then foreclose it as any third party or individual might. The fact, however, that it also provided in the same section that the treasurer might retain in his custody the certif - icates and assign them to any person wishing to buy the </seg>
            <seg id="p129">10 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL same, would seem to indicate that that provision was not especially to save the necessity of a re-advertisement as to insure a collection of taxes at as early a date as pos - sible. The law, as provided in said chapter 112, in my judgment does not refer to the county itself, because that would have a tendency to cause the county, unless it was as prompt as an individual, to lose the taxes by reason of a failure to foreclose and bid in the property. It is not to be supposed that the legislature so intended and until the court of last resort shall have declared otherwise, I shall adhere to this view. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, January 19, 1917. Attorney General. Deputy County Treasurer — Appointment Of. County Commissioners should appoint the deputy county treasurer and fix his compensation, but the acceptance of bond filed by such person without appointment, will justify reasonable compensation. H. D. Curtiss, Esq., County Attorney of Rock County, Bassett, Nebraska. Dear Sir : In your letter of the 25th instant you say : "The County Commissioners accepted a bond filed by deputy county treasurer, but made no appointment nor allowed any salary. The county treasurer at the end of his term turned over the excess fees of his office to his successor in office and then filed a claim for the excess fees for deputy hire, with the County Commissioners." You inquire whether under the circumstances above stat - ed the county commissioners would be safe in allowing this claim. In answer to the question propounded by you, allow me to say that the concluding part of chapter 41, Session Laws of 1915, which amends section 2453, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, provides that except in cases which do not arise in your county: "Neither of the officers above named shall have any deputy or assist- </seg>
            <seg id="p130">OPINIONS 11 ants unless the county board shall, upon application, have found the same to be necessary, and the county board shall, in all cases, prescribe the number, the compensation and the time of employment of all deputies, clerks and assistants which the officers above named shall have in addi - tion to or other than those deputies, clerks, and assistants which are herein expressly provided for." A fair construction of the above quoted statutory pro - vision would be, it occurs to me, that application should be made beforehand to the county board and permission obtained to employ a deputy, and that the compensation of said deputy should be fixed by the board prior to the rendi - tion of such service. I am inclined, however, to the opinion that where the county board knows that services are being performed by a deputy and accepts the bond of some person as such dep - uty without indicating that it will refuse to allow him com - pensation, it will be justified after the services are rendered, — if in its judgment such services were necessary, — to allow such deputy a reasonable compensation for work done by him, provided, of course, that such allowance when added to the salary of his chief shall amount to no more than the fees of the office. WILLIS E. REED, Very respectfully, January 27, 1917. Attorney General. Deputy County Clerk — Salary. A deputy clerk is precluded by section 2429, Revised Statutes of 1913 from receiving compensation for services rendered, other than out of the fees of the office. Henry Pickett, Esq., Clerk of the District Court, Wahoo, Neb. Dear Sir: In your letter of the 26th instant, you say: "The question has arisen in this county as to whether or not the County Board can allow the salary of the Deputy Clerk of the District Court out of the general fund of the County." You request an opinion from this office regarding the question involved. </seg>
            <seg id="p131">12 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Allow me to say that the concluding part of section 2429, Revised Statutes of 1913, in speaking of the appointment of a deputy for the clerk of the district court and of his salary, says: "If the county board think necessary said clerk may be allowed one deputy at a compensation of not to exceed one half the amount allowed his principal, and such other assistants at such compensation and for such times as the board may allow, and none of said clerks, deputies or assistants shall receive any other compensation than that accruing to their office." The above quoted statutory provision would seem to pre - clude a deputy clerk of the district court from receiving compensation for services rendered other than out of the fees of the office. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED * January 27, 1917. Attorney General. County Board — Printing and Supplies. When no bids on county printing supplies are received, the county board would be warranted in buying, from time to time in the open market, the necessary supplies in order that it may carry out the mandate of the law. Hugh J. Boyle, Esq., County Attorney of Holt County, O'Neill, Nebr. Dear Sir: Yours of the 24th instant at hand, in which you say: "The county board of Holt County in compliance with the law duly advertised for the necessary supplies for the court house for the year 1917, but received no bids. Last year they advertised twice and receiv - ed no bids, and they have about concluded that there is no company that will furnish any bids under the advertisement." Now the question that confronts them is this : "Under these conditions can they go into the open market and pur - chase the necessary supplies? Of course if the law is that they cannot, then we are confronted with the condition here that we just simply can - not get any supplies for the court house." In an amendment to section 143, chapter 15, Revised </seg>
            <seg id="p132">OPINIONS 13 Statutes of 1913, found in the Session Laws of 1915, page 75, it is made the duty of the county board of each county, among other duties, the following: "(4) To provide suitable books, and stationery for the use of the coun - ty board, county clerk, county treasurer, county judge, sheriff, clerk of the district court, county superintendent, county surveyor, and county attorney." Section 1088 of the Revised Statutes of 1913, and which became a law in 1879, is as follows : "In all counties where the cost of furnishing the officers with books, stationery and blanks shall exceed the sum of two hundred dollars per year, the supplies for such purpose shall be let in separate contract to the lowest competent bidder, who shall give bond for the faithful per - formance of his contract, with at least two good and sufficient sureties, residents of the state. The bond required by this section shall be ap - proved by the county board and the sureties therein shall justify in the same manner as sureties on official bonds." Section 1089 provides : "It shall be the duty of the county clerk on or before the first day of December, annually, to prepare separate estimates of the books, blanks, and stationery required for the use of the county officers during the com - ing year, and which by law are not required to be furnished by the state, and during the first week in December he shall publish a brief advertise - ment in one newspaper published in his county, stating the probable gross number of each item of books, blanks, and stationery required by such county during the year following the first day of January next en - suing, and inviting bids therefor, which bids shall be filed with said clerk on or before the said first day of January." Section 1090: "The county board shall, at their first meeting in January in each year, open said bids and award the contract for the furnishing of all such books, blanks and stationery as may be required by the County officers, to the lowest bidder competent under the provisions of this subdivision, and who complies with its provisions." Provided: the county board may reject any or all bids Section 1091, provides: "The accounts for books, blanks and stationery furnished under said contract shall be audited and paid as other accounts against the county, and no county board or other county officer shall procure any such books, blanks and stationery from any person other than the contractor or his </seg>
            <seg id="p133">14 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL assignee during the exintenee of such contract, and no account therefor shall be paid by the county." Each of the foregoing sections were passed in the same act at the same time in 1879. It will be noticed that in section 1090 the power was re - served to the board that it might reject any and all bids, and that the limitation placed upon the officers of the coun - ty not to purchase from any one except the contractor or his assignee, was limited to the period "during the exist - ence of such contract." It is necessarily presupposed that a contract would have first been entered into. In 1905, an act was passed, which is now section 1104 of the Revised Statutes of 1913, and is as follows : "All contracts, either express or implied, entered into with any county board, for or on behalf of any county, and all orders given by any such board or any of the members thereof, for any article, service, public im - provement, material or labor in contravention of any statutory limita - tion, or when there are, or were no funds legally available therefor, or in the absence of a statute expressly authorizing such contract to be en - tered into, or such order to be given, are hereby declared unlawful, and shall be wholly void as an obligation against any such county." The foregoing sections cannot be literally followed and at the same time comply with the general as well as the specific, duty enjoined upon the county board of the county to provide suitable books and stationery for the use of the county board, county clerk, county treasurer, county judge, sheriff, clerk of the district court, county superintendent, county surveyor and county attorney, if no one makes any bid to furnish the same. After the legislature specifically directed the county board to take all necessary steps to guard the rights of the taxpayers of the county by adver - tising for bids to furnish the necessary supplies to the pub - lic officers, and after the county board has followed the di - rection of the legislature in that respect, and no bids have been offered, there is yet a continuing duty on the part of the county board to furnish suitable books, stationery, etc., for the use of the county board and its officers, and this /luty cannot be performed unless it is permitted to pur - chase in the open market the necessary supplies and, this must have been implied when in 1879 by section 1090 above </seg>
            <seg id="p134">OPINIONS 15 ■quoted the legislature expressly provided that the county board may reject any and all bids and in the following sec - tion prohibited the purchase of any supplies "during the existence of such contract." Any other construction would render the words "during the existence of such contract" wholly unnecessary. In view of all the facts and circumstances thus far placed before me, in my opinion the county board would be war - ranted in buying from time to time in the open market, a limited and necessary amount of supplies in order that it may carry out the mandate of the law to furnish such sup - plies. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, January 26, 1917. Attorney General. Lottery. The giving away of checks upon which are printed the amount of the purchase and the date of purchase, and at the end of each month, re - funding the amount of one day's business, is in violation of the law. David S. Simms, Esq., County Attorney of Nuckolls Coun - ty, Nelson, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Simms : Yours of the 9th instant encjosing print - ed circular of Preston Drug Company of No. 325 Central Ave., Superior, Nebraska, in which it appears that the drug company proposes that : "Every cash customer will receive a check upon which will be printed the amount of the purchase and date of purchase and at the end of every month we will pay back in cash the amount of one day's business. There is no lottery connected with this. We simply announce the day's busi - ness that we give away and you bring in the checks bearing that date and receive your money back." This is a manifest violation of the law and you are cer - tainly warranted in making an example out of some of these fellows who persist in seeking to evade and violate the law.

            <seg id="p135">16 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL County Sheriff — Serving Warrants. The sheriff is not compelled to serve warrants issued by a police magis - trate for violations of certain city ordinances, where such violations are not otherwise unlawful. Hugh J. Boyle, Esq., County Attorney of Holf Count if, O'Neill, Nebraska, Dear Sir: In your letter of the 24th ultimo you say: "I am seeking a little information and thought perhaps your depart - ment there might be able to answer my question: 'My understanding is that a police judge is also an examining magis - trate in misdemeanor and felony cases; that he also has exclusive juris - diction in the violation of city ordinances; that by statute the marshal is the ministerial officer of his court, and that he is vested with the same authority in the serving of writs and processes as the constable. 'Now my question is this: Can a police judge issue a warrant for the violation of city ordinances to the sheriff and does the sheriff have to serve it? In that class of cases the county is not liable for any court costs, unless same was instituted with the consent of the county attorney; and by statute the city is not liable ; therefore, my question.' " In answer to the question propounded by you, allow me to say that, although the question has not yet been passed upon by our supreme court and is therefore not entirely free from doubt, I think it very doubtful if the sheriff is compelled to serve warrants issued for the violation of city ordinances where such violation does not constitute an of - fense against the general laws of the state. The rule is in such cases that : "A prosecution for the violation of a city ordinance which does not embrace any offense made criminal by the laws of the state, while not in form a criminal prosecution, is, in fact, a civil proceeding to recover a penalty. (Peterson r. State, 79 Nebraska, 132.) Section 2445, Revised Statutes of 1913, provides, among other things, that the sheriff may in all cases require the party for whom any service is to be rendered to pay the office in advance of such service. As you have pointed out, a city is exempted by statute from liability for the costs of a prosecution to enforce the provisions of a city ordinance. It is to be borne in mind, moreover, that if the sheriff is compelled by law to serve warrants for the enforcement of </seg>
            <seg id="p136">OPINIONS 17 city ordinances in the county seat, he will be, by a parity of reason, compelled to serve for other cities and villages in his county. Hence, I am led to conclude from a consid - eration of the question from different angles, that the su - preme court will probably hold, if the question is put up to it, that a sheriff is not compelled to serve warrants is - sued by a police magistrate for violations of city ordi - nances where such violations are not otherwise unlawful. Attorney General. Bv DEXTER T. BARRETT, February 12, 1917. Deputy Attorney General. Deputy County Clerk — Salary.

W. W. Wenstrand, Esq., County Attorney of Saunders County, Wahoo, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In your letter of the 27th ultimo you inquire whether : "In counties of over 25,000 population, should the deputy clerk of the district court be paid a salary out of the fees of the office or out of the general fund of the county?" Permit me to say in answer to the question propounded by you that section 1194 of the Revised Statutes of 1913 provides in express terms that in all counties in the State of Nebraska having over 30,000 and less than 60,000 inhab - itants, the clerk of the district court shall have a deputy whose salary shall be $1,000 per annum, to be paid monthly out of the general fund of the county ; while section 2429 of the Revised Statutes of 1913 provides generally that the clerk of the district court of each county may, if the county board thinks necessary, be allowed one deputy at a compen - sation of not to exceed one-half the amount allowed his principal, and such other assistants at such compensation Very respectfully, AVILLIS E.

In view of the provisions of statute last above referrel to, I think it advisable that the county board in all coun - ties, except snch as have a population between 30,000 and 60,000, limit the compensation to be paid the clerk of the district court and his deputies and assistants to an amount not greater than the receipts of the office.

Dear Sir: Your letter of recent date received, wherein you state: "Some years ago Hall County purchased a square for Court House pur - poses, later they purchased another square upon which they built the present court house. The Hall County Agricultural Association owns the property upon which they have placed quite extensive improvements. The proposition placed before the county board is this: "That the County trade the old Court House square for the fair grounds, then there is a proposition that the Agricultural Association sell the old Court House square to the city for a nominal consideration. "I am aware that the county has no right to purchase the fair grounds for fair grounds purposes. But some of the attorneys here contend that the trade of property would be legal, and I have been requested by the County Board to ask an opinion of the Attorney General with reference to the matter."

The county sheriff may receive 10c per mile traveling expenses for each mile traveled within the county, and 5c traveling expenses for each mile necessarily traveled outside the county. Leroy A. Devoe, Esq., County Attorney of Keith County, Ogalalla, Nebraska. Dear Sir : Your letter of the 8th instant received, to the following effect : "We will be pleased to receive an opinion from your department re - garding the amount of mileage a Sheriff is entitled to wherein he goes to another state and brings- back a criminal who is a fugitive from jus - tice." Senate File 249, Session Laws of Nebraska for 1915, page 106, in part provides: "Traveling expenses for each mile actually and necessarily traveled within their several counties, ten cents; traveling expenses for each mile actually and necessarily traveled outside their several counties, five cents." It would seem, from careful reading of the part above quoted, that the sheriff would be entitled to receive five cents per mile in strict accordance with that part of the statute, for each mile which he actually and necessarily travels outside of his county; and this would apply to your question, inasmuch as there is no limitation upon the dis - tance he shall travel outside of the county, and no limita - tion that he shall remain within the state.

Now as to the $10.00 each, which the parties paid bond - ing companies to secure the bond which the unconstitutional law required should be furnished, permit me to suggest to you that I can see no sound reason for the payment of this $10.00 each to the bonding companies, unless the legislature is first disposed to do justice to the state officers, who by law, are required to give bond, and pay for the same out of their own pockets. It costs most state officers $100.00 per year for a bond of $50,000.00. In all courts of justice, where administrators or referees are required to give bonds, it is customary, usual and prop - er that the court allow a sum of money to pay the admin - istrator or referee for the amount of premium for the bond which he has been required to furnish, because the law re - quired the bond to be given. It is true that one could give a private bond, and thereby save the cost of giving the bond. It is equally true that the state pays for a postage </seg>

House Roll 535 entitled "A Bill (or an act to provide a state teachers' re - tirement fund and the care and disposition of such fund," held to be unconstitutoinal. Honorable F. C. Radke, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to your request for my opinion regarding the constitutionality of House Roll 535 entitled "A bill for an act to provide a state teachers' retirement fund and the care and disposition of such fund", permit me to say that I find no constitutional objection to the pro - vision for assessing teachers a percentage of their salaries for the purpose of assisting in establishing a fund out of which teachers' pensions may be paid so long as said assessment is optional with those now under contract to teach. I think, however, the law is vulnerable to the objection that the managing body of said fund known in the law as "the board of trustees of the teachers' retirement fund" contains in its membership two members who, by virtue of the act, are made executive state officers contrary to the provisions of sections 1 and 26 of article 5 of the consti - tution. In the case of State v. Porter, 69 Nebraska 203, it was held that an act creating a state registry of brands and marks was unconstitutional for the reason that three mem - bers of the committee appointed to execute the provisions of said act and who were appointed by the governor, would be, if the act were valid, executive state officers.

It occurs to me from a perusal of the contemplated act known as House Roll 535 that the powers of the board of trustees thereby created are at least as broad as the powers of either of the boards or committees above mentioned.

Dear Sir: In response to the oral request of your com - mittee, for an opinion as to the constitutionality of House Roll No. 757 entitled "A bill for an ac.t relating to the estab - lishment of co-operative banks", permit me to say that the following provision found in section 7 of said bill, viz : "No person shall be entitled to vote who has not been a member for more than three months — nor shall any mem - ber vote by proxy or have more than one vote", is clearly unconstitutional, for it conflicts with the provisions of sec - tion 5, article lib of the Constitution, which reads as fol - lows: "Sec. 5. (Elections.) The legislature shall provide by law that in all elections for directors or managers of incorporated companies, every stockholder shall (have) the right to vote in person or proxy, for the number of shares of stock owned by him, for as many persons as there are directors or managers to be elected, or to cumulate said shares and give one candidate as many votes as the number of directors multiplied by the number of his shares of stock, shall equal, or to distribute them upon the same principle among as many candidates as he shall think fit, and such directors or managers shall not be elected in any other man - ner." </seg>
            <seg id="p142">OPINIONS 23 I may add that if it is intended by the following provis - ion found in section 13 of said proposed act, viz: "Each shareholder shall be liable for the debts of the corporation to the amount of shares subscribed by him, whether wholly or partly paid up", to limit the liability of the stockhold - ers to the amount of their capital stock, such provision is likewise unconstitutional, for it contravenes section 7 of article lib of the Constitution, which provides that: "Every stockholder in a banking corporation or institution shall be in - dividually responsible and liable to its creditors over and above the amount of stock by him held to an amount equal to his respective stock or shares so held, for all its liabilities accruing, while he remains such stockholder." In conclusion, allow me to suggest that inasmuch as the bill under consideration has to do as its title indicates, with the subject of banking, and that it extends by its terms the scope of the state banking laws, it would be better, in my opinion, to pass the act as an amendment to the existing law upon the subject of banking than to pass it as an inde - pendent act. In a somewhat analogous case, it was held, although by a divided court, that : "Validity. The subject of the act of 1913 (laws 1913 ch. 101), was to provide a method of raising funds for the erection of county buildings, and the provision it makes is in addition and supplementary to the stat - utes already existing for that purpose. It does not contain the section or sections so amended, nor repeal such sections. It is therefore a viola - tion of section 11, article 111 of the constitution and void." (Uinier v. Butt County, 95 Neb. 473.) WILLIS E. REED, Attorney General. Very respectfully, February 19, 1917." Schools — Normal Training — Appropriation. A school which does not give instruction to the required number of pu - pils as provided by law, is not entitled to share in the appropriation for normal training as provided in section 140 article 10 of school laws, which section was revised and amended in 1913. Honorable W. H. Clemmons, State Superintendent of Pub - lic Instrttction, Lincoln, Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p143">24 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Dear Sir : You call my attention to the 7th sub-division of section 140, article 10, chapter 71, Revised Statues of 1913, which reads as follows: "Every high school approved for normal training, shall instruct a class of not less than ten, and every student admitted to such class shall con - tinue under instruction not less than- eighteen weeks in order to be count - ed in such class." You inquire with reference to an appropriation made as follows : "For normal training in high schools as required by Section 140, Ar - ticle 10 of school laws, as revised and amended in 1913, $125,000.00." "May money derived from such appropriation be used to defray the expenses of normal training in such high schools as do not have a class of ten or more in normal training?" In answer to your question, allow me to say that a school which does not give instruction to the required number of pupils under the above quoted provision of statute, is not entitled to share in the appropriation for normal training, where such appropriation is made in the words last above quoted. Permit me to add that in my opinion the legislature may however, if it desires to do so, appropriate a fund for nor - mal training, to be used at the discretion of the state super - intendent of public instruction, for the support and bene - fit of high schools which do not quite come up to the stat - utory requirements found in said section 140. To illustrate ; I note that among the appropriations shown under the heading "Superintendent of Public Instruction", in 1913, there is one of $50,000.00 for state aid for weak schools, as required by section 51, article 11 of School Laws of the state, as revised and amended in 1913.

Dear Sir : In your letter of the 28th ultimo you inquire whether the county superintendent is required to pay out of his salary, traveling expenses, stamps, express, and clerk hire when they are absolutely necessary for the car - rying on of the official business of his office. In answer to your question permit me to say that he is certainly not required to pay for stamps and express charges where such expense is incurred in the performance of the duties of his office. The question as to whether or not he shall be required to pay his traveling expenses and clerk hire made necessary in the performance of his official duties depends upon the county board of his county. "The county board, at their option, may allow the county superintend - ent such clerk hire and traveling expenses as they deem necessary." (Sec. 2452, Revised Statutes of 1913.)

Dear Sir: In your letter of the 27th ultimo you inquire as to whether or not vacancies in the office of justice of the peace may be filled for the unexpired term by appointment where such unexpired term exceeds one year. In answer to the question propounded by you permit me to say that section 2278, Revised Statutes of 1913, provides, in substance, that a vacancy in the office of justice of the peace shall be filled by election where the unexpired term exceeds one year.

Public money appropriated for normal training in high schools can not be distributed to private schools or prrochial schools doing normal training work. A private school or parochial school doing high school work can not collect free high school tuition. Honorable W. H. Clemmons, State Superintendent of Pub lie Instruction, Lincoln, Nebraska Dear Sir: You inquire: "Can money appropriated for training in the high school be dis - tributed to private schools doing normal training work or parochial schools doing normal training work? "Second. Can a private school doing ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth grade work collect the free high school tuition: also can a parochial school doing ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth grade work collect free high school tuition?" First : No. There is no statutory provision for the payment of public money for normal training in private or parochial schools, and the appropriation for normal train - ing made in 1915 is not broad enough in its terms to include such schools. Second: No. There is no statutory provision author - izing the payment of free high school tuition to any school other than a public school district granting free high school education to non-resident pupils.

            <seg id="p146">OPINIONS 27 Statute of Limitations — Tax Sale Certificates. The county treasurer shall not cancel tax sale certificates issued prior to September 1, 1903. If the taxes due at date of sale were paid at the time such sale was made, the county treasurer may cancel same on the tax list, provided no action to foreclose is pending. If the owner of any tax sale certificate shall fail or neglect to demand a deed thereon, or to commence foreclosure action on the same within five years from the date of sale, such tax sale certificate shall cease to be valid. Charles F. Barth, Esq., County Attorney of Saline County, Friend, Nebraska. Dear Sir : In your letter of the 2nd instant, you say : "Calling your attention to Section 6570 of the Revised Statutes, 1913 and said Chapter 112; shall the County Treasurer cancel tax sale certifi - cates issued prior to September 1st 1903? "In the concrete case in our County, the certificate was issued in 1896. Did Chapter 112 affect Section 6570? "In the second place; that if the owner shall fail or neglect to demand a deed for a period of five years, etc. From when shall this five year period be computed; five years after the passage of the act, or five years before the passage of the act?" I will answer your questions in the order in which they are propounded. Section 6570, Revised Statutes of 1913, is a part of the general revenue law passed in 1903. The sole purpose of its passage was to preserve rights relative to the collection of taxes levied prior to September 1, 1903. So far as tax sales made prior to 1903 are concerned, it has long since become obsolete, for such a sale, even if made so late as the 31st day of August, 1903, would be barred by the 1st day of September, 1910, under the law as it existed prior to 1903, if no action to foreclose it were commenced prior to that time. In my opinion where a tax sale was made prior to Sep - tember 1, 1913, and the taxes due at the date of the sale were paid thereon at the time such sale was made, the coun - ty treasurer may safely proceed to cancel same on the tax list, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 112, Re - vised Statutes of 1915 ; provided no action to foreclose same </seg>
            <seg id="p147">28 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL is now pending. If, however, the sale was made to a coun - ty or other municipal sub-division of the state, and the taxes were not actually paid at the time of the sale, I do not think the record should show that they are cancelled. Section 4 of article 9, Constitution of Nebraska, provides that: "The legislature shall have no power to release or discharge any county, city, township, town or district whatever, or the inhabitants thereof, or any corporation, or the property therein, from their or its proportionate share of the taxes to be levied for state purposes, or due any municipal corporation, nor shall commutation for such taxes be authorized in any form whatever." And the supreme court of this state has held, as it was obliged to hold, in order to sustain the above quoted pro - vision of the Constitution that: "The county's lien for taxes is not devested by the failure of the county to forclose its tax lien within the time limited by statute, but the county may again purchase at tax sale for the years covered by its prior purchase." County of Valley r. Milford. 70 Neb. 313. Second: Chapter 112, Session Laws of 1915, which amends section 6569, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, says that if the owner of any tax sale certificate shall fail or neglect to demand a deed thereon, or to commence an action for the foreclosure of the same within five years from the date of sale, such tax sale certificate shall cease to be valid or of any force or effect whatever. In constru - ing the five year limitation, I think you should consider the five year period as commencing at the date of sale regard - less of whether such sale took place prior to or since the passage of the 1915 act. Such is the literal reading of the statute and those who purchased prior to 1915 have had, at the present time, about twenty months within which to institute an action of fore - closure, since that act went into effect. It is not necessarily a violation of any constitutional right to give a retro-active effect to a statute relating to the limitations of actions, if a reasonable time is allowed after the passage of the act, for the enforcement of exist - ing rights. </seg>

The road dragging fund may be used by the county board for road dragging, paving, repairing paving, oiling or strawing sandy roads and for no other purpose. Also for purchasing the necessary tools for such work. A county assessor is not eligible to a third term of office. The assessor having been elected for the third term by a majority vote and having qualified by filing bond which has been approved, is then a tie facto officer. The road overseer shall be a resident of the district for which he is elected. The value of a piano shall be assessed to the vendee when the same is not entirely paid for. G. E. Simon, Esq., County Cambridge, Nebraska. attorney of Furnas County, Dear Sir : Your favor of the 27th ultimo, received, where - in you state : Would like your opinion on the following matters:" "Commissioners of Furnas County advise me that there is a balance of over $5,000.00 in the road dragging fund and desire to know if they may use the same to pay for road drags required throughout the county, also if any part of the same may be used in paying for cement work on the roads, culverts, etc. "There are three instances in the County where the assessors elected have held two terms in succession. The Commissioners have approved their bonds filed. In my opinion they are not eligible under Section 1957 Revised Statutes of 1913. I shall be very glad to have your opinion. "In another instance, a resident of the village was elected road overseer for road district lying outside of corporate limits of his vil - lage. Is he eligible? </seg>
            <seg id="p149">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 30 "Pianos are sold here by a Lincoln firm, taking installment notes therefor, containing stipulation that the title, ownership and right of possession of said instrument shall not pass from vendor until the whole indebtedness be paid by the vendee. The assessors wish to be advised how to assess the same. It is my opinion that only the equity of the holder should be assessed to him. Am I right?" Answering your questions in the order in which you ask them, I desire to suggest section 2931 Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, provides inter alia : "Said Board shall furnish a suitable road drag for each dragging dis - trict and pay for the same out of the County Road Fund — ." The county road fund is made up of the county levy for road purposes and of money collected by the county in conformity with the provisions of the inheritance tax law. Prior to 1915 registration fees for motor vehicles were credited to the county road fund. ( See section 3045 Revis - ed Statutes of Nebraska for 1913.) But in 1915 the law was so amended that such part of the motor vehicle regis - tration fees as is paid into the county treasury constitutes what is deemed the road dragging fund, which may be used by the county board for road dragging, paving, repairing paving, oiling or strawing sandy roads and for no other purpose. (See chapter 61, Session Laws of 1915.) It then follows that the road dragging fund may be used for cement work, where such cement work takes the form of paving on the public roads. I am of the opinion that road drags may be purchased with such fund, although it is unquestionably true that the general road fund for the county may be used for that purpose. Where the statute expressly provides that a fund may be used for road drag - ging purposes, it would seem that the right to use such fund for the purchase of the necessary tools is included. Relative to your second question, section 1957 Revised Statutes of 1913, provides : "At the general election in nineteen hundred and fourteen and every two years thereafter, there shall be elected in each precinct ward or township, one precinct assessor whose term of office shall be for two years, and who shall not be eligible to hold more than two terms in succession, ." </seg>
            <seg id="p150">OPINIONS 31 The statute presents a complete bar, with respect to the eligibility of a precinct assessor who has held two suc - cessive terms, to a third term. It is surprising that the question was not urged prior to election. The person, how - ever, having been elected by a majority vote, and having attempted to qualify by filing his bond and the same being approved, the question arises as to whether he is a de jure or de facto officer. Clearly he is a de facto officer as defined in ex parte Johnson, 15 Neb. 512. Relative to your third question, there is no statutory provision specifically stating where the road overseer shall reside, but it would seem to the writer that he should be a resident of the district for which he is elected. Your fourth question is one which presents a conditional sale. I desire to suggest that section 6313 Revised Statutes of 1913, provides, inter alia: "Personal property shall be listed in the manner following: First: Every person of full age and sound mind, being a resident of this state, shall list all his money, credits, bond or stocks, shares of joint stock or other companies, when the capital stock of such company is not assessed in this state, moneys loaned or invested, annuities, franchises, royalties »iid all other personal property; — ." For the purposes of assessment it seems advisable to assess the value of the piano to the vendee, although he has not paid for it, for the reason that the indebtedness which he owes to the vendor upon the piano, may be de - ducted by the vendee from his gross credits, in listing his property for assessment with the assessor. The supreme court of Nebraska established the rule that the word 'credits' as used in section 28, article 1, chapter 77 Compiled Statutes of 1903, means net credits. The in - debtedness of the tax payer may be deducted from gross credits to find the true value of the credits for assessment. Oleson v. C timing County, 81 Neb. 209. Very respectfully WILLIS E.

They may also prescribe the courses of study and text-books for the use of such school. Hon. W. H. Ciemmmu, State Superintendent of Public In - struction, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir : Your Mr. Dixon has submitted to this depart - ment for an opinion thereon, the letter of W. G. Baker, county superintendent of Howard county, dated March 13, 1917, and addressed to you, in which he states that District No. 3 of said Howard county voted last year to install an eleventh grade, and that the members of the board of trustees have refused to comply with the expressed request of the electors of the district as to the installation of an eleventh grade in said school. He inquires what remedy the electors have. In answer to the question propounded by Mr. Baker, I will say that if they have any legal remedy at all, it is by mandamus brought by some interested person in the dis - trict on behalf of himself and others similarly situated. It is not at all certain, however, that such a method of pro - cedure would be successful. In the case of State v. School District No. 1 Dixon County, reported in 31 Nebraska at page 552, it was held: "The school trustees of a high school have authority to classify and grade the scholars in the district and cause them to be taught in such departments as they may deem expedient: they may also prescribe the courses of study and text-books for the use of the school." I assume that the school at Elba is one organized under the provisions of article 6 of the school law, that is to say, that it is a school having more than 150 pupils, but with a less population than is required for the organization of a city school district. If this assumption be correct, the statute itself confers upon the trustees the power: "To prescribe courses of study and textbooks for the use of such schools."

This question was before the legislature is 1893, as will be observed by an examination of the House Journal, page 735, which is as follows : "Resolved, That a committee of three members of this House be appoint - ed by the speaker for the purpose of employing counsel to collect any moneys due to the state of Nebraska from the late state treasurer by reason of the failure of the late state treasurer to pay over to the present state treasurer, his successor in office, the amount of moneys collected by him while in office during the years 1889, 1890, 1891, 1892. Giving to such committee full power to act in the premises." A bill was introduced in the legislature and reported for passage, as shown on page 781 of said House Journal, being House Roll 529. This was a bill for an act authorizing the special committee, Johnston, Brockman, and Sinclair, appointed by the House of Representatives of Nebraska to investigate and report on the $230,000 state money deposit - ed by J.

That the state had no money on deposit in said Capital Nation - al Bank, unless the money therein deposited by J. E. Hill, as hereafter stated, can be so considered. "Second. That the late state treasurer, J. E. Hill, was and is a creditor of said bank and kept on deposit therein large sums of the state money, i. e.. as much as $347,000.00 at one time in 1892. "Third. That at the close of the term of office of said J. E.

            <seg id="p157">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 38 $236,361.83 Therefore, suit was instituted in the supreme court of this state, entitled State of Nebraska r. John E. Hill, et al., to recover from former state treasurer, Hill $236,364.62, which case is reported in 47 Neb. 456. There were two trials, the first trial the jury disagreed, the second thore was a general verdict for all the defendants; motion for new trial was denied. This case was most fully considered by the supreme court and many of the facts are set out in the decision. Judge Norval in delivering the opinion for the court said : "It remains to be determined whether the facts found by the special verdict, standing alone, or when taken in connection with the other facts, established by uncontradicted proofs, constitute a defense to the action. It is strenuously insisted that the surrender by Bartley of the certificates of deposit which he received from Hill to the Capital National Bank — the institution which had issued them — after it had become a state depository, and taking credit therefor on open account as state treasurer, amounted to a novation and operated as a release of the defendants from liability on their bond. I shall not at this time stop to discuss this line of defense. I am convinced that upon another ground the action must fail. While Bartley had no power to bind the state by accepting these certificates of deposit as payment, yet his action in that regard was subsequently ratified by the state. It is disclosed by this record that after the deposit of said certificates of deposit in the Capital National Bank to the credit of Bartley. as state treasurer, he drew checks against said 16th, one check for 5,000.00 16th, one check for 5,040.54 16th, one check for 141.67 16th, one check for 66.40 17th, one check for 67.34 17th, one check for 1,256.59 17th, one check for 48.72 17th, one check for 322.83 18th, one check for 65.41 18th, one check for 6,211.08 18th, one check for 34.10 18th, one check for 5,254.18 20th, one check for 244.50 20th, one check for 607.43 20th, one check for 1,224.

            <seg id="p158">OPINIONS 39 account aggregating $48,993.23, which were paid by said bank before its doors were closed. The state in its petition herein gave Hill credit for the same. Furthermore, the legislature, at its last session, in the act making appropriation for the current expenses of the state government for the ensuing years, and to pay the miscellaneous items of indebted - ness of the state, made the following appropriation: "For state sinking fund, one hundred eighty thousand and one hundred and one and seventy - five one hundredths ($180,101.75) dollars, to reimburse said fund for the same amount tied up in Capital \&lt;itinmil Hunk." (Session Laws, 1895, p. 404, ch. 88.) Subsequently, Bartley, as state treasurer, by the attorney gen - eral as his attorney, brought suit against the receiver of said bank to re - cover the unpaid balance of said account. I am convinced upon full con - sideration of these matters that the state has ratified the act of Bartley in accepting said certificates of deposit from Hill as money, and thereby exonerated him from liability upon his bond. The only fund* in the Cmpitml Xatioiwl Hank irhirh the xtate hail, or could claim to have, any in - terest in. it was shown were those arising from the deposit of the certifi - cates received from Hill. The legislature must have regarded this claim against the bank as belonging to the state, else it would not, in making the appropriation aforesaid to reimburse the *iiil;inn fund. ichU-h had be - iniiic Impmlreii hit the failure of the bank, have used the words, "amount tied up in the Capital National Bank." Had the law-makers desired to repudiate the act of Hill in delivering to his successor said certificates as money, in making said appropriation, it is reasonable to suppose they would have stated in the act the impairment of the sinking fund was oc - casioned by the money belonging thereto being "tied up in Hill's hands," or used some other appropriate designation. There is no room to doubt that the legislature was clothed with ample power to ratify the act of Bartley in receiving the certificates of deposit in settlement with Hill." The suit referred to as having been instituted by the attorney general to recover from the receiver is McDonald v. State of Nebraska, which was tried in the circuit court of appeals for the eighth district, eighth circuit, on March 19, 1900, and reported in 101 Fed. 171. If any doubt ever existed respecting the validity of "An act to provide in what courts the state may sue and be sued," approved February 14, 1877, which act contained the following. "Sec. 16. Every claim and demand against the state shall be forever barred, unless action be brought thereon within two years after the claim arose; Provided, That claims now subsisting shall not be barred until two years after the taking effect of this act, and every claim and demand in behalf of the state, except for revenue, shall be barred by the same lapse of time as is provided by law in case of like demands between priv- </seg>
            <seg id="p159">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 40 ate parties; Provided, however. That in any action on behalf of the state the defendant may plead and avail himself of any set-off or counter-claim growing out of or connected with the same matter or transaction upon which action is brought against him." (Session Laws of 1877. p. 19.) At this late date it would appear that the legislature in 1881, in amending that act, was not mislead and understood clearly the force and effect to be given therein with re - ference to the statute of limitations by reenacting the same limitation clause and making exceptions which have no application herein. (Session Laws of 1881, chap. 32, p. 211.) Finally, when the legislature of 1913 adopted the Re - vised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, as prepared by the Code Commission, and thereby, among others, re-enacted the following district statute: "Every claim and demand against the state shall be forever barred, un - less action be brought thereon within two years after the claim arose. Every claim and demand in behalf of the state, except for revenue, or upon official bonds, or for loans or moneys belonging to the school funds, or loans of school or other trust funds, or to lands or interest in lands thereto belonging, shall be barred by the same lapse of time as is pro - vided by the law in case of like demands between private parties." (Re - vised Statutes of 1913, sec. 7581.) (The statute of limitations for like demands between private parties is four years from the time the cause of action arose. Revised Statutes of 1913, sec. 7569.) It has by its own legislative construction adopted a course which it would be difficult, if not impossible, to ex - pect the courts to declare invalid. "The honor and dignity of the State are under the protection of the courts as well as of the executive and legislative branches; and in mat - ters of discretion the courts must protect it, even as against those de - partments. "An act of legislation may be confirmed by the subsequent recognition of it; and express confirmation is unnecessary." {Attorney (lenrral r. Joy. 55 Mich. 94.) "The legislature as well as the courts must take notice of what appears in the journal; and that its subsequent adoption of acts in recognition of the amendment was a sufficient confirmation of that act to cure its orig - inal invalidity if any existed." {Attorney (lemral r. Joit. supra.) </seg>
            <seg id="p160">OPINIONS 41 "The judgment was entered on the 14th day of January, 1857. The statute in force at that time allowed a writ of error to be brought at any time within four years after the judgment. But chapter 61 of the Gen - eral Laws of 1858, which was approved April 24th of that year, contains the following provision: 'The time within which a writ of error may be issued in any case is hereby limited to two years from the date of the judgment rendered in the case in which the writ is taken.' This writ of error was issued on the 28th day of October, 1859, more than two years after the date of entering the judgment. If the statute applies, it is clear, therefore, that the writ was barred. "The authorities seem fully to establish the rule that where mere in - choate rights are concerned, depending for their original existence on the law itself, they are subject to be abridged or modified by law, and that statutes of this character apply to such rights existing at the time of their passage, provided a reasonable time is left after the passage of the act, and before it would operate as a bar, for the party to exercise the right. (He Cordova v». City of Galveston, 4 Tex. 470; Winston vs. ifeCor - mack. 1 Carter (Ind.) 56; Oilman rx.Cuttx. 3 Foster (N. H.) 376; Willard M. Harvey. 4 id. 344; Smith vs. Monixon. 22 Pick., 430; Butler vs. Palm - er, 1 Hill, 324.) "In this case, about nine months remained after the passage of the act, and before the expiration of the two years from the date of the judgment. There can be no doubt that this must be considered as a reasonable time within which the writ of error might have been sued out, and that the statute therefore operated as a bar to its being issued afterwards." (Smith rs. Paekurd. et al., 12 Wis., 413, 414.) "A judgment was recovered in 1840 when the time limited by the Statute for commencing actions on such judgments was twenty years. In 1849 the statute was amended limiting the time to six years; the revised statutes fix the limitation at ten years. Held that the revised statutes applied to the judgment, and that the time tchich had run under farmer xtatutex wax to be computed ax a part of the ten years." Hol - combe v.

It would be expecting entirely too much to believe that the court of last resort would sustain an action of the kind contemplated in your resolution. While I am ready and anxious to discharge my full duty as attorney general, be - fore any costs or expenses are incurred, or any vexatious actions are commenced, the honor and integrity of the state and action of its legislature must be respected, therefore am frank to say that the probable outcome thereof is en - tirely too hazardous for me even to suggest that such an action be instituted.

Nebraska State Railway Commission — Approval of Missouri Pacific Securities The Nebraska State Railway Commission has no jurisdiction or authority </seg>
            <seg id="p162">OPINIONS 43 over the issuance of securities by the Missouri-Pacific Railway Company. Such securities, if in conformity to the law of the state of Missouri, would be valid without the approval of the Nebraska State Railway Commission, and if in the future the Missouri-Pacific Railway Company should become domesticated, the validity of the bonds issued by such corporation would not be effected by the omis - sion, failure or refusal of the Nebraska State Railway Commission to approve same. Such action is beyond the power and authority of such Commission. Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Neb. Gentlemen: In your favor of the 30th instant you say: "The new organization of the Missouri Pacific Railway Company lias been before the Commission in an informal conference for the pur - pose of ascertaining the necessary steps to be taken before the Nebraska State Railway Commission in order to get the authority of the Commis - sion to issue $383,000,000 in securities, said securities to be issued for the purpose of taking up all of the securities of the Iron Mountain and Missouri Pacific Railway Companies and all of the properties of the companies referred to, to be merged into the new organization. The new company is organized under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Missouri and proposes to domesticate in the state of Nebraska. "The Commission is desirous of having your opinion on the following questions : "First, if the reorganization plan is consummated by the corporation which is organized under and by virtue of the laws of Missouri, will the Nebraska State Railway Commission have any Jurisdiction whatever over the issuance of securities by that corporation. Allow me to call your attention to the wording of the stock and bonds act of the state of Nebraska: " 'Sec. 1. A common carrier or public service corporation organized, incorporated or hereafter incorporated under or by virtue of the laws of the state of Nebraska, may issue stocks, bonds, notes or other evi - dence of indebtedness * * * provided and not otherwise, that there shall have been secured from the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission an order authorizing such issue and the amount thereof, and stating that in the opinion of the Commission the use of the capital to be secured by the issue of such stock, bonds, notes or other evidence of indebtedness is resonably required for said purpose of the corpora - tion. * • *' "The new corporation referred to is not organized under and by virtue of the laws of Nebraska, and, as you perhaps know, many cor - porations are now incorporating under the laws of other states and are </seg>
            <seg id="p163">46 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL laws of the state now in force or hereafter enacted, the same as if form - ally incorporated in this -state, anything in its articles of incorporation or charter to the contrary notwithstanding, and such acts on the part of such corporation shall be conclusive evidence of the intent of such corporation to create and become a domestic corporation: And provided further, that every railroad corporation of any other state, which has heretofore leased or purchased any railroad in this state, shall, within sixty days from the passage of this act, file a duly certified copy of its articles of incorporation or charter with the secretary of state of this state, and shall, thereupon, become a corporation of this state, anything in its articles of incorporation or charter to the contrary notwithstand - ing; and in all suits or proceedings instituted against any such corpora - tion process may be served upon the agent or agents of such corporation or corporations in this state, in the same manner that process is author - ized by law to be served upon the agents of railroad corporations in this state organized and existing under the laws of this state." {Southern Railway Co. v. Allison. 190 U. S. 333.) In Crutcher v. Kentucky, 141 IT. S. 47, the court said : "The act of the legislature of Kentucky of March 2, 1860, 'to regulate agencies of foreign express companies',' which provides that the agent of an express company not incorporated by the laws of that state shall not carry on business there without first obtaining a license from the state, and that, preliminary thereto, he shall satisfy the auditor of the state that the company he represents is possessed of an actual capital of at least $150,000, and that if he engages in such business without license he shall be subject to fine, is a regulation of interstate commerce so far as applied to a corporation of another state engaged in that business, and is, to that extent, repugnant to the Constitution of the United States." In the body of the opinion in Crutcher v. Kentucky, supra, the court said: . "The court seems now, however, to have settled that Congress alone has the power to 'regulate commerce' in matters susceptible of general and uniform regulation; but that in matters which are affected by local considerations the power to 'regulate commerce' is possessed by both the federal and state legislatures, subject, however, to the modification that whenever Congress speaks on the subject that is the supreme law. Philadelphia Steamship Co. v. Pennsylvania. 122 U. S. 326; Robbins v. Shelby Taxing District, 120 U. S. 489, 492, 493. In other words, in matters best susceptible of local regulation the states have concurrent power with Congress to pass laws that are directly and unquestionably regulations of interstate commerce, and are intended as such; but, as to matters susceptible of uniform regulation, the power to pass laws, the object of which is to regulate interstate commerce, is in Congress alone." </seg>
            <seg id="p164">OPINIONS 47 The authorities cited in the opinion of the Railroad Com - mission of Georgia, in re Issue of Corporation Mortgage Bonds by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company, to which you refer, found in Commission Leaflets for January 1912-1913, sec. 8, page 87, seem to sustain the opinion of that commission and is expressive of the fundamental principles upon which all state government must necessari - ly rest. No state should have any greater power than that of her sister state, and whenever any law is passed which places an undue burden upon interstate commerce it is al - ways stricken down by the federal or supreme court of the United States when it finally reaches such courts for de - termination. The act of the Georgia Code which was under consider - ation by the Railroad Commission of that state, and found in their Code 1911, section 2204, is as follows: "No foreign corporation shall exercise within this state any corporate powers or privileges which, by the constitution or laws of Georgia, are denied or prohibited to corporations created by this state, or the exercise of which is contrary to the public policy of this state, anything in the charter or corporate powers of the foreign corporations to the contrary notwithstanding." Our statute is no broader, and I can do no better than to quote from the opinion of the Georgia Railroad Com - mission, found in Commission Leaflets for January, 1912 - 1913, sec. 8, page 96 : "This commission cannot escape from the conviction that its juris - diction, as also the visitorial power of this state over foreign corpora - tions, ends with the conduct of their general business and the exercise of the corporate powers within this state, and that it does not nor can it extend over their internal affairs, or over the exercise of corporate powers or the conduct of any business beyond our territorial limits. This is in accordance with the unvarying line of decisions of the courts that, 'it is considered best that such matters should fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of that state under the laws of which such foreign corporations were organized and where they are resident." From the foregoing it is quite evident that: 1. The Nebraska State Railway Commission has no jurisdiction or authority over the issuance of securities by the Missouri Pacific Railway Company. </seg>
            <seg id="p165">48 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 2. That such securities, if in conformity to the law of the state of Missouri, would be valid without any approval whatever from the Nebraska State Railway Commission, and the fact that the Missouri Pacific Railway Company should in the future become domesticated the validity of the bonds issued by such corporation would not be, in any manner, affected by the omission, failure, or refusal of your commission to approve the same, it being beyond the power and authority of your commission to act, and likewise of the legislature to authorize you so to do. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, March 31, 1917. Attorney General. Waterworks — Bonds for Operating Expenses A village is not authorized to issue bonds for operating expenses of waterworks. Board of Educational Lands &amp; Funds, Lincoln, Neb. Gentlemen : With reference to the legality of the bonds presented to the board by the village of Beliwood, bearing date at Beliwood, Neb., June 19, 1916, and issued by that village, will say the history of those bonds clearly shows that an attempt by the village was made to conform to the law as provided in section 5119, Revised Statutes of 1918, being a part of the laws governing cities of the second class and villages. A portion of that section of the law pro - vides : "Such cities or villages may borrow money or issue bonds for the purpose not exceeding twenty per cent of the assessed value of the taxable property within said city or village according to the last pre - ceding assessment thereof, for the purchase of steam engines or fire extinguishing apparatus, and for the purchase, erection or construction and maintenance of such water works, mains, portion or extension of any system of water works or water supply, or to pay for water furnished such city or village under contract; and levy and collect a general tax in the same manner as other municipal taxes may be levied and collect - ed, to an amount sufficient to pay the interest and principal of said bonds heretofore or hereafter issued as the same mature, on all the property within such city or village as shown and valued upon the assessment rolls of the assessor of the proper precinct or township, in addition to the sum authorized to be levied under subdivision one of </seg>
            <seg id="p166">OPINIONS 49 this section, and all taxes raised under this clause shall be retained in a fund known as "water fund.' " While there are other provisions, the objection which I find in particular is that the notice provides the same may be used for operating expenses. No such provision is found in the statute, and the village is not authorized to issue bonds for operating expenses. If the word "operat - ing" had been omitted in the giving of the notice I could have passed the bonds. There is a wide difference and dis - tinction between "operating" and the other words used in the statute, which are specific and for which alone the bonds may be issued. I regret exceedingly to decline to pass the bonds, because of the wealthy community, but the same not being properly passed I cannot overlook such an irregularity as this and safe-guard properly the trust funds which we are required to protect in the loaning of the money. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, April 7, 1917. Attorney General. Precinct Bonds — Certificate. The secretary of state may place a certificate on precinct bonds stating that to his best knowledge and belief such bonds have been issued according to law, and charge $1.00 for each certificate to which his seal is attached. He does not certify that the bonds are register - ed in his office. Mr. James T. Wachob, 429 Omaha National Bank Building, Omaha, Nebraska. Dear Sir: It is my understanding that the secretary of state will place a certificate on each of the precinct bonds to which you refer, stating in effect that to the best of his knowledge and belief such bonds have been issued accord - ing to law. In such case he will charge $1.00 for each certi - ficate to which his seal is attached. He will not certify that the bonds are registered in his office, for as a matter of fact thev are not.

Neither is he authorized to charge a fee for attaching his seal to hunting licenses issued by him. It is also illegal to charge a fee of 25c on each warrant drawn by the county clerk for the county. Don C. Fouts, Esq., County Attorney of Adams County, Hastings, Neb. Dear Sir: In your letter of the 12th ultimo you say: "1. When the county is indebted to persons they are required to file a written claim for the amount and have the claim sworn and sub - scribed to. The county clerk of this county has made it a practice to acknowledge the claim for claimant and has then charged the county 25 cents on each claim so acknowledged for his certificate and seal. Should this charge be made to the county or should the amount be col - lected from the claimant, then entered in the fee book and accounted for as fees of the office?" "2. The statute provides that the state treasurer may send hunting licenses to the different county clerks and he may distribute them, collect the fee of $1 and remit same to the state treasurer. The county clerk attached his seal to these hunting licenses and has then charged the county &amp; fee of 25 cents for certificate and seal. Nowhere in the law do we find any provision that permits the clerk to make such a charge to the county, and will you please let me know whether, in your opinion, such charge could be legally made?" "3. On all warrants signed by the chairman of the board and counter - signed by the county clerk, the clerk has affixed the seal of his office to said warrants, and has then charged the county 25 cents on each war - rant for seal and certificate. Is this a proper and legal charge against the county?" I will answer the above questions in the order in which they are propounded. </seg>
            <seg id="p168">OPINIONS 51 1. The county clerk should not charge against the county any fee for administering an affidavit verifying claims a - gainst the county, and I doubt whether such charge should be made against the claimant. Section 2434, Revised Stat - utes of 1913, provides, among other things, that county clerks shall receive "for performing the duties of clerk to the county commissioners and attending the business of the county such salary per annum to be paid by the county quarterly as the commissioners of the county shall allow, not exceeding in any year the sum of four hundred dollars." It occurs to me that the above quoted provision of statute is broad enough to include work done by the county clerk in seeing that claims against the county are properly veri - fied. 2. No, the county clerk is not authorized, in my opinion, to charge the county a fee for attaching his seal to hunting licenses issued by him under the authority of the state game commissioner. 3. No, a fee of twenty-five cents on each warrant drawn by the county clerk for the county, with his certificate and seal attached, is not a proper or legal charge against the county. It is the duty of the county clerk to draw such warrants as clerk of the board of county commissioners, and he is not entitled to a fee in addition to his salary as clerk of the board for performing such service. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, April 14, 1917. Attorney General. Anaesthetics — Administration. The words "personally administered" when applied to the administration of morphine or other narcotics or anaesthetics, by a physician, means that such drugs shall be administered by the physician himself, or at least administered in his immediate presence and under his personal supervision and direction. Fred Fouts, M. D., Central City, Neb Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of inquiry of the 13th instant permit me to say that, in my opinion, the words "personally administered," as found in section 4, chapter </seg>
            <seg id="p169">52 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 195, Session Laws of 1915, fairly construed, mean, when applied to the administration of morphine, or other nar - cotics or anaesthetics, by a physician, that such drugs shall be administered by the physician himself, with his own hands, or at least administered in his immediate presence and under his personal supervision and direction. Would be pleased to give another construction to the law if it were possible, in view of the circumstances detailed in your letter, but the words themselves, when taken in con - nection with the other provisions of the section, seem to leave room for no other construction than the one I have placed on it. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, April 14, 1917. Attorney General. Corporations — Where Assessed. The capital stock and franchise of a corporation shall be listed and taxed in the county, precinct, township, city or village and school district where the principal office or place of business of such cor - poration is located within the state. George A. Magney, Esq., County Attorney of Douglas Coun - ty, Omaha, Neb. Dear Sir : In your favor of the 13th instant you say : "The Bankers Realty Investment Company, having its principal place of business at Omaha, Douglas county, Nebraska, and which com - pany is organized and doing business under the general incorporation laws of the state of Nebraska, is engaged in architectural and construc - tion business. "The corporation has an authorized capitalization of $1,500,000.00, and a paid-up capital in the nature of shares of stock outstanding of approxi - mately $1,250,000.00. The assets of the corporation consist of real and personal property. "All of the personal property of the corporation is assessed here in Omaha, Douglas county, Nebraska.

"The question that has been submitted to me for an opinion by the </seg>

There is no question in my mind from the reading of the statutes and the authorities that they are not compelled to list their stock in the company for taxation, but as various county assessors have compelled shareholders to list their stock in the Bankers Realty Investment Company for taxation, the company desires an opin - ion from me whether the same is legal or not. I have heretofore render - ed an opinion in conformity with the views herein expressed, but it seems that the county attorneys of the various counties, or rather the county assessors, refuse to accept my opinion as the law, and therefore the company desires an opinion from the attorney general, which I told them I thought you would gladly render. "Section 6313, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, provides: '"First: Every person of full age and sound mind being a resident of this state, shall list all his monies, credits, bonds, or stocks, shares of joint stock or other companies, when the capital stock of such company is not assessed in this state.' "Section 6314 reads as follows: " 'The capital stock and franchise of corporations and persons, except as otherwise provided, shall be listed and taxed in the county, precinct, township, city or village or school district where the principal office or place of business of such corporation or person is located within this state. If there be no principal office or place of business in this state, then at the place in this state where any such corporation or person transacts business." "In Cooley on Taxation, 3rd Edition, Volume 1, Page 396, the author says, citing many cases: " 'That the capital of a corporation is represented by the property in which it has been invested, can hardly require the citation of authori - ties, but the following may be referred to.' "Considering the wording of our statute and the general principle of the law applying to taxation, the proposition that this stock is not subject to taxation is so elementary that I hesitated submitting it to your depart - ment, and by way of apology will say, that it is only because the com - pany has insisted and persisted in getting this opinion that I submit the same to you for your consideration." I am satisfied beyond any doubt that the position by you taken, and indicated in your letter, is absolutely correct, and no other logical conclusion can be deduced from the wording of the statute. The stock of the Bankers Kealty </seg>

Where a mother by her own labor, pro - vides that her infant children may be with her and under her direct care and supervision, she is maintaining a home for such children and is entitled to relief under the provisions of said act. Mr. G. F. Robinson, Fullerton, Neb. Dear Sir : In your letter of the 20th instant you call my attention to chapter 187, Laws of Nebraska for 1915, com - monly known as the ' ' Mother 's Pension Law, ' ' and inquire : "1. Is the mother of a weak-minded child, possibly eighteen years of age, entitled to a pension under this act, upon showing that she is not able to properly care for and maintain said child?" "2. la the mother of children two and three years of age, whose hus - band is living but who fails to support his wife and children, in fact they have separated but have not commenced divorce proceedings, en - titled to pension under this act? The mother is not maintaining a home, that is a domicile, but is working out by the week, keeping her children with her." I will answer the above questions in the order in which they are asked. 1. Yes, in my opinion, the mother of a weak-minded child, who is striving to maintain a home for that child and is a suitable person to have its care and custody, but is </seg>
            <seg id="p172">OPINIONS 55 unable to properly care for it without some financial assist - ance, is entitled to such assistance under the aforesaid act. •2. The answer to your second question is not altogether free from doubt. It is to be borne in mind, however, that the "Mother's Pension Law" is a remedial statute and, therefore, should be given a liberal construction in order to carry out the purposes of the act. Giving it such a con - struction, it occurs to me that it may fairly be held that a mother who, by her own labor, provides that her infant children may be with her and under her direct care and supervision, is maintaining a home for such children and is entitled to relief under the provisions of said act. This is said, of course, upon the assumption that the mother is a proper person to have the custody of the children, that she is keeping them in a suitable place, and that she needs some financial assistance from the county in order to main - tain them properly. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, April 23, 1917. Attorney General. State Board of Agriculture — Appropriation. The State Board of Agriculture of Nebraska, not being supported wholly and completely by state funds, does not come within the meaning of a state institution in its fullest sense. It is partially supported by the state and controlled and governed in a great measure by and through acts of the legislature. The appropriation referred to in House Roll 74 is not for the expenses of the government but is for the purpose of permanent improvement and is subject to a refer - endum. Hon. E. A. Walrath, Secretary of the Senate, Lincoln Neb. Dear Sir: In response to your inquiry of the 23rd instant, in which you say : "The Senate requests the Attorney General of Nebraska to submit for its permanent record an opinion on the following questions of serious interest at this time to the taxpayers of Nebraska. "First. Is the State Fair of Nebraska, or the State Board of Agricul - ture of Nebraska, a 'state institution' within the meaning of section 1C. of article 3, of the Constitution of Nebraska? </seg>
            <seg id="p173">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 56 "Second. If the said State Fair of Nebraska, or the State Board of Agriculture, is construed to be a 'state institution' within the meaning of section 1C, of article 3, of the Constitution of Nebraska, is the appropri - ation enacted in House Roll 74 subject to the referendum, as defined in the said section of the Constitution?" Will say there is a striking similarity between your in - quiry and that which was under consideration in the cese of Bariling v. Wait, 148 N. W. 507. In that case the court said: "The words 'state institution' may have two meanings; one, the cor - porate, or in some instances the associated body which carries on the activities for which it is organized, the other meaning the building or buildings in which that body exercises its proper functions and activi - ties. "Under the provisions of section 1C, art. 3, of the Constitution, a refer - endum cannot be ordered upon acts of the legislature 'making appropri - ations for the expenses of the state government and state institutions existing at the time such act is passed.' The expense of maintaining the national guard of Nebraska, which is a part of the state government, and, in one sense, a state institution, may not be made the subject of a referendum, but an appropriation to erect a building for a memorial armory is not an 'expense' under the meaning of this clause, is not with - in the exception, and may be made the subject of a referendum." In the well reasoned opinion delivered by the court in that case, Judge Let ton, among other things, said that the construction of a building such as the armory to be con - structed at Nebraska City was not an expense within the meaning of the Constitution, but rather it should be con - sidered in the nature of a permanent investment. Am, therefore, constrained to say that the state board of agriculture, not being supported wholly and completely by state funds, does not come within the meaning of a state institution in its fullest and complete sense, but it is parti - ally supported by the state, controlled and governed in a great measure by and through acts of the legislature, and has been since 1879. In either event, however, the appro - priation referred to in House Roll 74 is not for the ex - penses of the government as contemplated by the Consti - tution, but is for the purposes of a permanent improvement. </seg>
            <seg id="p174">OPINIONS 57 It is, therefore, subject to a referendum as defined in the constitution of Nebraska. Very respectfully, April 24, 1917. WILLIS E. REED, Attorney General. Bridges Over Irrigation Ditches — Maintenance It is the duty of private persons and corporations who have constructed ditches across public highways, to build bridges across said ditches and keep same in repair. K. W. McDonald, Esq., County Attorney of Morrill County, Bridgeport, Neb. Dear Sir: You sav: "A serious question has arisen in this county as to whose duty it is to construct and maintain bridges over the irrigation ditches and • • • the county commissioners have asked me, as county attorney, to write you for an opinion on this matter." Where the irrigation ditch under consideration has been constructed by a public irrigation district, the answer to your question is to be found, I think, in section 2983, Re - vised Statutes of 1913. Where, however, such ditch has been constructed and now belongs to a private person or corporation, the question is more difficult. Section 3446, Revised Statutes of 1913, by its terms makes it the duty of any person, corporation or association constructing any ditch or canal across any highway, to build a bridge across such ditch and to keep the highway open for safe and con - venient travel. This in effect throws the burden both of constructing and of maintaining the bridge upon the person or corporation which constructed the ditch. If the validity of this section of statute be conceded, your question is answered in effect as to the irrigation ditches of private persons and corporations. There is some question, however, as to the validity of said section, owing to the fact that it purports to be an amendment of a prior section which was held invalid by the supreme court of this state in the case of State v. Farmers and Merchants Irrigation Co., 59 Neb., 1, in which the Court said : </seg>
            <seg id="p175">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 58 "Section 58. Article 2, chapter 93a, Compiled Statutes, 1897, which assumes to exempt irrigation companies from the operation of the general law requiring railroad corporations, canal companies etc., to erect and maintain bridges and crossings on the highways where their roads, canals or ditches cross such highways, is special legislation, and. being in violation of the constitution, is void." In two similar cases the court has held that an act purporting to amend a prior act which has been held void is itself invalid and void. See State v. Benton, 33 Neb. 823; Plattsmouth r. Murphy 74 Neb. 749. If said section 3446 is held to be invalid it will leave us without any statutory provision governing in express terms the construction of bridges across irrigation ditches dug on public highways by a private person or corporation, unless an amendatory act passed in 1913, which purports to amend a prior act passed in 1887, be held invalid. The original act provided that : "Any railroad corporation, canal company, mill owner, or any person or persons who now own, or may hereafter own or operate, any railroad, canal, or ditch that crosses any public or private road shall make and keep in good repair good and sufficient crossings on all such roads, in - cluding all the grading, bridges, ditches, and culverts that may be nec - essary, within their right of way." (Compiled Statutes of 1909, ch. 78. sec. 110.) The amendment undertook to change the above quoted provision of statute so as to make it applicable to railroad corporations alone. This can be done without an arbitrary discrimination among the private owners of ditches if sec - tion 3446, Revised Statutes of 1913, be held valid, for in such case responsibilities and duties substantially alike will rest upon all private owners of ditches crossing public high - ways : but if section 3446 be held to be invalid, then it occurs to me the amendment of said section 6162, Cobbey's Ann - otated Statutes, passed in 1913, is subject to the same objec - tion urged against the section of statute held invalid in the case of State v. Farmers and Merchants Irrigation Com - pany, Supra. I am inclined, therefore, to the opinion that it is the duty of private persons and corporations who have constructed </seg>
            <seg id="p176">OPINIONS 59 ditches across public highways, to build bridges across said ditches, and keep same in repair. As you will observe, this conclusion can be reached either by holding section 3446, Revised Statutes of 1913, valid, or by holding chapter 89, Session Laws of 1913, which purports to amend a prior act passed in 1887, invalid. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, Attorney General. By GEO. W. AYRES, April 27, 1917. Special Assistant. Supreme Court Stenographers — Salaries. The appropriation bill and not the statutory provision fixing salaries, governs in determining what salaries supreme court stenographers shall receive for the biennium. Hon. Wm. H. Smith, State Auditor, Lincoln, Neb. Dear Sir: You say "The statute of 1915 fixes a certain salary, for illustration, at $1,000 per annum. The legislature of 1917 amended this provision increasing the salary to $1,200 per annum, but the amended statute does' not contain the emergency clause and therefore will not become operative for ninety days from the adjournment of the legislature. In the meantime should this department issue warrants in payment of salaries on the basis fixed by the old statute or the new?" I am informed that the legislature made an appropria - tion of $1200.00 per annum for each supreme court sten - ographer for and during the biennium, beginning April 1, 1917, and that this appropriation passed with an emer - gency clause. This department has heretofore held : "Where an act increasing the salaries' of stenographers of the various judicial districts contains no emergency clause, but the appropriation bill, which fixes the increase, passed with the emergency clause, such appropriation bill determines the amount to be paid the stenographers prior to the time the law increasing their salaries actually takes effect."

Only the county court of a county of which a deceased person was a resident at the time of his death, or in which he left real estate, has jurisdiction to assess an inheritance tax against his estate. Mr. William G. Mennen, Newark, New Jersey Dear Sir : Your letter of the 26th instant, addressed to the state auditor has been referred to me. No part of any inheritance tax in this state belongs to the state. It is all the property of the respective counties. The auditor has no authority to consent to the transfer of corporation stock. I know of no reason, however, why such transfer may not be made without his consent. If Elma G. Mennen was a resident of Newark, New Jersey at the time of her death and left no real estate in Nebraska, no inheritance tax was due, in my opinion, from her estate, for in Nebraska it is only the county court of the county of which deceased was a resident at the time of his death, or in which he left real estate that has juris - diction to assess an inheritance tax against his estate.

Dear Sir: Yours of the 28th ultimo received, wherein you say : "A party died intestate in Kimball County. Nebraska, in 1914, being a patentee on a United States homestead, his right to patent not yet having been perfected. Shortly after his death, a patent was issued to the heirs of the deceased. The probate of his estate finds that he left surviving him a father, non-resident alien, living in Denmark, and sever - al brothers and sisters, some of whom are non-resident aliens and some who are citizens living in Nebraska. Under the law of descent, this property, of course, would descend to the father. By sections 6272 to 6276, inclusive, it would seem that this land is a proper estate for an escheat. "I would be obliged for information from you instructing me whether or not this is a case for the county attorney to bring escheat proceedings, or whether there is a treaty in effect between the United States and Den - mark permitting citizens of Denmark to take title to property in the United States."

Irrigation Ditch Across Public Highway — Maintenance of Bridge It is the duty of a private person or corporation owning and controlling an irrigation ditch crossing a public highway, to build and maintain bridges across same on the public highway. K. W. McDonald, Esq., County Attorney of Morrill County, Bridgeport, Neb. Dear Sir: You inquire whose duty it is to build and maintain a bridge over an irrigation ditch crossing a public highway, where such ditch was constructed before the high - wav was laid out. </seg>
            <seg id="p180">OPINIONS 63 In 1887 an act was passed which provided, among other things, that: "Any railroad corporation, canal company, mill owner, or any person or persons who now own or may hereafter own or operate any railroad, canal or ditch that crosses any public or private road shall make and keep in good repair good and sufficient crossings on all such roads, in - cluding all the grading, bridges, ditches and culverts that may be neces - sary within their right of way." (Compiled Statutes of 1909, ch. 78, sec. 110.) This section of statute has been held applicable in the case of irrigation ditches. In the case of C. B. &lt;&amp; Q R. R. Co., v. Lancaster County, 29 Neb., 412, it was held that by virtue of said provision of statute it was the duty of a rail - road company to build and maintain bridges on a public highway crossing its right of way, even though the high - way had been laid out after the railroad was constructed. I know of no reason why a like rule would not obtain in the case of irrigation ditches constructed by private per - sons or corporations, in view of the provisions of section 3446, Revised Statutes of 1913, if said section of statute be held valid ; if it be held invalid, it would seem that the pro - visions of the section of statute heretofore quoted, passed in 1887, should be construed to be in force and effect, irre - spective of an attempted amendment of same passed in 1913, and in that case the same conclusion will be reached, viz., that it is the duty of a private person or corporation, owning and controlling an irrigation ditch crossing a public highway, to build and maintain bridges across same on such highway. There is room for doubt, however, as to whether the same rule obtains in the case of an irrigation ditch be - longing to a public irrigation or drainage district, for the statute in such case only attempts to set forth what the respective duties of such district and of the county shall be in cases where the ditch is constructed across a highway existing at the time of its construction, and provides further that unless the parties contract otherwise it shall be the duty of the county to maintain the bridge after its con - struction. (Revised Statutes of 1913, sec. 2983.) This indicates, I take it, that the legislature has determined, as a matter of public, policy, that public irrigation districts, which presumably exist for the public benefit, shall be re - lieved in some measure from the duty of maintaining </seg>

Incorporated Village — Powers An incorporated village does not have the power to compel, by ordi - nance, the owner of a village property to cut weeds in the street opposite his property, but said village may prevent, by ordinance, the deposit of rubbish in the streets. Hon. 0. K. Fuglei, Chairman, Board of Trustees, Peters - burg, Neb. Dear Sir: Your communication of the 2nd instant ad - dressed to the attorney general has been received and con - tents noted. You inquire whether the village of Petersburg may legally enact an ordinance requiring the owners of lots or parcels of land within the corporation to mow or destroy weeds in the streets opposite their property and keep same free from rubbish, etc., and, also, whether this work may be done by the street commissioner and the expense of same charged to the owners of the property. Sec. 2946, Revised Statutes for 1913 provides that land owners shall mow or destroy weeds in the public road opposite their property, and on failure to do so the overseer of roads may have this work done and the expense of same may be charged to the owner of the property. That is a provision of the general highway law and does not apply to incorporated cities and villages. We assume that Petersburg is an incorporated village. In incorporated cities and villages the streets belong to the corporation, and it is the duty of the city or village to care for the same. Section 5141, Revised Statutes for 1913. An ordinance of an incorporated village might forbid the deposit of rubbish in the streets and impose a fine or </seg>

The legislature by section 4106 of the statutes for 1913 provided in the case of metropolitan cities, that is, cities with a population of 100,000 or more, that owners may be compelled by ordinance to destroy weeds on vacant city lots, and on failure to do so the expense of having same done may be charged to the owner. In 1915 the legislature authorized cities of the first class — that is, the city of Lincoln — to compel owners of property to destroy weeds and worthless vegetation on lots or in streets and alleys opposite, and on failure to do so the expense of having same done may be assessed to owners of the property. The statutes or charters for cities of the second class and villages, do not seem to create such authority in the council or board of trustees, so that evidently an incor - porated village has not the power to compel by ordinance the owner of village property to cut weeds in the street opposite his property, but might prevent by ordinance the deposit of rubbish in the streets creating a nuisance, and impose a fine or penalty for so doing. Section 5141 of the statutes referred to, makes it the duty of such council or board of trustees to keep the public streets free from nuisance. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED. Attorney General.

There is nothing in the state law to prevent a druggist from taking out a government license for retailing liquor. The Retail Druggists' Committee, Lincoln, Neb. Gentlemen : In your letter of the 7th instant you make a number of inquiries, the first being: "Is there any possible way for a registered pharmacist or corporation who has no permit to obtain alcohol for manufacturing purposes only?" In response thereto will say that section 27, of House Roll 793, provides: "That the provisions of this act shall not be construed to apply to the preparation, sale, distribution, giving away, dispensing or possession of any alcoholic compound, preparation, or remedy, containing drugs, or medicines which does not contain more alcohol than is necessary for the legitimate purpose of extraction, solution, or preservation, and which contains drugs, whether singly or in compatible combination, in suffi - cient quantities to so medicate such compound, preparation, or remedy, as to make them medicinal preparations or compounds, and to render such compound, preparation or remedy unfit for use as a beverage; nor to mechanical, culinary, or toilet preparations which contain no more alcohol than is necessary to dissolve the oils, or extract the desired active principles and hold them in solution, provided that such com - pounds, preparations, remedies, perfumes, essences, extracts, and syrups, are not manufactured, bought, sold or dealt in for use as a beverage or intoxicant, and provided further that such compounds, preparations, remedies, perfumes, essences, extracts, and syrups, are unfit for use as beverages." Section 16, of the same act, is as follows "Any resident of this state, or any corporation authorized to transact business in this state owning and operating a plant for such purpose, and paying special taxes levied by the United States Internal Revenue Department, may upon compliance with the reauirements herein provided, manufacture and sell in or out of the state ethyl alcohol for medicinal, mechanical, scientific and other non-beverage purposes. Such sales in the state, however, to be made only to wholesale and retail druggists, scientific institutions, and hospitals authorized under the provisions of this act to handle such ethyl alcohol." Section 17, of said act, provides: </seg>

Section 19, of said House Roll 793, provides : "Every wholesale druggist or registered pharmacist or manufacturer of alcohol before entering into the business of manufacturing, selling, or keeping intoxicating liquors for the purposes herein provided, shall first secure a permit therefor from the governor. He shall make under oath, a statement to the governor showing the approximate value of his entire stock of merchandise, that he has not been guilty of violating any of the provisions of this act, and shall cause said application to be ac - companied by the affidavit of three disinterested freeholders of the county where the business is to be carried on, stating that the applicant is a person of good reputation and standing, and that they have read his application and believe the statements therein contained are true. Thereupon the governor, if satisfied, with the good faith and truthful - ness of said application and affidavits, and that the applicant has not been guilty of any violations of this act, that no remonstrance has been filed, and sustained against the issuance of such permit, and that the provisions of this act with reference to such application have been complied with, shall, upon payment of an annual fee of two dollars by retail druggists, and ten dollars by wholesale druggists or manufacturers of alcohol, issue to such persons a permit to engage in the business of manufacturing or selling and keeping intoxicating liquors for medic - inal, mechanical, scientific or sacramental purposes at wholesale, or at retail, as the case may be, under all the provisions and restrictions of this act. AH fees collected by the governor for permits shall be paid by him into the state school fund." Said sections 16, 17 and 19 are the only sections which seem to relate direc.tly to your line of business, and a strict compliance, within the meaning of those sections, will be required. Neither a pharmacist, nor a corporation, nor any member of such corporation, can legally obtain alcohol for manufacturing purposes only, without first securing a permit therefor. 2.

I shall not attempt to determine whether any particular brand, such as you have enumerated, conforms to that requirement. 3. Your third inquiry: "Is there any possible way for a doctor to procure pure alcohol on a prescription or otherwise, for personal use?" If the doctor seeks to proctire it for the purpose of using it as a beverage, it is a violation of the law. If, however, he desires to use it for medicinal, mechanical or scientific purposes only, he can procure the same from wholesale druggists. Section 19, of the act, permits the wholesale druggists ta sell. Section 23, of the act, permits the pur - chase : "All persons who use alcohol in scientific laboratories or hospitals, and who are exempt from the payment of a United States Internal Revenue liquor dealers' tax therefor, and who have complied with all of the conditions required by the United States Collector of Internal Revenue, may purchase from wholesale druggists and manufacturers and keep pure ethyl alcohol for scientific purposes and for use in hospitals." 4. In your fourth interrogatory you inquire : "What method would you suggest for labeling denaturized alcohol 7" This is not a legal question, and it is one that should be complied with by exercising your own good judgment and state the facts, with such brevity as to enable you to get it on the container. 5. In question five you inquire : "Can a druggist or drug firm be permitted to handle or sell Essence of Jamaica Ginger in any reasonable quantity that might be called for?" My answer to your second question covers this subject. 6.

"Could he be penalized for so doing? Section 45, of the act, provides as follows : "The possession of a receipt or stamp, showing the payment of the special tax levied by the United States upon the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquor, by any person not authorized under this act to manufacture or sell intoxicating liquors, or a certificate from the col - lector of internal revenue or any of his agents, clerks, or deputies, show - ing the payment of such internal revenue tax, by any such person a - foresaid shall be prime facie evidence of the unlawful sale, barter, ex - change, giving away, furnishing, or other disposition of intoxicating liquors in violation of this act by such person." The penalty for a violation of the law is ; section 56 "For the first offense, be fined the sum of one hundred dollars, or be imprisoned in the county jail not less than thirty days nor more than sixty days, and for the second offense, shall be imprisoned in the county jail not less than sixty nor more than ninety days, and for the third and all other subsequent offenses shall be guilty of a felony, and shall be imprisoned in the penitentiary not less than six months nor more than two years, and shall in all cases pay the costs of prosecution." 8. Your inquiry numbered eight is as follows: "Can malt extracts be carried in stock, such as Pabst, Malt Xutrine, etc., it being a sort of heavy beer preparation prescribed by physicians for a tonic?"

Registered pharmacists as hereinbefore described may make uses of pure ethyl alcohol, such as are permitted by the United States Commissioner of Internal Revenue without paying the sj&gt;ecial revenue tax as retail liquor dealers." If the preparations of campher, bay rum, and tinctures to which you refer, are for scientific, mechanical or medici - nal purposes only, the above quoted provision of the statute permits the druggist to keep them, provided he is a regis - tered pharmacist without a permit, but he is not allowed to sell them without a permit. In this connection I call attention to section 27 of the said act, which in effect, permits the sale of certain alco - holic compounds, preparations and remedies, where such compounds or preparations contain no more alcohol than is necessary for the purposes set forth in said section, and are, moreover, so compounded as to be unfit for use as beverages. Out of abundant caution, I believe one should apply to the Governor for, and secure a permit. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, May 9, i917. Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p188">OPINIONS 71 Advertising Intoxicating Liquor — Sale of Liquor. The word "Eureka" is a Greek word meaning, "I have found it" and the word "It" in no manner relates to intoxicating liquors. The words "Old Homestead" do not necessarily relate to whiskey Individuals may keep on hand an amount of whiskey necessary for their own use, but are prohibited by law from selling same. Archie M. Smith, Esq., County Attorney of Thurston Coun - ty, Pender Nebraska. My dear Mr. Smith : With reference to your favor of the 5th instant, in which vou sav: "On the front of a saloon in a hotel block which bears the name 'Eureka' is a display shingle labeled 'Eureka Bar, Fred Nickels, Proprie - tor.' Mr. Nickels will continue to occupy the room, formerly used as a saloon, as a soft drink emporium, and desires to leave the display shingle just as it is. Would it be legal to use for the soft drink display sign the same sign as was used for the saloon before May 1st, under section 9 of the prohibition statute, which prohibits the use of any letters, words, signs, pictures or other matter which has been used to advertise intoxicating liquors, to remain in or upon the premise?" First. In answer will say, section 9 of the prohibitory law recently enacted, is as follows: "It shall be unlawful for the owner of any premises, or the agent, tenant, or the person in control thereof, after ten days from the taking effect of this act, to knowingly allow any letters, words, signs, pictures, or other matter advertising, purporting to advertise, or which has been used to advertise intoxicating liquors, to remain in or upon said prem - ises." The words which were used prior to the 1st day of May, namely, "Eureka", "Eureka Bar, Fred Nickels, Proprie - tor", are not such words as were contemplated in section 9. "Eureka" is a Greek word meaning "I have found it", and the word "it" in no manner relates to intoxicating liquors. You say further "A saloon-keeper used in his saloon a clock with a wood dial on which were the following words in metallic raised letters: 'Old Homestead Whiskey.' The saloon-keeper pasted paper over the word 'whiskey' leaving 'Old Homestead' just as before. Does not the same section 9 require the removal of 'Old Homestead' as well as the word 'Whiskey'?" </seg>
            <seg id="p189">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 72 In answer thereto, will say, with the word "whiskey" eliminated, "Old Homestead" does not necessarily relate to whiskey. It is more frequently referred to with reference to a certain kind of tobacco. It likewise has reference to a play which has been played throughout the United States many times, and it can not be that the law intends to pro - hibit the use of a common name such as there used, and it does not necessarily relate to the drinking of intoxicating liquors; nor is it reasonable to suppose that the words "Old Homestead" would be considered as a liquor adver - tisement. You say further "A bill-board along a country road had a large advertisement of in - toxicating liquors upon it. This was blown down by the wind, so that the advertising was not visible, as it faced the ground. Does not the same section 9 require the removal or rather defacement of such bill - board?" The action of the elements seems to have complied with the letter of the law without any further notice or effort on the part of the public. You state further that : On April 27th, 1917, a farmer imported by rail fifty gallons of whisicey and eleven barrels of bottled beer, and was seen taking them in the direction of his home. A few days prior to that time it is reported that he bought five barrels of bottled beer at a local saloon. A few days before that it is reported that he imported by rail two half barrels of whiskey and ten barrels of bottled beer. Would the last consignment alone, of fifty gallons of whiskey and eleven barrels of beer be deemed unreasonable, so as to justify search and seizure, assuming that it was being stored in his private dwelling home. It is reported that this farmer generally keeps two or three hired men to whom he dispenses liquors in part payment of wages." While you say nothing about the age of the farmer who purchased the liquor referred to, and some talk might arise as to the amount of liquor which each individual might be entitled to keep at his own home as a reasonable amount, that is to say, some are under the impression that a person of twenty-five or thirty years would be entitled to have in his possession for his use, more than a person who was one hundred or one hundred and ten years of age, and the ques - tion as to what is a reasonable amount must ultimatelv be </seg>
            <seg id="p190">OPINIONS 73 determined, like many other questions, with all of the facts and circumstances before the court and a jury. The legis - lature, in its wisdom, omitted to say what a reasonable amount was. Under the facts stated, however, am frank in saying to you that I should lose no time in taking steps to proceed on the theory and the honest belief that the amount of whiskey which this man ought to have, was more than necessary for his individual use, and might not be considered beneficial for his health ; and of course he would have no right to sell it to his hired men or anyone else. In other words, he would be subject to prosecution and I leave it to your own good judgment to take such steps in the premises as you may think just and proper. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, May 12, 1917. Attorney General. Alcohol — Used for Beverage. It is unlawful to sell any compound which may be used as a beverage, if same contains more than one-half of one per cent of alcohol. Mr. C. Smrha, Milligan, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire whether "Triner's Bitter Ton - ic" and "Triner's American Elixir of Bitter Wine" may lawfully be sold. I doubt very much whether the above mentioned products may be sold under the law in this state. Each of them con - tains a far greater percentage of alcohol than is permitted by the new law on that subject, if they are susceptible of use as a beverage. The highest percentage of alcohol permissible under the new law in any beverage, is one-half of one per cent. The restriction of one-half of one per cent alcohol does not apply, however, in the case of alcoholic compounds, prep - arations or remedies used for medicinal, mechanical, culi - nary or toilet purposes, where no more alcohol than is nec - essary' and where such compounds, remedies or preparations contain other ingredients which render them unfit for use as beverages. See section 27 of the act which I enclose here - with. </seg>
            <seg id="p191">74 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL The fact that an article containing alcohol is labeled as a medicine, will not render its sale lawful, however, if it is fit for use as a beverage or is sold for that purpose.

A registered pharmacist desiring to handle or use alcohol in any manner or condition, should take out a permit to do so. C. L. Steivart, Esq., County Attorney of Clay County, Clay Center, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire "Can a registered pharmacist who has not availed himself of section 19, House Roll 793, obtain from a wholesale house one gallon of alcohol to be used by him in making and preparing for sale pharmacopoeial preparations as provided in section 27 of said House Roll and in com - pounding of physicians' prescriptions as provided in section 25?" It may well be doubted, in fact, I feel that the safer course is to require that a license be procured. The provision of section 12 to which you refer, has more special reference to the protection of carriers. The only safe course is for the pharmacist to take out a permit, if he desires to handle or use alcohol in any manner or con - dition. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. EEED, May 12, 1917. Attorney General. Special Bond Election in School District — Ballot A school district should bear the expense of having ballots printed for a special bond election.

Who prints the ballots for holding a special bond election in school districts in cities of 1,500 and over?" "2. Is it necessary to print ballots in newspapers prior to election?" "3. Who appoints the officials of election?" "4. Is it necessary to get out card of instructions, as per section 2001 of the Revised Statutes?" I will endeavor to answer your questions in the order in which they are propounded. 1. The school district should bear the expense of having ballots printed for a special bond election. The work of over-seeing the printing devolves properly, I think, upon the secretary of the board of education. 2. It is not necessary to print ballots in newspapers prior to a bond election. A notice of the time at which the election is to be held and of the purpose of the election should be printed, however, in some newspaper published inside the district. 3. The ballots at a special bond election should be re - ceived, and returns made, by the regular election board. (Revised Statutes of 1913, sec. 6951.) 4. It is not, in my opinion, absolutely necessary that a card of instructions, as per section 2001, Revised Statutes of 1918, be used at a special bond election, although it is entirely proper that instructions similar in form be given to the electors.

            <seg id="p193">76 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL dealer may lawfully sell a preparation containing less than one-half of one per cent of alcohol when sold. Herbert Rhodes, Esq., County Attorney of Burt County, Tekamah, Nebraska. My Dear Sir : In response to yours of the 4th instant, in which you say : "Relative to our phone conversation of some days ago concerning ship - ments of liquor received prior to midnight of April 30th, by express com - panies within the county, beg to say that the express companies in th« county are reluctant to ship the consignments back to the original con - signors for the reason that the shipments have all come from Omaha, Nebraska, and the companies claim that they have no right after the first day of May to ship liquors anywhere within the state. You will please note that these shipments were not all received by the express companies too late to be delivered by May 1st. In two instances, the consignments had been in the express office for more than a week and had not been delivered, though the consignee had been duly notified that the liquors were in the office. The lack of delivery was due to the fact that in this county we had a steady rain for nearly a week and the fanners were unable to travel. The consignments of liquor in each case, belonged to farmers." The fact that the liquor was shipped from a point in Ne - braska to another point in Nebraska, makes it prohibitory upon the carrier to return the shipment. It is only in such cases where the shipment starts from a point in a state that is wet, that I have advised that the shipment be re - turned to the original consignor. The fact that it rained and prevented a person from re - ceiving the liquor, or that the same was ordered by a farmer and belonged to a fanner, makes no difference. The express company is denied the right to deliver the liquor. There is but one course for you to pursue until the su - preme courts holds otherwise, and that is to follow the strict letter of the law with reference to the disposition of the same. No doubt the express company would be pleased to turn the matter over to the authorities authorized to re - ceive it under the prohibitory act. You state further : </seg>
            <seg id="p194">OPINIONS 77 "Also kindly advise me relative to one who is handling what I call 'hard cider' which is really not hard cider. A retail dealer has been handling a cider in town, which cider, according to the Government tests, contains less than one-half of one per cent of alcohol. However, this cider, if left open, within thirty days forms alcohol and shows a test of more than the one-half of one per cent of alcohol. Would your opinion be that the dealer has the right to sell the cider so long as the test does not show more than one-half of one per cent?" If, at the time the sale takes place, the article does not contain more than one-half of one per cent alcohol, the sale of the same is not a violation of the law. The prohibitory law did not seek to punish anyone for what the commodity itself might do unaided by anyone, since the violation, if at all, would simply be the violation of the cider itself, and I know of no way to punish the cider for so doing, (unless you drink it.) The law was intended to reach individuals and not the cider, for a violation of the law, if at all. If the cider has become in such condition as to contain more than one-half of one per cent of alcohol, then the selling of it would be a clear violation of the law. Very respectfully, WILLIS E.

You state further: "I am no boozer nor have I ever in my life sold a drop to anyone, and I have never been arrested for anything, nor ever have been a wit - ness on a liquor trial. And no one in Broken Bow can say that they ever saw me drunk." You state further that the beer which you ordered was from outside of the state, coining in fact, from Minneapolis.

From your communication it appears that your "busi - ness is the bottling and selling of home remedies, which are manufactured for me in the east, and the compounding and selling of extracts and shampoos. In the production of these I must use a certain per cent of alcohol in com - pounding.

I use alcohol only in compounding the following; vanilla, lemon, orange, pine - apple, banana, strawberry, wintergreen, peppermint and cinnamon extracts; for fruit coloring; for toilet creams and liquid shampoos." You say that unless you can get the alcohol for the means above stated, your way of earning a livelihood is taken away from you and that at your age and condition of life you are unable to do much of anything else. Answering will say, under section 27 of the prohibitory law, compounds such as are allowed to be sold under the United States federal law, such as you have specified, can be sold irrespective of the prohibitory law. In other words, the prohibitory law was not intended to interfere with the selling of such compounds.

            <seg id="p205">88 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL "Dave has advised the county commissioners, so I am informed, that the county is not bound to furnish necessaries to persons not paupers under ordinary circumstances, who lire in this city, and are temporarily unable to earn a livelihood by reason of being quarantined. "I am quite unable to see how he arrives at this opinion in view of section 5808 Revised Statutes of 1913 as amended by the 1915 legisla - ture. It seems to me that it makes special provision for such cases as this. "I am also unable to find any means by which a city of this class can pay for these things, outside of the actual expense of quarantine and fumigation. The law says 'except such cities, etc. to which that power shall be granted,' but I can not find that it has granted the power to cities of the second class. "The commissioners requested him to get the opinion of the attorney general on this point twice. They are in favor of paying the expense, but hesitate to disregard his opinion, though they have requested me to appear before them at their next meeting to argue the matter, and two of the three have told me they think it ought to be paid as any other 'poor' claim, since the city and county are taxed alike for this purpose. "Will you find out if the general has given an opinion, and if so send me a copy, and if not, will you be so good as to have one prepared and sent me? It is made the duty of the county commissioners by sec - tion 5808 Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, as amend - ed by section 14 chapter 20 Session Laws of Nebraska for 1915, page 81, to pay for the board, nursing and medical aid of the persons referred to in your letter. The amended section provides: "Aid to non-resident or person not a pauper.— Whenever any non - resident, or any other person not coming within the definition of a pauper, shall fall sick in any county in this state, not having money or property to pay his or her board, nursing and medical aid, it shall be the ,4uty of the county board, to furnish such assistance to such person as they shall deem necessary; and if any such person shall die, the county board shall provide all necessary means for a decent burial of sueh person."

            <seg id="p207">90 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Municipal Corporations — Assessment — Delivery of Beer A lumber corporation should be assessed upon the actual value of its property without any special regard to the book value of its capital stock. A railroad company has no right to deliver beer to the consignee or to deliver it to the consignor at any point within the state, but if the consignor can sell it at some place outside the state where such sale is lawful, the railroad may transport it to such place if requested by the consignor to do so. C. R. Stasenka, Esq., County Attorney of Franklin County, Bloomington, Nebr. Dear Sir : You say : "A lumber corporation of this county has recently been organized with a capital of 130,000.00. The corporation owns real estate of the value of $10,000.00, and lumber and other building materials valued at $14,000.00. The capital stock is paid up. The question is can the amount of the real estate held by this corporation and the amount of the stock of lumber etc. held by this corporation be deducted from the amount of the capital stock, and should the balance of $6,000.00 be assessed? In case that the real estate is to be deducted from the capital stock, at what figure should it be deducted — the assessed valuation, or the real valuation? That is, should the real estate be deducted at the assessed valuation of 1916, or the actual present value? Another corporation is capitalized for $100,000.00, with only $75,000.00 paid up capital. Should this corporation be assessed at the actual paid up capital of $75,000.00 or should it be assessed at $100,000.00? Another question in regard to the new prohibition law, a case of bot - tled beer was shipped from a point within this state to a consumer with - in this county, which is now held by the railroad company. Same was shipped before the law went into effect, and arrived at the station before the law went into effect, but the consignee did not call for same until after the law went into effect. What disposition should be made of this case of beer? I will endeavor to answer the questions propounded by you in the order in which they are asked. (1) The lumber corporation should be assessed upon the actual value of its property without any special regard to the book value of its capital stock. Inasmuch as the corporation has been recently organized it is fair to assume, I think, until the contrary is made to appear, that its prop- </seg>
            <seg id="p208">OPINIONS 91 erty is worth the amount paid in, that is to say $30,000.00, but this is a matter which the assessor will have to deter - mine for himself from the best information obtainable. (2) You do not say what kind of a corporation it is that has an authorized capital sock of $100,000.00 with $75,000.00 paid in, but in any event its assessed valuation should be based upon the actual value of its property rather than up - on the amount either of its authorized or of its paid up capital. (3) I do not think the railroad company has a right to deliver the case of beer to the consignee or to deliver it to the consignor at any point within the state, but if the con - signor can sell it at some place outside the state where such sale is lawful, I see no legal objection to the railroad com - pany transporting it to such place if requested by the con - signor so to do.

It is unlawful (or any person over 14 years of age to play baseball in a competitive # game on Sunday, except in cities and villages where such games may be authorized by a vote of a majority of the electors of such city or village at a general or special election for that purpose. C. L. Richards, Esq., County Attorney of Thayer County, Hebron, Neb. Dear Sir: Your communication of the 16th instant ad - dressed to the attorney general has been received, in which you submit the following proposition : "One of the villages of our county at an election held In 1916 voted in favor of Sunday baseball. The village board of trustees for the year 1917 has recently passed an ordinance prohibiting the playing of base - ball on Sunday in the village. • * * Will the passage of this ordi - nance, if a valid ordinance, prevent the playing of baseball during the present year?" </seg>
            <seg id="p209">92 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Section 8802 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913 contains certain provisions pertaining to Sabbath day or Sunday observance, prohibiting, under penalty, certain acts on such day. That section of the statute provides that it shall be unlawful for any person over fourteen years of age to play baseball in a competitive game on Sunday in this state, except under the following conditions : "In all cities and villages such games may be authorized by a vote of the majority of the electors of such city or village voting at a general or special election for that purpose." The above is a general provision of the statutes of this state applying to all cities and villages, and it would seem doubtful if a city council has authority to enact an ordi - nance prohibiting baseball on Sunday in a case where it has been authorized by an election under section 8802. Although section 8802 does not, nor do the statutes pro - vide any definite procedure for annulling the result of such election, unless it ma}' be done under article 6, chapter 51 of the 1913 statutes, known as the Initiative and Referen - dum Act, and where a city or village has adopted the act pursuant to section 5255 of the statutes. The amendment to section 8802 of the statutes occurred in 1913. The Initiative and Referendum Act was passed in 1897, and it may be that the legislature had under con - sideration the provisions of that act when it enacted the amendment to section 8802. You will observe that the Initiative and Referendum Act provides that ordinances may be enacted by the voters at special or general elections, and that ordinances or meas - ures thus enacted may, after the expiration of«a year, be altered and amended, or even annulled, by a city or village council, as provided in section 5244 of the statutes. The above is suggested as a possible explanation of the silence of the legislature in not providing for a re-sub - mission to the voters of the question as to Sunday baseball under section 8802. We are not, however, without some doubt as to the pur - pose and intention of the legislature when it enacted the amendment to section 8802 of the statutes; and it may be </seg>
            <seg id="p210">OPINIONS 93 that a court may differ from any view that we may indicate, but it would seem doubtful if a city council has authority to annul by ordinance the right of the people to have Sun - day baseball when authorized by an election under section 8802 of the statutes, unless possibly it may be annulled in the manner indicated in cities and villages having adopted the Initiative and Referendum. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, Attorney General. By CHARLES S. ROE, May 19, 1917. Assistant Attorney General. Lumber Corporations — Tax — Delivery of Beer — Lighting Bonds. A lumber corporation should be taxed upon the real value of the property it owns. The law does not provide for the delivery of beer to the sheriff, by the railroad company nor for its destruction by him without an order of court to that effect. Land which has been detached from the municipal corporation issuing lighting bonds, is not liable to pay same. C. R. Stasenka, Esq., County Attorney of Franklin County, Bloomington, Neb. Dear Sir : In answer to the first question propounded in your letter of the 21st instant, permit-me to say that the property of a corporation organized for the purpose of dealing in lumber should be taxed in the same way and manner that the property of an individual is taxed, that is to say, the real value of the property of the corporation should be found and one-fifth of the real value taken as its assessed value. The value of its property does not neces - sarily depend upon the amount of its authorized or paid in capital stock. To illustrate, a lumber company might be organized with paid in capital of $25,000.00. By judicious investments it might come about that its property would be worth $50,000. In such case, the real value being $50,000, the assessed value of such property would be $10,000. On the other hand, it might happen that through injudicious investments or loss </seg>
            <seg id="p211">94 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL by fire or storm, of property which was not protected by insurance, property of the corporation would be of less value than its paid up capital stock. In such case the assessment would be made in proportion to the value of the property and not based upon the capital stock. It is to be borne in mind that the constitution requires that; "the legislature shall provide such revenue as may be needful by levying a tax by valuation so that every per - son and corporation shall pay a tax in proportion to the value of his, her or its property and franchises." Section 1, article 9 of the Constitution. If the lumber company to which you refer does not have all its paid in capital stock invested in lumber yards, but holds a part thereof in cash at the situs of its principal office, such excess may be taxed there. In answer to the question propounded in the third para - graph of your letter, will say that the law does not provide in express terms for the delivery of this beer to the sheriff by the railroad company and for its destruction by him without an order of court to that effect. It is probable, however, that the consignor of this liquor will either take steps to protect its property, or authorize the sheriff to destroy same if the matter is called to its attention. In answer to the third question which is asked with reference to the liability of land to pay a lighting bond tax after it has been detached from the municipal corporation issuing such bonds, I will say that in my opinion its liability ceases for subsequent years after it has been detached from the municipality issuing and owing the bonds, unless it is made to appear that the valuation of the municipality has been so reduced as to render it impossible for it to pay off the bonds, in which case a court of equity may direct that a lighting bond tax be levied on the detached territorry.

            <seg id="p212">OPINIONS 95 Taxation — State Property Exempt The property of the state, counties and municipal corporations, both real and personal, shall be exempt from taxation, and such other property as may be used exclusively for agricultural and horticultural socie - ties, and school, religious, cemetery and charitable purposes may be exempt from taxation. Mr. 0. E. Bernecker, Secretary of State Board of Equali - sation, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In compliance with your oral request of the 22nd instant for an opinion upon the question presented by the letter of Mr. Jas. F. Pease, county assessor of Merrick county, I respectfully submit the following : Mr. Pease savs : "I am writing you for a little information in regard to the hospital at Palmer, which was built the past year. They claim it is not assessable, as they claim it is a charitable institution; but they charge for any patients that are there, so I claim it is subject to taxation. Please give me your opinion on the matter and oblige." The statement of facts contained in the letter is not suffi - cient upon which to base other than a mere approximate opinion, and the facts should be amplified to show whether the case comes within or without the limits of the authori - ties hereinafter cited and quoted. The constitutional and statutory provision applicable is section 2, article 9, constitution of Nebraska, which pro - vides : "The property of the state, counties, and municipal corporations, both real and personal shall be exempt from taxation, and such other property as may be used exclusively for agricultural and horticultural societies, for school, religious, cemetery, and charitable purposes, may be exempted from taxation, but such exemptions shall be only by general law." Also section 6301, Revised Statutes, 1913, which provides, inter alia : "The following property shall be exempt from taxes: • • » Second • * Such other property as may be used exclusively for agricultural and horticultural societies, for schools, religious, cemetery and charitable purposes." In Scott v. Society of Russian Israelites, 59 Nebr. 571, </seg>
            <seg id="p213">96 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL the supreme court said, with reference to the section of the statute above quoted exempting property from taxation in this state : "The language of the provisions quoted is plain. There is exempt from taxation all property used exclusively for religious purposes. It is the exclusive use for the purpose named which determines whether the property is subject to the burden of taxation or not." In 7. M. C. A. of Omaha v. Douglas County, 60 Nebr 642, the supreme court of this state said : "If the property be used by appellant exclusively for purposes of its own organization, this would exclude the idea of others using it for an entirely different or secular purpose. The fact that appellant is in the exclusive use of a portion of the property for the legitimate purposes of its organization, does not preclude the occupancy of other portions for purely secular purposes, and thus subject the property so used to the general law of taxation. The language of the statute is clear and explicit. Under it all property used exclusively for the purposes mentioned is exempt from taxation. Property not so used is subject to the general law of taxation. Nor do we think that proximity of one class of property to another is material, the sole question being whether the use of the property renders it ex - empt. It is not necessary that the property should be such as to permit of its separation into distinct and definite parcels or tracts of land." In 37 Cyc,., page 929, the rule is found : "A public hospital is a charitable institution or under some statutes an 'almshouse' so as to be exempt from taxation; * * *. But it is none the less a public charity because patients of sufficient pecuniary ability are required to pay for what they receive, if the proceeds are applied exclusively to the purposes of the institution and if indigent patients are treated without charge; * * *. The exemption will ordinarily include not only the hospital building, but also such other property as is used for the purposes of the institution and not as a source of profit." In Hot Springs School District vs. Sisters of Mercy, 84 Ark. 497, the supreme court of Arkansas said: "A hospital building, with the grounds connected therewith, which is used in the operation of a public charity is not excluded from the con - stitutional exemption from taxation of buildings and grounds 'used ex - clusively for public charity' merely because patients who are able to do so pay for the attention and medicine which they receive, if the profits derived therefrom are used to promote the charitable objects of the in - stitution." </seg>
            <seg id="p214">OPINIONS 97 In the case of State v. Powers Hospital, 10 Mo. App. 263, the court said : "Does the fact that this institution derives some part of its revenue from paying patients exclude it from the benefits of the constitutional exemption from taxation? We do not see upon what reasonable grounds this can be said. Suppose that the community in charge of the hospital devoted themselves partly to some kind of manual labor, shoemaking for instance, in order to raise money for the purpose of furnishing medi - cine and necessaries and comforts to their patients, would not this be a charitable act? If they devote themselves partly to the care of paying patients, to defray the expenses of attendance upon the poorer patients who cannot pay, this is surely an act of charity. Must we hold that if the community raise money purely by begging, their purposes are purely charitable; but if they work to support themselves whilst ministering to the sick, and to support the sick to whom they administer, the charac - ter of the charity is impaired? • » • The fact of receiving money from some of the patients does not, we think, at all impair the character of the charity, so long as the money thus received is devoted altogether to the charitable object which the institution is intended to further." In the case of County of Hennepin v. Brotherhood of Gethsemane, 27 Minn., 460, the court said: "A hospital, with the necessary grounds, free to all who are not pecuni - arily able, and supported partly by private contributions and partly by fees from patients, but producing no profit, is a purely public charity." The following language of the court in its opinion seems particularly pertinent to the question presented by Mr. Pease's letter: "In legal parlance the word 'charity' has a much wider signification than in common speech. But, without undertaking to give a general definition, it will be sufficient for all the purposes of this case to say that an institution established, maintained and operated for the purpose of taking care of the sick, without any profit, or view to profit, but at a loss which has to be made up by benevolent contribution, is a charity. If, in addition to this, the institution is one the benefits of which the public generally are entitled to enjoy, it is then a purely public charity — public, because, although not owned by the public, its uses and objects are public; purely public, because its uses and objects are wholly public, and for the benefit of the public generally, and in no sense private as being limited to particular individuals. The word 'public' has two proper meanings. A thing may be said to be public when owned by the public, and also when its uses are public. The Cottage Hospital falls within this description of an institution of purely public charity. That patients who are able to pay are charged for hospital services according to their </seg>
            <seg id="p215">98 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ability, and that the county pays for such services rendered to those who are a legal county charge, are facts of no importance upon the question as to the character of the institution as one of purely public charity; for the fact still remains, that, notwithstanding all receipts from such sources, the hospital is established, maintained and conducted without profit or a view to profit, and that, on the whole, it is operated at a loss, which is necessarily made up by private contributions." In Penn. Hospital v. Delaware Co., 169 Pa. St. 305, the court said : "Property which is used directly for the purpose and in the operation of the charity is exempt, though it may also be used in a manner to yield some return and thereby reduce the expenses." To the same effect, see Sisters of Charity v. Township of Chatham, 52 N. J. L. 373; Mount Henmon Boys' School r. Gill, 145 Mass. 149; Episcopal Academy v. Philadelphia, 150 Pa. St. 574. In Board of Review r. Chicago Policlinic, 233 111. 268, the court said: "The only point urged by counsel for appellee is that the property of appellant is not actually and exclusively used as a public charity. This case on this question cannot be distinguished from Sisters of St. Francis r. Board of Rericir. 231 111. 317. That decision renders unnecessary any further discussion as to whether the property used for hospital and dispensary purposes and a training school for nurses is exempt, and as appellee makes no point that the property is used, in part, for a school of medicine and surgery, if this were not a public matter we would be justified in passing over, without discussion, this latter point. There is nothing in the record to show just what part of the building is used for that purpose. We think it is clear, however, that the nature of the branches taught would bring it within that class of institutions of learning of a higher grade than the public schools, not used with a view to profit, and that therefore such part of the building as is used for this purpose is exempt on this latter ground. Montijomery r. Wymun, 130 111. 17: City of ChU-ago r. Unirernitu of Chicai/o. 228 id. 605; J'rople v. .St. Francis Imvier Femmle Acntlimii. (ante, p. 26.)" Obviously, if the facts of the present case bring it within the confines of the decisions cited, the property of the hospi - tal is not exempted from the constitutional and statutory provisions exempting property devoted exclusively to char - itable purposes notwithstanding patients pecuniarly able to pay are so required. We will not undertake to hold upon the statement of facts before us that the hospital property </seg>

The state compensation law does not apply to anyone injured while in the employ of a railroad engaged in doing work as a common carrier • in interstate commerce. Mr. G. D. Patterson, Supt., American Express Company Omaha, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Your letter of the 21st instant addressed to the insurance commissioner has been referred to me for answer. You say among other things that "The question that is up at this time is a slight injury to one of our messengers who was running on a train operating between Chadron, Nebraska and Lander.

The question which you propound is not entirely free from doubt, inasmuch as just such a question has not been passed upon yet so far as I am able to ascertain either by our own supreme court or the supreme court of the United States. I am of the opinion, however, that inasmuch as your company is engaged in interstate commerce, and in this particular instance was doing its work as a common carrier by the use of the railroads, that the state compen - sation law does not apply.

Liquor — Advertisement by Non-Resident Firm.

            <seg id="p218">OPINIONS 101 Dear Sir: Receipt is hereby acknowledged of your in - quiry in which you enclose certain specific advertising mat - ter consisting of a self-addressed envelope to M. Wollstein &amp; Co., (Incorporated,) "Opposite Union Station, Omaha, Neb. Union Station P. ()." printed in black letters, and then the words, "Opposite Union Station, Omaha, Neb. Union Station P. O." stricken out, and printed in red letters, "New location Cor. 4th &amp; Felix Sts., St. Joseph, Mo."; also a removal notice specifying, among other things, that the company is a liquor dealer and had been in Omaha for the past thirty-seven years, and that it is now located at St. Joseph, Missouri, and inviting one to call; and then in addition thereto enclosing two pages of printed matter showing the former location of Wollstein &amp; Go., and where it had been doing business for many years, giving price lists of the various brands of whiskey; and in which you say you received the same through the United States mail. You do not say, however, that you received it in the state of Nebraska, nor that it was mailed in the State of Nebras - ka. I assume, however, that at least you received it through the mail in the state of Nebraska. With reference thereto will say, the question presented is whether advertising by a non-resident firm of intoxica - ting liquor to be shipped into the state is a violation of section 8 of the prohibition law prohibiting the advertising of intoxicating liquor. ( 1 ) Under the Wilson Act of 1890 the state possesses the power to prohibit the solicitation within its borders of the sale of liquor manufactured out of and to be shipped into the state, and such prohibition is not in violation of the constitutional power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce. Delamater v. South Dakota, 205 U. S. 93. This case is tl?e basis of all later decisions on the subject in hand. The defendant was an agent of a Minnesota liquor firm and was engaged in soliciting sales in South Dakota for shipment from Minnesota into that state. He was tried for violating a state law imposing a license on "the business of selling or offering for sale" intoxicating liquors in the state, and raised the point that he was soliciting an interstate busi - ness. A federal statute known as the Wilson Act was then sa« </seg>
            <seg id="p219">102 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL in effect, providing that liquor transported into a state should be subject to the police power of the state the same as if produced and shipped within the state. It was held: "Since the enactment of the Wilson law, which expressly provides that intoxicating liquors coming into a state should be as completely under control of the state as though manufactured therein, the owner of in - toxicating liquor in one state cannot, under the commerce clause of the Constitution, go himself or send his agent into another state and in defiance of its laws, carry on the business of soliciting proposals for the purchase of such liquors." (2) Uuder the Wilson Act, solicitation by advertising from outside of the state for the sale of intoxicating: liquor manufactured out of and to be shipped into the state is a violation of the state anti-advertising law and is not re - pugnant to the constitutional power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce. State v. Delaye, 68 Southern 993. The defendant was prosecuted under an anti-advertising liquor law for selling newspapers at his news stand coming from out of the state and containing whiskey advertisements of out-state firms. Defense was made that the advertisements were of an in - terstate business. Basing the decision on the case of Delameter r. South Dakota, Supra., it was held: "The anti-advertising liquor law of February 10, 1915, prohibiting the sale of newspapers and magazines containing liquor advertisements, does not, when applied to a newspaper published out of the state, and containing an advertisement of liquor manufactured out of the state and to be shipped into the state to individuals, ordering it, violate Const. U. S. art. 1, section 8, vesting in Congress the exclusive power to regulate interstate commerce, since the states have the right to prohibit sales of intoxicating liquors and incidentally the right to prohibit solicitations for such sales, whether by agent or advertisement." Rose v. State, 62 S. E. 117. This case was subsequently overruled in Rose v. State, 65 S. E. 770, but is a strong case and has been subsequently cited and approved in other cases on the same subject. The defendant doing a liquor business in Tennessee solicited business in Georgia through self-addressed envelopes, order blanks and printed matter, and was indicted for violating the state law prohibiting soliciting for the sale of liquor. It was held : </seg>
            <seg id="p220">OPINIONS 103 "Under the provisions of the Wilson bill a statute, which (in aid of a police regulation prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors within a state or any portion thereof) prohibits the solicitation of orders, is not, for the reason that such statute conflicts with the power of Congress to regulate and control interstate commerce, void as to orders solicited in said state, although the seller and the liquor to be sold may both be in another state, because such regulation in no wise encroaches upon the power of Congress to control interstate commerce. The exercise of such state regulation, so far from being in conflict with the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce, is expressly allowed by law." (3) In contradiction of the foregoing proposition it is held in one jurisdiction that such solicitation since it is a part of interstate commerce, is not a violation of the state anti-advertising law. Rose v. State, 65 S. E. 770. ( )n the same state of facts as Rose v. State, Supra, and in contradiction of the princi - ple laid down in the Federal case of Delameter v. South Dakota, Supra, it was held : "A criminal accusation charging that the defendant, who lived in Chattanooga, Tenn., solicited orders for the sale of intoxicating liquors by a circular sent through the United States mail from Chatanooga to a person living in this state, where the sale of intoxicating liquors is pro - hibited, did not set forth any crime under Pen. Code 1895, 428, and was subject to general demurrer." (4) The Webb-Kenyon Act of 1913 has the same effect on state legislation as the Wilson Act of 1890, it being con - strued not as a positive federal prohibition of interstate shipments of intoxicating liquor, but as a withdrawal of such shipments from the operation of the commerce clause of the constitution and an extension of the state laws over them. "The purpose of Congress in enacting the Webb-Kenyon Act of March 1, 1913, c. 90, 37 Stat. 69, was not to prohibit all interstate shipment or transportation of liquor into so-called dry territory, but to render the prohibitory provisions of the statute operative whenever, and only when the liquor is to be dealt with in violation of the law of the State into which it is shipped." Aimmt B*p. Co. r. Kentucky. 238 U. S. 190. "Thus it appears from the Webb-Kenyon Act, supra, that intoxicating liquors are divested of their interstate character, if it be intended to use them in any manner in violation of any law of the state, and the ship - ment of articles mentioned therein into Tennessee with such intent, is prohibited. From the Wilson Law, it appears that when such articles are </seg>

Ct. 865. 35 L. Ed. 572. Hence we conclude that the stock of intoxicating liquors in the place of business of the plaintiffs in Memphis, Term., was divested of its interstate character when shipped into Tennessee in violation of law, and it was here subject to be dealt with under the laws of the state enacted in the exercise of its police powers, with the same force and effect as though the power to regulate commerce among the several states had never been granted to Congress, or as though Congress had never undertaken to regulate commerce among the states by legisla - tion."

E. 283 (5) Since, therefore, under the Webb-Kenyon Act, in - terstate commerce in intoxicating liquor is withdrawn from federal control and placed within the police power of the state, advertising by a non-resident merchant of liquor to be transported into a state is not protected as being a part of interstate commerce, but is a violation of a state pro - hibition against such advertising. State v. Davis, 87 S. E. 262. By the stipulated facts in this case, the defendant, a citizen of Maryland, was engaged in a mail order business in intoxicating liquor in that state and was prosecuted in West Virginia for soliciting sales in West Virginia by means of circular letters, price lists and order blanks sent through the United States mails, of liquor to be shipped from his place of business in Maryland. The Yost law of West Virginia, under which prosecution took place, made it a misdemeanor to "circulate or distri - bute any price lists, circulars or order blanks advertising liquors." It was held: "A liquor dealer residing and doing business in another state, who, by the agency of the United States mails, sends into this state unsolicited and here circulates or distributes to prospective customers price lists, circulars and order blanks, advertising his liquors for sale and which he proposes to ship into this state to them, and which advertising matter by such agency is actually delivered to a citizen of this state, is guilty of a violation of section 8, chapter 13, Acts of the Legislature of 1913, known as the Yost Law * • • and may be here indicted and punish - ed as provided by said act." Under the Federal law which goes into effect July 1st, 1917, section 5, session .2, chapter 162 of the Sixty-fourth Congress provides : </seg>
            <seg id="p222">OPINIONS 105 "That no letter, postal card, circular, newspaper, pamphlet, or pub - lication of any kind containing any advertisement of spirituous, vinous, malted, fermented, or other intoxicating liquors of any kind, or contain - ing a solicitation of an order or orders for said liquors, or any of them, shall be deposited in or carried by the mails of the United States, or be delivered by any postmaster or letter carrier, when addressed or directed to any person, firm, corporation, or association, or other addressee, at any place or point in any State or Territory of the United States at which it is by the law in force in the State or Territory at that time unlawful to advertise or solicit orders for such liquors, or any of them, respectively. If the publisher of any newspaper or other publication or the agent of such publisher, or if any dealer in such liquors or his agent, shall knowingly deposit or cause to be deposited, or shall knowingly send or cause to be sent, anything to be conveyed or delivered by mail in viola - tion of the provisions of this section, or shall knowingly deliver or cause to be delivered by mail anything herein forbidden to be carried by mail, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than six months, or both; and for any subsequent offense shall be imprisoned not more than one year. Any person violating any provision of this section may be tried and punished, either in the district in which the unlawful matter or publication was mailed or to which it was carried by mail for delivery, according to direction thereon, or in which it was caused to be delivered by mail to the person to whom it was addressed. Whoever shall order, purchase, or cause intoxicating liquors to be trans - ported in interstate commerce, except for scientific, sacramental, medi - cinal, and mechanical purposes, into any State or Territory the laws of which State or Territory prohibit the manufacture or sale therein of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes shall be punished as afore - said: PROVIDED, That nothing herein shall authorize the shipment of liquor into any State contrary to the laws of such State: PROVIDED FURTHER, That the Postmaster General is hereby authorized and directed to make public from time to time in suitable bulletins or public notices the names of States in which it is unlawful to advertise or solic - it orders for such liquors." It is quite evident that after the 1st of July, 1917, the acts hereinbefore complained of would be a violation of the law. Prior to that date publications mailed outside the state to points within the state are not a violation of the law.

Internal improvement bonds voted by a city for tbe purpose of repairing and paring certain streets in the city and for the purpose of estab - lishing an electric lighting system therein, are void by reason of having been voted for a dual purpose. Hon. W. H. Smith, State Auditor, Lincoln, Neb Dear Sir : In response to your oral request for an opinion from this department as to the validity of internal improve - ment bonds issued by the city of Benson, permit me to say that the history of said bonds submitted to me for examina - tion by your office shows that the bonds were voted both for the purpose of repairing and paving certain streets in the city of Benson, and for the purpose of establishing an electric lighting system therein. It shows also that notice of the election to vote upon the question of their issuance was published but in one publica - tion of a weekly newspaper, and that less than seven days elapsed between the date of said publication and the date of the election. This being true, I think the history of the bonds shows two objections to their validity, — First: Duality of purpose. Second: An insufficient publication of the notice of elec - tion. </seg>
            <seg id="p224">OPINIONS 107 I suggest that you call the attention of those interested in the issuance of these bonds to the apparent defects in their history and ascertain what reason, if any, they may offer in support of their validity.

Charles F. Fiarth, Esq., County Attorney of Saline County, Wilber, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In your favor of the 1st instant you say: "I desire your opinion on the constitutionality of chapter 187, laws 1915, commonly known as the Mothers Pension Act. Our county judge has heretofore held said law to be unconstitutional from the ground that the body of the act is broader than the title." Answering will say, the title of the act is as follows : "An Act to provide pensions for mothers and guardians of dependent and neglected children; and to declare an emergency." Section 1 provides : "MOTHERS PENSION— PETITION— HEARING. "That hereafter when a petition is filed in the county court of any county in the state, properly verified by any person, stating that the said person is the parent of any child or children; that all of said persons are and have been for two years last past actual residents of the State of Nebraska and residents of the county where the petition is filed for at least one year last past; that such residence was not acquired with the intention of applying for relief under this act; and that such child or children are liable to become dependent or neglected, that the petitioner is trying to maintain a home, that by reason of limited means said person is not able to properly care for, maintain and educate said child or chil - dren, the county judge shall try and determine the matters contained in the said petition.

Sec. 2. SAME— HEARINGS— FINDINGS— If upon the hearing of said petition, the court finds the allegations thereof are true, and that the petitioner is poor and unable to properly care for such child or children but otherwise is a proper guardian and that it is for the welfare of the child or children to remain at home under the guardianship of their mother, or guardian, the court may make an order finding such facts, and fixing the amount of money necessary to enable the petitioner to proper - ly care for such child or children, and thereupon, it shall be the duty of the court to certify his findings to the Board of Supervisors or Commiss - ioners and it shall be the duty of said board to pay to the petitioner the amount so specified therein for the benefit of said petitioner until the further order of the court. Provided, not more that $10.00 per month shall be allowed for the care of each child. Provided, further, no such order shall be effective for more than six months, unless renewed by the court at or after the expiration of that period. All payments are to be made from the general fund of the county." Section 8175 of the Revised Statutes of 1913, is as fol - lows: "A judgment rendered, or final order made, by a county court, justice of the peace or any other tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial functions, and inferior in jurisdiction to the district court, may be re - versed, vacated or modified by the district court." Section 8176 defines what a final order is In view of the construction placed upon the act by your county judge I would urge that you appeal from his deci - sion to the district court that it may there be determined, and if need be it can then be carried to the supreme court. A rational and reasonable construction of the act must necessarily lead to the conclusion that the act is not void notwithstanding it might have been worded better. It is a good and wholesome law, and we should use every means at our disposal to see that it is carried out and enforced, and it is needless to say that it must be sustained in order to be able to do so.

The use of monies received by the treasurer of the state historical society from the annual membership dues, sale of books, etc., should be left to the discretionary judgment of the governing body of the society. Such monies should be used for the benefit of the society, and the monies so received and disbursed should be included in the report to the Governor pursuant to section 7167 of the statutes. Mr. A. E. Sheldon, Sec'y, Nebraska State Historical Soci - ety, Lincoln, Neb. Dear Sir: Your communication of the 22nd ultimo, ad - dressed to the attorney general, and containing copy of a letter of earlier date, has been received. Your letter states that : "The Historical Society receives, in addition to the appropriation made by the state legislature, several hundred dollars per year from annual membership dues, from sale of books and other miscellaneous sources, that are not paid into the state treasury, but which are retained by the treasurer of the Historical Society." You inquire whether these moneys may be legally dis - bursed and paid out upon the order of the executive board of the society, to employes of the society, who receive sal - aries or compensation fixed by the legislature in its appro - priations for the maintenance of the Historical Society. In 1883 the legislature, section 7166 of the present stat - ute, designated the State Historical Society a state insti - tution and in section 7167 of the statutes, it was provided as follows : "It shall be the duty of the president and secretary of said institution to make annually reports to the governor, as required by other state institutions. The report shall embrace the transactions and expenditures of the organizations together with all historical addresses which have been or may hereafter be read before the society or furnished it as historical matter, a data of the state or adjacent western regions of country."

In the appropriation bill for 1917, providing salaries for state officers and employes, is included the salaries and compensation for the different people holding office or positions in the State Historical Society. In view of the absence of any statutory direction as to the use of the moneys to which you refer, it would seem that the disbursement and use of such moneys may have been intended to be left to the discretionary judgment of the governing board of the Historical Society to be used for the benefit of the society; but the moneys so received and disbursed should evidently be included in the report to the Governor required in section 7167 of the statutes.

By an amendment passed at the last session of the legislature the permit fee is now $5.00 per annum. I think you will be justified under the circumstances in issu - ing permits upon the payment of the $5.00 after the 1st of next July, although technically speaking, the act providing for a $5.00 fee does not go into effect until the 25th of next month.

Railroad companies incur no liability in shipping pure ethyl alcohol to doctors who are legally licensed to practice as physicians, if the doctors comply with the law respecting such shipment. Retailers can not sell pure ethyl alcohol directly to physicians Hon. Edson Rich, Assistant General Solicitor, Union Pa cific Railroad Company, Omaha, Nebraska. Dear Sir : Yours of the 7th instant enclosing letter from Mr. George A. Magney, county attorney of Douglas county, also copy of letter which he wrote to the W. G.

In a limited sense hospitals are not defined, but where a person is treated for some sickness or ailment and a doctor is treating the same he might qualify under that claim. In any event instruments which the surgeon must necessarily use must be cleansed and cleaned, and many use alcohol for that purpose. Recently, in conversation with some very able physicians and surgeons, I learned that it is and has been for years their practice to occasionally use pure ethyl alcohol for certain purposes themselves in the treating of patients, not as a beverage by any means, nor in any way. It was not the intention of the legislature to deprive science of any advantage which it has attained in the line of its practice or provision. Section 12, relating to transportation by carriers, you say, provides for the transportation of pure ethyl alcohol to wholesale and retail druggists, scientific institutions and hospitals, and of wine for sacramental purposes to whole - sale druggists, church goods houses, and authorized repre - sentatives of churches and religious societies. You state further that it may be that physicians would be held to come within the terms of section 23 as "persons who use alcohol in scientific laboratories or hospitals", and that said section would give them express authority to purchase. That is my holding. They come clearly within section 23, and since they can then purchase from the wholesaler, and the wholesaler ships for the purpose specified, and the physician receipts therefor in the form provided by the act, no one will have violated the law in my judgment. With reference to the W. 6. Cleveland Company, I have not given any opinion.

County Board — Liability. Any action of tbe county board in creating debts for the future, when there is no money on hand or same is not covered by a levy to pay the debt, is unauthorized, illegal and void, and the board has no legal right or authority to issue the same. Frank Safranek, Esq., County Attorney of Johnson County, Tecumseh, Neb. Dear Sir : In response to your recent inquiry in which you submit a blank worded as follows : COUNTY CLERK'S OFFICE. "No Tecumseh, Nebraska 191.... This is to certify, That the account of against the County of Johnson, Nebraska, amounting to Dollars was this day by the Board of County Commissioners, on the Fund Levy for the year 191 The County Commission- ers have agreed to allow same J County Clerk." You inquire whether the board can issue 0. K. certifi - cates, or a certificate purporting to show that the board will allow or has allowed certain bills on certain funds. As an example, claims against bridge funds for which they are unable to issue warrants until they have sufficient funds either in the treasury or in the levy, as prescribed by law. You desire to know if the board issues the certificates for such bills and there is no money on hand to pay the same, whether the county commissioners would be liable personally, and you state further: "If we are unable to issue these certificates, or receive such credits, the county will be seriously handicapped, for the reason that a drainage district was formed in the county and that the county has been forced to build numerous bridges which have been expensive, and as a result </seg>
            <seg id="p231">114 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL the county is very much in debt. If the county is unable, as I have said, to receive this credit or issue these certificates, it will be greatly handi - capped in doing emergency work in the way of constructing bridges." Answering will say, section 962 of the Revised Statutes for 1913 provides : "It shall be unlawful for the county board of any county in this state to issue any warrants for any amount exceeding the aggregate of eighty - five per cent of the amount levied by tax for the current year, except there be money in the treasury to the credit of the proper fund for the payment of the same; nor shall it be lawful for the county board to issue any certificate of indebtedness in any form in payment of any account or claim, nor to make any contracts for or to incur any indebt - edness against the county in excess of the tax levied for county expenses during the current year; nor shall any expenditure be made, or indebt - edness be contracted to be paid out of any of the funds of said county in excess of the amount levied for said fund." The same has been upheld and construed by our supreme court. "A county board cannot lawfully incur an indebtedness against the county in excess of the taxes levied for the current year, nor can they issue warrants in any one year exceeding in the aggregate eighty-five per cent of the levy, unless there is money in the treasury for the pay - ment of the same."

Robert x r. Thorn pnon, 82 Neb. 458. A certificate or statement such as contemplated by your county creates no liability on the part of the board, either collectively or individually. Any action of the board in creating debts for the future when there is no money on hand, or covered by a levy, is unauthorized, illegal and void, and the board has no legal right or authority to issue the same.

School districts entitled to share in the state apportionment of school money before the amendment of the statute by the last legislature, which amendment requires eight months school instead of seven, are entitled to share in the semi-annual apportionment of school funds. Hon. W. H. Clemmons, State Superintendent of Public In st ruction, Lincoln, Neb. Dear Sir : You call my attention to the fact that section 6745, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, has been so amended by the last legislature as to require eight months school instead of seven to entitle school districts with a certain school population to share in the state apportion - ment of school moneys. You state further that your appor - tionment for this year is based upon the school census for the school year ending in 1916, and inquire whether or not districts having the requisite amount of school to entitle them to share in the appropriation prior to the amendment of the law by the last legislature, but not sufficient to entitle them to apportionment under the law as it now is, shall share in the apportionment about to be made. In my opinion such districts are entitled to share in the semi-annual apportionment of school funds now about to be made. I do not think that it was the legislative intent to deprive them of their share of the state apportionment because of the fact that after the school year had expired the period of time they are required to have school in order to entitle them to share in the apportionment was length - ened. I think the law should be interpreted so as to give it a prospective rather than a retro-active effect. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, Attorney General. By GEORGE W. AYRES, June 12, 1917.

When negotiating the warrants a question was raised as to the valid - ity of the law and would like the opinion of the department thereon." I am of the opinion, in view of the facts above stated, that the warrants in question were validly issued. The concluding portion of section 6743 to which you refer, was added to the section in 1913, and reads as follows : "PROVIDED FURTHER, if a majority of the qualified electors vote in favor thereof, the school board may at once proceed to carry out the purpose of the levy as provided in the petition, and to do so are hereby authorized to issue warrants, as needed, not to exceed eighty-five per cent of the amount raised by the levy, against the fund voted." By the adoption of the provision of statute last above quoted the legislature intended, in my opinion, to authorize the making of a contract for the construction of a school - house and the issuance of warrants in payment for same without waiting until the last year of the period for which the building fund tax is voted. Any other construction will, it seems to me, make the aforesaid proviso meaningless. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, Attorney General. GEORGE W. AYRES, Bv July 13, 1917. Special Assistant.

I may add, however, that if the old members voluntarily retire and the new ones take their place they are at least de facto officers, and their acts while allowed to serve as members of the school board are as valid and binding as though they were de jure officers. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, Attorney General. By GEORGE W. AYRES, July 18, 1917. Special Assistant. County Judge — Military Appointment — Resignation. When a county judge enters into a military position, his judicial authority should cease. His right to occupy the office of county judge after the appointment of a successor is doubtful. Richard C. James, Esq., County Attorney of Richardson County, Falls City, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Your communication of the 31st ultimo has been received and contents noted. You inquire with reference to the interpretation to be given to subdivision ninth of section 2275 Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913. </seg>
            <seg id="p236">OPINIONS 119 The statute provides that an acceptance of a commission in any military office in the state or federal service, which requires services for sixty days or more out of the state, shall vacate the civil office. If the county judge of Richardson county has accepted an appointment as lieutenant in the sixth regiment, it seems strange that he should retain his position as county judge, particularly since an appointment has been made to fill the position. While the county judge remains at Falls City and con - tinues to perform the duties of the office, his acts may be valid, but we would think that as soon as the county judge enters into his military position, his judicial authority should cease. Since the county judge has been disposed to occupy the office after the acceptance of the military position, we dis - like to take the position that the two offices are so incon - sistent and so incompatible, the one with the other, that the common law rule as to inconsistent and incompatible offices should be invoked in this case. State v. Bus, 36 S. W. 636. The country is in a state of war and the, count)' judge has accepted a military commission that necessitates his immediate and indefinite absence from not only the county, but from the state, and it might readily be held that under the provisions of the statute the acceptance of and enter - ing upon the military commission under the circumstances rendered the office of county judge ipso facto vacant, and the office would certainly be rendered so vacant whenever the duties of the military commission necessitated the absence of the county judge from the county. It may be that it. has not been necessary for the county judge to resign from his office prior to August 1st, and it may be that he has already resigned, but if he is to be called from the county to take up the permanent duties of his commission, it would seem that his right to occupy the office of county judge after the appointment of a successor is very doubtful and it would seem that the county authorities should not be thus embarrassed. </seg>

The state fire commissioner and his deputy have the power to exercise such authority as will afford adequate protection against the destruc - tion of property by reason of the maintenance of cans and tanks of gasoline above ground; and to require that gasoline in excess of five gallons, when kept for use, should be placed at least three feet under ground and when stored above ground should be 200 feet from any building. Hon. W. S. Ridgell, State Fire Commissioner, Lincoln, Neb Dear Sir: You submit to this department a question as to the authority of the state fire commission to enforce cer - tain regulations and restrictions with reference to the hand - ling and storing of certain combustibles and explosives. Your question is, "Has this department under the fire commission law the authority to prohibit oil companies from filling or maintaining cans and tanks with gasoline in excess of five gallons above ground?" This practice, you say, is particularly hazardous, and that all gasoline in excess of five gallons when kept for use should be placed at least three feet under ground, and when stored above ground should be 200 feet at least from any building or structure. Article 2 of chapter 23 of the Revised Statutes of 1913 creating the office of State Fire Commissioner and defining the authority and duties of such officer and his deputies, and particularly sections 11 and 12 of the act, contemplate and provide for the exercise of such authority by your de - partment as will afford adequate protection against the destruction of property from such cause, otherwise the state would fail in carrying out the vital purpose of the law. Such regulations as you propose should be observed by the </seg>

Permit me to add, however, that the form of signature you have heretofore used is sufficient to bind the district in my opinion, so long as in the body of the bond itself it appears that it is the obligation of the district, and if it is very inconvenient to make the change I would not do so if I were you, but if the change can be made without any par - ticular inconvenience it seems in better form to have the name of the district itself signed to the bonds.

            <seg id="p239">122 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL E. F. Armstrong, Esq., County Attorney of Nemaha Coun - ty, Auburn, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Your letter of the 17th instant received in which you inquire with reference to the exemption from taxation of certain lands used for school purposes. Yon state the facts as follows : "Bernard Ottens, during his life time, executed and delivered a deed to the trustees of the Catholic Church, — one hundred and sixty acres of land, — conditioned that the income off of said land be used for the purpose of supporting a parochial school which was to be built, the deed further providing that the school should be open to protestant children as well as children of catholic parentage, so long as accomodations could be pro - vided for them. The question now arises whether or not this land should be run upon the tax list.'' It seems the school is not located upon the lands in ques - tion. Section 2, article 9, of the Constitution of Nebraska provides that property "Used exclusively for agricultural and horticultural societies, for school, religious, cemetery and charitable purposes may be exempted from taxation, but such exemptions shall be by general law." Section 6301, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913 specifically exempts such property. Numerous decisions of the supreme court are cited under the above provision of the statute, and we might refer you to the opinions of the attorney general for 1915 and 1916, page 31. Questions similar to that which you present have been before the supreme court on other occasions and the deci - sions in such cases seem to require that the lands you de - scribe should be listed and assessed for taxation.

Sheriff — Fee for Serving Summons The sheriff must account for fees paid him for serving summons direct ed to him as sheriff, from another county. </seg>
            <seg id="p240">OPINIONS 123 Where a sheriff has received a summons from outside the state, and has served same, he is entitled to whatever charge he can agree up - on with the person sending the summons. William Suhr, Esq., County Attorney of Hall County, Grand Island, Nebraska. Dear Sir: We have received your letter of September 12th, in which you inquire: "(1) Must the county sheriff in his settlement with the county, ac - count for fees paid him for serving summons directed to him from an - other county? "(2) Must the county sheriff in his settlement with the county, ac - count for fees earned by him in serving summons directed to him from another state?" (1) Section 8172, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913 provides : "When a summons is issued to another county than that in which the action or proceeding is pending, it may be returned by mail and the sheriff shall be entitled to the same fees as if the summons had issued in the county of which he is sheriff." Under this section it is evident that the compensation re - ceived by the sheriff for service of summons directed to him from another county must be considered as fees under the statute. Section 2441, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, as amended by chapter 37, Session Laws of 1915, provides that: "The sheriff shall on the first Tuesday in January, April, July and October of each year, make a report to the county board, under oath, showing the different items of fees, except mileage, collected or earned, from whom, at what time, and for what service, and the total amount of such fees collected or earned by such officer since the last report and also the amount collected or earned for the current year and he shall then pay nil fees earned to the county treasurer." Under these statutes we are of the opinion that the sher - iff must account for fees paid him for serving summons directed to him as sheriff from another county.

The summons could have been directed to any private person, and of course that person would be entitled to whatever charge was agreed upon for making the ser - vice. We are of the opinion that the sheriff occupies the same position and is entitled to whatever charge he can agree upon with the person who has sent the summons to him. Ordinarily this charge would be the same as is pro - vided by law for the service of summons. However, since the amount involved would ordinarily be quite small, in order to avoid criticism or a possible adverse decision by the supreme court, the sheriff might well pay over these fees to the county treasurer for his own protection.

No inheritance tax is collectible in Nebraska from an estate in which a non-resident holder of corporate stock of a Nebraska corporation dies leaving no estate other than such corporate stock in Nebraska. Hon. Bryce Crawford, Omaha, Nebraska Dear Sir: You say "A non-resident holder of the corporate stock of a Nebraska corpora - tion dies leaving no estate other than such corporate stock in Nebraska." You also inquire where, under such circumstance, the in - heritance tax, if any, on this estate, should be paid. In answer to the question propounded by you, permit me to say that in my opinion no inheritance tax is collectible in Nebraska from such an estate, for it is only the county court of the county of which the deceased was a resident at the time of his death, or in which he left real estate, that has jurisdiction to assess an inheritance tax. •Under such circumstance the supreme court of Kentucky has held that : "The county court in the county in which is situated the real property of a non-resident decedent, or in the county in which decedent resided. </seg>
            <seg id="p242">OPINIONS 125 shall have jurisdiction to determine questions relating to inheritance taxes, does not confer jurisdiction on the county court to ascertain in - heritance taxes on stock of a domestic corporation owned by non-resi - dent decedents." Commonwealth r. Cumberland Telephone d Telegraph Co.. 142 S. W. 392. A like holding was made by the New York court under a similar statute in the case of In Re Estate of Embury, 45 N. Y. Supplement, 881, although in that estate the law has been changed so as to confer jurisdiction on the courts to assess an inheritance tax in certain eases where the deceas - ed was neither a resident of the state nor left real estate therein. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, September 14, 1917. Attorney General. Intoxicating Liquor — Transportation. It is a violation of the law to transfer intoxicating liquor from a wet state into a dry one. R. ('. James, Esq., County Attorney of Richardson County, Falls City, Neb. Dear Sir : In yours of the 14th instant you inquire "Is it a violation of the law for an individual to bring a case of beer from Missouri to Nebraska for his own personal use, the liquor being transported by the owner himself in his own automobile from Missouri, through a corner of Kansas and into Nebraska?" Answering will say, I am not aware of any provision of the law which would permit, without violation, such a trans - fer of intoxicating liquors from a wet state into a dry one. Kansas is a dry state, and it was the intention of the voters at the last election to make the state of Nebraska dry. Very respectfully, WILLIS E REED, September 18, 1917. Attorney General. Game Laws — Violation. The legislature did not intend that complaining witnesses should be re - stricted to the fines collected under section 2699, but should be paid in the same measure from fines collected in other similar offenses under the game laws of the state of Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p243">126 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Hon. George E. Koster, Chief Deputy Game and Fish Com - missioner, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire of this department with refer - ence to the provision in section 2700 of the Revised Statutes for 1913, as to the conditions under which complaining witnesses should receive a part of the fines, in prosecutions under the game laws of the state. The question is whether such provision in section 2700 applies only to prosecutions under section 2699, the pre - ceding section, for illegally transporting game out of the state. It seems that in some instances section 2700 has been given such a restricted meaning. We do not think the wording of the present statute even justifies such an inter - pretation and there is no apparent reason why the complain - ing witnesses should receive a part of the fines under sec - tion 2699 and not receive any part of the fines in other prosecutions of similar offenses. The present game law, with few changes since, was enact - ed in 1901 by chapter 36 of the laws of that year and in - cluded what are now sections 2699 and 2700 It was there provided that : "All fines recovered under any of the provisions of this act shall, when collected, be paid into the treasury of the county for the use of the school fund, and the corporate authorities of any county, city or village, within whose territorial jurisdiction such fine was recovered, when such fines are collected, shall pay to the complaining witness in such prosecu - tion, out of the general fund of such county receiving such fine, an amount equal to one-half of the fine actually collected, upon the proper application of the party entitled to the same, in the manner usual for the presentation of claims against counties." The first two and one-half lines in the above quotation were evidently inadvertently omitted by the commissioners who codified our statutes in 1913; the" part omitted being in force up to .and including the year 1911. (See Cobbey's Annotated Statute for 1911, section 3278.) The remaining part of the above quotation is now section 2700 of the pres - ent statutes. There was evidently no authority whatever for the drop- </seg>
            <seg id="p244">OPINIONS 127 ping out of that part of the statute, by the codification com - mittee. The legislature of 1913 adopted the codified revis - ion of the statutes but the provision of the statute partic - ularly referred to has not been directly repealed and should be considered in ascertaining a correct interpretation of the present law, and when this is done it seems very plain that the legislature never intended that complaining wit - nesses should be restricted to the fines collected under sec - tion 2699, but should be paid in the same measure from fines collected in other similar offenses under the game laws of the state ; and this department believes that such is the correct interpretation of the present law.

When the real estate of an insane person has been sold pursuant to law and the proceeds thereof are in the hands of a guardian, such pro - ceeds may be liable for the support of the insane person subject to the provision of the statutes as to the necessary support of those legally dependent upon him or her. The pension money of an insane person is exempted absolutely from attachment and execution, as well as property purchased with such pension money amounting to $2,000.00. Such money may be used by the guardian in his discretion, for the benefit of the insane per - son and his dependents. A. V. Thomas, Esq., County Attorney of Butler County David City, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Your letter of the 3rd instant received, in which you request an opinion of this office as to whether the proceeds from the sale of the homestead property and pen - sion money in the hands of a guardian of an insane person, are liable for the costs of maintenance of such patient. Your inquiry evidently pertains to the maintenance of such person when an inmate of a state hospital or institution and with reference to section 7272 of the statutes as amend - ed bv the 1915 laws. </seg>
            <seg id="p245">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 128 The amendment to section 7272 changes the original stat - ute in that in case an insane patient is possessed of an estate or income sufficient to meet the expenses of main - tenance, his or her guardian is required to pay quarterly to the institution, an amount fixed by the board of com - missioners of state institutions and such claim is made a charge against the estate of such insane person and collecti - ble therefrom, but subject, however, to the necessary sup - port of those dependent upon the insane person ; while the original statute required the county of the residence of such insane person to meet such expense but authorized the county board of such county to collect the amount of such expense from the estate of the insane person. It would seem to be the purpose of the present statute to subject the estate and property of an insane person to his support and maintenance, subject however, to the neces - sary support of dependents. The effect of this statute must be considered in this case in connection with the exemption laws as to homesteads and pensions. Sections 1710 to 1716 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, provide for the sale of the interest of an insane person in real estate, by a guardian, subject to the con - ditions contained in the sections of the statutes above re - ferred to. Section 1715 provides that the husband or wife of such insane person, as the case may be, must authorize such sale, otherwise it can not be had and section 1716 provides that the same requirements shall govern in the case of a sale and conveyance of the homestead interest of such insane person in the land of his or her spouse. It would not therefore appear that section 7272 as amend - ed would be operative against the interest in real estate of an insane person, but that when such interest has been sold pursuant to law and the proceeds thereof are in the hands of a guardian, such proceeds may be liable for the support of the insane pereon, subject to the provision as to the neces - sary support of those legally dependent upon him or her. With reference to the pension money of an insane person, section 8106 exempts such money absolutely from attach- </seg>
            <seg id="p246">OPINIONS 129 ment and execution, as well as property purchased with such pension money amounting to $2,000.00. It would not seem that section 7272 as amended super - sedes that provision of the statutes as to the extent of subjecting pension moneys in the possession of a guardian, to any legal process for the collection of the cost of main - tenance of such insane person in a state hospital or institu - tion, but that such moneys may be expended and used by the guardian in his discretion, for the benefit of the insane person and his dependents. We trust that the foregoing will meet with your approval Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, Attorney General. By CHARLES S. ROE, October 6, 1917. Deputy Attorney General. Consolidation of Villages — Indebtedness. Any two or more cities or villages having the same government and lying adjacent to each other, may consolidate and become one city or municipal corporation, as the case may be, with all the powers, obligations and duties of the city or municipal corporation whose name shall be assumed and adopted. George W. Learner, Esq., County Attorney of Dakota Coun - ty, Dakota City, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Your letter of the 6th instant received, con - taining an inquiry as to the responsibility for indebtedness of incorporated villages when two or more such villages are consolidated pursuant to chapter 50, of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913. Section 5082 of the 1913 statutes provides that : "Consolidation of two or more cities or villages. — Any two or more cities or villages, governed by the provisions of this chapter, lying adja - cent to each other, may consolidate and become one city or municipal corporation, as the case may be, and under the name and with all the powers, obligations and duties of the city or municipal corporation whose name shall be assumed and adopted in the proceedings in this chapter provided." </seg>
            <seg id="p247">130 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL r It would seem, however, that under section 5083 such consolidating villages may prescribe to a considerable ex - tent the conditions of the consolidation. Section 5084 provides that when the consolidation has taken place, thereafter the city or village annexed shall be governed as a part of the city or village to which annex - ation is made. That section however, contains this pro - vision : ' ' Such annexation shall not effect or impair any rights or liabilities then existing for or against either of such cities or villages, but they may be enforced the same as if no annexation had taken place." The general rule is that in case of the consolidation of municipalities the new or consolidated municipality takes over the property and assets of the former municipalities and assumes the liabilities and obligations. 28 Cyc. 219 - 222 This rule has been applied to the consolidation of school districts in Nebraska. Clother v. Maker, 15 Neb. 1. This rule was followed by the legislature in creating the greater Omaha. Chapter 202 of the 1907 laws, section 2. Section 5082 of the 1913 statutes would seem to imply that such rule should apply in such case of consolidation, but section 5083 evidently contemplates that the consoli - dating cities or villages should define these rights and liabilities by the ordinances authorizing the consolidation and in the absence of such provisions the proviso at the end of section 5084 might seem to create a somewhat doubtful question. Section 5085 does not indicate plainly that the obligations referred to are obligations of the city annexed or obligations due or owned by it. The section seems to refer only to the assets and property belonging to the annexed municipality. It would seem as though the ordinances of the two munic - ipalities authorizing the consolidation in question, should have defined the duties and obligations of the annexing mu - nicipality in the above respect. The section refered to pro - vides that the terms and conditions of the annexation should be reported by the commissioners to the counsel or trustees and bv them submitted bv ordinance to the voters. </seg>
            <seg id="p248">OPINIONS 131 It may be that the proceedings in the case in question provided as to the respective obligations of the two munie - ipalities in the respect referred to. If not, the general rule may prevail that South Sioux City, having taken over all the assets and property of Covington, has assumed and should pay the debts in question, notwithstanding the pro - viso at the end of section 5084 referred to, whereby said debts may still be enforcible against the village of Coving - ton. It is quite probable that the proceedings and ordinances authorizing the consolidation, in connection with the gen - eral rule, require that the consolidated city of South Sioux City should assume and pay, by a general tax, the judg - ments in question.

Taxation — Boundary Line Changed by River. Assessment of land in South Dakota by authorities in Nebraska, where the boundary line has been changed by the Missouri River, is errone - ous. Nebraska has no authority or jurisdiction to make an assess - ment on such land, and it would likewise follow that should South Dakota attempt to collect any taxes upon this side of the river, such attempt must necessarily fail. George W. Learner, Esq., County Attorney of Dakota Coun - ty, Dakota City, Nebraska. Dear Sir : In yours of the 7th iirstant you say : "Sometime between 1903 and 1905, commissions appointed by Ne - braska and South Dakota, established a boundary line between these states that the Missouri River has separated. In 1905 an act was passed (Session Laws, 1905, page 599) pertaining to this boundary. The same year a joint resolution was passed by the legislature and it will be found on page 793 of the 1905 Session Laws. In fixing this boundary line, which I think has been legally established by acts of each state and act of Congress, land that had formerly been in South Dakota was placed in </seg>
            <seg id="p249">132 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. Nebraska, and land in Nebraska into South Dakota. There were delin - quent taxes against some of the Nebraska land that the commission plac - ed in South Dakota. The question I would like to ask is this, can Ne - braska or Dakota county collect these delinquent taxes now, in any way? "This question has become a very important and serious one to us, and I would appreciate an early reply." In response thereto, from an examination of the pro - ceedings of the legislature referred to in your communi - cation, and that of Congress, being chapter 1295 United States Statutes at Large, page 820, volume 33, part 1, which is as follows : "Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives, of the United States of America in Congress assembled, that the portion of the boundary line between the state of South Dakota and the state of Ne - braska lying and being south of Union county, South Dakota, shall be in the middle of the main channel of the Missouri River as now existing, and the compact between said states establishing said boundary line is hereby approved. Approved March 1, 1905." This was merely approving the compact, with the Senate and House of Representatives concurring, in Senate File 43, chapter 234 of the Session Laws of Nebraska for 1905, found on page 793 and was as follows: "Witnesseth: That subject to the consent of Congress that portion of the boundary line between the state of Nebraska and the state of South Dakota lying and being north of Dakota county, shall be in the middle of the main channel of the Missouri River as now existing. Approved February 3. 1905." It is quite evident that the legislature and the states of Nebraska and South Dakota made no attempt to cause the ratification of any new or distinct border or boundary line, but rather declared just where the boundary line was. A fair interpretation of the act of the legislature and that of Congress necessarily means that an attempt was made to point out more cleariy the boundary line which had here - tofore existed between the states of South Dakota and Ne - braska. The fact that some of the land was assessed in South Dakota when in fact and in truth, under the line as now designated it appears to be in Nebraska, or that "there </seg>
            <seg id="p250">OPINIONS 133 were delinquent taxes against some of the Nebraska land that the commissioner placed in South Dakota," would be no warranty or authority for the state of Nebraska to at - tempt to collect delinquent taxes upon land in South Da - kota. The conclusive legal presumption must necessarily be that the assessment of the land in South Dakota by authorities in Nebraska, was erroneous, having no authori - ty or jurisdiction to make such assessment; and it would likewise follow that should South Dakota attempt to collect any taxes upon land this side of the river, such attempt must necessarily fail, because the state of South Dakota and none of its officers were authorized bv law to levy such taxes. Very respectfully WILLIS E. REED, October 9, 1917. Attorney General. Aclohol — Gift to Hospitals. There is no provision of the law as it now stands, which authorizes or empowers anyone to sell or give alcohol or whiskey to a hospital. Mr. C. W. Delamatre, 401 Karbnch Block, Omaha, Neb. Dear Sir: In yours of the 2nd instant you say: "I am a trustee of the Methodist Hospital and have requested Mr. McGuire, attorney for the city, to inform me as to whether our hospital could secure some of this alcohol and whiskey. He referred me to Chief Dunn. I took the matter up with Chief Dunn and he said that he would be glad to turn this alcohol and whiskey over to the local hospitals and other institutions, provided he would be within the law. He further said that he wished that I would write for your opinion on the subject, and to request you, when you answer me, to send him at the same time, a copy of your answer." You sav further: "Will you kindly state to me your opinion, by letter, and send a copy thereof to Chief Dunn, and greatly oblige?" Assuming that the alcohol and whiskey have been seized by an officer and that at the present time they are in the custody of the law, will say, there is no provision of the law, as it now stands, which would authorize or empower any one to sell or give to a Methodist Hospital, or any other hospital for that matter, the alcohol and whiskey. Insofar 9atr </seg>
            <seg id="p251">134 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL as the whiskey itself is concerned, the language of the pro - hibitory law should be strictly followed, and while there is no direct provision of the law, it would seem the part of sound sense and reason that the alcohol should be disposed of to the various hospitals without suffering the waste and loss by confiscation and destruction. Evidently it had never occurred to the legislature that such a condition as has arisen would arise, or they would have made adequate pro - vision therefor. It is a matter of common knowledge that the hospitals will use an immense amount of alcohol and to destroy the same in the face of the great demand, and which will become still greater on account of the war, would be, to my mind, a great wrong. If the institutions such as you refer to, the Methodist Hospital, or any other hospital, took the alcohol when it was about to be destroyed and put it, as they would, to a beneficial purpose or use, no one would think of prosecuting them for so doing. Certainly I should not recommend a prosecution. The court might possibly order the alcohol to be transferred or placed in the custody of the hospitals on request of the public prosecutor instead of destroying the same, and upon the request also of the public institutions requiring it. As stated before, the whiskey must necessarilv be destroved. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED November 5, 1917. Attorney General Alcohol — Selling Lemon and Vanilla Extracts. It is a violation of the prohibitory law for merchants to sell lemon and vanilla extracts for drinking purposes. A. M. Smith, Esq., County Attorney of Thurston County, Fender, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Am. just in receipt of a letter to the effect that certain merchants in Winnebago are selling lemon and vanilla extract to different parties for drinking purposes; that a number of the merchants have been told repeatedly that the parties to whom they had sold the lemon and va - nilla extracts were using them for the purpose of becoming intoxicated and that the same had produced intoxication repeatedly. </seg>
            <seg id="p252">OPINIONS 135 Though needless, will say to you that the intention of the prohibitory amendment was to prevent the use of in - toxicating liquors as beverages. It will not do for an in - dividual to assume that the legislature might grant relief, nor did it do so. Will you kindly notify the merchants and individuals in Winnebago or elsewhere, for that matter, in your county, that they must desist and cease selling lemon and vanilla extracts for drinking purposes, or they will be prosecuted for violating the prohibitory law. Will you also go to Winnebago and investigate the conditions there, because I am led to believe that the situation is such that your own good judgment will prompt prosecution, if an individual is purchasing lemon or vanilla extract and drinking the same or anything else that produces intoxication. Jamaica Bitters is also one of the liquors that merchants must cease selling, if anyone uses the same for use as a beverage. There are several other bitters and nostrums that will necessarily come under the ban of "intoxicating liquors." The people declared, for prohibition and must have it if it lies in our power to so enforce the law as to insure the same. Knowing that you will most cheerfully co-operate in this matter, I am writing you quite fully and hope to hear from you in the near future. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, November 5, 1917. Attorney General. Physicians — Illegal Practice. Any one taking the symptoms of those who are ill, on what is termed a "symptom blank" and sending said blank to a practicing physician in another state, which physician puts up medicine and sends it to the patient, is practicing medicine within the meaning of the statute and should be prosecuted for its violation.

Mr. Springer has noth - ing on record in this county entitling him to practice as an M. D. and I understand that he has no right to any such certificate as he has had no medical training at all. "Their method is as follows: Mr. Springer goes out and takes their symptoms on what they call a symptom blank and then sends it to Dr. Coe at Kansas City, who puts up the medicine and sends it to the patient. Mr. Springer then goes and sees the patient and sees how he is getting along. Mr. Springer at the time he sends in the symptom blank collects the fee nit.her in cash or in notes." The solicitor, Mr. Springer, or anyone who acts in a simi - lar capacity, is guilty of violating the law.

Insane Person — Maintenance by Relatives The estate of a deceased parent of an inmate of a state institution for the insane, is not chargeable with the maintenance of the insane inmate at such institution. Such expense under the statutes, is a personal charge against the parent. The constitutionality of the statute rendering relatives of inmates of state institutions for the insane liable for the support of such insane inmate, is questioned. Hon. E. O. Mayfield, Board of Commissioners of State In - stitutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Your inquiry of the 27th ultimo received in which you refer to the case of Adolph Stange, an inmate of the State Hospital for the Insane at Norfolk, from Madi - son county, Nebraska. Chapter 132 of the 1917 Session Laws amending chapter </seg>
            <seg id="p254">OPINIONS 137 134 of the 1915 laws and section 7256 of the Revised Stat - utes of 1913, provides that: "If the husband or parent or any person legally liable for the mainte - nance of a patient is possessed of an estate or income sufficient to meet the expense of the care and maintenance of such patient in said hospital, then such husband or parent or other person shall be required to pay to the superintendent of the hospital, quarterly during said patient's stay therein, a sum to be fixed by the board of commissioners of state institutions in an amount as nearly as may be equal to the per capita cost of maintaining such hospital, and the superintendent thereof may bring suit to recover the same in behalf of the state." The amendment further provides that the parties so liable and desiring to be relieved from such obligation may show by affidavit that his or^ier estate is not sufficient to meet such demand, etc. A similar amendment was enacted by chapter 134 of the 1915 laws and that chapter amended also sections 7249 and 7272 of the Revised Statutes for 1913. Section 7272 of the 1913 statutes was very indefinite in that it provided that the insane person should be charged with his support at a state institution, excepting, however, "the cost of board, care and treatment while in the hospital of the state, which cost of board, care and treatment shall be borne by the state." In Kearney County v. Elsam, 81 Neb. 490, it was held that the estate of the insane person was not liable for the expense attending the committment to the institution. When the expense of the committment and that of board, care and treatment at the institution are borne by the state there would seem to be but little expense remaining to be borne by the estate of the insane person. Under section 7272 as amended by chapter 132 of the 1917 laws, the question arises, first, whether the estate of the husband, parent or other person legally liable for the maintenance of an insane patient in such hospital is charge - able for such maintenance; second, whether the mother, brothers or sisters, if there are such, are personally liable for such support. It would seem that such liability is a personal one, and does not attach to the estates of such persons. Such conclusion seems to follow from the several amendments of the statutes referred to. </seg>
            <seg id="p255">138 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL If the insane patient is possessed of an estate it is charge - able with such patient's support, and if the husband, parent or other person legally liable for such support is possessed of an estate or income sufficient for such purpose, such per - son may be chargeable with the same ; although in Baldwin v. Douglas County, 37 Neb. 283, it was held that the provi - sion authorizing the county to bring suits against relatives for such support was unconstitutional. The law as to the support of paupers requires relatives, other than parent or husband to furnish support as provid - ed in sections 5795 and 5796 of the 1913 statutes, but we do not apprehend that those provisions apply to section 7256 as amended by the 1917 laws in determining the persons liable for the support of the insane. It would seem to be doubtful as to the persons intended by the 1917 statute to be charged with the support of the insane in addition to the parent and husband. In the case presented, if there is a surviving mother of the insane person with property sufficient for the support of the insane son in addition to the necessities of those de - pendent upon her as provided by the 1917 laws, then it would seem to be the purpose of the statute that she should defray the expense of the maintenance of the son at the hospital referred to. It would not seem that the estate of Henry C. Stange is liable for the maintenance of the insane son, and his will might not be set aside because of his failure to provide for such maintenance. Different legislatures seem to have differed as to the extent to which the state should care for its insane, inde - pendent of such insane person's property interests, or the interests of such person's relatives. The state hospital for the insane is supported by the tax payers, and it would not seem as though there need necessarily be an additional charge upon the tax payer when he, or a member of his family, becomes an inmate of the institution, unless for special services; but the last two legislatures evidently be - lieved that those with sufficient means should contribute in proportion to such means. It is a question from which viewpoint a court may determine this matter. </seg>
            <seg id="p256">OPINION'S 139 The purpose of the present statute would seem to be to make the living parent of Adolph Stange liable for his sup - port, provided such parent is possessed of the means con - templated by the statute, but there is a question as to the constitutionality of such a statute as above pointed out, and the question as to the liability of brothers and sisters in such case would seem to be a more doubtful one.

Appropriation — Use of for Teaching Home Economics The act of Congress now known as chapter 227 Session Laws of 1917, has been held to be broad enough in its scope, by the officers charged with its administration, to authorize the use of government funds in paying a part of the expenses of teaching the subject of Home Ec - onomics in the various states. Hon. W. H. Clemmons, State Superintendent of Public In st ruction, Lincoln, Neb. Dear Sir: You inquire whether any part of an appro - priation of $18,500 made to carry out the provisions of an act entitled, "An act accepting on behalf of the state the conditions, purposes and terms of an Act of Congress, known as Public Xo. 347 64th Congress, entitled, "An act to provide for the promotion of vocational education; to provide for co-operation with the states in the promotion of such education in agriculture and the trades and industries; to provide for co-operation with the states in the preparation of teachers of vocational subjects; and to appropriate money and regulate its expenditure." "To provide for a board, to be known as the State Board of Vocational Education; prescribing the powers and duties of said board; to repeal chapter 234, Session Laws of 1915, and all acts and parts of acts in con - flict with the provisions of this act, and to make an appropriation." and now known as chapter 227, Session Laws of 1917, can be used for the purpose of assisting in paying the expense in - cident to the teaching of Home Economics. It is my opinion that it may. Sections 1 and 6, of the above entitled act, read as follows : </seg>
            <seg id="p257">140 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL "That the state of Nebraska hereby accepts the provisions of the act of Congress, approved February 23, 1917, entitled, 'An act to provide for the promotion of vocational education; to provide for co-operation with the states in the promotion of such education in agriculture and the trades and industries; to provide for co-operation with the states in the preparation of teachers of vocational subjects; and to appropriate money and regulate its expenditure." (Public — No. 347 — 64th Congress.) The good faith of the state is hereby pledged to make available, for the several purposes of said act, funds sufficient at least to equal the sums allotted, from time to time, to this state from the appropriations made by said act and to meet all conditions necessary to entitle the state of Nebraska to the benefits of said act." "There is hereby appropriated out of any money not otherwise ap - propriated the sum of $2,500 or so much thereof as may be necessary, to defray the expenses of the State Board of Vocational Education in carrying out the purposes of this act. and the further sum of $18,500 or so much thereof as may be necessary for expenditure, under the supervis - ion of said board to enable the state to meet its share of the cost of co - operation under the provisions of the aforesaid act of Congress. All expenditures except such as are provided for expenses of the board under this act shall be by and through such schools and other agencies as are supported and controlled by the public." The act of Congress referred to therein has been held to be broad enough in its scope by the officers charged with its administration, to authorize the use of government funds in paying a part of the expense of teaching the subject of "Home Economics" in the various states.

Until the supreme court shall have held otherwise, or an amendment is made by the legislature, it is essential that a retail druggist should secure a permit and comply with all the requirements of the law for the handling of pure ethyl alcohol. Mr. D. B. Welpton, Arlington Block, Omaha, Neb. Dear Sir: In response to yours of the 23rd instant, in whicji you inquire : "Can a retail druggist, who has not qualified to the state under the re - quirements of the law governing the sale of pure spirits, but has obtained </seg>
            <seg id="p258">OPINIONS 141 a permit from the internal revenue department, under the law passed in April, purchase and use exclusively in the compounding of tinctures, extracts, essences, etc., and for non-beverage purposes, without Incurr - ing liability to the state." Will say, while certain sections of the prohibitory law might indicate that it would be lawful for them so to do, I am of the opinion that it would be a dangerous precedent to establish and practice to observe, if they were permitted so to do. Until the supreme court shall have held other - wise, or an amendment is made by the legislature, I hold that it is essential that a retail druggist should secure a permit and comply with all the requirements of the law for the handling of the same. Any other holding might bring true what so many have repeatedly said: "Hush, little drug store, don't you cry, You'll become a saloon, by and by." Very respectfully, November 24, 1917. WILLIS E. REED, Attorney General. Soldiers — Punishment . Each elector in actual military service of the United States or of this state, and not in the regular army, may exercise the right of suffrage at such place and under such regulations as may be provided by law. Section 3 of article 7 of the Constitution applies to primary as well as general elections. The question as to whether or not the provision of chapter 177 of the laws of 1917 applies to municipal elections, is not entirely free from doubt but no good reason exists why such person should be de - barred from voting at a municipal election when he is permitted to vote at general state elections. Hon. James C. Dahlman, Omaha, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire whether chapter 177, laws of 1917, which provides that : "At the first general or special election after the second Monday of January, 1917. every elector in this state who is in the military service </seg>
            <seg id="p259">142 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL of the United States and. because of said service is absent on said day from the city, village, town or voting precinct in which he is entitled to vote as an elector, shall have the same right to give, in the manner here - inafter provided, his ballot for candidates for all officers voted for at said election, and to have said ballot counted for all candidates for said offices, as he would have if present at the time of voting in said election in said city, village, town or voting precinct. The provisions of this act shall not. however, extend to persons in the regular army of the United States." Said section provides further for taking and counting the votes of such electors, and it is constitutional. You inquire also whether the provisions of said act apply to primary and municipal elections. This is a remedial statute and the rule for construction under such cases is to consider the old law the mischief and the remedy. Under the old law the legislature had omitted to provide with proper safeguards the opportunity for an elector to vote, if he was outside of the state and in the employment of the state or Nation and unable to return home at the time fixed for the general election. The in - justice of such a failure in former years, on the part of the legislature, was made quite apparent when many of our Nebraska citizens were required to lose their votes on ac - count of military duties on the border between the United States and Mexico or in fact being within Mexico, and the measure enacted by the last legislature was one in which it was sought to remedy this gross injustice to those whose lives might not be spared in the defense of their country, and as a result chapter 177 of the Laws of 1917 was passed and became the law. I will answer the questions propounded by you in the order in which thev are stated above. (1) The act is constitutional. Section 3 of article 7 of the Constitution of Nebraska reads as follows : "Every elector in the actual military service of the United States or of this state, and not in the regular army, may exercise the right of suffrage at such place and under such regulations as may be provided by law." The right to vote of an elector engaged in the military service of the United States may be said then to be granted by the constitution which impliedly places upon the legis - lature the duty of providing means for its exercise. </seg>
            <seg id="p260">OPINIONS 143 (2) No good reason exists in my opinion why said act should not apply to primary as well as general elections. (3) The question as to whether or not the provisions of that act apply to municipal elections may not be entirely free from doubt, but everything considered, I am inclined to the opinion that it does. In many cases, possibly in most, the elector is about as much interested in the result of a municipal as he is in the result of a state or national election. It may effect the most intimate and tender relations of his life. Questions affecting the health, convenience and general welfare of his family, including the education of his children, are large - ly in the hands of officers chosen at such an election. No good reason exists why he should be debarred from voting at a municipal election when he is permitted to- vote at general state elections. The statute which makes pro - vision for the exercise of the right does not limit it to gen - eral, but includes also special elections which, so far as I now recall, are never state wide, and the constitutional pro - vision conferring the privilege, you will observe, is broad enough in its terms to include municipal as well as state and national elections. Very respectfully. WILLIS E. BEED. November 23, 1917. Attorney General. Transportation of Intoxicating Liquors — Seizure and Sale of Vehicle An automobile or other vehicle used for the unlawful transportation of intoxicating liquor in this state, may be declared a common nui - sance and abated as such. Wmere one is convicted of the unlawful sale or keeping for sale of intoxicating liquor, such personal prop - erty as is directly used in connection with the commission of the said offense, shall be sold under order of court, at public sale and the proceeds of such sale paid into the school fund as in the case of fines and forfeitures. A. G. Cole, Esq., County Attorney of Cass Comity. Platt mouth. Neb. </seg>
            <seg id="p261">144 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Dear Sir: You inquire whether or not an automobile used in this state in the unlawful transportation of intoxi - cating liquors may be seized and sold by the sheriff, and if it may, what can be done with the proceeds of such sale. The last paragraph of section 42, chapter 187, Session Laws of 1917, reads as follows: "Any car, automobile, vehicle or means of transportation which shall be engaged in, or used for, the unlawful transportation of intoxicating liquors is hereby declared a common nuisance and may be abated as in this act provided. Any peace officer having probable cause to believe that such vehicle is being used for the unlawful transportation of in - toxicating liquors, shall make search thereof with or without a warrant, and in every case where a search is made without a warrant, the officer shall take the vehicle and the persons in charge thereof into custody and forthwith shall file a complaint and a warrant shall issue and the case thereafter shall proceed in all respects as is provided in this and the preceding sections." It follows from the above quoted provision of the statutes that any automobile or other vehicle used for the unlawful transportation of intoxicating liquors in this state, may be declared to be a common nuisance and abated as such. As to what shall be done with the proceeds of the sale of such vehicle, depends upon the form of the action. Section 41, chapter 187, Session Laws of 1917, provides for the search for and seizure of intoxicating liquors, and for the trial of those found with such liquors in their possession. The last sentence of the section read as fol - lows: "Final judgment of conviction in such proceedings shall be in all cases a bar to any suits for the recovery of the same, or other personal property actually and directly used in connection therewith, or the value of the same, or for damages alleged to arise by reason of the seizing and destruction thereof, and on conviction, judgment shall be entered direct - ing that containers or other receptacles hereinbefore mentioned, and other personal property actually and directly used in connection with the said violation shall be ordered sold by the court at public sale on ten days notice and the proceeds paid into the school fund as in case of fines and forfeitures." The statute, therefore, is clear that where one is convict - ed of the unlawful sale or keeping for sale of intoxicating liquors, such personal property as is directly used in con- </seg>

Where, however, the action is not criminal in form, but is brought as an action for injunction and to abate and pre - vent the maintenance of a nuisance, the sale is made in conformity of the provisions of section 33, of said chapter 187, which provides that after the costs of the action for abatement are paid, the balance of the proceeds of the sale, if any, shall be paid to the defendants. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED November 30, 1917. Attorney General Irrigation District — Taxation Real estate subject to sale for taxes within a city, village, drainage or irrigation district, may be purchased at such sale by any such city, village or district and the treasurer of same may assign the cer - tificate of purchase. When such lands have been sold to the county and the county assigns the tax certificates to a city, village or dis - trict, payment is not required of such city, village or district until such certificates have been disposed of or until the money is re - ceived through redemption or foreclosure proceedings. H. W. McDonald, Esq., County Attorney of Morrill Coun - ty, Bridgeport, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Your letter of the 24th ultimo received. You state that the Farmers Irrigation District has re - quested the county treasurer of Morrill county to issue to it tax receipts for the taxes due the county on lands within the irrigation district without tendering to the county treasurer the taxes due thereon. We assume that in the case to which you refer, the lands have not been sold to the county as provided in section 6529 of the 1913 statutes. Section 6530 of the 1913 statutes was amended by chapter 118 of the 1917 laws conferring upon drainage and irrigation districts the same right as had in - corporated cities and villages, to purchase at tax sales. The amendment provides that real estate subject to sale for </seg>

The question in such case seems to be whether the city, village or district so purchasing, shall pay to the county the taxes then due upon the lands purchased. It is plain that when such lands have been sold to the county and the county assigns the tax certificates to a city, village or district, pay - ment is not required of such city, village or district until such certificates have been disposed of or until the money is received through redemption or foreclosure proceedings. There would seem to be no reason why the city, village or district receiving the certificates of purchase from the coun - ty treasurer should not have a like opportunity to dispose of such certificates; and does not the proviso at the end of section 6530 as amended, apply to both tax certificates and certificates of purchase, the two conditions referred to? It would seem so, and it would seem particularly so when section 6431 is considered in this connection. Such seems to be the purpose of the amended statute. We trust the foregoing will meet with your approval Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, Attorney General. Bv CHARLES S. ROE. December 4, 1917. Deputy Attorney General. Insane Person — Pension Money — Proceeds from Sale of Homestead Property. The guardian of an insane person has discretionary control of pension monies to be used for the benefit of the insane person and those dependent upon him.

            <seg id="p264">OPINIONS 147 Hon. Silas A. Holcomb, Board of Commissioners of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Your letter of the 21st ultimo received, en - closing a letter from Mr. A. V. Thomas, the county attorney of Bntler county. Mr. Thomas, in his letter to your board inquires as- to the use of pension moneys and moneys re - ceived from the sale of homestead property in the hands of the guardian of an inmate of a state institution for the in- sane. On October 6th, 1915, we replied to an inquiry from Mr. Thomas in this connection, to which reply Mr. Thomas re - fers now in his letter to your board. We then stated to Mr. Thomas that it would seem very plain that under the exemptions contained in section 8106 of the 1913 statutes, the guardian would have the discretionary control of such pension moneys for the benefit of the insane person and for those dependejit upon him. With reference to moneys in the hands of a guardian re - ceived from the sale of homestead property, it then seemed to the writer that section 7272 of the statutes as amended by chapter 134 of the 1915 laws might require such moneys to be used for the maintenance of such insane person at a state institution. In view of the provisions and purposes of the homestead law there may be doubt as to the correctness of this posi - tion. The investigation of the question as to the duties and obligations of the state with reference to the care of its in - sane, occasioned by our communication to your board of the 16th ultimo, leads to the conclusion that moneys in the hands of a guardian of an insane person received from the sale of homestead property, not exceeding the amount of homestead exemption, may not, as a general rule, be re - quired by law to be paid to a state institution for the main - tenance of the ward at such institution. It at first appeared that there might be conditions in the absence of the dependents referred to in section 7272 as amended by chapter 134 of the 1915 laws, wherein such ap - plication might be required, but when the above statute is considered fully in connection with the provisions of the </seg>

Alien Companies — Annual Report — Promotion Expense. No foreign or alien company shall be admitted to do business in Nebras - ka until, in addition to all other requirements, it has made at least one annual report to the insurance department of the state or coun - ty in which its home office is located. Non-compliance wtih section 3167 as to promotion expense is not an ad - equate ground for exclusion from the state. Hon. W. B. Eastham, Insurance Commissioner, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Your communication of the 28th ultimo re - ceived. You state that the American Bonding &amp; Casualty Com - pany of Sioux City, Iowa, has applied to your department for permission to carry on business in this state. It is stated that this company was incorporated in Iowa on June 25, 1916, and that the state of Iowa issued a license to the company on January 10, 1917, to do business in that state, and on June 30, 19i7, this company made a statement of its affairs to the insurance department of the state of Iowa. You further state that the question is under considera - tion in your department as to, "Whether or not the state - ment submitted to the Iowa department as of June 30, 1917, complies with the requirements of section 3276 Revised Statutes of Nebraska." Section 3276 of the 1913 statutes provided that : "No foreign or alien company shall be admitted to do business in this state until, in addition to all other requirements it has made at least </seg>
            <seg id="p266">OPINIONS 149 four annual reports to the insurance department of the state or country In which its home office is located." The above provision was amended by chapter 78 of the 1917 laws as follows: "No foreign or alien company shall be admitted to do business in this state until, in addition to all other requirements it has made at least one annual report to the insurance department of the state or country in which its home office is located." This amendment probably grew out of a reciprocal ne - cessity on the part of this state under section 3293 of the 1913 statutes, in order to conform to the requirements of the state of Iowa as to the admission of foreign insurance companies into that state. However that may be, it would seem that the report filed by the company in question with and accepted by the insurance department of the state of Iowa, should be deemed to be a reasonable compliance with chapter 78 of the 1917 laws referred to. We understand that a further question or objection is raised as to the propriety of permitting this company to enter this state, on the ground that the promotion expense of the company exceeded the limit prescribed by section 3167 of the Nebraska statutes. Since this company, with reference to its incorporation and organization, must have complied with the laws of Iowa both in the particular respect referred to and in other re - spects, it would not seem that a noncompliance with section 3167 of our statutes should be an adequate ground for ex - clusion from this state, unless exclusion would be exercised under like conditions in the state of Iowa.

That the bonds will bear date of the month of July, 1917, and a date prior to the resignation of the former chairman of the board, and the appointment of the present chairman. In this connection you submit to this department the question whether the present or the former chairman should sign the bonds at this time. First: We will say that the former chairman has no legal authority to sign the bonds at this time and under the circumstances stated. Legal authorities are quite uni - form in this respect. There might be circumstances or con - ditions under which such an ac,t might be sustained, but such conditions are not here present. In this connection we will refer you to State v.

In the above cases questions similar to the questions in - volved in this matter are discussed. We will be pleased if you will submit these views to the legal advisor of your village.

Jn the use of such meat for food the public should be satisfied that all reasonable sanitary precautions are exercised and deception in its sale prevented. Hon. Otto Murschel, Deputy Food, Drug, Dairy and Oil Commissioner, and, Dr. J. S. Anderson, State Veterinarian Gentlemen: We have a copy of the letter of the 20th instant submitted by the Food, Drug, Dairy and Oil Com - mission to the State Veterinarian suggesting certain sani - tary regulations with reference to the sale of horse flesh and the slaughter of the animals. There seems to be no prohibition in this state against the sale and use of horse flesh for food. From an examination of the provisions of the statutes with reference to regula - tions and restrictions that may properly be exercised by the Food, Drug, Dairy and Oil Department, it would seem that the proposed regulations contained in the letter re - ferred to are entirely consistent with the purpose of the statutes in providing for sanitary and wholesome food and preventing deception of every kind in such respect. In the use of such meat for food the public should be satisfied that all reasonable sanitary precautions are exer - cised and deception in its sale prevented. The proposed regulations seem to this department to be reasonable and proper requirements and within the powers and duties of the food department. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, Attorney General.

Chiropractic Practitioners — Administering Anaesthetics A chiropractic practitioner is not authorized by statute to administer anaesthetics, nor to authorize the administration of same by a train - ed nurse. </seg>
            <seg id="p269">152 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Dr. E. A. Harvey, Hebron, Neb. Dear Sir: Your letter of the 12th instant received. Chapter 197 of the 1915 laws authorizing the licensing of chiropractic practitioners provides that "such license shall not authorize the holder thereof to prescribe or use drugs in the treatment of diseases." We understand, however, that a professional trained nurse is permitted to administer anaesthetics under the di - rection of a regularly licensed physician, not as we under - stand, a chiropractic practitioner; but it is evidently a ques - tion whether or not the chiropractic practitioner is author - ized to administer anaesthetics. If in your case you are a regularly licensed physician and your wife is a professional trained nurse, she can evidently administer an anaesthetic under your direction ; but if you are a chiropractic prac - titioner it would seem to be doubtful as to whether you can administer an anaesthetic or authorize the same adminis - tered by a trained nurse. The statute is not plain, and it is problematical as to how a court might determine the question, but this department is inclined to the view that a chiropractic practitioner is not authorized by the statute to administer anaesthetics, nor to authorize the administration of same by a trained nurse.

            <seg id="p270">OPINIONS 153 Dear Sir: Your letter of the 16th instant has been re ceived. You inquire with reference to the method that should be employed in filling a vacancy in the board of supervisors of a county under township organization. The question you submit is whether the vacancy should l»e filled as provided in section 2277 of the 1913 statutes, amended by chapter 38 of the 1917 laws, or whether the provision in section 993 of the 1913 statutes should be held to control. Whether the ruling in State v. West, 62 Neb. 461, should now be followed, holding that the office of supervisor is a township office, may, under the later amendments as to su - pervisor system, be doubted, but that question may not be particularly material in determining the question you sub - mit. State v. Rankin, 33 Neb., 266, would seem to state the rule that should govern in this instance, unless section 2277 and its amendment in 1917 should prevail over the pro - vision in section 993 of the statutes and the decision in State v. West, supra, holding that section 993 was a special provision as to filling a vacancy in office that should prevail over a general provision as to filling such vacancy. Chapter 38 of the 1917 laws substituted the county attor - ney for the county judge without other change as to filling a vacancy in a county board. Section 2277 was enacted in 1879 while section 993 was enacted in 1895. The amendment to section 2277 by the laws of 1917 seems not material in this connection. In view of the holding in State v. West, supra, in 1901, it would seem that the ruling in that case should now be followed in filling the vacancy to which you refer. It may be that section 2277 in its reference to a vacancy in a county board was intended to include a vacancy in a board of supervisors under township organization as well, yet the rulings of the supreme court referred to seem to preclude such interpretation.

L. A. Devoe, Esq., County Attorney of Keith County, Ogal - lala, Nebraska. Dear Sir : Your letter of the 24th instant received. The inquiry contained in your letter raises a question as to the jurisdiction of a county board over an incorporated city or village within the county with reference to furnishing county medical aid to cases within such incorporated city or village. You will see that by section 5798 amended by chapter 20 of the 1915 laws, the county physician does not have gen - eral authority as such over incorporated cities and villages within the county. He does, however, have certain author - ity as to contagious and epidemic diseases when acting through the State Board of Health pursuant to the author - ity vested in the State Health Department. The reference to incorporated towns and cities in the statutes referred to, we understand to mean incorporated cities and villages.

Fur Bearing Animals — Hunting — Trapping, Section 2668 of the 1913 statutes seems to have been enacted to prevent the annoyance of hunters and trappers in pursuit of muskrats, mink or otter on the lands of others, rather than a protection of these fur - bearing animals, which have now become valuable. The purpose of the 1917 amendment of the statute Is to protect these fur-bearing animals. Hon. George E. Koster, Deputy State Game and Fish Com - missioner, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Pursuant to your request for an interpreta - tion of section 2668 of the 1913 Revised Statutes amended by chapter 54 of the 1917 Session Laws pertaining to the hunting, trapping, etc., of fur bearing animals, we submit the following: This section of the statutes prior to the 1917 amendment was enacted in 1873, entitled "An Act to prevent the killing, trapping or hunting of muskrats, mink, otter on lands of others." The purpose of the early statute seems to have been to prevent the annoyance of hunters and trappers in pursuit of these animals rather than a protection of these fur bearing animals which now have become valuable. The original statute provided that such hunting and trapping of these animals should not be carried on from the 15th day of April to the 15th day of February, and it may be doubted whether the purpose of that statute was the "protection of these animals or the protection of land owners from the hunters or trappers during such period of the year. The original statute, however, does provide that during such </seg>
            <seg id="p273">156 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL period of the year persons shall not without permission en - ter the premises of others and destroy the houses of musk - rats. The purpose of the 1917 amendment of the statute was plainly to protect these fur bearing animals. It estab - lished a closed season from February 15th to November 1st. The period of breeding it seems begins February 15th, although the furs are prime beyond that time. The second provision in this statute is that no person at any time shall enter upon the premises of another without his consent for the purpose of hunting and trapping those animals or disturbing their houses. An inference is there - fore justifiable that the preceding provision in these words, "It shall be unlawful for any person between the 15th day of February and the 1st day of November, next ensuing of each year, to trap, catch, kill, or to pursue with such in - tent, on the premises of another, any fur bearing animal, to-wit: Muskrat, mink, raccoon, opossum or otter," is ren - dered uncertain by reason of the punctuation or comma between the words "intent" and "on," and the clause con - taining these words should read "or to pursue with such intent on the premises of another." With the elimination of the punctuation referred to the statute becomes consist - ent in its provisions and carries out its evident purpose. While grammatical construction of the statute is such that a different interpretation might be given it, yet it is our view that the interpretation here given is the logical and correct interpretation and should be upheld as a mat - ter of public policy.

Osteopaths — Practicing Optometry In view of the medical education of the osteopath now required by stat - ute, there would seem to be no impropriety in permitting such physi - cians to practice optometry the same as licensed medical practition - ers. </seg>
            <seg id="p274">OPINIONS 157 Dr. D. L. Davis, Secretary State Board of Optometry, Su - penior, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Your letter of recent date received You inquire whether an osteopath can practice optometry without the license or certificate provided for in section 2824 of the Revised Statutes of 1913. Section 2821 provides that the requirements for a license to practice optometry shall not "apply to permanently located physicians duly licensed to practice medicine under the laws of this state, nor to persons who sell spectacles or eye glasses on pre - scription from any duly qualified optometrist or physician nor to permanently located dealers in spectacles or eye glasses who neither practice nor profess to practice optom - etry." The question involved is the interpretation to be given the term "permanently located physicians duly licensed to practice medicine under the laws of this state." The osteopath is not licensed to practice medicine under section ?788. He is licensed to practice osteopathy, but he is recognized as an osteopath physician in section 2791. Prior to legislative recognition of the osteopath the courts in different states hekl that the osteopath was a practi - tioner of medicine and was within the statute prohibiting the practice of medicine except by persons licensed by the states as medical practitioners. It is a question how a court would now interpret section 2788, since an osteopath is now recognized as an osteopath physician, or a practi - tioner of osteopathy. We are inclined to the view that a rule enacted by the board of optometry permitting an established osteopath to practice optometry without a license by that board would be upheld by a court, and that probably a rule so enacted would be upheld requiring the osteopath to obtain from Buck board a license to so practice, thus granting to the optometry board some discretionary authority as to the qualifications of the practitioner of optometry. In view of the medical education of the osteopath now required by statute there would seem to be no impropriety in permitting the osteopath to practice optometry the same a licensed medical practitioner, but we think this ques- </seg>

The county sheriff in serving distress warrants for the collection of per - sonal taxes, is not entitled to collect a fee for service and return, nor for levy or any unsuccessful attempt to perform his duty. All fees earned by the sheriff shall be paid to the county treasurer No fee should be charged by the sheriff where he collects distress war - rants by mail.

Is he entitled when he makes no collection to any fee (a) for serv - ice and return (b) for levy (c) for mileage? (a) He is not entitled to a fee for service and return because there is no provision for such in the statutes in cases of distress warrants.

(c) In accordance with the general rule that a sheriff is not entitled to mileage for unsuccessful attempts to per - form duties, he should not in such ease receive mileage. 2. Is he entitled where he makes collection in cash from the tax-pay - er, but does not distress or levy upon and sell any property for the taxes to any fee (a) for service and return (b) for levy (c) for commis - sions (d) for mileage? (a) He should receive no fee for service and return be - cause there is no provision for such in the statute. (b) He should receive none for levy because no levy is made. (c) He should receive no commissions because the right to commissions is contingent upon the performance of his duties in an actual distress and sale. Kane v. U. P. R. R. Co. 5 Neb. 105. (d) Where collection is made he should receive mileage. 3. In case a commission is collected and in case a fee for levy is col - lected, is the sheriff entitled to retain such fees, or shall he under the law account for and pay the same over to the county treasurer? Section 2441, Revised Statutes of 1913, provides that all fees earned by the sheriff shall be paid to the county treas - urer. This includes all fees not specifically exempted by statute. State v. Miller, 98 Neb. 179. Since fees and com - missions earned in connection with distress and sale for personal taxes are not exempted they should be turned over to the county treasurer. 4. What fees and commissions is the sheriff entitled to where he col lects such warrants by mail? In such cases no fee should be charged, except that for issuing the warrant. 5. In cases where the sheriff starts out with a number of warrants and makes a trip on which he collects from some persons and fails to collect from others, is he required to pro-rate mileage? If so, does he pro-rate it only among the tax payers from whom he collects, or in pro - rating it among tax payers from whom he collects, should he make </seg>
            <seg id="p277">160 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL allowance for mileage accruing for reaching those from whom he does not collect? Do the fellows who pay on the warrants also pay a proportion of the mileage for those who are visited on the same trip and do not pay, or should it be charged up to and collected by the sheriff from the county on his mileage account? Section 6485 provides that the mileage charged shall be pro-rated among the warrants served. This provision makes no distinction in the pro-rating as to whether there is an actual collection or not. The mileage should, there - fore, be pro-rated amongst all the taxpayers upon whom a warrant is served, regardless of collection. Each taxpayer should be required to pay only his portion of the mileage, whether collection is made in the other cases or not, and the payment of the pro-rated amount in each case would be contingent upon collection of the tax. Section 6485 provides also that mileage should be charged to the taxpayer and be collected as the original tax. It should not, therefore, be charged to and collected by the sheriff from the county on his general mileage account. 6. What is the proper method of pro-rating mileage where the sheriff takes out several warrants on a trip? Does he charge each man up with the mileage consumed in getting to him from the last fellow, or does he figure it out on some basis referring to the total number of miles con - sumed on the trip? Each collection should bear a proportion of the total mile - age of the whole trip equal to the ratio between the mile - age required to make the single collection alone and the to - tal mileage required to make all the collections separately. If two collections, for instance, are made, one five and one ten miles from the office, the total round trip is twenty miles. The first collection would alone have required ten miles, and the second twenty miles, and the two separately would have required a total of thirty miles. The first, then is one-third and the second two-thirds of the total required to make the two separately. Hence the first collection should be charged 33 1-3 per cent and the second 66 2-3 per cent of the mileage of the actual trip made. 7. May the county board lawfully pay the sheriff twenty cents a mile each way for mileage incurred in serving warrants, process or other papers for the county or state, he claiming that he can not travel for less than that amount? </seg>
            <seg id="p278">OPINIONS 161 Statutes allowing fees and commissions should be strictly construed and none allowed in excess of those specifically provided. As stated in Logan County v. Doan, 34 Neb. 10-i, "A sheriff must discharge the duties of his office for the fees and compensation fixed by law, and he cannot recover a greater sum, nor has the county board the power to allow a public, officer a compensation in excess of that allowed by statute, nor where none is authorized." 8. Should the commissioners allow his bills based on the twenty cents each way proposition, would they be liable at the suit of a tax payer to return same, to the treasury of the county? In this state it seems never to have been directly decided that a taxpayer may sue a county commissioner for suras allowed to be taken from the treasury without authority of law. It has been decided, however, that a taxpayer may maintain a suit to restrain a governing body of a public cor - poration from making an illegal disposition of public funds or property. Shepard r. Easterling, 61 Neb. 882. It has also been decided that members of a county board voting for an illegal claim on which a warrant is issued without legal authority are jointly and severally liable to the county for the amount of money so disbursed. Otoe County v. Stroble, 71 Neb. 415. If a taxpayer by reason of his inter - est as such may maintain a suit for the county, and if county commissioners are liable to the county for illegal disburse - ment, it is safe to conclude, I believe, that in this state county commissioners would be liable individually at the suit of a taxpayer for disbursements to the county sheriff in excess of his statutory fees and commissions. In other states this principle has been specifically upheld. 7 R. C.L.,p.965-UCyc.p.45± Very respectfully, . WILLIS E. REED, Attorney General. Bv JOHN L. CUTRIGHT, March 4, 1918.

All property in this state not expressly exempt there - from shall be subject to taxation. Section 6300 of the 1913 statutes. Statutes exempting property from taxation are strictly construed. Y. M. C. A. v. Douglas County, 60 Neb. 642. All irrigation works and projects are expressly exempted from taxation under section 3449, that section providing that: "All ditches, canals, laterals or other works used for irrigation purposes shall be exempt from all taxation whether state, county or municipal." This statute must be construed strictly and must, we think, be held to exclude an interpretation of section 3375 whereby any canal constructed for the development of water power may be exempted from taxation on the ground that water can or may be taken therefrom for irrigation purposes. A power plant constructed and used for fur - nishing water power as a commercial enterprise, should not, we think, be exempted from taxation on the ground that in - cidentally it furnishes or can furnish water for irrigation purposes. The wording of the statute referred to does not seem to sanction such interpretation. It may be that such ditches, canals, laterals, etc., as may be used for irrigation, incidentally, in connection with a plant constructed for fur - nishing power, may be exempted from taxation. Section 3375 defines the term "Irrigation canal" and provides that canals constructed for any useful purpose from which water can be taken for irrigation, are within the definition and subject to the laws relating to irrigation canals. Section 3449 is a definite exemption from taxation. It exempts ditches, canals, laterals or other works used for irrigation purposes. The operation of this statute of ex - emption from taxation should not be extended beyond its clear import. It has reference to ditches, canals, etc., used for irrigation purposes only. Section 3375 defining an irri - gation canal refers to any canal constructed for the purpose of developing water power or any other useful purpose.

Dear Sir: Your letter of the 13th instant was duly re - ceived, but demands upon our time have prevented an ear - lier reply. Chapter 25 of the 1917 laws provides for the probate of a foreign will. This proceeding does not seem to come within chapter 45 of the 1917 laws, where it is provided that: in all estates where it therein become necessary to appoint an administrator tie boni* mm. the sum of $10.00 shall be allowed for making such appointment, and a like sum for estates settled under the provisions of section 346, in chapter 23, of Compiled Statutes of Nebras - ka for 1909, and a like sum for estates settled under provisions of chapter 185 of Session Laws of 1915." "Do these exceptions apply to and include the probat - ing of a foreign will under chapter 25 of the 1917 laws!

            <seg id="p282">OPINIONS 165 Section 346 in chapter 23 of the Compiled Statutes for 1909 referred to in chapter 25 of the 1917 laws, is section 346 of the 1913 statutes and does not pertain to the pro - bating of a foreign will. Chapter 185 of the 1915 laws provides for the settlement of estates of decedents who have died intestate and for the determination of heirship. Since the proceedings for the probate of a foreign will under chapter 25 of the 1917 laws, are not within the provisions of chapter 45 of the 1917 laws, where the fees of the county judge are limited to $10.00, would it not seem that in the case of the probate of a foreign will the county judge would receive a fee based upon the value of the estate or property in this state ad - ministered upon under the foreign will. We understood the county judge to state that the value of the property in that case was $2,000.00 or that it exceeded that amount. Tt may be your view that the fee of $10.00 for the ap - pointment of administrator de bouts non provided for in chapter 45 of the 1917 laws, should include or apply to the probating of a foreign will, but that statute provides that: "In all estates where it therein becomes necessary to appoint an ad - ministrator '/* him ix nun. the sum of $10.00 shall be allowed (or making such appointment."

The county board would, in reality, need legislative authorization in order to legally make a contribution of $50.00 toward the Nebraska build - ing at Camp Punston, but doubtless no one would object if the do - nation was made without such authorization. Hon. R. B. Schnurr, Secretary Sioux County Council of Defense, Harrison, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Some time ago you communicated with the Governor with reference to the authority of the board of county commissioners of your county to make an appro - priation of $50.00 toward the Nebraska building at Camp Funston, and later your letter came to this office. It may be realized readily that the proposition is of doubtful legality. The duties and powers of the county board are defined in article 4 of chapter 15 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska and the county board has certain discretionary powers as to the expenditure of the county funds, but you can readily see that such moneys must nec - essarily be used for purposes authorized by law, otherwise great abuse and misappropriation of public funds would necessarily result. If such action of a county board should be challenged by a tax payer through legal proceedings, it is doubtful if a court could sustain it. Some time ago it was proposed by a county board to make a contribution to the Red Cross fund from the county general fund and we were asked to advise as to its legality. Of course we could not say that the county board had legal authority for such action and that if objection was raised </seg>
            <seg id="p286">OPINIONS 169 by a taxpayer, such objection would not prevail ; but we said, however, that the purpose was such that probably no objection would be raised if the donation was made ; and so in this instance a county board would, in reality, need legis - lative authorization in order to legally make such use of the county funds, but doubtless no one would object if the do - nation was made without such authorization. There might be some question as to the willingness of the other county officers to audit and pay such a donation of the county funds, but very likely no such objection would be made. We dislike to suggest a doubt or question as to this action of the county board for we would much pre - fer to commend it. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, Attorney General. Bv CHARLES S.

From the foregoing it is quite evident that your body has the power and authority to determine, first, whether there is a vacancy before asking any other or further step. The mere fact that a member of your body may have been elected and served in a regular session and then re - moved temporarily from his home, that is, for a temporary purpose and without any intention to absolutely abandon Ms home, would not constitute such a removal as is con - templated in the constitution.

Motor Vehicle Registration Fund — Use of — County Road and A county board can not be compelled to use the fees collected under the motor vehicle registration law, for paving, repairing paving, etc., within the limits of a municipality. Such funds shall be used for the construction and maintenance of permanent roads in the inter - est of the motor vehicle owners. The county road and highway fund shall be apportioned as under sec - tion 2920 of the Revised Statutes for 1913. Mr. Louis Lightner, City Attorney, Columbus, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Some time ago you wrote us, first, with ref - erence to the distribution or use of the fees collected under the motor vehicle registration law, and second, with refer- Highway Fund — Apportionment </seg>
            <seg id="p288">OPINIONS 171 ence to section 2920 of the 1913 statutes as amended by chapter 53 of the 1915 laws, dealing with county road and highway funds. As to the first proposition, it is difficult to find authority whereby the municipality may compel the county board to use the fees or a part thereof, provided in section 3045 of the statutes as amended in 1917, for paving, repairing pav - ing, etc., within the limits of the municipality. The statutes referred to provide that these fees shall be credited to the county road fund for the construction and maintenance of permanent roads in the interest of motor vehicle owners. While the application and use of this fund is limited to this purpose, yet the county board seems to have a discre - tionary control over its expenditure and the roads and highways upon which this money shall be used. The county board has no jurisdiction over the streets of the municipality as to their improvement, but the board may have authority to contribute from this fund for road improvement within the municipality when such improve - ment is essential to the advantageous use of the roads to and from the municipality, particularly such improvements as the latter statutes provide for. Sections 2912 and 2916 authorize such use of the county road moneys under certain conditions. While these motor vehicle license fees are contributed largely from the municipality, yet the residents of the municipality are largely benefited by road improvements beyond the municipality. Chapter 67 of the 1917 laws pro - vides for extensive improvement of highways outside of the municipality, by a special tax upon the county gener - ally, no part of which is expended within the municipality, and it is evidently considered not to be unjust because of the greater benefit to the municipality from such road im - provement. We see no reason or authority for the contention that the municipality is legally entitled to a portion of these motor vehicle license fees provided in section 3045 and its 1917 amendment, the purpose of which is evidently the im - provement of the county roads and highways for the bene - fit alike of the county and the municipality. </seg>
            <seg id="p289">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 172 Second. It is difficult to arrive at a satisfactory interpre - tation of section 2920. The amendments to which you refer lead one to your view, while the wording of the statute is such that its purpose may seem to be limited in its appli - cation to counties under the commissioner svstem. The cases cited under section 2920 of the 1915 statutes do not deal with the counties under township organization. There is, however, an authority that may be followed. In the case of Falls City r. Richardson County, 99 Nebr. 663, this question was considered when that county was under township organization. The county has since adopted the commissioner system, and had, we think, adopted that sys - tem when the opinion was written. In that case it was held that the taxes should be apportioned as under section 2920 although section 2920 was not referred to, but rather strangely, all the cases there cited and relied upon were cases in counties -under the commissioner system, as yon will observe. There seem not to be other wes in the state dealing with this particular subject, but that case evidently may, with propriety, be regarded as authoritative in determining now the question you have to decide. We trust that we shall have given you some assistance in disposing of these questions. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, Attorney General. By CHARLES S. ROE, March 29, 1918. Deputy Attorney General. Communicable Diseases — Revocation of Physician's license A failure to report communicable diseases is not sufficient ground upon which a physician's license to practice may be revoked: Dr. Wm. F. Wild, Commissioner of Health, Lincoln, Neb. Dear Sir : You inquire whether the state board of health may, upon the suggestion of your department or of the medical advisory board, revoke a physician's license for failure to report communicable diseases. </seg>
            <seg id="p290">OPINIONS 173 Permit me to say in answer to the question which you ask that the grounds upon which the state board of health may refuse to issue a certificate or may revoke one already issu - ed to a physician, are set forth in section 2721, Revised Stat - utes of 1913, as amended by chapter 56, Session Laws of 1917. A failure to report communicable diseases is not set forth as one of the grounds upon which a physician's license to practice may be revoked, and I am of the opinion, there - fore, that some other or different ground than failure to make such a report is necessary to authorize the revocation of a physician's license. This does not, however, leave the state entirely without a remedy for violation of a rule or regulation of the board requiring a report from the physician in charge in such cases. Section 2738, Revised Statutes of 1913 provides that every person or officer who shall fail, neglect or refuse to obey or enforce the rules and regulations of the state board of health formulated to prevent the introduction or spread of diseases, shall upon conviction be subject to a fine of not less than fifteen nor more than one hundred dollars for each and every offense.

It is evident that the person or carrier cannot and should not be subjected to the expenses thus incurred. The public is the vital beneficiary. This principle is applicable gen - erally in matters of quarantine and sanitation, including fumigation and disinfection as a matter of public protec - tion and safety and would seem to apply as well in the handling of communicable disease carriers. We stated in a former communication that it is the pri - mary duty of the county to exercise adequate quarantine and sanitation within its boundaries and outside the limits of the municipalities and the same duty rests upon the municipality within its limits. Charters of certain muni - cipalities, give them the right to exercise these powers of quarantine, sanitation, etc., certain distances beyond the municipality. That is a permissive duty and if exercised by the municipality it is at its expense. The state law, however, provides that where such work is directed by the state board of health, the expense is charged to the municipality or the county, as the cas.e may be, and evidently the rule would not be different in dealing with carriers of communicable diseases. If dealing with such matters and cases is deemed by the state board of health to be essential to the public welfare, then the board would have jurisdiction to direct local boards of health in such respect, and failing, the state board should have this work performed and the expenses would fall upon the county or municipality, as the case might be.

The owners of private ponds not exceeding ten acres in area, are exempt from state regulation as to the time and method of taking fish therefrom. Hon. George E. K otter, Deputy State Game and Fish Com - missioner, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: We are replying to the inquiries from Ains - ley and Whitman, Nebraska, which you have transmitted to this office, with reference to fishing in lakes and ponds claimed to be private. People generally seem to have a very erroneous under - standing that the public may enter upon the lands of an - other for fishing purposes or that the banks of a stream or pond are open to the public for such purpose, while no such right exists, and more, section 2671 of the statutes, section 19 of the game laws, specially prohibits same and provides that a person entering upon the lands of another for such purpose is subject to prosecution and fine. Section 2677 of the statutes, section 25 of the game laws, defines the public waters over which the state may exer - cise jurisdiction, particularly for fish protection, etc., and is as follows: "Public waters within the meaning of this section shall embrace all lakes, ponds, rivers, creeks, bayous and streams except artificial pond or ponds subject to the exclusive dominion of single ownership." Section 2660 of the statutes provides that all game and fish are the property of the state as follows : "All fish or game, song, insectivorous or other birds now or here - after within this state not held by private ownership, legally acquired and which for the purposes of this chapter shall include all the quadru - peds, birds and fish mentioned herein, are hereby declared to be proper - ty of the state, and no right, title, interest or property therein can be acquired or transferred, -or possession thereof had or maintained, ex - cept as herein expressly provided." Section 2694 would seem to exempt or exclude from state control and regulation, private ponds not exceeding ten acres in area and in the case of such private ponds the owners may probably be exempt from state regulation as to the time and method of taking fish therefrom ; but other waters are public waters so far as the control of the fish and fishing bv the state are concerned. </seg>
            <seg id="p293">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 176 An owner of lands adjoining a lake, river or pond may charge any fee he wishes for permission to go upon his lands for fishing purposes. If, however, the road adjoining the lake to which one of the letters referred to, is a public road so that the right-of-way extends to the lake, then the public may fish from the public road or go upon the lake from this road. It is a public road for such purpose if it has been so designated by the county board, though it may not follow the section line. The owner of land may charge people for a permit to go upon his land for fishing purposes, but not as a license to fish. We trust the foregoing will aid you in an understanding of the law pertaining to fishing rights and privileges in this state. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED. Attorney General. Bv CHARLES S.

Frank Kelly, Esq., County Attorney of Ouster County Broken Bow, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Your letter of the 6th instant received, in which you inquire whether moneys collected under section 3045 of the statutes amended by chapter 61 of the 1915 laws, can be used for the purpose of purchasing road ma - chinery in the different townships. It seems that under section 3045, as amended by chapter 64 of the 1917 laws, such license fees are to be paid to the county treasurer and a part credited by him to the "road dragging fund of the county and it shall be used by the county board of said county for road dragging, paving, re - pairing paving, oiling, strawing, claying or stable littering sandy roads and for no other purpose." The remaining portion of such fees is to be remitted by the county treasurer to the state treasurer and placed in a fund designated the "special motor vehicle registration fund." This is a special fund derived from motor vehicle inter - ests to be used by the county board for such interests as the statute directs, and it would not seem that it could be appropriated to township road purposes, such as purchas - ing road machinery for a particular township or that would be the property of the township. </seg>
            <seg id="p295">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 178 ( 'hapter 67 of the 1917 laws should be considered prob - ably in connection with chapter 64 referred to. The pur - pose of chapter 67 in establishing a system of county roads throughout the state is due largely to the public demand in the interest of motor vehicle traffic. Undoubtedly under chapter 64, the county board might purchase from the road fund, drags and road machinery for use in certain districts or localities, but such property would not belong to the township or be under its jurisdiction, but would be the property of the county board as trustees of this motor ve - hicle fund. The distinction of the duties of the county board under chapter 64 and chapter 67 of the 1917 laws with reference to the use of the moneys provided by these statutes is not plain. Chapter 67, of course, has particular reference to a system of county roads contemplating a system of through highways traversing the county in connection with such highways of adjoining counties, while chapter 64 contem - plates the roads and highways generally in the county with reference to the motor vehicle interests of the county. Un - der chapter 67, the county board operates largely through a county highway commissioner created by that statute, while under chapter 64, the county board is itself the trustee of the special fund there created. We are replying rather fully to your inquiry, but we have occasion frequently to answer inquiries with reference to these somewhat confusing statutes and so endeavor to aid as far as we can toward an understanding of them.

Dear Sir: In response to yours of the 17th instant, in which you say : "On page 9 of the Second Liberty Loan Bulletin No. 17, we Four-Min - ute-Men were told that we could safely say that 'You pay no taxes — that's all. Neither national nor local taxes. The assessor who comes around to ask you about your personal property has no right to even ask how many Liberty Bonds you own. For that is an affair between you and the National Government.' But now our assessor is doing that very thing, demanding the amount, and number of the series, and shows his instructions under the Nebraska statute for it. It seems that a rul - ing should be obtained either from the attorney general of the state of Nebraska, or the federal government, making it plain that it is either right to be required to list them, or that the assessors should be notified not to call for them." In answer thereto will say the First Session of the 65th Congress of the United States, of September 24, 1917, chap - ter 56, is: "An Act to authorize an additional issue of bonds to meet expenditures for the national security and defense and, for the purpose of assisting in the prosecution of the war, to extend additional credit to foreign govern - ments, and for other purposes."

The interest on an amount of such bonds and certificates the principal of which does not exceed in the aggregate $5,000.00 owned by any individual, partner - ship, association, or corporation, shall be exempt from the taxes provid - ed for in subdivision (b) of this section." From the foregoing it must be evident that the bonds are not subject to taxation in any other manner than as pro - vided in said section 7 and as qualified by the exceptions specified in said section. It will be noticed that not only is the $5,000.00 exempt, but the interest thereon is exempt from the taxes provided for in sub-division (b), that is, graduated additional income taxes, commonly known as surtaxes, and excess profits and war profits taxes, now or hereafter imposed by the United States. Section 6345 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913 is as follows: "Any person, firm or corporation within this state, required to list property for the purpose of taxation and who claims that a portion of his or her funds are invested in government bonds, and therefore exempt from taxation, shall be required to exhibit to the assessor, to whom then are required to make return* of *uch bomlx, and the assessor shall enter upon such lists, the species of bond or bonds so exhibited, together with the number, series and the amount of each bond respectively.

In Jones v. Seuard County, 10 Neb. 154, our court held that government bonds, to be exempt, must be owned as an investment and not to avoid taxation. Past experience has taught the public that a person de - siring to dodge taxation might claim, and in some instances exhibit, a government bond to the assessor for the specific purpose of avoiding taxation, and inasmuch as the assessor could not meet each individual at once, he found by experi - ence that the same bond was peddled around in the neigh - borhood and afforded a golden opportunity for the tax </seg>
            <seg id="p298">OPINIONS 181 shirker to avoid the payment of taxes. Hence the act of the legislature, section 6345 of the Revised Statutes, supra. By following the letter of the statute just referred to, it can work no hardship upon the individual, although it may be sometimes inconvenient for him to exhibit the bond and permit the assessor to note the species of the bond, its number, series and amount. By so doing he is able to check that bond against another who might give in the same bond. In view of the purposes for which these bonds have been and will continue to be issued, it seems to me that the over-modest investor who does not care to parade his wealth, would be pleased for a golden opportunity such as this, when required by the plain provisions of the law, to frankly state the amount of his investment, and each indi - vidual should faithfully conform to that wise provision of the statute, and if he does so the language of the statute is express that it is not taxable as provided in section 7, supra. Aside from the patriotic reason of disclosing the fact, there are future calls which must necessarily be met by the individuals in this country and it might be of material as - sistance to the public in endeavoring to place the burden of financing the war where it can be borne with the least hardship upon the people of the country.

A bank in making its return lor assessment purposes, is permitted, under the law to deduct from its assessment roll the amount of govern - ment bonds of the first and second Liberty loan, held by it on April 1, 1918. Such a deduction may be made of so much of the capital stock of the bank as represents an investment in such bonds. Hon. P. L. Hall, Lincoln, Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p299">182 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Dear Sir : You inquire whether a bank in making its re - turn for assessment purposes is permitted, under the law, to deduct from its assessment roll the amount of govern - ment bonds of the first and second liberty loans held by it on April 1st, 1918. In my opinion, such a deduction may be made of so much of the capital stock of the bank as represents an investment in such bonds. In making this statement, am not unmind - ful of the fact that our supreme court has held that the statutory provision for the taxation of the property of banks is in reality a provision for the taxation of the share - holders upon the value of their respective shares of stock (State v. Fleming, 70 Neb. 529) and that the supreme court of the United States has held that the tax on an individual in respect to his shares in a corporation is not a tax on the corporation and the value of the shares may be assessed without regard to the fact that the assets of the corporation include government securities (Home Savings Bank v. Des Moines, 205 U. S. 503; Van Allen v. Assessors, 3 Wall 584; Cleveland Trust Company v. Lander, 184 U. S. Ill) and, if the question were merely as to the power of the state to tax the stockholders of a bank upon the full value of their shares of stock, without making any deduction because of the fact that a part of the capital stock of the bank is in - vested in government securities that are non-taxable, will say frankly that, as yet, they have not done so. It is clear to my mind, however, that the laws of this state do not contemplate or sanction the taxation of stock - holders in a bank upon the value of government securities that are exempt from taxation and which form a part of the capital stock of the bank. The organic law of the state provides for uniformity of taxation and the general pro - vision of law, relative to the taxation of corporate stock only requires that the holder and owner make return of such stock when the capital stock of the corporation is not assessed in this state. It is clear that if a corporation or - ganized for mercantile purposes, let us say, and having all its property within the state of Nebraska, animated by a spirit of patriotism upon the part of its managers, should buy non-taxable government securities, neither the corpora - tion itself nor those owning its stock could be assessed upon the value of such securities. Uniformity of taxation </seg>
            <seg id="p300">OPINION'S 183 requires that a like ruling be made in the case of the own - ers of bank stock. In the case of First Trust Company of Lincoln v. Lancaster County, 141 N. W. 1037, it was held that the value of mortgages on real estate in this state, held by banks as security for loans made, should be deduct - ed from the capital stock of the corporation for taxation purposes, even though the taxes on said mortgages were paid by agreement by the mortgagor. It occurs to me that, by more than a parity of reason, the value of government securities which are non-taxable, in the hands of anyone, should be deducted for taxation purposes from the value of the capital stock of a bank owning them to the extent that they represent an investment of its capital stock. Independent of the fact that the statutory provisions of this state and the judicial decisions of its courts indicate clearly that the capital stock of a bank invested in non - taxable governmental securities is exempt from taxation either to the bank itself or to its stockholders, in this crisis of the country's history an exemption from taxation in such cases should be allowed as a matter of public policy; for every possible inducement should be held out to secure a ready response to the government's appeal for funds with which to prosecute the war.

(In re Inheritance Tux of Stratum'* E*Ut1e, 142 N. W. 678). And the rule is that a widow's homestead interest is not subject to an inheritance tax. (Section 60 Ross on Inheri - tance Taxes.) In order to determine what inheritance tax, if any, the widow's interest in the estate must pay, it becomes im - portant to know what is the value of the real estate which is claimed as a homestead, for the homestead cannot be con - sidered in determining the amount of the inheritance tax. It will also be necessary to know whether or not the widow is the mother of all the children of the deceased. If she is not she only takes a one-fourth interest in his real estate under the law, while if she is she takes a one-third interest under the law. The value of the interest in the real estate which she would take under the law if there were no will should be deducted from the total value of the real estate namely $25,300, and the value of her life estate in the balance determined. It is to be borne in mind, too, that the first $10,000 in value that she takes by virtue of the will over and above what she would have otherwise, pays no inheritance tax.

Extermination of Gophers — Sale of Poisons In view of the extensive and necessary use of such articles, the sale of such a proprietary preparation as Gopher Death and other sub - stances used generally by the landowners and agriculturists, though poisonous, should not be restricted to registered pharmacists. Such substances should be labeled in such a manner that all persons handling same would readily* know uf their poisonous properties. Hon. Charles E. Gunnels, University Farm, Lincoln, Ne b raska. Dear Sir: Your letter of recent date, addressed to the pure food commission, has been handed to this department for a reply, with reference to the legal provisions and re - strictions as to the sale and use of poisons for the extermi - nation of gophers, grasshoppers and other similar pests, and whether associations organized for the destruction of these pests may purchase these drugs in quantities and dis - tribute them to the users, thus minimizing the cost to the users. The statutes are restrictive as to the use of some poisons in some instances. Section 8604 of the statute requires that Arsenic sold in a less quantity than one pound shall be mixed with soot or indigo and it has been attempted to restrict the sale of articles generally classed as drugs, to registered pharmacists. This department however, has held that well known household drugs and remedies, put up in packages or containers by reputable druggists or phar - macists, may be dispensed in such form by other than the registered pharmacist, but this department has held that formaldehyde, owing to its poisonous character, should, as a matter of public safety, be dispensed by registered phar - macists.

George W. Learner, Esq., County Attorney of Dakota Coun - ty, Dakota City, Nebraska. Dear Sir : Your letter of the 31st ultimo received and we note with interest your views as to the purpose of chapter 228 of the 1918 laws pertaining to the maintenance of flags and flag poles upon school house grounds. The first section of the act indicates quite plainly that the legislature when it enacted the law, had in mind the erection of flag poles upon the school grounds rather than upon the school buildings, and we concur in your reasons for such interpretation of the statute. It may be noted that the captions of sections one and three of the act refer to flags upon school buildings, while the title, and particularly section one of the act, refers to the construction and maintenance of flag poles and flags upon the grounds of the school houses and public institu - tions of learning. It may also be noted that the heighth of flag poles pre - scribed might justify an inference that the flag staff might be placed upon the school building, particularly in the case of the small rural school buildings ; but in the case of the larger school buildings, such as you refer to, it would seem to be the intention of the legislature that the flag pole should be placed upon the school grounds, and in all cases such an arrangement would seem to comply more fully with the purpose of the law. </seg>

Persons engaged In the organization of clubs, leagues, societies or asso - ciations which do not have for their object the furtherance of the progress of the war, are not engaged in useful occupations. Mr. R. M. Joyce, Chairman, Nebraska State Council of Defense, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir : You have asked my opinion as to the proper construction to be placed upon the words "useful occupa - tion" in subdivision M, section One, House Roll No. 5, laws passed at the special session of the Nebraska legislature and approved April 9, 1918, page 37, supplement to Ses - sion Laws of 1917. It is my opinion that the construction to be placed on "Useful occupation" varies somewhat under the circum - stances of each case and the time and conditions of the country at the time of rendering the same. For instance, one might be engaged in an occupation which is useful, but by methods or manner of pursuing the occupation fail to make it useful, such as one engaged in lecture work who uses his opportunities as a lecturer to attempt to belittle the government activities, or to disparage our form or system of government at this time. Such a person, while his occupation might be useful, in the first instance fails to make its pursuit useful and thus, in my opinion, fails to be engaged in a "useful occupation."

Any occupation which is instrumental in keeping alive existing military, commercial or governmental activities is useful, but any occupation which has for its object, either directly or indi - rectly, the opposition to our present form or system of government, the creation of new political parties, the de - termination of economic questions not connected with the war, and many other acts and deeds too numerous to men - tion, are not useful occupations. There may be instances, as I have stated, where an occupation might be useful if properly followed, but become useless under the meaning of the act referred to, when attempted in communities where such activities are not desired, or in such a manner as to encourage a failure of unanimous and concerted ac - tion by all people toward the common end of winning the war, and each and all such persons so found violating the law must be punished to the limit.

Mr. Frank Dolezal, Fremont, Nebraska. Dear Sir : In your favor of the 7th instant you say that at the request of the Roman Catholic church at Snyder, you desire an opinion from this office touching the following matter: "Their priest was refused permission to preach or teach. It is a Ger - man congregation and they cannot get served without great inconven - ience and trouble. The two things they are most interested in are the ritual observances. First is the service of the Mass. This is a ritual - istic service in the Latin language in the church. It cannot be varied by the priest and is served in the same form in all the churches in all the countries and there is not in that congregation a single person who un - derstands the Latin so as to be able to tell the meaning of the words. It is purely a religious ceremony and wholly ritualistic. The second feature is the two main rights of the church, baptism and extreme unc - tion. The baptism is a ceremonial and is performed in Latin in the church under a ritualistic form. The extreme unction is also ritualistic, but it involves the confession on the deathbed and is the preparation by the priest of a person for his death in his last sickness." Answering the same, will say that I infer, when you say that "their priest was refused permission to preach or teach," the subject of his right to preach or teach has un - doubtedly been up before the judge of your district court as provided by law, and denied by the judge.

Upon such application being filed, the court shall notify the State Council of Defense of its pendency together with the date when the same is set for hearing, when the State Council of Defense shall be offered full opportunity to file any counter showing which they think advisable. If upon such hearing a permit is granted the same shall be revokable at any time in the discre - tion of the court."

I find nothing in the statute that limits the time within which the county superintendent must act in such a case, although the law contemplates of course that it shall be within a reasonable time. Miss Coon has an undoubted right as county superintendent to defer action for a reason - able time. The law does not contemplate the filing of either a pe - tition or a remonstrance signed by electors of a consoli - dated district in such a case. The petition or remonstrance, if one is filed, is signed only by the electors of the district to be joined to the consolidated district.

Vaughn, Nebraska City Business Men's Asso - ciation, Nebraska City, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Your letter of the 13th instant received and we are pleased to reply to your inquiry. Section 767 of the Revised Statutes of 1913, governing the question you submit, provides as follows : </seg>
            <seg id="p314">OPINIONS 197 "Each corporation, organized under tbe laws of this state, not for profit, and having no capital stock, shall make a report in writing to the secretary of state, annually, during the month of November, in such form as the secretary of state may prescribe. The report shall be sign - ed and sworn to before an officer authorized to administer oaths, by the president, vice president, secretary or other chief officer of the corpora - tion, and forwarded to the secretary of state." The secretary of state's office holds that a corporation having capital stock is not exempt from the occupation tax provided in article 19 of chapter 14 containing section 767 referred to and that for a corporation to be exempt from such tax it must be organized, "not for profit and having no capital stock;" that is, that the two conditions must exist. That question may be somewhat debatable but this department has rather concurred in the ruling of the secre - tary of state. The statutes . provide for the incorporation of educa - tional, charitable, fraternal, religious and other associa - tions without capital stock and which would not be subject to an occupation tax. In such cases bonds are often issued to represent an interest in property acquired by the asso - ciation or corporation. In the case of the corporation you refer to, the occupa - tion tax is $5.00 and if you could avail yourselves of the exemption referred to, yon would then need to pay a filing fee of $1.00 for filing the certificate required in such case as provided in sections 768 and 769, making a difference of $4.00 in case the corporation could be exempted from the occupation tax in question.

Dear Sir: Your letter of the 14th instant received, in which you request an interpretation of section 2157 of the Revised Statutes with reference to the time within which nominating petitions may be filed for the primary election to be held August 20, 1918. The statute provides that the petition or application des - ignated therein shall be filed "at least 30 days prior to such time." Evidently the 30 days must elapse from and after the day of filing the petitions or applications and fully expire before the day appointed for the primary. This depart - ment, in an earlier opinion, so decided a similar question, relying upon the cases of Weyant r. Tuthill, 17 Neb. 4!&gt;"), and Miller r. Lefever, 10 Neb. 77. There may be some confusion upon this question because of the prevailing opinion in the case of State r. Dewey, 73 Neb. 396, but we do not think that the ruling in that case is sufficiently definite to be authoritative upon the particular question presented, but rather that the dissenting opinion therein emphasizes the theory that is decisive of the ques - tion that is the subject of this inquiry. Our view of the question is that nominating petitions or applications must be filed on or before July 20th, 1918, in order that the names of the petitioners or applicants may be legally upon the primary ballot.

Berry, Esq., County Attorney of Wayne County, Wayne, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to your inquiry in re ease of State v. Schlock, I will say that in my opinion, the statute you cite has reference to a former conviction rather than to the date of the offense charged. "In many of the states a severer punishment is inflicted upon a second conviction for a violation of the liquor law than upon a first conviction. Occasionally a different punishment is prescribed for a third offense, which usually must be committed after a conviction for a second offense. * * * In all such instances such averments must be inserted in the indictment, if a greater punishment is desired, as will reasonably point out to the accused where he can find the record of the first conviction." Section 911, Woolen and Thornton on Intoxicating Liquors. "Whenever a statute makes a second offense felony, the first being misdemeanor, or punishes the second more heavily than the first, it is enlarged by construction to mean, after conviction for the first, not mere - ly after it is committed." Bishop on Statutory Crimes (3rd Edition) Section 240. Under these rulings, it is clear that the court should sen - tence for each count, if the defendant is convicted, as though the offense was committed for the first time. Very respectfully, WILLIS E.

It is the duty of the school district treasurer when he is elected, to give a new bond and failure to give this bond within ten days after the election renders the office subject to be declared vacant by the school district board.

            <seg id="p317">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 200 Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of inquiry of the 14th instant, I will say that it was the duty of the school district treasurer, when he was elected, to give a new bond, and failure to give this bond within 10 days after the election rendered the office subject to be declared vacant by the school district board. I think the other members of the board, on the undisputed facts in the case, had a right to declare the office vacant without giving notice of their intention so to do to Mr. McKelvie, although the usual and better course would have been to not if v him. The filing of his bond after the office had been declared vacant for a failure to file and without any reappointment by the district board, did not operate to restore him to of - fice, since the bond was not approved by both the other members of the board. If there were 40 people present at the annual district meeting when a vote was taken to fill a vacancy in the office of district treasurer and only 15 of them voted, but all who did vote, voted for Mr. Fred Mock, Mr. Mock in my opinion, was elected. While Mr. McKelvie held and was permitted to hold without objection, the office of school district treas - urer, he was a de facto officer and his acts were valid and in such a case, in my opinion, mandamus would lie in a proper case to compel the moderator to c.ountersign orders drawn on the de facto district treasurer, namely, Mr. Mc- Kelvie. This action for a mandamus could be brought by the county superintendent on behalf of the district, but this need not necessarily be done. The teacher or other party in whose favor the order was drawn, could maintain man damus in his own behalf. In such ease, Mr. McKelvie would not be a proper party to bring the mandamus suit where he was not the party in whose favor the order was drawn, but only the school district officer on whom it was drawn.

Reverend Sir: With reference to your communication of the 17th instant in which you explain that it is the de - sire of certain members of your congregation to know the power of the Council of Defense, as well as my opinion with reference to teaching Sunday school in the German language and preaching in the German language, will say, the Council of Defense will write you and send you a letter such as they are sending throughout the state, in order that you may know the position which they take. As I have repeatedly said to others, as yet there has been no statutory law enacted which prohibits the teaching of the Sunday school in the German language nor preaching in the German language, and yet it is essential that the public should do many things or omit to do others which are not commended or prohibited by law, leaving to the best judg - ment of public opinion as to the better course to pursue, and the failure to observe what the general public believes to be just and right under conditions as they exist at the time, almost always results in subsequent enactment of laws to meet the general will of the public. The fact that in many localities it might stir up strife and bad feeling and cause a certain amount v of distrust and cause questions of loyalty or disloyalty to embroil one's neighbors, it would seem that such organizations as religious ones, who condemn strife and anger, and who teach brotherly love, should be the first to show by example the beauty of such a doctrine ; and that no other or further order or suggestion would be required than the reading of only a few words from the Holy Writ. Knowing that you are thoroughly loyal yourself and that most people in this country also are, and that the membership of your church may not expect to increase as a result of migration from the old country in view of the war, and the feeling growing out of the same, your church must then enlarge by reason of the young people growing up, and all those know or can easily learn and should ac - quire knowledge of the Bible through the English language.

Attorney General. Osteopaths — Administering Drugs. An osteopathie physician can not lawfully prescribe or administer drugs of any kind or character, under the laws of the state of Nebraska. Dr. J. J. Hompes, Secretary of Advisory Board to the State - - — - — £ 7 j - j cr — Department of Health, Lincoln, Neb. Dear Sir : Answering your inquiry relative to the ex - tent of the practice of osteopathy by licensed persons fol - lowing that system of treating diseases, will say that the practice of osteopathy and the practice of medicine differ greatly. Osteopathy is defined by the Annual Encyclopaedia for 1900, p. 554, as : "A method of treating diseases of the human body without the use of drugs, by means of manipulations applied to various nerve centers, chief - ly those along the spine, with a view to inducing free circulation of the blood and lymph, and an equal distribution of the nerve forces. Special attention is given to the readjustment of any bones, muscles, or ligaments not in the normal position." The American School of Osteopathy at Kirksville, Mo., is the parent college of the system of osteopathy in this country, and the statutes of Missouri recognize osteopathy as a "system or science of treating human diseases," and declare such system or science not to be the practice of medicine and surgery, within the meaning of the act regu - lating the practice of medicine and surgery in that state. (Mo. Laws of 1897, p. 206.) The law of Nebraska, how - ever, provides that surgery must be included in the course of study in any legally chartered school of osteopathy. (Revised Statutes of 1913, section 2794.) In the schools of learning teaching medicine in its dif- </seg>
            <seg id="p320">OPINIONS 203 ferent branches, an essential part of the instruction is in teaching the nature and effects of medicine, how to com - pound and administer them, and for what maladies they are to be used. Without a knowledge of medical agencies, no person can be deemed equipped to practice medicine by any medical college; for these things lie at the base of the in - struction given in sucji schools. Osteopathy teaches neither medical therapeutics nor ma - teria medica. Bacteriology is also ignored by it. It relies entirely on manipulation of the body by rubbing, pulling and kneading with the hands and fingers, for the treatment of diseases. Its theory is that a large number of ailments are due to irregular nerve action, and that by stimulating or repressing the nerve centers by manipulation they en - able nature herself to right the evil. It does not administer drugs and does not profess to cure all diseases. When a case is presented requiring medication, the osteopath gives way to the physician. Services in kneading and manipula - ting the body are no more the practice of medicine than services in bathing a patient to allay his fever or the in - flammation of a wound. I am of the opinion, therefore, that an osteopath cannot lawfully prescribe or administer drugs of any kind or char - acter, as such acts would constitute the practice of medicine and, under the law of this state, such person would be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof would be subject to a fine of not less than $50 nor more than $300, together with costs of prosecution, for each offense. How - ever, surgery being one of the branches osteopaths are re - quired to know, under the law of this state, it would seem that they can practice this branch, but are prohibited from administering drugs ; and inasmuch as one cannot safely practice surgery without administering a drug, as the law now stands they are not permitted to perform surgical operations without the personal supervision and assistance of a regularly licensed and practicing physician and sur - geon.

Rev. J. Lehmann, Cook, Nebraska. Reverend Sir : In yours of the 20th instant you inquire : "Will you kindly inform me whether a minister living in Iowa could secure a permit for preaching in Nebraska? Our district includes part of Iowa. A change of pulpits between ministers of the two states has been customary. Provided that a minister is an alien enemy but has the name of being thoroughly loyal (having three of his boys in the United States army), provided that he could procure the necessary proof and testimony of his loyalty, could he obtain a permit to occasionally preach in Nebraska?". In response thereto, will say that section 5, chapter 5 of the laws passed at the special session of the legislature of Nebraska, which convened March 26th and adjourned April 8th, 1918, among other things, provides: "No alien enemy shall act as lecturer, priest, preacher, minister, teach - er, editor, publisher or educator in any capacity or by any means, within the state during the present war without first filing an application with the District Court in the county of his residence, setting forth the date of his arrival in the United States, the places where he has resided, what steps, If any, he has taken to become a citizen, together with a showing of what service he has rendered the government since the war was de - clared and obtaining a permit from said court to act as preacher, lectur - er, priest, minister, teacher, editor, publisher or educator. Upon such application being filed, the court shall notify the' State Council of Defense of its pendency together with the date when the same is set for hearing and the State Council of Defense shall be afforded full opportunity to file any counter-showing which they think advisable. If upon such hear - ing a permit is granted, the same shall be revokeable at any time in the discretion of the court." The state has no jurisdiction outside of its geographical boundaries and when the legislature referred to an alien enemy, coming within the act, filing application before the district court in the county of his residence, setting forth the date of his arrival in the United States, the places where he has resided, etc., it thereby excluded from consideration, anv alien enemy who is not a resident of this state. Am </seg>
            <seg id="p322">OPINIONS 205 strengthened in this view by the further statement in the act, which says : "Upon such application being filed, the court shall notify the State Council of Defense of its pendency together with the date when the same is set for hearing and the State Council of Defense shall be afforded full opportunity to file any counter-showing which they think advisable." If an application was made by a minister in New York or San Francisco or any other city in the United States so remote from here it would be physically impossible for the Council to appear, and no adequate provision by the legislature has been made to cover the expenses in so doing, it would make the law of no value or benefit whatever. It must therefore be held, on all the facts by you stated, that so long as the applicant is a resident of another state, the district court would not have jurisdiction to make a finding and thereby grant a permit. The jurisdiction of the court to hear, try and determine those facts is exclu - sive and as the law now stands, must be conformed to. I have no doubt whatever, from your statement, but what the party under consideration is absolutely loyal and if he was a resident of the state at the time of making the ap - plication, the district court in the county of his residence, upon a showing of the facts, as by you detailed, would un - doubtedly grant the permit, but not otherwise.

(Revised Statutes of 1913, section 6942.) In such a case, however, no division of school property is made. Section 6708, Revised Statutes of 1913, makes it the duty of the county superintendent, at the time of forming a new district from one or more districts possessing school prop - erty, to ascertain and determine the amount justly due to such new district from any district or districts out of which it may have been in whole or in part formed. The division of property should be made when the district is divided, or as soon as possible thereafter. After the division, the old district has no authority to use property or funds to which the new one is entitled. Section 6745, Revised Statutes of 1913, provides that the school district officers. shall see that school is actually taught within their district by a licensed teacher, and that : "No district shall receive any portion of the state funds unless school shall have been actually taught therein for the length of time required by this section, provided, in case of epidemic sickness prevailing to such an extent that the school board in any district shall deem it advisable to close any or all schools within the district, or if, on account of the de - struction of the school house, it shall be impossible to continue the school, such closing of the school shall not prevent it from drawing its proper share of the state apportionment."

The general provision relative to the refunding of the indebtedness of a school district, does not authorize such a refund except by exchange of bonds made In cases where the district has been found to be unable to pay its entire bonded indebtedness. There is a special provision in regard to city school districts which provides that the board of education of a city school district may borrow money upon bonds or warrants which they are empowered to issue when authorized so to do by the electors of the district at an election called for that purpose. Hon. W. H. Smith, State Auditor of Public Accounts, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: I have been asked for an opinion as to whether or not a cjty school district operating under arti - cle 22 of the school law may lawfully issue bonds for the purpose of taking up outstanding warrants. The general provision relative to the refunding of the indebtedness of a school district does not authorize such a refund, except by exchange of bonds made in cases where the district has been found to be unable to pay its entire bonded indebtedness. But there is a special provision in regard to city school districts governed by the provisions of article 22 of the school law, which is found in article 6971, Revised Statutes of 1913 as amended by chapter 129, Session Laws of 1917, which provides that the board of education of a city school district governed by the pro - visions of the aforesaid article may borrow money upon bonds or warrants which they are empowered to issue when authorized so to do by the electors of the district at an elec - tion called for that purpose. The special statute places no limitations upon the amount or the purpose for which such bonds shall be issued, except that it shall be for an amount authorized by the electors of the district, and there is, of course, the implied limitation that the issues shall be for some purpose connected with the administration of the schools. In the case of Kockroiv et al v. Whisenand et al, 130 N. W. 287, it was held that the general provision of statute requiring a petition of the electors of the school district </seg>
            <seg id="p325">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 208 to the school district board asking for the submission of the question of voting of school bonds at a district elec r tion would not apply, and that the board could call for such an election without a petition of the electors. Simi - larly, in the case of State v. Barton, 136 N. W. 22 to 36, it is held on page 33 that the general provisions of statute relative to the issuance of school bonds found in sections 2, 3, 4 and 5 of sub-division 15 of the compiled statutes of 1911 would not apply to a city school district of the class of Lincoln. It occurs to me that by a parity of reason the general provisions of statutes relative to the refunding of the in - debtedness of a school district do not apply in the case of a city school district, but that under the special provisions of statute the school board may, when authorized so to do by the electors, issue the refunding bonds of the district to take up valid outstanding warrants. In this connection I call attention to the fact that even if such bonds should be held invalid, but the proceeds de - rived from their sale are used in paying off valid warrants, the purchaser will have recourse against the district to re - cover the amount of warrants paid with the proceeds of the sale of such bonds.

Dear Sir: You submit to this department the follow - ing communication, with reference to the compensation and mileage of members of the legislature for attendance upon the special session, convened March 26th, 1918. "The last, or special, session of the legislature appropriated funds to pay the members for a ten days period at the rate of $10.00 per day. The act did not carry the emergency clause, but is now operative be - cause of the lapse of ninety days since the date of adjournment. Please advise me whether or not, in your opinion, it would be legal, under- the wording of the constitution, for us to issue warrants in payment of the claims filed against this appropriation. The same session appropriated funds out of which to pay mileage to the members at the rate of ten cents per mile. Please advise me whether or not, in your opinion, claims would be legal against this approprtatom also." Section 4 of article 3 of the state constitution provides that : "Both senators and representatives shall each receive pay at the rate of $600 for each regular session of the legislature during their term and ten cents for every mile they shall travel in going to and returning from the place of meeting of the legislature on the most usual route." Section 8 of article 5 provides that : "The governor may, on extraordinary occasions, convene the legis - lature by proclamation, stating therein the purpose for which they are convened and the legislature shall enter upon no business except that for which they are called together." Tt has been held in other jurisdictions under similar con - stitutional provisions or limitations as to compensation, that the legislature may defray the expenses of travel thus incurred, and indeed our own state has held similarly. As to the additional per diem compensation appropri - ated by the legislature in addition to that directly provided by the constitution, there is some question. The construc - tion of the constitution by the legislature evidenced by its action in appropriating the additional per diem compensa - tion, is not at all authoritative, as in the case of the inter - pretation by a legislature of its own acts. </seg>
            <seg id="p327">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 210 If, in this instance, the legislature may authorize this additional compensation and fix the per diem amount, the constitutional provision in this respect would seem to be ghorn largely of its apparent intended force. For these reasons, we are reluctant to recommend that warrants be issued upon the claims in question against this appropria - tion. We would like to recommend the payment of these claims, but out of deference to our views as to the doubt - fulness of their legality, we feel that it is not only proper, luit altogether advisable for all concerned, that the matter l&gt;c -ubmitted to the court.

Any person who is physically able to work and is not engaged in any useful occupation and who refuses employment or remains habit - ually idle when useful employment is obtainable, shall be deemed guilty of sedition. A. S. Moon, Esq., County Attorney of Loup County, Tay - lor, Nebraska. Dear Sir : In your favor of the 30th ultimo you say : "I have been acting under the theory that persons who were traveling about with a wagon selling patent medicines, and those who were going about with the ordinary medicine shows are not engaged in useful em - ployment. The proprietor of a medicine show claims that he is in the same class as the people who are employed by the chautauqua corporations, that they both put on vaudeville for the same purpose of attracting a crowd and reaping in the shekels. Now I am of the opinion that there is con - siderable merit in what he says, and I desire to administer affairs in an entirely impartial manner, and although it might be that the latter named class were engaged in a more useful occupation than the medi - cine shows, yet I would like your opinion as to whether or not their occupation is useful in such a way as to clear them under the sedition act.

Am also just in receipt of a letter from Mr. A. K. Holmes of your city touching the same matter, and in which he says, among other things : "The Jones Chautauqua System is scheduled to open here Saturday August 10th next. Our county attorney announced yesterday that he would arrest them under the new sedition statute, and would also get the local chautauqua committee into the toils of the law if the chautauqua people are permitted to appear. His contention is, non-essential em - ployment. We wish to know just as promptly as possible whether there has been any adjudication, or interpretation of that statute, that offers any legal grounds for such an application of it. Has the State Council of Defense made any ruling that would govern in such an instance? Have you any statement of the Federal government's position on the chautauqua question in general? County Attorney Moon was appointed recently by the county board in compliance with recommendations from the State Council and the Governor. We had been getting along here for several months without a county attorney. By the same style of threats to the village board, Mr. Moon is stopping a stock company show that were billing the town for next week. Please do not ignore this letter, as local interest is running high, and we think the principle involved is one of considerable importance." It is quite evident from the foregoing that there is a wide difference of opinion as to what is useful or non-useful oc - cupation. At the recent session of our state legislature a bill was passed which became a law and which is known as chapter 5 of the laws of Nebraska of the Thirty-sixth Ses - sion, being a special session of the legislature, which ad - journed April 2, 1918; the part under consideration now being sections 1 and m, which are a part of section 1 and read as follows: Section 1. Sedition defined — If any person with intent to obstruct, hinder, delay, discourage, hamper, or otherwise interfere with the effici - ent prosecution of the war in which the government of the United States is now engaged shall: • * » * </seg>

Any person so offending shall be deemed guilty of sedition and upon conviction thereof shall be fined in any sum not to exceed ten thousand dollars, or be imprisoned in the county jail or in the state penitentiary for any period not to exceed twenty years." "Sec. 2. Abettors — Whoever shall aid. abet or procure any person to commit any of the acts mentioned in Section 1 shall upon conviction thereof be fined in any amount or imprisoned for any period of time for which the principal offender could be fined or imprisoned for the princi - pal offense." Section 7 of the same act provides : "State Council of Defense aid in enforcing Act. — The State Council of Defense shall aid and assist in the enforcement of this act, and, in the performance of such duties, shall have authority to furnish inform - ation of any violation of the provisions of this act that may come to their attention or possession to the proper county attorney or other prose - cuting officer." As you state, it is clearly a question of fact. Before any legal action could be commenced successfully it must nec - essarily appear that the person or individuals arrested were physically able to work and had refused employment or had remained habitually idle, assuming, of course, that useful employment is certainly obtainable. And then the qnestions arise: First, what are the parties referred to engaged in? Second, is it a useful occupation? From all the facts by you stated and also those contained in the letter of Mr. Holmes, as yet no case has been pre - sented which would warrant a prosecution, but this does not mean that facts might not develop which would warrant you taking action upon the question of a useful occupation. In my opinion that is clearly a question for the jury in the light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding the same. With the strenuous demand for labor in all of the va - rious war activities, it seems inconceivable that those who are physically able to work could be induced to embark in an occupation which is not a useful one at the present time.

Attorney General District Paving Bonds — Payment The city of Lincoln may issue valid district paving bonds without in - corporating in them a provision making them payable at the option of the city at any interest paying date. Hon. W. H. Smith, State Auditor of Public Accounts, Lin - coln, Nebraska.

You inquire whether in view of the above quoted provi - sion the city of Lincoln may issue valid district paving bonds without incorporating in them a provision making them payable at the option of the city at any interest - paying date. In my opinion it may. I think the city exercises the op - tion conferred when it issues the bonds without providing that their payments shall be optional at any interest pay - ing date. You will note that the language of the statute under con- </seg>

Even if it should be held that the statute pro - vides that district paving bonds shall be payable at the op - tion of the city at any interest paying date, the failure to include the provision for optional payments in the bonds would not invalidate them. (See Independent School Dis - trict of Ackley r. Hall, 113 U. S. 135.) The bonds involved in that case were issued pursuant to lawful authority and under a statute which provided that they should be pay - able at the pleasure of the district at any time before due. The bonds themselves did not contain this provision. It was held they were valid obligations and their collection could be enforced. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, Attorney General. By GEORGE W.

County boards are authorized to use the motor vehicle registration fund in connection with the state aid road fund, for the construction and maintenance of permanent roads. Hon. George E. Johnson, State Engineer, Lincoln, Ne - braska. Dear Sir: We are pleased to answer your inquiry per - taining to section 8 of chapter 185 of the 1917 laws, and section 3045 of the 1913 statutes as amended by chapter 61 of the 1915 laws. The former provides |kat : "Any county desiring to use a greater sum of money upon the roads within the county than is made available under the provisions of this act and the Federal Aid Road Act of July 11, 1916, may use other avail - able county road funds or proceed to vote upon the question of issuing bonds or making a special levy." Your inquiry is whether under this provision the fund created by motor vehicle registration fees, under section 3045 as amended by chapter 61 of the 1915 laws, may, by the uuru ao aiiiciiucu uj i uaj^ici \jj~ \jl iuc ijau lamo, way , vy tuc county board, be transferred to the county road fund and used pursuant to section 8 of chapter 185 of the 1917 laws. </seg>
            <seg id="p332">OPINIONS 215 In this connection, section 3045, before the amendment in 1915, should be observed. The section then provided that these motor vehicle registration fees should be paid to the county treasurer and credited "to the county road fund for the construction and maintenance of permanent roads." The limitation thus placed upon the use of this fund was unsatisfactory as evidenced by the amendment of the statute in 1915 and the repeal of the 1913 provision. The reference in the 1915 amendment to the county road dragging fund, is somewhat confusing since that section in the 1913 statutes placed the registration fees in the county road fund. Section 2931 of the 1913 statutes, created the "county dragging fund," which fund was to be created by a special levy and into which the motor vehicle registration fees, did not go, but by section 3045, as it existed prior to 1915, such fees went into a county road fund. The provi - sion in section 3045 as amended in 1915, providing that these registration fees should go into the "road dragging fund of the county," would seem to be in conflict with the general purpose of the law were it not that this 1915 amend - ment provides that these registration fees, when credited by Ihe county treasurer to the road dragging fund of the county ".shall be used by the county board for road drag - ging, paving, repairing paving, oiling or strawing sandy roads and for no other purpose." Notwithstanding the confliction in the statutes, the pur - pose of section 8 in chapter 185 of the 1917 laws is definite and should be held to amend, by implication at least, the former statutes conflicting therewith. We are therefore of the opinion that this section of the 1917 laws referred to, authorizes the county boards to use the motor vehicle reg - istration funds in connection with the State Aid Road Fund provided for in said chapter 185. The term "available" in section 8 of the chapter should be interpreted in connec - tion with the provision in the 1915 amendment of section 3045 as to the uses of this registration fund.

Robert E. Waters, Esq., County Clerk of Custer County, Broken Bow, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire with reference to the provision in chapter 6 of the laws and resolutions enacted at the special session of the legislature, with reference to pro - viding funds for furnishing equipment for the Home Guard. The statute provides that : "The county board of any county may at its discretion furnish such Home Guard as shall have been mustered in and accepted by the com - mander-in-chief, within said county, with such arms, supplies and equip - ment as shall have been designated by the governor, and such boards are hereby expressly authorized to include an amount for that purpose in their estimate of county expense and levy for taxes, or pay said ex - pense out of the general fund of the county." You will observe that it is discretionary with the county board as to defraying the expense of the home guard equip - ment and also discretionary whether to defray such ex - pense from the general fund or by a special assessment. Inadequacy of the general fund for such purpose would, of course, be a ground for the special assessment. The time has gone by for such an expense to be included in the estimate as provided by the 6th paragraph in sec - tion 954 of the 1913 statutes. Under that section the ex - pense can be included in the levy and the levy will be valid, as you will observe, but there is a penal liability that might attach to the members of the board in such respect. The law with reference to the Home Guard was not en - acted in time for the annual estimate made by the county board, and it is a special law that should have precedence over the general law referred to.

The (act that a corporation whose property is by law exempt from tax - ation, acquires title to real estate' upon which taxes are due, does not cancel such taxes. Mr. 0. E. Bernecker, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir : You submit to this department a letter of in - quiry written to you by Mr. Ernest Frisch, county clerk of Clay county, asking whether real property belonging to cemetery associations, churches, etc., is exempted from taxes lawfully assessed, against same prior to the time the corporation whose property is exempt by law acquired such property. In my opinion the fact that a corporation whose property is by law exempt from taxation acquires title to real estate upon which taxes are due, does not cancel such taxes. The rule is that "where an institution, such as a church or school, enjoys an exemption from taxes on all the property which it may acquire and hold, still it must assume the pay - ment of taxes assessed for the current fiscal year on any property which it purchases or acquires otherwise." 37 Cyc. 897. "Under Code — and Laws — exempting from taxation property owned by a religious society used for religious purposes, lands purchased by a church for religious purposes after a lien for the taxes of the then cur - rent year has attached is acquired subject to, and not exempt from, such lien, and a sale thereof for such taxes will be valid."

The statutes relating to the motor vehicle registration fund do not con - template that the motor vehicle fees shall be used for the improve - ment of streets generally, in incorporated cities or villages, but only in connection with county and state roads. John M. Cotton, Esq., County Attorney of Brown County, Atnsivorth, Neb. Dear Sir : Your letter of the 22nd instant received. You inquire whether the city of Ainsworth is entitled to any portion of the motor vehicle registration fees for use on the streets of the city. Chapter 64 of the 1917 laws provides that these motor vehicle registration fees shall be paid to the county treasurer and by him turned into the road dragging fund of the county to be used by the county board of said county "for road dragging, paving, repair - ing paving, oiling, strawing, claying or stable littering sandy roads and for no other purpose." The 1913 law provided that these fees should be used by the county board for the building and repairing of perma - nent roads in the county. The 1915 law directed that these fees should be paid into the road dragging fund, but desig - nated the use of this money. The road dragging fund was created in 1913 and provided for a small special levy for that purpose alone. It seems strange that the motor ve - hicle registration fees should be placed in the road drag - ging fund without a direction for such moneys to be used for general road purposes. Recently we have held that section 8 of chapter 185 of the 1917 laws under the state aid road fund act authorized the transfer of these motor vehicle fees from the road drag - ging fund to the state aid road fund when such fees were not needed in the road dragging fund, and one reason is, the motor vehicle fees in the road dragging fund may be used for the same purpose as the funds under the state aid road act. We do not think the statutes on the subject contemplate that the motor vehicle fees shall be used for the improve - ment of streets generally in incorporated cities or villages, </seg>

No political party can be compelled to present as its candidate at a general election, one who does not affiliate with the party so pre - senting him as a candidate.

It is true that decision was rendered before section 2158, Revised Statutes of 1913, was amended by chapter 35, Session Laws of 1917, but you will observe that the amend - ment passed in 1917 did not broaden in any way the quali - fications of a candidate for a partisan nomination.

Ordinance Forbidding Speaking of Any Foreign Language is Invalid An ordinance which forbids the speaking of any language other than English upon the streets or in any public place in a village, is in - valid. Mr. Geo. G. Crilly, Campbell, Nebraska Dear Sir: With your letter of the 28th instant you en - close copy of a proposed ordinance which forbids the speak - ing of any language other than English, upon the streets or in any public place in the village of Campbell, and in - quire whether such ordinance, if passed, will be valid. Permit me to say in answer to your question, that in my opinion such an ordinance will not be valid. Villages and other municipal corporations of the state have only such powers in the passage of ordinances as are given to them by statute, either expressly or by necessary implication, and I find nothing in the statute law of this state which </seg>
            <seg id="p338">OPINIONS 221 clothes a village or any other municipal subdivision of the state, for that matter, with power to forbid the speaking of any foreign language within the corporate limits of the municipality. It will be observed that the proposed ordinance, if passed, will forbid the speaking of French and Italian as well as the language of the countries with which we are at war. As applied to the subjects of countries with which we are now allied, the ordinance would probably be invalid as being in contravention of our treaty relations with those countries, but irrespective of that fact and speaking in a broad sense, I am of the opinion as has heretofore been stated, that the village board lacks the power to pass a valid ordinance forbidding the speaking of any foreign language whatever within the corporate limits of the vil - lage. Prudence and public policy will, no doubt, in the near future, prompt those of foreign birth to desist as far as possible, in the use of their native language. Very respectfully, WILLIS. E.

Certificates of Birth and Death — Registration Fee Registrars in metropolitan cities and cities of the first class are entitled to receive a fee of twenty-five cents for each certificate of birth or death furnished by them to the state registrar. Frank Peterson, Esq., County Attorney of Lancaster Coun ty, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You call my attention to the provisions of section 2751, Revised Statutes of 1913, which provides that the local registrars shall receive a fee of 25c for each cer - tificate of birth or death furnished by them to the state registrar, and further provides that "local registrars in cities of the metropolitan and first classes shall receive no </seg>

You inquire whether or not in the opinion of this office the registrars in metropolitan cities and cities of the first class are entitled to receive the compensation allowed by law to other registrars for certificates of birth or death. In answer to the question which you propound I will say that although the statute is somewhat ambiguous, am of the opinion that they are entitled to receive the same fees for such services as other local registrars receive. You will note that section 2750 provides that "in cities of the metropolitan and first classes the local registrar may forward duplicate certificates in place of the originals." 1 am of the opinion that the legislature intended by the provision of the statute under consideration to provide that local registrars in cities of the metropolitan and first classes should receive no additional compensation for making out and forwarding duplicate certificates, or for the perform - ance of any other duties devolving upon them by virtue of the provision of the vital statistics law, rather than to bar them from receiving the same fees that other registrars re - ceived for forwarding certificates of birth or death to the state registrar. I am informed that the construction here given to the section of statute under consideration has been the con - struction given it by the officers charged with its execution ever since its passage in 1905. If this be true it furnishes an added reason why that construction should be adhered to. "Where the meaning of a statute is dubious, long usage is a just medi - um by which to expound it."

            <seg id="p341">224 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL / Crossings or Approaches from Highway to Residences — Replacing Same — County Not Liable It ia not Incumbent upon, the county or highway authorities to replace or rebuild crossings or approaches to residences, when changes are necessitated by highway improvement. Hon. George E. Johnson, State Engineer, Lincoln, Ne - braska. Dear Sir: Your communication received referring to private crossings or approaches from the highway to resi - dences or premises along the highway. It seems that in many cases of highway improvements, particularly the permanent improvements under the fed - eral and state aid road law, it is necessary to provide for drainage along the highway, which frequently interferes with the approaches to the residences and premises along the highway, and the question has arisen as to whether it is the duty of the county board or highway authorities to build or replace such crossings when interfered with in carrying out such improvements. The owner of property along the highway has, of course, the right of entrance and exit to and from his property, but subject to the public use of the highway and necessary highway improvements as they may from time to time arise. An adjoining owner cannot acquire a prescriptive right to maintain a crossing in any particular manner and it would not seem to be the duty of the county or highway authorities to provide such crossings or rebuild them when interfered with by necessary highway improvements. When the county acquires the highway by grant or con - demnation, it acquires the right to improve such highway as necessity may require from time to time. In Churchill v. Beethe, 48 Neb. 87, similar questions were considered. There, the court said "The proceedings by which a highway is opened call for a settlement and payment of all damages which may arise from such proper construc - tion and maintenance of the highway, taking into consideration such fills, cuts, ditches, and culverts as a proper construction and maintenance may require." </seg>
            <seg id="p342">OPINIONS 225 And the court said" further that when the improvement is "reasonably necessary to a proper maintenance of the road, damages consequent from such construction being presumed to have been satisfied when the highway was opened." So it would seem that it is not incumbent upon the county or the highway authorities to replace or rebuild the crossings when changes of them are necessitated by highway improvement. Evidently the county board or the highway authorities have the authority to prescribe the manner in which such crossings shall be constructed and maintained commensurate with the proper maintenance of the highway. There might need to be a somewhat different ruling in cases where the adjoining owner has not parted with or retains the title to the land in the highway oppo - site his premises by having granted a right of way only over his premises, but we do not understand that your in - quiry contemplates that condition. The class of perma - nent highway improvements under the recent state and federal acts which particularly come under the jurisdiction of your department contemplates absolute control of the highway where such improvements are carried out. Should the county board or the highway authorities, however, elect to put in drains and build these crossings in order that bet - ter drainage and uniformity may be obtained, they evi - dently may do so, but we fail to see wherein the county is required to do this under our present highway laws. Our courts have frequently passed upon questions similar to that contained in your inquiry and the interpretation of these laws on those occasions seem to necessitate the posi - tion herein taken.

Machinery necessary for the work of general road improvement, if not supplied by the county from the general fund, may be purchased out of the road dragging fund derived from motor vehicle fees. Mr. H. P. Schmidt, County Highway Commissioner, Friend, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire of this department whether the road dragging fnnd may be used for the purchase of road machinery. In 191 3, the legislature provided for a levy of not to exceed one mill for a "county dragging fund," the use of which was to be confined to road dragging. That provision is now sections 2931 and 2932 of the Revised Statutes for 1913. In 1911, the legislature provided that certain of the mo - tor vehicle registration fees should be paid into the county road fund for the construction and maintenance of perma - nent roads. In 1915, a new motor vehicle law was enacted, chapter 61 of the laws of that year, which repealed the for - mer law and provided that certain of the motor vehicle fees of the county should go to the road dragging fund of the county to be used for "road dragging, paving, repairing </seg>
            <seg id="p344">OPINIONS 227 paving, oiling or strawing sandy roads and for no other purpose." This law was re-enacted with almost no change by chapter 64 of the 1917 laws. The original road dragging law provided that road drags and machinery should be supplied from the general road fund of the county. In many instances, monies have accumulated in the road dragging funds beyond the needs for dragging purposes and there is a quite general mistaken understanding that the use of the road dragging fund is confined entirely to road dragging, while under the road dragging law since 1915, this fund, and particularly that part of it derived from motor vehicle fees, may be used for paving, repairing paving and other road improvements so that it may be said that such fund may be used now for general road improve - ment. Since such fund is a considerable fund and ade - quate for extensive road improvement, it would seem to follow that machinery necessary for such work, if not sup - plied by the county from the general fund and particularly in the case of inadequacy of the general fund, may be pur - chased from this road dragging fund. Another view might be taken, as we have suggested in a case of a surplus of money in the road dragging fund. Such surplus under sections 1097 and 1098 of the statutes might be transferred to the general county fund. Recently under chapter 185 of the 1917 laws pertaining to state and federal aid road improvement and providing that other county road funds not needed may be transferred to the federal and state aid road fund, we held that un - needed and surplus money in the road dragging fund, de - rived from motor vehicle fees, might be transferred to such federal and state aid road fund as provided in chapter 185 of the 1917 laws. Road development has become a great public necessity and all monies intended for such purpose should be utilized by county authorities to the fullest extent and for the great - est accomplishment.

If the mayor and councilmen are unable to obtain firemen, policemen or other officers to discharge the duties enjoined upon the city and Its public officers to do and perform, at the salary designated and fixed by the legislature, then upon complaint of a tax payer that certain protection has not been provided, and the mayor and councilmen answer thereto that the only compensation which they could offer and had offered was that which was designated by statute and for which individuals would not work, then the court should direct them to employ the necessary assistants irrespective of the statute. Mr. Ed P. Smith, Mayor, Omaha, Neb. My Dear Mayor: In yours of the 27th ultimo you say that": "Every person in Omaha who has given the matter any consideration agrees that many of our policemen and firemen are receiving wholly inadequate compensation. The city commissioners would be only too glad to raise their pay if they felt they had the power to do it." You inquire: "Wish you would give me your opinion as to whether or not the council has the power to declare that an emergency now exists which would justify them in any manner in voting an increase in the pay of these officers, without waiting for a new charter to be adopted and become effective. * * * Is there any way you can point out to me by which provision can be made for these men at this time?" Answering, will say : Chapter 77 of the Session Laws of 1915 amended the same section as it formerly appeared in the Revised Statutes of 1913, and made a slight increase in the compensation to be paid certain officers. Chapter 97 of the same session laws also provides for an increase in compensation of certain municipal officials and leaves dis - cretionary with the mayor and councilmen under certain circumstances respecting compensation of other employes of the city. If one is restricted and confined to the literal wording of the sections and chapters referred to except for services not specified in the act and which you have the power by ordinance to determine, alter or change, as provided in section 4179, it might be doubted whether you could do so or not. See also section 4177, which provides that : </seg>
            <seg id="p346">OPINIONS 229 "No officer shall, directly or Indirectly, be allowed any further or great - er compensation for his official services than is allowed herein, nor shall any officer named herein take or receive therefor, directly or indirectly, any further or greater compensation for such services, than is provided as aforesaid. All claims of employees or appointees for extra compen - sation overtime or traveling expenses shall be presented as a claim against the city and shall not be included in the salary appropriation ordinances." The next section provides "If any such officer shall violate any of the foregoing provisions of this chapter, or if any member of the council shall vote for any further allowance to any officer whose salary is fixed by this chapter, or to the members of the council, the same shall constitute malfeasance in office and be deemed a misdemeanor." And to the same effect is section 4378, of the Revised Statutes of 1913. Chapter 46 of the Revised Statutes of 1913 was enacted, passed and became a law for the better "care, manage - ment and control" of cities containing a population of over 100,000, and innumerable numbers of duties were enjoined upon the mayor and council, many of which are specifically pointed out. In addition thereto section 4089 provides: "When by this chapter the power is conferred upon the mayor and council to do and perform any act or thing, and the manner of exercis - ing such power is not specially pointed out, the mayor and council may provide by ordinance the details necessary for the full exercise of such power." Section 4091, under the title "Additional Powers," pro - vides that: "In addition to the powers herein granted, cities governed by this chapter shall have power by ordinance: to levy special taxes and provide for expenses," etc. Section 4096 is : "To adopt all such measures as they may deem necessary for the accomodation and protection of strangers and the traveling public in person and property." Section 4130 is as follows: "The mayor and council shall have the care, management and control of the city, its property and finances, and shall have power to pass, !2ag </seg>
            <seg id="p347">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 230 amend or repeal any and all ordinances necessary or proper to execute or carry Into effect any of the provisions hereof, or any of the powers herein granted, except as otherwise provided herein." The main object and purpose of chapter 46 was to im - prove and better safeguard the citizens and general public, and that power rests in the mayor and councilmen. It is a duty enjoined upon them from which they may not es - cape without being derelict in their duty and subject to re - moval from office. Minor sections conflicting against the plain purpose and consideration of the act cannot be per - mitted to stand. If the city is unable to obtain firemen, policemen or any other officer to discharge the duties enjoined upon the city and its public officers to do and perform at the salary des - ignated and fixed bii thr legislature, then, upon complaint of a taxpayer and citizen that the mayor and councilmen had failed and neglected to provide certain protection, stat - ing specifically the facts, to the citizens and property hold - ers within said city, as well as all the general public, and that you be mandamused to provide the necessary pro - tection as enjoined upon you by the said act, and upon your answer thereto that the only compensation which you could offer and had offered was that which was designated by - statute, and individuals would not work for such compen - sation, the court would no doubt direct you to employ the necessary assistance, irrespective of the statute, until the same could be changed by legislative authority, and under such circumstances neither yourself nor any member of the council would be violating the law. On the contrary, you would be obeying its plain mandate to provide suitable care, management and control of said city. It is possible that without, such a suit special assistants might be appointed by you and the council and their com - pensation fixed by ordinance. These must necessarily be designated as special employes and not those specifically mentioned in the statute. In either event, however, the only safe course for all parties concerned would be to have an order of the court until the charter has been changed and taken effect. Very respectfully, WILLIS. E.

            <seg id="p349">232 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Dear Sir: You submit to me a letter written to you by your county clerk and ask for an opinion upon the follow - ing questions therein propounded: "In the coming election on November 5th, 1918, are the women allowed to vote? If the women are allowed to vote shall their ballots be placed in the same ballot box with the ballots of men? If they are not allowed to place theirs in the same ballot box. must we furnish a double set of ballot boxes for the women ballots; that is, where there is a double election board must we furnish two boxes for the gen - eral ballot and two boxes for the Non-Partisan ballot? In the coming election if the women vote what officers are they allowed to vote for? Must we furnish a separate ballot for them with only the officers they are allowed to vote for?" 1. It is impossible to determine definitely at this time whether women may vote or not at the coming November election. Chapter 30, laws of Nebraska, 1917, confers upon women with the requisite age and residence qualifications a qualified right of suffrage. A petition has been filed, how - ever, with the secretary of state requesting that the statute conferring such right be referred to the electors at the com - ing November election for their decision. The Constitution provides that in such cases the operation of the act re - ferred is suspended until it has been passed upon by the voters. (Sec, 1. C. article 3 of Constitution.) If the peti - tion to refer the act in question to the voters has been signed by the requisite number of qualified electors, the operation of the law conferring a limited right of suffrage upon women is held in abeyance and women may not vote at the coming November election.

The county clerk, in the preparation of non-partisan ballots, is prohibited from printing on such ballots the post-office address or residence of the candidates. Chapter 37, Session Laws of 1917, provides for the rotation of the names of candidates for judicial and educational offices on the general as well as the primary ballot. The county clerk should distribute the ballots so as to prevent one candi - date from obtaining any advantage over the others by having his name appear more frequently at the top of the list of candidates. In the preparation of non-partisan ballots, the county clerk is not com - pelled to follow the order in which the names appear on the certifi - cate of the secretary of state. Attorney of Dawson County, Dear Sir: Answering your inquiries of October 7, in the order in which they are propounded, I will say: "1. In performing the official duty to prepare and distribute the sep - arate ballots for the election of judicial and educational officers, has the county clerk any authority to print or use ballots giving the post-office address or residence of the candidates?"

Said chapter 37, Session Laws of 1917, provides for the rotation of the names of candidates for judicial and educa - tional offices on the general as well as the primary ballot and directs: "The form shall be set up by the printer with the names in the order in which they are placed on the ballot by the county clerk or other offi - cial, whose duty it shall be to have the ballot prepared, and in printing the ballot for the various election districts or precincts, the position of the name in each office division shall be changed for each election dis - trict or precinct. In making the change of position the printer shall take the line of type containing the name at the head of the form in such office division, and for each election district or precinct, and place it at the bottom, shoving up the column so that the name in each office divis - ion for each election district or precinct that was second before the change shall be first after the change." In my judgment it is mandatory upon the printer to ro - tate the names of candidates upon said ballots, but inas - much as the law requires the county clerk to prepare the ballot, and print or cause the same to be printed, it would be advisable for the county clerk to instruct the printer to ro - tate the names of the candidates. "3. In distributing among the voting precincts the separate ballots for the election of judicial and educational officers, may the county clerk consider the legislative purpose to prevent one candidate from obtaining an advantage over the others by having his name appear more frequently at the top of the list of candidates?" • In giving effect to the above quoted provision from chap - ter 37, Session Laws of 1917, the county clerk should inter- </seg>
            <seg id="p352">OPINIONS 235 pret it as will comport with what is supposed to have been the purpose of the legislature, and I believe he would be justified in distributing the ballots so as to prevent one candidate from obtaining an advantage over the others by having his name appear more frequently at the top of the list of candidates. "4. Is the county clerk, in preparing and distributing ballots for the election of judicial and educational officers, obliged to follow the order in which the names of candidates appear on the certificate of the secre - tary of state?" Our court has held in Woods v. State, 44 Neb., 430 "Some discretion is conferred upon the officer charged with the prep - aration of the official ballot, such as the arrangement thereon of party names and in other respects not inconsistent with the spirit and purpose of the law, and the exercise of such discretion will not be controlled by the court." Therefore, I believe the county clerk, in the preparation of the non-partisan ballots, is not compelled to follow the order in which the names appear on the certificate of the secretary of state.

In the event the chairman of the board of village trustees becomes in - toxicated frequently, it is the duty of the county attorney, as a public officer, to act and make no charge therefor, other than the regular compensation he receives as county attorney. Any expense incurred in the prosecution must be paid by the county. Hon. Louis Lightner, Deputy and Acting County Attorney, Columbus, Nebraska.

Is the prosecution of said proceedings one of my duties as County Attorney, or is it a matter for which I would be entitled to make a charge?" Answering, will say : Assuming the facts by you stated to be true, it becomes your duty, as a public officer, to act and make no charge therefor, other than the regular com - pensation as county attorney. Of course, any expenses which you incur must be paid by the county in the first instance, that is to say, you are to be reimbursed for any cash outlay or expense which you incur in the way of the prosecution. I regard the same as clearly within the provisions of the act referred to. Very respectfully, WILLIS. E. REED, October 16, 1918. Attorney General. County Judge — Candidates. There can be but two candidates for the office of county judge, when but one is to be elected. If one candidate withdraws and requests that he be not considered a candidate, then the person first filing a petition to supply the vacancy may be considered a candidate in lieu of the one withdrawing. Any subsequent petitions must be disre - garded for there must be but the two candidates at the general elec - tion. Where the candidate goes upon the ballot by petition, the words, "by petition" shall not appear thereon. Mrs. Mabel C. Penrod, County Clerk of Gage County, Beat rice, Neb. Dear Madam: In response to your favor of the 16th instant, in which you say: "The facts are these: F. W. Messmore a nominee for county judge has withdrawn as a candidate and requested that his name not be printed on the ballot on account of his having received a commission through the officers training school, which he has been attending. I now have two petitions on file, each signed by the required number of qualified voters of the county with a possibility of a third being filed before night. </seg>
            <seg id="p354">OPINIONS 237 Shall I recognize the petitions and fill the vacancy caused by the with drawal? Would it be legal to put more than two names on the ticket when they have the privilege to vote for only one? If not, what method should I pursue in selecting the one to fill the vacancy?" Answering will say: Section 2211 of the Revised Stat - utes of Nebraska for 1913, provides: "After said primary election, held as aforesaid, the county clerk or other official whose duty it is to prepare the official ballot for the gen - eral election to be held in this state, shall prepare a separate ballot similar and substantially in the same general form and the names ro - tated on said ballot as hereinbefore provided for in this article for the nomination of judicial officers at the primary election; and said county clerk or other official shall place on said separate ballot, in each office division, tirice as many names as there are places to be filled at the said general election. Said names shall be the names of the persons who received the highest number of votes for the office for which they were candidates in the primary. If more than one person was a candidate for the same judicial position in the primary and the county clerk or other official, in preparing the separate official ballot for the general election, shall place thereon the names of the two persons who received the highest number of votes in said primary for the position for which they were candidates; but in no event shall the names of the official ballot in each office division be more than twice the number of offices to be filled at the said general election. The candidate or candidates receiv - ing the highest number of votes at said general election shall be declared duly elected to the office or offices for which they were candidates". The object and purpose of the non-partisan judiciary act was to eliminate as far as possible the mischief which had grown up throughout the state and elsewhere by rea - son of bitter partisanship and the general public, became convinced that justice did not always prevail through the courts, and that individuals might be more free to act when discharging a public trust, the non-partisan judiciary act was urged and finally adopted. Yet in so doing, that indi - viduals might not be required to accept one person only, there was to be an opportunity for an individual to make a selection between at least two candidates at the primary and two at the general election. It appears that two were nominated at "your primary; and that one has withdrawn for good and sufficient reasons. You are directed to place </seg>
            <seg id="p355">238 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL upon the ballot for the general election, as provided in sec - tion 2211, the names of two persons because there is but one office to be filled. You state that a third petition may be tendered to you. The third petition cannot be considered. One regular nom - inee and the petition of the first one petitioning to supply the vacancy caused by the withdrawal of the candidacy of Mr. Messmore, in my judgment, is the only candidate whose name can appear properly upon the official ballot. Referring to the latter part of section 2211, it says : "In all other respects the general laws in force in this state respecting the holding, conducting and declaring the results of any such general election shall apply so far as the same are applicable and not inconsis - tent with the provisions of this article." Section 2140 permits the filing of a name of a candidate by petition, but in the event of there being more than one petition, it would be inconsistent with the non-partisan ju - diciary act under the facts by you stated, that is to say. there must not be but two candidates at the general elec - tion. Any other subsequent petitions not only may be, but must be disregarded by you. Under the non-partisan judiciary act where the candi - date goes upon the ballot by petition, the words "by peti - tion" should not appear thereon because the same would be inconsistent with the form of ballot provided by the act itself. The rule of construction is to construe all acts of the legislature that they may carry out the intent of the legislators if that can be determined, and that it may be consistent and in the event of an election give the people an opportunity of expression without denying their valuable right of franchise, and this can be done in this instance by printing the name of the party who was first to file his pe - tition, which, I take it, was proper in form and number of names, etc., in lieu of and to take the place of the vacancy caused by the withdrawal of the regular nominee at the primary election.

            <seg id="p356">OPINIONS 239 School Bonds — May Be Issued to Compromise Indebtedness. School bonds issued in compromise of indebtedness, may only be issued under the authority of statute in cases where the district is unable to pay its indebtedness in full, and satisfactory arrangements can be made with its creditors for discounting or compromising its in - debtedness. Such bonds when issued, are not sold on the market by the district but are turned over to the holders of the original in - debtedness in satisfaction of their claims. Hon. William H. Smith, Auditor of Public Accounts. Lin coin, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You say that a consolidated school district in Scott s Bluff county recently voted an issue of bonds for the purpose of constructing a school house and that said bonds have been refused registration because of an ex - cessive issue, the amount voted being more than 12 per cent of the assessed valuation of the district. You state further that, assuming there would be no question about the sale of the bonds voted, the district board entered into a contract for the construction of a school house which has been built and the district, although anxious to do so, finds itself without money to pay for same. You inquire whether under such circumstances compromise bonds may be is - sued to take up all of said indebtedness as well as other outstanding indebtedness of the district under the provi - sions of sections 400 to 404 both inclusive, Revised Statutes of 1913. In answer to the question which you propound, I will say that bonds in compromise of indebtedness may only be is - sued under the authority of the sections of statute above cited in cases where the district is unable to pay its indebt - edness in full and satisfactory arrangements can be made with its creditors for scaling, discounting or compromising its indebtedness. And when such bonds are issued, they are not sold on the market by the district as other school district bonds are, but are turned over to the holders of the original indebtedness in satisfaction of their respective claims. The indebtedness which may be paid by the issue and delivery of compromise bonds is doubtless, a valid in - debtedness, one on which if not paid, judgment may be ob - tained against the school district. It is very doubtful whether a claim for the contract price of the school bouse </seg>
            <seg id="p357">240 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL in the instant case comes within that class. In the case of School District v. Stough, 4 Neb. 357, the supreme court of this state laid down the rule that: "Contracts for the erection of a school house should be made with reference to the funds in the treasury for that purpose." The decision in that case has been cited with approval in subsequent cases. In the instant case the contract was not made with reference to a fund in the treasury nor with ref - erence to a fund to be raised by taxes levied although not yet collected. It was made in contemplation of the sale of bonds which were afterwards rightfully refused registration on the ground that they were excessive in amount. Under such circumstances the contract for the construction of the school house was clearly invalid and inasmuch as it was a contract which the district had no power to make in the first instance, it may well be doubted whether the district, as the law now stands, has power to ratify it in any event. It follows in my opinion, that any taxpayer of said dis - trict might enjoin, if he chose to do so, the registration of compromise bonds issued to pay off the indebtedness for the contract price of such school house. I may add that I doubt whether the original holders of such bonds could en - force the payment as against the district for they would hardly be innocent purchasers. A different question would be presented, however, if such bonds containing recitals of the facts necessary to make their issue valid, should be sold to an innocent third party. In such a case, I think it very probable that the bonds could be collected by the innocent purchaser. In the case of City of Huron v. Second Ward Savings Bank, 86 Fed. 272, it is said : "A municipal corporation is estopped from defending an action by an innocent purchaser to collect its negotiable bonds which recite that they were issued for the purpose of funding the bonds, warrants, or floating debt of the corporation, either on the ground that the warrants or bonds which they were issued to satisfy were void, or -that the apparent debt which they were issued to pay was fictitious." "Where an innocent purchaser buys, of others than the municipality or its agents, negotiable bonds which recite that they were issued to </seg>
            <seg id="p358">OPINIONS 241 fund the debt or obligations of the municipality, the purchaser may rest on the legal presumption that the legal method was adopted; that the issue of the bonds did not increase the debt of the municipality, and he is not required to consider or inquire concerning the question of excessive indebtedness."

Certificate of Deposit — When Payable. A certificate of deposit becomes payable at the time specified therein. The fact that the holder of the certificate transfers the same to another bank does not in any manner change the legal status inso far as the payment of the certificate is concerned. Mr. W. J. Root, Cashier American State Bank, Sutherland Nebraska. Dear Sir : In yours of the 26th instant you make inquiry "Will you kindly inform me if a certificate of deposit issued by a state bank in Nebraska, made payable 12 months from date and bearing 5% interest must be paid at any time prior to the expiration of the time specified if presented for the face amount of the certificate. The case in point is where we issued a certificate of deposit payable in 12 months with 5% interest. The certificate was turned in through another bank who presented it for payment, and we sent it back as it was not due. They are insisting that we must pay the certificate at any time if they do not demand the interest." A certificate of deposit becomes payable at the time speci - fied therein. If the party to whom the certificate had been issued had declined to surrender the certificate to you at any time before the 12 months upon a tender of the face of the certificate, or of the face of the certificate plus the in - terest due at the time of the tender, you could not have re - quired the holder of the certificate to return the same, be - cause the holder of the certificate had for all intents and purposes loaned his money to you for that period of time that he might profit thereby to the extent of the interest. </seg>
            <seg id="p359">242 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL On the other hand, the bank borrowing the money for 12 months had a right to expect and believe that the con - tract which was made was enforcible and the institution could not be required to pay the same until the twelve months period had elapsed. It was a mutual contract be - tween the bank and the depositor and each had these rights respectively. The fact that the holder of the certificate transferred the same to another bank has not in any man - ner changed the legal status insofar as the payment of the certificate is concerned. It frequently happens as a business proposition that where a bank has issued a certificate of deposit and the holder is willing to forfeit the interest, that the bank issu - ing the certificate pays the face of the same and thereby saves its institution the interest. But that is the making of a new contract which rests wholly with and between the parties, which, of course, they have a perfect right to do. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, October 28, 1918.

Draft Registration Certificate — Can Not Be Held for Indebtedness Ii is not only wrong on the part of an individual to hold the draft regis - tration certificate of another, but when held for the purpose of en - forcing payment of a financial obligation, may subject the person holding the same to a prosecution under the state as well as the federal law. Mt. Fred D. James, Potter, Nebraska Dear Sir: Yours of the 24th instant received, in which you state: "I write to inquire if it is at all proper for one to hold another's draft registration certificate in order to enforce payment of a financial obli - gation. Word came to me that a man in our community had gotten possession of another's draft registration certificate, and although he had been approached at different times with the request that he turn same over to its rightful owner, who was at the time sick in another town, he re - fused unless payment of the small obligation was made. </seg>

Answering will say, it is not only wrong on the part of any individual to hold the draft registration certificate of another, but when held for the purpose of enforcing the payment of a financial obligation may subject the person holding the same to a prosecution under the state as well as the federal law. The punishment therefor, however, is not as adequate as I would like to see it. Anyone so devoid of the high principles of justice and the welfare of his country as to be guilty of such a culpable act as you have described, should be taken by the federal government and put in the front ranks of our army in Europe. Will you kindly send me the name and address of the individual who holds the draft registration certificate and likewise the name and address of the individual whose draft registration certificate is so unlawfully held, that proper steps may be taken immediately to cause respect for the law and restore the draft certificate to the registrant. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, October *28, 1918. Attorney General. Certificate of Deposit — When Payable. When a certificate of deposit contains the words "payable in current funds to the order of himself on the return of this certificate properly en - dorsed" and is then properly endorsed by the party to whom it is issued, and tendered to the bank for payment, it becomes a proper demand due and payable immediately upon presentation. If the certificate contains the words "if left twelve months" it is clear that the holder of the certificate has a right to exercise his opinion to de - mand the return of the face of the certificate, without interest, at any time. American State Bank, W. J Nebraska.

In 1913 the legislature of Nebraska enacted a statute authorizing the county board of any county to appoint a county farm demonstrator whenever ten per-cent of the farm land owners of the county should petition the county board accordingly. The county board may tnen set aside monies from the county general fund for such purpose. Hon. John L. Gilmore, Assistant County Agent Leader, College of Agriculture, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Your letter of the 23rd ultimo received con - taining the following inquiries : "Question No. 1. Must a petition be filed each year with the com - missioners for an appropriation from a county for the continuance of county-agent work, or may the commissioners on their own motion or upon request of the organized Farm Bureau, make the appropriation? Question No. 2. If the commissioners fail or refuse to make the nec - essary appropriation for the continuance of the work on their own motion, would a petition of legally qualified voters and tax payers suffice? Or should it be held to come under the law providing for the first petition and contain at least 10% of the farm land owners? In 1913 the legislature of Nebraska enacted a statute authorizing the county board of any county to appoint a county farm demonstrator whenever ten per cent of the fann land owners of the county should petition the county board accordingly. The statute provides that the county board may then set aside for such purpose, monies from the county general fund; such act being sections 70, 71 and 72 of the Revised Statutes. The act provides that such county farm demonstrator shall work under the direction of the agricultural extension department of the University of Nebraska. In 1914, Congress passed an act providing for additional appropriations to the states for co-operative agricultural extension work supplementary to an act passed in 1862. The 1914 act contained the proviso that this additional ap - propriation should be made to each state "which shall by action of its legislature assent to the provisions of this act, ' ' and that act also provided : "That no payment out of the additional appropriations herein provided shall be made in any year to any State until an equal sum has been </seg>
            <seg id="p363">246 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL appropriated for that year by the legislature ol such State, or provided by State, county, college, local authority, or individual contributions from within the State, for the maintenance of the co-operative agricultural extention work provided for in this act." Pursuant to this federal act, the Nebraska legislature in 1915 enacted chapter 231 of the laws of that year with the following preamble: "Whereas, the Congress of the United States has passed the Act, ap - proved by the President May 8, 1914, providing for cooperative agricul - tural work as before stated, and WHEREAS, it is provided in section 3 of the Act aforesaid that the grants of money authorized by this Act shall be paid annually, 'to each state which shall by action of its legis - lature assent to the provisions of this act.' " The act itself provided : "That whole and complete assent and acceptance is hereby given to the provisions and requirements of the said Act of Congress. The state Treasurer is authorized to receive the grants of money appropriated and to pay warrants drawn by the Auditor upon certificates presented by the Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska in payment of expenses of the Extension Service of the College of Agriculture of said University in accordance with the terms and conditions specified in the Act of Con - gress aforesaid." It .seems that the Nebraska legislature in 1915 and in 1917 made the appropriations called for by the federal act necessary to entitle the state to the appropriation provided by the federal act and that the state has received the same. The purpose of the federal government in making these appropriations and the action of the state legislature pur - suant thereto should be considered in connection with an interpretation of this Nebraska statute to which you refer. Since the statute deals with an appropriation of county monies, it may be that a strict view of the statute may lead to the conclusion that a petition each year should precede the annual appropriation by the county board, but owing to its public importance particularly at this time, it would seem that a larger view should prevail, which indeed, the language of the statute does not preclude. The statute does not definitely require that there shall be a petition author - izing each appropriation by the county board nor does the statute limit the period for which the countv board mav </seg>
            <seg id="p364">OPINIONS 247 contract for such county demonstrator, but the statute does provide that the board "shall make such contract with a trained and competent man for the service as shall seem to the best interest of the county." It may be that a petition limiting the employment of a county agent to one year would likewise limit the power of the county board accordingly, but a petition general in form, as contemplated by the statute, would evidently authorize the county board to continue the employment and the appropriation of money for the same "As shall seem to the best interest of the county." However, there may be a question as to the validity of an appropriation by the county board when no authority has come from the farm land owners of the county as provided by the statute. The only authority for such an appropriation by the coun - ty board would seem to" be the statutory one, but in case the county board should decline to act pursuant to such auth - ority, a court should compel compliance by the procedure proper in such case. A levy and appropriation by a county board specifically authorized by the legislature cannot be entirely valid un - less such specific authorization is reasonably complied with. In this instance, it would seem as though there should be an initiative petition at least provided for in sections 70 and 71 of the statutes. Although this question affects a matter of great public importance, particularly at this time, as indicated by the acts of the federal and state governments, and though we would like to hold that the county board may act in these matters independent of the particular provisions of the statute referred to, yet since the matter involves the ap - propriation of county monies or its regularity, we hestitate to adopt such view.

The live stock sanitary board and the pure food, drug and dairy com - mission are not authorized by statute to make rules requiring the registration of hog food remedies or the license ol manufacturers and vendors dealing in such commodities. Companies engaged in the manufacture of stock foods and remedies, even if held to be engaged in non-essential industries are not guilty of sedition unless what they do is done with the intent to obstruct, hin - der, delay, discourage, hamper, or otherwise interfere with the suc - cessful prosecution of the war. Dr. J. S. Anderson, State Veterinarian, Lincoln, Neb Dear Sir: You submit for my consideration the follow ing resolutions, viz: "RESOLVED, That it be the sense of this Committee that the Live Stock Sanitary Board be asked to make rules and regulations in co - operation with the Food, Drug and Dairy Commission of Nebraska, look - ing toward the registration of so-called hog food remedies and cures and also toward the license of manufacturers and venders dealing with those commodities. RESOLVED, That it be the sense of this Committee that Companies engaged in the manufacture of these products, so called stock foods and remedies, and the company agents are engaged in a non-essential in - dustry and we believe that they come under the sedition law and where evidence to this effect is introduced that they be prosecuted under the law." You ask for an opinion from this department as to whether or not it is practical to do the things therein re - quested. Permit me to say that, in compliance with your request, this department has examined the various statutory pro - visions relative to the powers of the Live Stock Sanitary Board and the Food, Drug and Dairy Commission of Ne - braska, and has failed to find any statute authorizing either or both of said boards to make rules requiring the registra - tion of hog food remedies or the license of manufacturers and vendors dealing in such commodities. There is, how - ever, a statutory provision requiring a registration of live stocjc remedies, section 5 of chapter 193, Laws of 1915, which, reads as follows : </seg>
            <seg id="p366">OPINIONS 249 "Before any manufacturer, importer, or dealer or agent shall offer or expose for sale in this state any live stock remedy as defined in section 1 of.this Act, he shall register with the State Food, Drug and Oil Com - missioner each brand of live stock remedy offered for sale, on blanks furnished by said commissioner on which shall be stated a list of ingredi - ents composing said remedy. Wherever any manufacturer or importer of such live stock remedy, shall have made such registration herein re - quired, no other person or agent of such manufacturer or importer shall be required to make such registration. Provided, a fee of $5.00 shall be collected by the Food Commissioner for each brand registered." Section 1 of said chapter 193 defines a live stock remedy in these words: "The term 'live stock remedy' as used in this act shall be held to in - clude all condimental feeds, medicated stock foods, medicinal stock foods, stock food tonics, stock powders, proprietary medicines, or any preparation of like nature designed for any animal except man and ad - ministered internally for their stimulating, invigorating, curative or other powers. Provided that this shall not be held to include proprie - tary medicines designed primarily for man but used occasionally for live stock or poultry." Other sections of the same act provide a penalty for a violation of its provisions and empower the State Food, Drug, Dairy and Oil Commissioner, who is also the Gov - ernor, to adopt such regulations as may be necessary for the prompt and effective enforcement of its provisions. As for the prosecution of companies engaged in the manufacture of stock foods and remedies on the ground that they are engaged in a non-essential industry and are, therefore, guilty of sedition, I will say that even if it be as - sumed for the purposes of the argument that they are en - gaged in a non-essential industry, they would still not be guilty of sedition under the statute unless what they did was done, "with intent to obstruct, hinder, delay, discourage, hamper, or otherwise interfere with the successful prose - cution of the war in which the Government of the United States is now engaged."

Kucera, Tobias, Neb Dear Sir : In yours of the 30th ultimo you say : "On Oct. 6th, when the epidemic broke out in our town, the local board of health ordered all places of public gathering closed, including in their order schools and churches especially. Some time thereafter, as you know the State Board of Health placed a ban on schools, so that the result is that our school will be closed one full month. The fact that our school was closed by the order of our local board of health, what effect has that on the teachers' claim for salary during the time the school was so closed?" It does not matter whether the school was closed by the local board of health or the state board. If closed by either it was closed by authority of law. Under such circum - stances the teachers cannot recover their salary during the period the school is closed by virtue of such order. You inquire further : "Under the circumstances explained above, which brought about the closing of the school, has the board any right to pay the teachers' salary for the month the school was closed without laying itself accountable to the district for such money paid, if they go ahead and pay them the salary on their own decision?" It would be unlawful for the school board to pay out money, under such circumstances. It would be regarded un - der the law as a misappfopriation of public moneys. You also inquire : </seg>
            <seg id="p368">OPINIONS 251 "Could the board legally make an agreement agreeable to the teachers, to make up the time lost by teaching on Saturdays, equal to the twenty days of school for the month lost, and make that a 9 months term by paying them a month's salary for teaching the twenty Saturdays to make up the time?" They can undoubtedly do so and would be fully warrant - ed in so doing under and bv virtue of the law and the faots. You state further "Where the school was closed one month on account of the epidemic, and no arrangements could be satisfactorily made to make up that time, would 8 months school entitle us to the state apportionment we would be otherwise entitled to if the school had not been closed and one months time lost on such account." Section 6745 of the Revised Statutes of 1913, provides as follows : "Time school tavyht — They shall also determine at each annual meet - ing the length of time a school shall be taught in the district the ensuing year, which shall not be less than four months by a legally qualified teacher in a district having less than twenty pupils of school age, nor less than eight months in districts having between twenty and seventy - five pupils inclusive, nor less than nine months in districts having more than seventy-five pupils: PROVIDED, school shall be taught in every such district for at least nine months in the year when the same can be supported by a levy of fifteen mills on the dollar valuation in such school district, when supplemented by the district apportionment from the state school fund, and for at least eight months in the year when the same can be supported by a similar levy of twenty mills, supplemented as above. They may also determine and instruct the district officers as to the different lengths of the terms of school, and the seasons of the year in which the same shall be taught; and the district offi - cers shall see that school is actually taught therein by a licensed teacher, in conformity to such instructions and for not less than the length of time herein required. No district shall receive any portion of the state funds &lt;nless school shall have been actually taught therein for the length of time required by this section: PROVIDED, in case of epidemic sickness prevailing to such an extent that the school board in any district shall deem it advisable to close any or all schools within the district, or if, on account of the destruction of the school house, It shall be impossible to continue the school, such closing of school shall not prevent it from drawing its proper share of the state apportionment. Such sickness or destruction of the school house shall be sworn to by the district board, and the oath filed with the county superintendent within ten days after the annual school meeting." </seg>
            <seg id="p369">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 252 The same rule would apply whether the school was closed on account of an order of the school board or by virtue of the local or state board of health. Your district is, therefore, entitled to the school appor - tionment under the facts coming within the knowledge of the state board of health and likewise that which is of common knowledge to your district. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED, November 7, 1918. Attorney General. Closing of Schools — Lost Time — Payment of Teachers. When the school board closes the school and the teacher is ready, able and willing to complete the contract, the teacher can recover; but when the school is closed by an order of the city, county or state board of health as a police regulation, it is closed by law, and the teacher can recover only by making up the lost time. The local board can legally make an agreement with the teachers to make up the lost time by teaching on Saturdays and pay them accordingly. Mr. J. F. Demel, Supt. Coleridge Public Schools, Coleridge, Nebraska. My Dear Sir: Yours of the 14th instant in which you state your disapproval of my ruling in the following words : "I wish to express my disapproval of your decision on payment of teachers' salaries during vacations on account of epidemics. Teachers have a written contract to teach school nine months beginning on a certain time. They are prepared to do the work required during toe vacation. In this county the school was closed by the county board of health and yet there was not one case of flu in our town during the four weeks so closed. The teachers had to live — they paid board just the same. They were held off from week to week. Some chased home a long distance and were called back only to close school again. They kept in readiness to fulfill their part of the contract — the board did not. It is very clear to me that if they are not to be paid they have a right to treat the contract as a 'scrap of paper' and take another job if they wish. I understand that the attorney general of South Dakota has ruled the reverse of yours. Yours may be law, which I doubt, but it is not justice." It is only when individuals who have, or think they have, a grievance and thus frankly express the same that it ulti- </seg>
            <seg id="p370">OPINIONS 253 mately reaches those who make the laws and attracts atten - tions to the necessity of making new laws or amending the old ones to conform to the concensus of public opinion. The legislature might pass a measure for the relief of the teach - ers throughout the state, permitting and authorizing the various boards to pay the teachers the salary which they have necessarily lost by reason of the epidemic. But that is purely legislative and no lawyer or court at the present time could grant such relief. Your letter, therefore, comes as a source of much satis - faction to me, because I do not attempt to make any law, but simply declare and assist as far as possible in pointing out to those entitled to inquire, and occasionally to those who are not, what the law really is. As a former country pedagogue, I quite fully appreciate the situation of the teachers throughout the state, and I also note that the wages which they are now receiving are several times that which I received, or any other teacher who taught school at the time I did. During those days epidemics broke out and teachers were required to refrain from teaching in order that epidemics might be controlled as speedily as possible. Other public gatherings were nec - essarily closed. I am unable to recall, however, a single instance when teachers during those days as much as pro - tested against closing their schools to assist in controlling epidemics. When the school board closes the school and the teacher is ready, able and willing to complete thon's contract, the teacher can recover, but when the school is closed by virtue of law and an order of the city, county or state board of health as a police regulation closes the school, it is closed by law, because those boards are legally constituted and are administrative. If there is to be any relief along that line, it must be sought through the legislature. If any teacher believes otherwise, the courts are open for him to try the case through the court. But any lawyer of this state, familiar as he is with the law, will undoubtedly give you the same advice. </seg>
            <seg id="p371">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 254 I note you say that during the time the schools were closed by order of the board of health, there was not one case of "flu" in town. That is a strong argument in favor of the closing of the schools and of sustaining the order of the board of health. In view of the many fatalities where they were not as prompt in taking action, I congratulate you, my dear sir, that you are alive, as well as the other splendid citizens and teachers in your locality. Very respectfully, WILLIS E. REED. November 16, 1918. Attorney General. Transportation of Intoxicating Liquor — Seizure of Vehicles — Sale. An automobile used in the transportation of intoxicating liquor may be seized and disposed of in the manner provided in the prohibitory act. If the automobile is mortgaged and the mortgagee permits the mortgagor to retain possession and an accident occurs while the mortgagor is driving the car and it is destroyed, the mortgagee loses his security. If the automobile is destroyed through the careless - ness of the mortgagor and the mortgagor is unable to pay, the mortgagee may never recover. James. A. Rodman, Esq., County .Attorney of Kimball County, Kimball, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In response to yours of the 19th ultimo in which you say: Section 42 of the act among other things provides 'There shall be no property rights of any kind whatever in any liquors, vessels, appliances, fixtures, bars, furniture and implements kept or used in violation of any provision of this act.' Section 41 provides, in part, 'Final judgment of conviction in such pro - ceedings shall be in all cases a bar to any suits for the recovery of the same, or other personal property actually and directly used in connection therewith, or the value of the same, or for damages alleged to arise by reason of the seizing and destruction thereof, and on conviction, judg - ment shall be entered directing that containers or other receptacles herein - before mentioned, and other personal property actually and directly used in connection with the said violation shall be ordered sold by the court at public sale on ten days notice and the proceeds paid into the school fund as in case of fines and forfeitures.' </seg>
            <seg id="p372">OPINIONS 255 During the past few weeks we have taken at least a half dozen auto - mobiles under this act and sold four of them up to date. In most cases the cars have been claimed to be mortgaged, but in each case we were satisfied that the contrary was true. At this time we hold two big cars from Denver against which there are mortgages in the first instance we do not doubt, but what interpretation shall we give that portion of section 42 cited herein above. It seems absurd that the mortgagee would be deprived of his rights, and yet the statutes says there are no proper - ty rights in this property. I imagine that this proposition has come to your notice many times before this. I shall be very glad to receive an early reply in this matter as I expect to hold the cars or release them in accordance with your opinion." Answering will say : "Where the owner of personal property, mortgaged by him to another person, remains in possession of it after giving the mortgage, and com - mits acts in respect to such property, which work a forfeiture of it to the United States, under the 25th section of the Internal Revenue Act of March 2nd, 1867 (14 IT. S. Stat. at Large, 483,) it must be condemned, even though the mortgagee is not shown to have been concerned in such acts. Nor can the demand of the mortgagee be paid by the court out of the proceeds of the property condemned." Vnitnl states r. 7 Barrels of Distilled OH, Etc., Blatchford's Circuit Court Reports, Volume 6, 174. Section 471 Jones on Chattel Mortgages, 5th Edition. The foregoing is so clearly in point with the subject under consideration by you in your favor of the 19th ultimo and the reason in support thereof is so clear that I am of the opinion that an automobile seized under the facts by you stated, was properly taken and should be disposed of in the manner pointed out by the prohibitory act. If the mort - gagee permits the mortgagor to retain possession and an accident occurs while the mortgagor is driving the car and the same is completely destroyed, the mortgagee loses his security without redress. Doubtless if it were done through the carelessness of the mortgagor and if the mortgagor is unable to pay, the mortgagee may never recover. If the mortgagor under such circumstances should drive the au - tomobile into a place in which it is consumed by fire, the mortgagee has lost his security.
