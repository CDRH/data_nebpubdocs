Section 6781— Boundaries of Division One "Water Division No. 1 shall consist of all the lands of the state drained by the Platte River; and also all other lands lying south of the Platte and South Platte rivers that may be watered from other super - ficial or subterranean streams not tributary to said Platte River." Section 6782 — Boundaries of Division Two: "Water Division No. 2 shall consist of all lands that may be watered from the Loup, White, Niobrara and • Elkhorn Rivers and their tribu - taries and all other lands of the state not included in any other water division." For convenience in the adjudication of claims and in the distribu - ttonioffcrnter these divisions have been subdivided into twelve water divisions denominated 1-A, 1-B, 1-C, 1-D, 1-E, 1-F; 2-A, 2-B, 2-C, 2-D, 2-E, 2-F, as shown on the accompanying: map. </seg>

No prior rec- wds were available on the handling of the stream as far down as Kear- and it was practically guess work as to the amount of water which would have to pass Bridgeport and North Platte in order to furnish Kearney with the required amount of water for the past season. The weather conditions are such a strong factor governing the amount of water which is necessary to have passing both Bridgeport and North Platte that even with the records of the past season it is not possible •ately the exact amounts. For instance, on August 6, ■veral hundred feet of water passing the headgates of e Kearney Canal in excess of 'what they could use. On August 9, at Kearney was absolutely dry. No water was available for use Kearney Canal, yet during this period there had been from nine elve hundred cubic feet of water passing our gaging North Platte, and the intervening ditches between North Kearney were using not to exceed three hundred forty feet. lecrease in the flow of the river is easily accounted for ex dering the wide expanse of the river bed and the four days of juth winds' on August 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th. A. report of Water Commissioner McNamara at North Platte con- wing statement: "My experience as Water, Commissioner this season shows that we cannot supply water to the four irrigation &gt;ast of North Plattte and keep enough water flowing under the se for the Kearney Water and Electric Powers Com- volume here at North Platte of one thousand second feet onditions are favorable." are appropriations between the State Line and . Bridgeport per second; between Bridgeport and North Platte priations covering 2030 cubic feet per. second; and from ar North Platte east to Kearney there are appropriations covering approx- jsand fifty cubic feet per second. From this it can be mate proportion of water used in the different territories divided. It will be remembered, however, that prac- he ditches between the State Line and Bridgeport : are alive and use water to the full amount of their appropriation. There are several ditches between Bridgeport and North Platte, which have not been in use during the past few years, and for this reason all the water rovided ] for in the above statement between Bridgeport and North Platte during the past biennium was not used Also while there are appropriations covering appproximately five housand fifty second feet between North , Platte and Kearney, it has y taken about one thuosand cubic feet of water to take care of these during the past season. However, as spoken of before, there are several large ditches between North Platte and Kearney, which are being re- pened and put in proper shape to use the water for irrigation purposes. The old Lexington Canal used a considerable amount of water when the same was available during the past season. This is one of the largest </seg>

It is also a , fact that the irrigated acreage under the Gothenburg, Cozad and Six Mile canals has increased and considerable additions are expected for next year. Water was being: used by all of these canals as late as the latter part of October, wetting up the ground for next year, because there was plenty of water in the river at that time. Work is now being carried on cleaning out and repairing the old Gothenburg South Side canal which irrigates a large acreage just south of Gothen - burg. It is expected to have this canal ready for operation early next spring. These ditch companies have become convinced that it will pay out hot and dry and all of the canal compani once. Perhaps up to this time there has been wr of water in the river, the most of which has bee N Platte River from the Laramie River and other , tributaries this side of the Pathfinder Reservoir, which is probably storing all the water avail - able atthitytime.^ It ' can] be readily seen from the total amount of the appropriations above given that if nearly all the canals began drawing approximately their full amount of water, there would be a very sudden drop in the river and perhaps a shortage and in some cases the river goes entirely dry. This has occurred at different parts of the years," for the past two seasons generally occurring between the 28th of May and the 10th of June. However, this year it did not occur until the latt. part "of /June.' In order to better overcome this it is recommended that a law be passed 'requiring L every, canal 'company, desiring to draw . water to give a notice 'of .the same stating the time at which they desire to draw water them to operate their canals even though they only get water during the early spring and late fall months and perhaps for short periods of floods during the irrigating season. It is conceded by all that the Pathfinder Reservoir is a wonderful improvement to the territory which it serves and that the benefits to be ierived therefrom are nearly unlimited, when the reservoir is properly managed. It is also conceded that this reservior should store all the waste, surplus and unused. water of the North Platte River that it pos- sibly can for use for irrigation purposes during that portion of the irri- gating season when the natural flow of the river is not large enough to neet the demands and needs of the water users. The greater part of th reservoir is filled from the run off and floods between April 1st and Ju 1st of each year. The irrigation season begins April 1st.

            <seg id="p025">22 REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER DRAINAGE The Legislature of 1913 passed the following law relative to drain - age: "All plans for proposed drainage districts shall be approved by the state board before any contract through its representatives shall have may] see] fit 1 in 'said plans and requir thereto, and shall at all times, durir is let or begun. The state board authority to order any change they carrying out of this work. The people of the state have not taken at much advantage of this portion of the law as they might The benefits , which have been derived from drainage works con structed in the southeastern portion of the state have been, very great. That section of the state has many streams such as the Nemahas and others that drain a large area of rolling land and these streams are very crooked, with timber and shrubs growing along the banks making it difficult for the flood water to get away quickly. By the building of proper drainage ditches, straightening out the channels, a good grade is secured with clean, straight banks which allows the water to run off may see fit in said plans and require the drainage district to conform thereto, and shall at all times, during the construction, have the right to inspect said work and make recommendations pertaining to the same. Upon request of any interested party of parties of a proposed drainage district, the state board may prepare for them plans and speci- fications for any proposed drainage work at actual cost of doing the same." This law has only been in effect during the past two years but it is believed that it is a good one as it assures the proposed drainage dis- trict of any recommendations or changes that a disinterested party acquainted with this work would have after a careful consideration of the plans and an inspection of the actual conditions in the field. It also insures proper plans for the building of the proposed drainage work to the district itself and the proper laying out of the work. Several large drainage districts have been formed during the past biennium and plans for the same have been presented to and approved by this office. One of the largest of these is the Otoe and Johnson Counties Drainage District Number One, whose plans have been approved just re- cently and the contract for this work is expected to be let some time this winter. Also under this law the state board is given authority to make sur- veys for interested parties. As yet no work of this kind has been done by the department for the reason that no requests have come in. It is expected that after the people of the state become familiar with this law and the workings of it that surveys of proposed drainage works will be made by this office and arrangements should be made for the proper </seg>

In the past, some investigations of the loss from seepage in canals have been made within the state. Some observations were made by the office of Experiment Stations of the U. S. Department of Agriculture on the Culbertson canal diverting water from the Frenchman river in 19O1.» These observations, covering 16 miles of the canal, showed that a flow of 80.62 second-feet at the headgate was reduced to 25.19 second-feet by the time it reached the lowest point of observation. The Mirage Canal on Niobrara river was constructed in a loose, sandy and then abandoned, seepage being one of the causes, the losses from seepage being such that when 18 second-feet were diverted at the headgates only 4 second-feet could be delivered at the end of the 14th mile. The upper end of the Crawford Citizen's Canal on White river was lilt in the side of the bluffs bordering the river, and the loss from epajre was such that while 18 second-feet were diverted at the head- water was ever delivered below the fourteenth mile of the ga car loss from seepage can be so excessive as to destroy the useful - a canal, yet the two cases mentioned are extremes and if those same canals could have been operated for a series of years the loss from seepage might have become less. Sufficient experiments to determine the exact loss from seepage have not been made, and on account of the different formations of substrata encountered, each locality presents its own individual case for investigation. . It may be estimated roughly that e old canals about 30 per cent of the amount of water to be diverted e headgates is lost in conveyance. n addition to the actual loss of flow encountered, seepage has other res which prove objectionable.

The return eepage water, has become a serious factor" in" the irrigated districts along the North Platte river. During ; the fall of 1912, the U. S.

            <seg id="p058">52 REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER Fifty-three per cent of all of the canals built within the state and 60 per cent of the total mileage constructed were in operation during 1914. There were over 684,000 acres lying below the 1,441.1 miles of canals in operation, but only approximately 50 per cent of this acreage was irrigated during 1914. The causes for this condition vary on differ - ent streams, and in some cases even in different sections of the same stream. Thus along the upper portions of the North Platte river, 87 per cent of the canals built and 99.2 per cent of the mileage constructed were in operation during 1914; 230,257 acres could have been irrigated from the canals and mileage in operation, yet only . approximately 50 per cent of that acreage was irrigated. This condition was due to several causes: The normal flow of the river is not sufficient to supply the entire acreage under canals; some canals cover lands for which water rights have not been granted, and while the lands lie below the canals water can not be used upon them; apd some of the bottom land which was formerly irrigated is now either subirrigated and no water is applied or has become seeped and drainage is necessary to make it productive. In the middle section of the North Platte river where most of the unused ditchs are located, the non-use is due chiefly to the construction of ca - nals for an acreage larger than could be supplied by the normal flow of the river and to the subirrigating of lands. Lodge Pole creek is the most completely utilized stre he state, yet the percentages, while high, show that acreag can not be supplied by the normal flow of the creek The Frenchman river is in a class by itself, as while only a sma percentage of the canals built were in operatio Y the acreage lying under the canals in operation was irrigated explained by the fact that the small canals covering small areas not operated while the few canals that were in operatior, areas, the greater portion of which were irrigated The canals along the South Platte river were constructed at a period when there was a sufficient flow in the river to supply them. Later di - versions were made in Colorado and the part of the river in Nebraska is dry for the greater portion of the year. There is little, if any, pros - pect of increasing the irrigated area under these canals. The conditions along the Republican, Niobrara and White rivers and Hat creek may be attributed to the construction of too many canals for the normal flow of the streams, and it is very doubtful if the acreage irrigated during 1912 could be increased to any appreciable extent dur - ing the normal year. The abandonment to so great an extent of the canals along the Platte and Loop rivers ls*due to" the" fact that these streams are located within that portion of the state where fair crops can be raised without irrigation. It has been demonstrated, however, that the practice of irrigation prac - tically doubles the yield in this region. </seg>

A contract was let for the construction of 6% miles of canal lying between the two rivers, payment to be made in stock of the company. The contractors furnished bond for $20,000 to guarantee the completion of the work and the company agreed to furnish the right of way. The work was begun simultaneously at the banks of the South Platte river, the farmers working down the canal on the south side of the river, and the contractors working up the canal between the rivers. The company became involved in litigation over some right of way between the rivers, and the contractors ceased work after two miles of canal had been com - pleted.

On July 18, 1891, a land and cattle company posted a notice of appropriation claiming: twenty - one second-feet of water, and constructed 6V4 miles of canal at a cost of $2,400.. Later, it practically abandoned the canal. Parties wishing to use" the water of the creek for irrigation started to contest the right of the land and cattle company and a compromise was reached whereby they obtained three-sevenths of the control of. the old canal. Several years later the canal was again practically abandoned. On April 26, 1902, successors to the company made a new application for a water right of 45.70 second-feet and re-opened and slightly straightened the canal. One of the stockholders of the new company became sole owner, and en November 30, 1906, made an application for an additional water right of 4.29 second-feet, and at this time straightened the alignment of the canal considerably. In the meantime, he had acquired several other small canals in the purchase of adjoining lands, but practically abandoned them by supplying all the water used from the Keystone canal. In 1909, he organized the Keystone Irrigation Company, with a capital stock of $140, - 000, and listed all his lands for sale. On May 27, 1910, an application for an aditional water right of nine second-feet was made in the name of the companyV in order to secure a water right for every acre. The agent with whom the lands were listed re-opened, straightened, and lengthened the canal sufficiently, to cover all the lands on the east tide of the creek, making a few applications for small water rights and relinquishing others in order to clear the water-right records. About $3,000 was spent in making these improvements. Four thousand acres under this canal were sold at $20 per acre. Each acre carried with it a water right and stock in the Keystone Irrigation Company, which is now operating the canal. Three thousand acres were irrigated in 1914. The maintenance and operation charges are low, 15 cents per acre. WEST KEYSTONE (A-1001). At the time the Keystone Irrigation Company was organized there was no canal to cover the land west of White Tail Creek. An application for a water right of 1% second-feet was made for these lands, and the West Keystone ditch, 1% miles long, was built at a cost of $1,000. The lands under this ditch were sold on the | same{Urn» | »t]those east of the creek. The canal is owned and operated by the Keystone Irrigation Company. There are 180 acres below this ditch, all of which are irrigated at about 15 cents per acre. FOSTER KEYSTONE CANAL (D-730).

            <seg id="p130">REPORT OF STATE ENGINEER 116 CANALS ALONG LODGE POLE CREEK The irrigated area within this valley consists of a very narrow strip lying" adjacent to each side of the creek. The putting of a portion of the Kimball Irrigation] District ' system 1 into [operation in 1912, placed water upon the hi gherj bench's] bordering , the [creek in the vicinity of Kimball and a considerable acreage is" being brought under irrigation. The first irrigation enterprise within this valley was undertaken in 1871, when General Dudley, in command of Fort Sidney, employed the soldiers in building a dam across the creek and excavating a ditch which was used for irrigation at the fort. The results obtained here have been described on page 46. Settlement in the valley began about this time and during the seventies eight other dams and ditches were built and used for irrigation. A dam and ditches were built upon the present site of the Bordwell ditch in 1873. The dam was destroyed by flood in the suc - ceeding years, but a new dam was built in 1889, and it and the ditches still are in use. The Bay State Cattle Company built a ditch 1% miles long in 1876, which is still in operation. The same year a dam and a ditch were constructed on the present line of the Oberfelder ditch. In 1877, a dam was built near the present location of the W. C. Bullock ditch and flooded some hay land. During 1878 two dams and ditches were built, one upon the original location of the Borquist ditches and one upon the site of the Adams and Tobin ditch. In 1879 dams and ditches w upon the present site of the Persinger ditch and also that of tl and also that ditches. In practically all of these cases the dams a for flooding hay lands along the creek bottoms. Following this period, settlement of the valley and many dams and ditches were built during the succeeding years. Tr banks of the creek are very low and but little labor is required to coi struct a serviceable dam of earth. Dams averaging 75 feet long ar 4 to 10 feet high are to be found every half to three-quarters of a mi apart along the entire course of the creek, with the excep ose portions of t the stream bed where the stream disappears in the sand and the*channel ! ij^dry .^ Owing, to 2 the ; sandy bed of the creek, the construc - tion of a permanent dam is costly and but very few have been built. Heavy spring floods are prevalent, and thus the greater portion of the expense of maintenance and operation on the canals goes in keeping the earth dams in repair. gf As ! previously noted, the discharge of the Lodge Pole creek is very small, yet in comparison with its size the creek is the most completely utilized stream in the state. This is explained by the fact that the creek is fed by numerous springs along its entire course, and also by the fact that the irrigated lands lie in such close proximity to the stream that the return waters reappear promptly. It has been an observed fact that when alljthe" flow was being diverted at one point, the stream a half-mile farther down would be" flowing again the same as if no water had been diverted above. </seg>
