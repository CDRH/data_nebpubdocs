            <seg id="p010">10 During the ton years here given, the herd naturally went thru many changes which had more or less influence ou the production of milk and butter fat. The herd of 1897 was composed of two-jear-old grade heifers with their tirst cmlf, but all well selected and of good dairy type. The herd of 1898 were the same cows at three years old and naturally gave a larger yield. A few ration tests were carried on dur - ing the winter of 1S!&gt;S which in a slight degree affected the annual production. In 1899 four western mage beef-bred Fig 1. Florence Airdrie 6th.

This disease was sup- sed to have been brought in by some of the grade animals r&lt; based in the west in 1S99. l&gt;\ the thoro aud suet fluent carried on by the Department of Animal Pathol - the abortion was stamped out and did not appear again. E01 two Holsteins wen; added to the herd and also two \&gt;. while all conditions favored a normal production, ig the years from 1902 to 190(5 few changes were made ret t the herd production. Some culling was done each and an effort was made to build up the herd not only iu I ben but also in production. During this period the tein herd was increased and it will be noted in the table ing "average yearly production for ten years" that the Ik yield increase* while the per cent of fat decreases; tin - ■rage weight of the cows also increases. The increase of 906 and 190(5 is also due to the addition of a few very ex - illt-nt cows and the culling out of some poor ones. A little ivier feeding was also carried OB during the two years In 1905, twenty-five records were made which averaged 163.1 lbs. of milk and 328.67 lbs. of butter fat. The lowest f-d was 260.52 lbs. of butter fat, which was made In IM and can not be called a poor record. Iu 190(5 there were ty seven records made, averaging 9,103.(5 lbs. of milk aud 17 lbs. of butter fat jht cow. The lowest during this was L'07.99 lbs. of butter fat, but considering that this carried twin heifer calves during eight months of the 252-daj lactation it can not be considered a poor yearly production. Taking out the two records of Katy and Karen II, which over 600 lbs. of butter fat in 1906, the average of the remaining 25 cows would be 329.66 lbs. of butter fat as com - pared with 328.67 lbs. of butter fat from the 25 cows in 1905. </seg>

During the winter feeding season the were kept in the barn only nights and when ■torma were in progress. They received their hay from racks in the yards and open sheds. The water was supplied from a large tank in the center of the yard and a tank heater was used in cold weather, so the water was always free from ice. This op. method of feeding hay was used with the view of keeping the herd healthy and free from tuberculosis. Bach animal was kept in a separate stall of its own when in the barn and here given all rations that were measured or weighed. Tin- milk ing was also done in the barn at all seasons of the year and at about the time the cows received their grain ration. During the pasture season the cows were kept in only during milking time, they having the run of a night and day pasture. The plan of breeding has always been to have the cows calve • twelve months, and by allowing a six weeks" dry period before each calving the lactation period would be Hi weeks long. By this plan the cows were bred from eleven to twelve weeks after calving and little trouble was experienced in getting cowb with calf. 28 BT A. L. EAECKIR </seg>

The roughage was made up of alfalfa and corn ensilage during the winter months, with bluegrass and white clover pasture during the summer. The corn ensilage was made from corn cut up while in the early dent stage with at least two-thirds of the stalks inuring ears.
