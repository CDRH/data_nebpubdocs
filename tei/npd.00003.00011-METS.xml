REPORT. 

l'n His Excellency, William A. Poynter, Governor of Nebraska: 

I have the honor, pursuant to the law, to submit for yonr consideration 
tht tenth biennial report for the period ending November 
30. 1900, of the Superintendent of the Nebraska State 
Industrial School for Juvenile Offenders (Boys), located at Kear 
nev. Neb. 

i events in the history of this institution have been rt 

corded in previous reports. The act providing for the State Reform 
School was passed by the legislature of 1879. The old main 
building was completed in 1881, and the first boy was received 
Julv 15. 1881. 

Until 1891 both boys and girls were received at the institu- 
Dii. The evils of a mixed school became so apparent that the 

legislature of that year enacted a law providing for the establishment 
of the Girls' Industrial School for Delinquents at Geneva, 
and in the fall of the same year the girl inmates were 
transferred to the latter institution, and this became a school exclusively 
for boys. 

In 1887 the legislature changed the title of this institution, 
giving it the name of "Nebraska State Industrial School for Juvenile 
Offenders." 

COMMITMENTS. 

Total number of boys received since the organization of the 
hool. 1.328; released by parole or otherwise, 1,192; number in 

chool November 30. 1900, 136. 

Tht- number of boys received the past two years has been 
considerably below the average for previous periods. 

In my opinion, the reasons for this decrease are twofold: 
First, more avenues of employment have been open to the people 
on account of better times, and the ranks of the laborers have </seg>

been depleted by recruits for The army. Second, the last legis 
lature, by clerical error, only appropriated #1,500, instead ol 
$15,000, to pay the expenses 'of sheriffs in bringing boys to thf 
school. This fund was exhausted in June, 1899. For all ex 

penses incurred since then tht

AROLI 

When a boy clears his record of d 

erning his conduct, he is sent back to his parents, or a new home 
found for him, where he can continue the line of work for which 
his inclination and training while here have fitted him. If he 
misbehaves, he can, without further legal proceedings, be taken 
again into custody for further training. 

The average term of service here is about two and one-half 
years. Approximately. 75 per cent of those sent out become lawabiding 
citizens. 

The recent decision of the state supreme court, holdin 

boy sentenced for incorrigibility on ex parte hearing 

kept here after he is 16 years old. unless then tried by 

sentenced for statutory offenses, and that no boy over 

old can be sent here except by same process, it seems tc

RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION. 

Religious instruction is given to the boys by a resident chap 
in. His synopsis of the work done is included in this report 

PHYSICAL HEALTH 

V brief statement of the health conditions of. the school is 

shed bv our physician. 

My connection with the school dates from April 1, 1899, when 

ntered upoc the duties of assistant superintendent. On Febiry 
1. 1900, 1 became superintendent. It was my purpose to 

i the hearty co-operation of all officers and employees, with 
uiM'iiutendent. ;is well as with each other. Success attended 

beyond my most sanguine expectations. 

Ii would be impossible to attain to any measure of success in 
is institution without such co-operation, because of the inde- 

of all departments. All must stand together for the 
purpose of good government, else all must feel the 

adow of failure pursuing their labors. So I desire to acknowige 
my indebtedness to all assistants, for the efficient support 

. ami am sure they need no higher encomium for their 
oval services than is furnished by the inmates them- 

higher standard of deportment. 

POLITICAL) CIVIL SERVICE. 

Id my mite to the weight of opinion in r 

work: that it is detrimental to the best interests of an 

this kind to be controlled by politics. The shift- 

if officers with every change in the political sentiment of 

e state makes of these institutions political footballs cuffed 
re and there for party advantage, too often with only secondary 
gard for tht welfare of the helpless wards of the state. 
While attending the National Conference of Charities and Corctions 
held at Topeka in May, 1900, I noticed that the unanious 
opinion among all the experts in sociology of the United 
ates was that all public institutions should be officered under 
*il service rules. </seg>


            <seg id="p008">10(1 

LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT. 

I quote from a paper read by Superintendent Hancock, of the 
Kansas Reform School, as follows: "A change of administration 
always causes unrest among the inmates, disorganizes plans 
for the future, creates a spirit of uneasiness, and generally demoralizes 
the work. Discipline usually grows lax, and all the 
thousand incidents of daily life are disturbed and interfered 
with. Get the proper man for the place, allow him to surround 
himself with good competent help, apply civil service rules, and 
you need have but little fear but that your state institution will 
be run on the highest possible plane." 

Captain Hatch says, in discussing this subject, "that to sen 
men for such work, by a partisan standpoint, is to rely uj 
qualifications that are utterly worthless, and disregard tlv 
which are essential." 

I believe the legislature should be urged to provide for 
creation of a non-partisan board of control for the governi 
of our eleemosynary institutions. 

It is a matter of regret and a source of consider 

ance that a large portion of those having kin in this school arc 
so misinformed in regard to its purposes that they persist in regarding 
it a penal establishment where boys are sent for punish 
ment rather than instruction. It should be thoroughly impressed 
upon all citizens that this is a place where the wayward will 
of the youth is gradually bended, rather than broken. It is a 
place where the shiftless are aroused, the distracted, aimless 
energy of the boy is marshalled, controlled and directed along 
lines .of usefulness. The powers of mind and body are concentrated 
upon a logical plan working for the accomplishment of 
a definite purpose. In doing this, the boy must of necessity 
check and restrain more and more his profligate tendencies, and 
thus be gradually led into habits of rectitude and paths of honor. 
This result is the more certainly attained here, because of the 
constant surveillance under which the boy is kept day and night, 
which prevents evil practices; and the regular habits established 
by regular hours for working, playing, eating, and sleeping. Ton 
much emphasis cannot be laid upon the physical advantages ac- </seg>

make a long stride in the direction of moral reformation, 
hen a boy is sent here the guardianship is virtually vested in 

ie state. It is a grave responsibility for the state to assume, 
id in discharging this trust the idea of self-support, very erneously 
entertained by many of our citizens, should be entirely 
ibordinated to the primary purpose of giving the charges the 
ost efficient, moral, intellectual and industrial training. The 
gislature should be urged to provide liberally for the mainnance

nomy to allow buildings to deteriorate. There should

Dear Sir: I respectfully submit my second biennial 
chaplain of the State Industrial School. 

While the work here is largely seed sowing, we have reaso 
to believe that much of the soil is fertile and capable of briugi 
Forth a good harvest. Many of the boys who have gone out fr&lt; 
this school during my labors here, are doing well, though soi 
have relapsed into their old habits. While we meet with ma 
liscouragements, we also have great reasons for rejoicing tli 
the general trend is upward, and hope based on ftods promis* 
is our reward. 

I wish to express my gratitude to the officers and employ*

Number of visits made "" ; 

Number of examinations '•''•'

I am glad to be able to say that during ilie past two years w&lt; 

have had no deaths in the school. To report the name of the dis 

ease in each case would be to make my report too lengthy. Suttii- 

it to say that we have had quite a number of cases of minor sui 

gery, fractures and dislocations, pneumonia, diphtheria, inflau 

inatory rheumatism — two cases where the heart was especiall 

involved, and the diseases usually met with in this climate. 

1 take pleasure in expressing my sincere thanks for the intei 

est you have always shown, and the promptness and cheerfulnes 

with which you have procured the necessaries for the can- an 

treatment of the sick and thus greatly aiding me in the pel 

formance of my work. 

Our relations have always been pleasant ami cordial.
