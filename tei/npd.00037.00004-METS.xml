            <seg id="p003">166 SECOND BIENNIAL REPORT OF STATE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL Kearney, Nebraska To His Excellency, Honorable John H. Morehead, Governor, and to the Honorable members of the Board of Commis - sioners of State Institutions, Howard Kennedy, Henry Gerdes and Silas A. Holcomb: Gentlemen : The superintendent is honored in presenting to you the eighteenth biennial report of the State Industrial School for boys located at Kearney, Nebraska, for the period ending No - vember 30, 1916. The school management and studies for our boys during this biennium have been very similar to the great common school system of our great commonwealth, from the primary department to the ninth grade inclusive. The enrollment throughout the biennium has remained quite constantly around the number 200, opening the first day of the bien - nium, December 1, 1914, with 203 boys and closing the last day, November 30, 1916, with 202 boys. In our four pub - lic schoolrooms and one band room the educational work has been conducted. In Cottage C we have taught those sub - jects common to the first, second and third grades. In the schoolroom of Cottage B the subjects of the fourth and fifth grades have been taught while in Cottage A the sixth and seventh grades have been instructed. In the schoolroom of Cottage E the boys have received work in the eighth and ninth grade subjects. Each boy in the Institution not above the ninth grade in educational advancement is receiving his instruction one - half of each of the five school days of the week. The other </seg>
            <seg id="p004">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 167 half of these days the boys devote to work in the many detail departments of the School, such as the laundry, shoe-shop, carpenter shop, painting department, engineering depart - ment, tailor shop, kitchens, bakery, dining-rooms, cottages, band, printing office and the 602 acre farm. In these pur - suits the management has aimed sufficiently to instruct the boys to an extent which will permit them, when paroled from the school, to become capable men in their trades and earn desirable wages. I^ater in this report will be found the num - ber of boys constantly employed in these departments and also a financial report concerning the commercial value to the institution of the leading occupations. The discipline in our State Industrial School for boys is a source of pride to all connected therewith. Eternal vigilance has been our motto in this respect. The boys of this school are orderly and well be - haved without that strained demeanor which always detracts from good deportment. The boys plunge freely and heartily and with real enthusiasm into all the leading modern sports, — ice-skating, football, baseball, basketball, and lawn tennis. To a very large extent our good discipline is incited and maintained by a credit system which places each boy upon his own responsibility in his attempt to behave well, to learn and to gain his parole. When a boy enters this school he starts with a clean record and is encouraged to earn as many credits as possible each day with the understanding that when he earns 18,000 he will be permitted to try once more his fortunes in the world at large. The normal boy earns these credits at the rate of 30 per day, 10 in behavior, 10 in school work, 10 in industry. This will entitle him to parole in practically 17 months. The boy who is ambitious may earn these credits more rapidly and thus shorten the time of his detention in this school. The boy who is lacking in these three requisites will earn the credits more slowly and thus lengthen the time of his stay in the school. Thus the indus - trious good boys will decrease the 17 months to 12 or 14 while other boys by poor work and careless indifference will prolong the time from 17 to 20 or 24 months. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">168 SECOND BIENNIAL REPORT OF You, gentlemen, will be particularly pleased with the fact, I believe, that during this biennium the health of our boys has been so good and so satisfactory that we have lost not one by death, neither have we suffered with the spread of any contagious or infectious disease. Considering the number of boys constantly with us we feel that the number of accidents has been very few. The moral training of the boys in this school has been definitely and carefully directed. The utmost vigilance has been exercised to endeavor to influence our boys to lead clean, pure lives. Improvement in the spiritual welfare of the boys has been sought through the holding of Sunday school and chapel exercises. Each Sunday afternoon a minister or lecturer is provided to advise and instruct the boys, with the hope that many will receive that general up-lift which will cause them to live Christian lives. By the facts pre - viously stated it has been shown, I believe, that the purposes for which this school was established have been kept in mind as follows: Physical improvement of the boys, advancement in their education, higher ideals of morality and more lofty tendencies in spirituality. Furthermore do I dare to hope sincerely that these purposes have, to a marked extent, been realized. The improvements throughout the institution during this period may be enumerated as follows: There was provided one large modern chicken house, 24x24 feet, which improvement has permitted us to care for an increased number of fowls, varying from 300 in the beginning of the biennium to 1000 at the close. The chickens and ducks have produced for the school's use throughout the two years 91565 eggs. Some of the chickens and ducks furnished the inmates and officers most delicious food for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners. A large commodious cow-barn with a convenient hay- t above, situated northwest of the dairy barn, has been led for our dairy herd. This is a large frame struc - 32x100 feet, with a high cement foundation, to accom - £ our Holstein cows in stormy weather, simultaneously </seg>

            <seg id="p007">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 169 providing them with plenty of fresh air, the lower part of the barn being quite open on the south side. The water supply has been increased in efficiency by lowering in the pump-house on the Lincoln Highway the large triplex pump, bringing it more nearly to the water level, thereby decreasing the electrical power necessary to man - ipulate this pump and to the same degree decreasing the monthly expense for power by electricity. Throughout the past bienniums when putting up ice for the institution's use it had been necessary to haul the ice by means of teams and wagons up hill for a distance of 400 yards to the old ice-house. One of our best improvements during this biennium has been the construction of a new ice - house on the east bank of the institution's lake. Into this ice-house may be drawn directly from the lake ice in abun - dance without the necessity for long hauls by wagon. This new ice-house is a large frame structure, 30x40 feet, 20 feet high. Protection for our 205 hogs has been materially bettered by the construction of two houses, 13x50 feet each, just north of and in addition to the old piggery. Several carloads of hogs have been reared at the institution and marketed in South Omaha according to later figures in this report. To the tax payers of Nebraska the leading improvement inaugurated by this administration has been the installation of a new conduit system leading from the boiler house to the various buildings of the institution. This new heating plant during this biennium has consumed coal costing $10335.62. The old heating plant which extended its pipe* through the tunnels averaged biennially for the four years preceding this present biennium $17786. The new conduit system has therefore saved the tax payers $7450.38 bien - nially. Thus in less than one more biennium, this $11000 conduit will have saved an amount of money more than pay - ing for its own installation. Much credit is due the carpentry department for a spa - cious and beautiful porch on the front of the administration building, also a neat convenient rear porch on the same. </seg>
            <seg id="p008">170 SECOND BIENNIAL REPORT OF Of the various interior improvements the most impor- tant and most pleasing to the boys and officers is the complete renovation and remodeled appearance of our library of which we are very proud. New, modern, institution made, book- cases have been installed therein. In this library we have 1080 volumes of choice literature arranged according to the latest methods of an expert librarian. It is with pride and satisfaction that I insert for your consideration a statement of the cash fund as it has ap- peared at the close of the last four bienniums, desiring that you note the superiority of the last two over the first two: Cash on hand Nov. 30, 1910 $1,035.77 Cash on hand Nov. 30, 1912 95.54 Cash on hand Nov. 30, 1914 4,577.20 Cash on hand Nov. 30, 1916 13,350.38 The institution proudly possesses 26 head of fine horses and 65 head of cattle, 205 head of hogs, 850 chickens and 150 ducks. Our 28 Holstein cows would have been more in num- ber had it not been for the fact that 19 were condemned by the State Veterinarian and were slaughtered. $2839 have been expended during the biennium to replenish the herd. Hogs have been, in this biennium, one of the largest sources of revenue. During the biennium we have raised 546 head. We have sold 306 head for $4973.30. We have butchered 35, their value being $665. We have on hand 205, their value being $3400. All the above have been and are pure bred Duroc Jersey Reds.

            <seg id="p011">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 173 It is with pride that I present the above statements of farm products during the biennium because they are the largest and most profitable the school ever raised. A greater number of boys participate in the agricultural work than in any other work. They cannot but be impressed with its im- portance after helping to produce the above results. A band of thirty-eight pieces is in training under the direction of an experienced and very competent instructor. This furnishes, with the orchestra, an enviable opportunity to our boys to develop a taste for high grade music and to train themselves in skillfully handling an instrument so that they may go into bands or orchestras to secure remunerative assistance upon their departure from the school. We have been, indeed, proud of our band during the past summer be- cause we sincerely felt that we had the best permanently organized band in the state of Nebraska. The department of carpentering has been one of most practical benefit to the boys therein because the carpenters have been busy in various departments throughout the insti- tution. They have repaired chairs and other furniture, re- finished rooms, made fancy cupboards and pedestals, repaired barns, sheds and buildings, and built new porches. One master carpenter has charge of the boys in the department. Following is a report of work accomplished in this de- partment : Commercial value of completed work estimated to be 1 Front porch Administration Building (new) $ 482.00 1 Rear porch, Administration Building (new) 286.00 1 Library refinished 287.40 1 Cow barn (new)...- _ _ _ 1,180.00 1 Ice house (new) 876.00 1 Chicken house (new) _ _ 664.00 2 Hog houses (new) _ 525.00 Repairing Chapel, "D" Cottage, farm implements, wagons, office wash room, doors, locks, furni - ture, etc _ 1,230.81 J5.621.21 Value of lumber, cement and hardware furnished.... 3,612.64 Value of department to the institution $2,006.57 </seg>
            <seg id="p012">174 The boys' cottages and other buildings are cared for by the smaller boys under the direction of women house-keepers. The duties here are scrubbing, washing windows, dusting, sweeping, paraffining and polishing floors, cleaning lamp globes, making beds, mending and patching. The dining-room work is done by boys under the direc - tion of two women, one for each dining room. The boys are encouraged to be neat, alert, quiet, careful, cleanly and oblig - ing in performing their numerous duties, which include sweeping, dusting, setting tables, washing dishes and serving meals. Some of the most successful paroled boys gained their training in the engineering department. Here the boys learn to handle the large boilers, to clean flues, watch water and steam gauges, care for valves, pumps, and steam lines, oil and clean engines, help in steam fitting and machine shop work in general. All this is under the direction of the chief engineer. The hot house furnishes plants for the campus and grounds, flowers for the buildings, enables us to gain an early start with garden plants and furnishes instruction in plant life for the boy. While we have not raised many beau - tiful flowers we have benefited wonderfully by the early start given tomato plants, permitting us to enjoy the early market with its higher prices, bringing to us revenues and furnishing the dining rooms with ripened tomatoes for table use. Egg plants, peppers and cabbage also benefit by the early start in the greenhouse. Boys are given a real respect for gardening when thus encouraged. An able and practical woman instructor is over each of our two kitchens — the boys' kitchen and the officers' kitchen. With the former is a bakery. All furnish wonderful facil - ities for the boys who are anxious to advance in these trades. Boys who were formerly in these departments are now earn - ing good salaries in various localities of our state. The boys of the laundry detail are taught practical laundry work. To do the washing and ironing for two hun- </seg>

The boys handle all kinds of garments from plain blankets to fancy waists. The boys belonging to the painting detail enjoy practical experience in painting. They decorate the interior of the buildings and preserve from the weather the exteriors. Upon their work depends so much the general appearance of the institution. Too much praise cannot be given the printing depart - ment. It furnishes the boys not only a trade, but broadens and informs them along many lines while they are learning the mechanical side of the work. No branch of labor fur - nishes better and quicker facilities for gaining employment out in the big world than does the printer's art. Our office publishes a weekly paper called the "Industrial School Times," in which the printers and boys in general take a deep interest, sending it to their parents as regularly as it comes from the press. Many boys throughout the state hold paying positions for which they were qualified in the print - ing office of the State Industrial School. Following is a report of work accomplished in the print - ing department for the period beginning December 1, 1914, and ending November 30, 1916: ill % III i-EC 8l*l ill Publication of weekly "Times" and general print- ing for the school.

All shoe repairing, all the repairing of harness and leather in general is done by the boys of this detail under the direction of one expert shoemaker. The department has been a successful one both from the standpoint of the boys employed and the state. Several boys paroled from this de- tail are capable of making a first class pair of shoes in one day's time.

Gray uniforms, daily work clothes, shirts, overalls, mittens and citizens' suits for paroled boys leaving the school, are here made, keep- ing the tailor and his apprentices busy during all the working hours. Boys who apply themselves leave this department thoroughly qualified to gain remunerative employment in the cities from which many of them came. </seg>

In two years our Holstein herd has produced 42200 gallons of milk. In our dairy room, situated just west of the officers' kitchen, this milk has been separated under the direction of the woman managing the officers' kitchen. The milk has been used for cooking purposes in both the officers' and boys' kit- chens and also has been furnished to the dining room where it has afforded our boys the most nearly ideal drink. From the cream, other than that used for table use there has been made 4677 pounds of good butter. When the present admin- istration assumed control 30 to 50 dollars per month were being expended for butter. The same dining room in the last two years has been supplied from the above amount of butter while the state has received during the period $455.43 for the sale of butter in excess of the amount used. That our paroled boys might be held more closely to their adopted trades, that their actions and behavior might be con- tinuously observed and that they might be, thereby, better members of society, an officer should be added to the present </seg>

This officer should demand reasonable results from the boys thus cared for. If the boys through faults of their own fail to produce these results, this officer should have the authority to return said boys to this school where they would receive another term of training. With hope and expectation we are planning for the bene - fit of our boys, who may be stricken with disease or contag - ion, the erection of a neat, modern, well equipped hospital where our sick may be cared for according to the rules of propriety and hygiene. For a school of this kind with 200 boys I have for 4 years been impressed with the need for a large, well equipped gymnasium. Indeed, I hope our coming Legislature will appro - priate $30000 for the erection of a building which will furnish the boys with an excellent gymnasium. Another need of the school is a chapel highly appropriate for the religious services held for the benefit of the boys. The present chapel in the third story of the Administration Building is poorly located and very inconvenient. It is my plan that the above $30000 building would beautifully ac - commodate the needs of this school by furnishing facilities both for an excellent chapel room and a first class gym - nasium. Following is the superintendent's estimate of needed ap - propriations for the biennium April 1, 1917, to April 1, 1919: Superintendent $3,600.00 Assistant Superintendent 2,200.00 Steward 1,600.00 Chaplain 600.00 Physician 1,200.00 Matron _ 600.00 Employees _ 34,000.00 Maintenance other than above wages for officers and employees. 89 ,000.00 Furniture and Equipment 3,200.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p018">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 179 From the foregoing, gentlemen, will you not please con- clude with me that the work for this school during the pres - ent biennium has been a success? The finances are sound. We are going before the new Legislature with no deficit. I desire at this time to give full credit to all my faithful employees, officers and assistants and the citizens of the state who have ably and conscientiously assisted me in producing good results for the boys of this school in the past two years. I wish to express my appreciation for the confidence and help given me by the judges of the courts and by the probation officers of Nebraska. Please accept my thanks, Governor Morehead, for the confidence and trust you have placed in me for four years and for the encouragement and assistance you have generously given me in this important work. I thank you, gentlemen, members of the Board of Com- missioners of State Institutions, for the ability, honesty and care you have exerted and displayed in the purchase of all supplies and for your able judgment and advice conscien - tiously given me in the care, guardianship and protection of my boys. Sincerely yours, R. V. Clark, Superintendent. Kearney, Nebraska, November SO, 1916.
