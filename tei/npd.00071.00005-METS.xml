            <seg id="p011">FORTY-THIRD ANNUAL REPORT This report covers the investigations, expenditures, and publications of the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Sta - tion during the fiscal year ending June 30j 1929. During the year there have been under investigation eighty projects, covering a wide range of subjects. For convenience they are grouped as to subject matter, and of necessity the reports are generally brief. During the year there were published by the Experiment Station eight bulletins dealing with various subjects. In addition to these, thirty technical or semitechnical papers were submitted by members of the staff to various technical and professional journals. A list of the I publications and a statement of the receipts and expenditure^ of the Experiment Station are given at the end of this report.) The demand from the public for new information and assistance of one kind or another has continuously exceeded the resources of the Station. The policy has been to con - centrate resources and efforts on a fewi rather than many projects. As projects are completed, they) are closed and new ones take their places. In choosing new projects, precedence is given to those whose solution is most urgent, providing the Station has or can obtain the necessary equipment. _ On the whole, the past year has been quite satisfactory from the standpoint of the research program. Progress has been made on almost all projects. Several were completed, notable among these being a study of the relation of avian tuberculosis to the tuberculosis of swine, I another of the con - trol of seed-borne diseases of the potato, and a study of a horse disease of northwest Nebraska. The last legislature made a special appropriation to the Experiment Station for the carrying on of certain crop studies in Box Butte county. Ten thousand dollars was appro - priated for this work, which is to be carried on in co-opera - tion with the county commissioners of Box Butte county the county commissioners furnishing the land and necessary buildings. Plans are already under way for startfnyr the work in the spring of 1930. There has been an increasing demand upon the Experiment btation for identification, diagnosis, analysis of, and general information concerning various kinds of plant and animal specimens. The number of such specimens coming to some departments has become so great as to interfere seriously with the research program. The Experiment Station is not organized or equipped to take care of such requests, except at the expense of the research work. lit can not attempt to </seg>
            <seg id="p012">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station care for such routine work, unless there is a general com - munity interest served by doing so. INVESTIGATIONAL WORK The investigational work of the Experiment Station is supported by both Federal and State funds. Some of the funds are limited to certain types of research. In this report the projects are grouped according to subject matter, with - out regard to funds with which the work was done. AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING Nebraska Tractor Tests. — Work on this project is carried on in accordance with, the Nebraska tractor testing law. During the year thirteen tractors were submitted for tests. The majority of these were new models rather than improved old ones. Two were of the general purpose type designed for cultivating row crops as well as for plowing. The testing procedure adopted in 1928, involving the use of one carburetor setting thruout, appears to have hastened the demand for im - proved carburetors. Another noticeable improvement in tractor equipment is the use of an oil purifier system on most of the new machines. Change in design and construction, permitting less weight per horse power, continues, as well as a tendency toward a higher rate of travel. Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 233, on Nebraska Tractor Tests, was issued during the current year. This bulletin summarizes the reports of all tests conducted since this work began in 1920. Poultry House Ventilation and Construction. — Work was continued along much the same lines as previously reported, and the data on the various factors studied during the past year agreed with those of the previous report. During the current year the data will be assembled for publication, and the project closed. Combine Harvester Study. — During the harvesting season samples were gathered daily from combines. These were tested for moisture and graded, and later tested for protein. Correlation of the data has been attempted and indicates that more work must be done before definite conclusions can be drawn. Some operating cost data collected show that the total cost of harvesting wheat varied from 26.12 cents per bushel where 2,070 bushels were harvested from 230 acres using a 10-foot combine, to 5.86 cents per bushel where 9,310 bushels were harvested from 500 acres by a 12-foot combine. The cost per </seg>
            <seg id="p013">Forty-third Annual Report acre varied from $1.06 to $5.04. Additional data will be gathered on the rate of drying of standing and of wind-rowed grain. A Study of Wind-driven Electric Plants for Farm Use. — Additional data have been collected on this project. Oppor - tunity to get the data was afforded by a farm installation close by. Those in charge plan to assemble the data for publication during the coming year. " Pump Irrigation. — The work of the previous year was con - tinued with additions and greater detail. | The requests for information along this line have been increasing. In order to determine the power requirements of | various pumping plants, a portable, cradle-mounted, four-cylinder engine has been constructed. This can be transported from plant to plant and accurate power measurements obtained. Many farmers, especially in the Platte Valley, are putting in pumping plants as insurance against drought. The material so far obtained will be (put in manuscript form to be submitted for publication. Tractor Lug Efficiency. — The work reported in the last annual report has been continued. Satisfactory progress is being made and it is estimated that the project is approxi - mately half completed. Study of the Use of Electric Power on Nebraska Farms. — Work on this project has been done under four subprojects: (a) Adaptation of Small Electric Motors to Farm Use. This is in co-operation with the Engineering Experiment Sta - tion. In one study the 3 h. p. electric motors for operating a hay hoist gave highly satisfactory results. Work with grinders indicates little sacrifice in grinding efficiency when small machines are used j in place of larger ones. Additional work is planned with grinding equipment, one phase of which will include investigation of other ma - chines, which may be capable of reducing ear corn and snapped corn with limited power requirement. There is a great demand for information along this 1 line. (b) Automatic Water Systems. Work under this phase of the project has been completed and the data are being pre - pared for publication. (c) Study of Small Unit Plants for Farm Use. Experi - ment Station Bulletin 235, "Unit Electric Plants for Ne - braska Farms," and Bulletin 236, "Rural Electric Service Supplied from Central Stations in Nebraska in 1927," have been published. (d) Electrically Operated Refrigerators for Farm Use. Observations on domestic refrigerators have continued, and </seg>

ANIMAL DISEASES A Study of the Pathogenicity as Well as the Antigenic and Biologic Properties of the Organisms Belonging to the Hem - orrhagic Septicemia Group.— This project remained inactive during the year. It is proposed to undertake some further trials on the immunizing value of so-called aggressins as soon as the completion of the tuberculosis project will release a more dependable supply of laboratory animals. After this the project will be closed as a separate project. An Inquiry into the Part Played by the Avian Tubercle Bacillus in the Production of Tuberculosis of Farm Animals with the Exception of Swine and Poultry. — All material necessary for conclusive results is now in the course of typing and we have asked our co-operators to discontinue further shipments. The final detailed report on the project will be - come available in the course of the following six months In the meantime the following statement of progress will con - vey the results thus far obtained as well as the extent of the work done.

            <seg id="p015">Forty-third Annual Report Investigation of a Horse Disease in Northwest Nebraska. — This inquiry into the nature and cause of a disease of horses prevalent in northwestern Nebraska has lately been com - pleted and the project closed. A detailed report was printed as Research Bulletin 43, "On the Nature and Cause of 'The Walking Disease' of Northwestern Nebraska." This report closes with the following conclusions: 1. The "walking disease" of northwestern Nebraska is essentially an enzootic necrobiosis and cirrhosis of the liver due to a toxic agent and does not materially differ from similar disorders occurring in other regions or countries. 2. The disease affects horses and cattle, but it is most commonly encountered in the former. 3. The disease in all its clinical and pathological manifesta - tions may be reproduced with the utmost fidelity by the feed - ing with plants of Senecio RiddeUii. 4. It was not possible to entirely exculpate the Senecio mtegerrimus, altho no experimental evidence was obtained which would indicate that this plant is a factor in the causa - tion of the "walking disease." 5. Feeding experiments showed that Lupinus argenteus and Lupinus plattensis are harmless to horses. 6. There is evidence, epizootologic as (well as pathologic, which tends to show that the poisoning by Senecio RiddeUii is limited to a relatively short period. 7. Preventive measures may be based upon these observa - tions, and in these the use of sanctuary pastures during the critical season may have a definite place, j Laboratory Diagnosis and Examination of Specimens. &gt; This project is made to carry the routine examination and diagnosis of various types of specimens that are sent in to the Department of Animal Pathology, i During the year covered by this report, 5,554 specimens were examined for the purpose of diagnosis, and 2,351 letters written. The number of specimens is so heavy that it interferes with the research work. Poultry Morbidity. — Some work was done on this project during the last few weeks of the year covered by this report. Quite satisfactory equipment has been provided in the form of twelve enclosed units, six of them being made with, and six without sanitary precautions. The project will be actively carried forward during the current year!. DAIRY HUSBANDRY A Study of the Principles of Ice Cream Making. — This project has been carried on under three divisions: (a) Studies of Ice Cream Quality and Composition. The </seg>
            <seg id="p016">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station study of Nebraska-made ice cream has been carried on for several years in connection with the meetings of the manu - facturers. This year, chocolate as well as vanilla cream was studied. Analysis would indicate that a more uniform ice cream is being manufactured, in both type of flavor and com - position. Better sanitary conditions and care in handling are also indicated by the lower bacteria counts. It is felt that this work has helped to bring about an improvement in quality of ice cream in the state. (b) Storage of Strawberries for Ice Cream Making. — The use of strawberries in the manufacture of ice cream and the inability to obtain fresh berries except for a very short sea - son, make the storage of berries an important question. The process of holding the fruit in a frozen condition has gained much popularity in the last year or two. The berries thus held have been found to give more of the "fresh berry" flavor than berries stored by methods formerly used. The packing of medium-sized Arkansas berries, after they were stemmed, washed, and drained, gave satisfactory results when mixed, by weight, at the rate of one part of sugar to two or three parts of berries. After standing a short time to allow the sugar to dissolve the mixture was placed in the zero room. The frozen fruit was thawed as needed and with good success. The Northern Arkansas berries, selling at $4 per crate of 24 quarts, gave a cost of 14 to 16 cents per pound when labor was included. At these figures it seems desirable for the ice cream manufacturer to pack his own strawberries if he has storage space. (c) Modified Babcock Test for Butter Fat in Ice Cream. The study of a modified Babcock test for butter fat in ice cream has been continued and two methods of procedure have been worked out and comparisons made with the Mojonnier method. Results with one method in testing 79 samples of vanilla ice cream showed an average variation of ± 0.1212 per cent from the Mojonnier. Another method used in test - ing 90 samples of varied flavors, including chocolate, showed an average variation of ± 0.1244 per cent from the Mojonnier. These tests require the use of normal butyl alcohol, sulfuric acid, ammonium hydroxide, and ethyl alcohol. Because of the difficulty in obtaining' ethyl alcohol, the substitution of some of the many denatured alcohols is being tried. Studies of "Fat Soluble A" as Present in the Milk of the Four Dairy Breeds, Holstein, Ayrshire, Jersey, and Guernsey. — In this study methods recommended for the assay of vit - amin A by the United States Pharmacopoeia have been used with slight modifications. The milk obtained from a group of cows of the different breeds receiving the same feed has been </seg>
            <seg id="p017">Forty-third Annual Report fed to rats in graded amounts. The milk was collected at one time and held in cold storage thruout the feeding period Holstein and Jersey milk, both standardized to 3.5 per cent + • i r *-i, ±r 7? r ? compared in three experiments. In two trials the Holstein milk was not standardized, as it was 3 5 per cent butter fat as produced. In these trials the Holstein milk produced superior gains. In the third trial the Holstein milk tested 3.8 per cent butter fat, as compared to 4.8 per cent for the Jersey milk. When these lots of milk were ad - justed to 3.5 per cent butter fat the gains were not decisively in favor of either group. Holstein milk testing 4.1 per cent butter fat and Ayrshire testing 3.85 per cent were standardized to 3.5 per cent and compared m another trial. In this triall the rats receiving the Holstein milk made greater average gains than those re - ceiving the Ayrshire milk, despite the fact that more skimmed milk was added to the Holstein I milk. In order to explain this apparent incongruity a study was made in one * *!. the v^™ 111 A content of skimmed milk. The results of this experiment showed that this skimmed milk contained very little if any vitamin A. A Study of Growth in Dairy Cattle.— Measuring and photo - graphing the animals of the herd have been continued as in previous years and the yearly summary has been made show - ing the results to date. As larger numbers are available the curves of growth are becoming much smoother. The photo - graphing has become so systematized that it can be rapidly carried on. Factors Affecting the Quality of Fluid Milk as Shown by the Fat Teat, Sediment Teat, and Bacteria Count.— An effort has been made to show farmers the condition of their milk as delivered to the creamery and to suggest ways of improving mnw qU « a i&amp;; Fyt fat torts are .made on each delivery of milk, sediment tests and bacteria counts are made weekly and the record is sent to the producer. The milk is divided into grades with the milk with a sediment score of 7 or above and a count less than 100,000 receiving a bonus of 3 W T^fi^" 11 / ° f^ b * "^ f^' The meth y ] ene blue reductase test has been found to check reasonably i well with the other tests as an indication of milk quality. The results so far in - dicate an increase in the quality of milk delivered to the creamery during the period of study. The number of samples scoring zero (very dirty) was decreased [from 55 per cent in 1924 to 0.53 per cent in 1928. Likewise the percentage of aTO ™!« On £ g I ° r J e " e L¥ 3 increased from 15 in 1924 to lu x No doubt mght temperature and cooling of milk on the farm are important factors that will have to be con- </seg>
            <seg id="p018">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station sidered if high-quality milk is to be delivered. The use of Neuman s stain No. 2, in place of the usual staining method for direct microscopic analysis of milk, has been found satis - factory. That good milk can be produced has been demon - strated by the quality of milk produced in the University barns as Varsity Baby Milk. This milk has averaged under 2,000 bacteria per c.c. It is hoped that by demonstration and education the quality of milk produced in the market milk sections of Nebraska may be materially improved. A Study of the Methods of. Practical Control and of the Economic Effect of Contagious Abortion upon a Dairy Herd. —This project is an attempt to obtain a herd free from Bangs disease as indicated by the agglutination test. The dilutions used in this test are 1:25, 1:50, 1:100, and 1:250. A separate group of buildings and yards is provided for the animals which are considered infected. The negative herd is tested each month and the entire herd every three months. Studies of the monetary loss of milk, calves, and other measurable losses due to abortion have been completed and are in the hands of the editor. These losses over thirty-three years have amounted to more than $20,000. FIELD CROPS AND SOILS A Study of the Principles of Corn Improvement thru In - breeding and Hybridization. — Very satisfactory progress has f e , n n m on this P ro J' ect during the past year. In the season of 1928 normal yields of corn were obtained except from late planting. The latter part of the season was dry, and lodging was unusually severe. The corn improvement work is largely devoted to the de - velopment and determination of desirable selfed lines, ac - companied by an investigation of the real merits of the var - ious forms of recombination already at hand. This program of selection and crossing inbred lines seems to have consider - able commercial possibility. Two classes of inbred strains are being grown, selfed lines developed locally from a wide range of Nebraska regional types, and promising lines de - veloped by workers in other states. Among the selfed lines furnished from other states there were several of outstanding interest and promise. About 75 hybrids Were made among these and are being grown for further observation in 1929. Further studies in the use of advanced generation hybrids as parents in the production of F, double crosses give rather conclusive evidence that such procedure is entirely feasible It appears that; the commercial production of double-crossed seed may be greatly simplified by such a program, since it eliminates the need for the continual maintenance of inbreed- </seg>

[ In 1928, 64 double crosses between F;. single crosses averaged 1 per cent higher yield of dry shelled corn per acre than did corresponding double crosses between F, hybrids having the same lines in - volved. Similarly, 12 F, double crosses between F., single crosses averaged 1 per cent more grain] than corresponding double crosses between F, single crosses. In a comparative test of 60 hybridsj including 30 from other states, some very striking increases in yield over stand - ard varieties resulted. The results indicate the possibility of using hybrid seed in one state that is produced in another. In farm "practice it would naturally be desirable to plant such seed commercially only when previous local experience has indicated its superiority. Tests of 30 outstanding hybrids and varieties from various sources were made in 1928 at Valley and Papillion, Nebraska, in co-operation with the Extension Service. The superiority of several of these over standard local varieties was approx - imately 10 bushels per acre, or more than 10 per cent. A Comparative Study of Corn Tillage Practices. — The re - sults obtained under this project during the past year were in agreement with those of the preceding six years. These data have been assembled for publication as Bulletin 232, "Tillage Practices in Relation to Corn Production." The average of the six-year period shows that spring plowing for corn has yielded more than fall plowing, early plowing being better than late spring plowing. Disking previous to late spring plowing was advantageous. Seven- to 10-inch plowing gave higher yields than 4- and 5V-&gt;-inch Jdepths. Double list - ing and single listing preceded by double disking gave slightly lower yields than surface planting. Wide spacing of rows compared with normal spacing resulted in decreased yields even when the number of plants per acre was normal. Weed control is the main consideration in corn cultivation. Scraping with the hoe gave only 2.1 bushels less per acre than land which received four normal cultivations. Continued late cultivation reduced yields. Little variation in yield per acre was obtained with shallow, medium, and deep cultivation. A Comparative Study of Various Miscellaneous Cultural Practices Involved in Growing the Cqrn Crop. — The sum - marization of 13 years' work on the rate of- planting corn indicates that the highest yield is. obtained with three plants per hill, but that reasonable deviation from this is not serious. During the 12 years of testing it has been found that there may be considerable irregularity in the stand without ma- </seg>
            <seg id="p020">Nebraska Agricultural, Experiment Station terially affecting yield. The superiority of multiple-row plats has been demonstrated. Further work with mercuric seed-corn treatments gave evi - dence that Nebraska farm-selected seed corn in general is not in need of disinfection. Four years' results of seed-corn treatments with mercuric disinfectants have been summarized and submitted for pub - lication. Where seed corn was severely infected with Diplodia, the disease was found to develop under conditions prevailing at the Experiment Station. Where such seed was used, at leastpartial control of the disease organism followed seed treatments with various mercuric compounds. Variety Testing, Breeding, Acclimatization, and Cultural Studies .with Small Grains. — Satisfactory progress has been made m all lines of this study. Of 1,000 selections of Crimean winter wheat, made in 1922, 100 select strains were grown m five-row nursery plats replicated ten times. Forty winter wheat varieties from various sources were included in similar nursery plats for preliminary testing. Six hundred hybrid selections from 30 variety combinations were grown in dupli - cate one-row plats. The parents of these hybrids were selected from some outstanding characteristic. Excellent results are promised from the smut-resistance nursery, several strains having shown themselves to be almost entirely resistant to a number of physiologic forms. Three hundred hybrids made for smut resistance involving crosses with Ridit, Hussar, and Sherman on Kanred and Nebraska No. 6, are being grown In the field plat tests, Nebraska No. 60 and No. 6 continued to stand at the top, based on a five-year average. In a further study of smut control, copper carbonate seems to be the most practical treatment. A high degree of control m « r « obtained. Among 30 varieties and selections of oats and 25 of barley, Nebraska No. 21 oats and Trebi, Comfort, and Wabron barley continue to give superior results. Seventy strains of Burt and Texas Red oats are being grown in the nursery. Among 20 varieties of spring wheat, Ceres, a North Dakota hybrid, has given the highest yields in two successive years "* now being certified for the first time in Nebraska. Seed bed preparation investigations with winter wheat comparing 20 different practices, again showed the striking advantage of early preparation involving plowing or listing, together with timely supplementary disking. During the past year the best practices yielded double the amount of grain per acre that was secured by the least productive method. Crop Rotation and Fertilizer Experiments. — With the sea - son of 1928, eight years of investigation in this project have </seg>
            <seg id="p021">Forty-third Annual Report been completed. During this period the following average yields have been produced at the Agronomy Farm on the fertility plats: Winter wheat, untreated, 29.4 busheld per acre, and the average of all treatments, 31 bushels. Oats, untreated, 37.0 bushels, and the average of all treat - ments, 40.7. • | Corn, untreated, 34.6 bushels per acre, and the average of all treatments, 35.6 bushels per acre. As an average for the eight years, the maximum response from commercial fertilizer applied to wheat was 3.1 bushels per acre for annual applications of 4 pounds of NH, 16 pounds of P 2 O 6 , and 8 pounds of K 2 O. p With oats a corresponding response was 7.4 bushels from 18 tons of manure per acre applied every four years The maximum response to commercial fertilizer was 9.9 bushels per acre from an annual application of 32 pounds of NH, 16 pounds of P 2 O e , and 4 pounds of K 2 O. In the case of corn, the maximum response from manure was 2.3 bushels from annual applications of 3 tons per acre The greatest response to commercial fertilizers, 2.8 bushels per acre, was from an annual application of 12 pounds of NH 3 , 48 pounds of P 2 O 5 , and 12 pounds of K.O. , The increased yields from commercial fertilizers on these plats have not been sufficient to produce a profit above the cost of material and application. Forage Crop Investigations. — This work continued very successfully during the past year. The| part of the alfalfa investigations which pertains to varietal hardiness, disease re, sistence, and soil moisture relations has become co-operative with the U. S. Department of Agriculture. 14 . T Ji e inf erior resistance to low temperature of Common alfalfa from southern seed sources, such as Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, California, I Africa, Italy, and Argentina, has been fully demonstrated. Northern seed sources supply reasonably hardy Common alfalfa seed. The Grimm variety has proved relatively hardy, whatever its source. A special effort is being made to increase the seed supply of Hardistan alfalfa, a newly named variety which has proved outstanding in central Nebraska and at the Agricultural Ex - periment Station. After eight years this variety maintains a perfect stand at the Experiment Station. A number of variety tests are located in various parts of the state and are doing much to emphasize the advantages of using hardy seed. </seg>
            <seg id="p022">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Soil sampling tests to a depth of 35 feet have demonstrated fully that the high yields of alfalfa which are secured under eastern Nebraska conditions during the first four or five years are due to the use of a reserve subsoil moisture supply which has accumulated during past ages. When this subsoil mois - ture reserve is once depleted by the deep root system, many years may be expected to elapse under upland conditions be - fore alfalfa may be grown as productively as before. Evidence shows that alfalfa drew upon the subsoil moisture supply to a depth of 33 feet in a six-year-old meadow and 25 feet in a two-year-old meadow at the Agronomy Farm. A six-year-old alfalfa meadow reached its peak of produc - tion in the third year, with 7.2 tons of cured forage per acre. Yields thereafter were curtailed by subsoil moisture depletion. Irrigation of a portion of this meadow in its sixth year increased the yield nearly three-fold, bringing it up to 6.72 tons for the season, compared with 2.35 tons without irri - gation. Varietal tests with red and sweet clover and with various annual forage crops were continued. Extensive hay-curing tests were made during the crop sea - son of 1928, comparing the effect of various combinations of swath, wind-row, and cock curing upon the rate of curing and the quality of product. The results were secured in co - operation with the U. S. Department of Agriculture and are being summarized for publication. As an average for three years, 1925-27, the Jerusalem artichoke yielded 6.17 tons of tubers and 5.02 tons of tops per acre, which is a total yield of 11.19 tons per acre.. Reduced to a moisture-free basis these yields were 1.51, 1.87, and 3.38 tons per acre respectively. Comparable moisture-free forage yields of sunflowers and corn planted in rows for silage, and orange sorghum grown in close drills for hay, were 2.26, 2.96, and 3.56 tons per acre, respectively. The three-year average yield of 6.17 tons of fresh tubers per acre would produce 1:07 tons of sugar, which is 17.1 per cent of the tuber weight. The Relation of Weather, Cultural Practices, and Soil Con - ditions to Nitrification in Nebraska Soils.— Work during the year has borne directly and exclusively on the relation of nitrates to wheat production. In the report for 1928 it was stated that ten fields of wheat on ten different farms in four counties were selected for study and that on each of these, two nitrogen fertilizers were applied in April, at the rate of 40 pounds of nitrogen per acre. The effect on yield due to sodium nitrate fertilizer varied from 17.9 bushels increase to 2.4 bushels decrease, and averaged 6.3 bushels per acre. In </seg>
            <seg id="p023">Forty-third Annual Report six cases out of the ten the increases were over 6 and aver - aged 9.5 bushels. The increases in yield due to ammonium sulfate varied from 5.1 to 0.7 bushels ancl averaged 2.2. In the above-mentioned six cases, the increase from ammonium sulfate was 2.1 bushels. In a single test with Calurea, likewise applied at the rate of 40 pounds of nitrogen per acre, the increase in yield was 16.8 bushels as compared with 15.9 bushels for sodium nitrate and 2.2 bushels for ammonium sulfate. T^he yield per acre of untreated wheat in this experiment was 7.|&gt; bushels. The pro - tein content was increased by the nitrogen fertilizers, being 12.75, 13.75, and 14.67 per cent, respectively, for the un - treated, the ammonium sulfate, and the sodium nitrate treated wheat. During the past year more extensive tests were being carried on in Lancaster, Kearney, and Phlelps counties with a large number of nitrate carriers. The harvest data not being available, the results of this season's work cannot be given. The indications from the work to date are that either sodium nitrate or Calurea can be used with profit on wheat on many fields in southeastern Nebraska where the soil is highly deficient in total nitrogen, especially in years when conditions for nitrification are unfavorable. Ammonium sul - fate has not been a successful fertilizer for top dressing wheat on the heavy-textured soils of southeastern Nebraska. Harm - ful physical effects have resulted from the use of sodium nitrate in a number of cases. Calurea is possibly the prefer - able of the three fertilizers. In seeking a method for de - termining available nitrogen which can be used in the field to diagnose nitrogen fertilizer requirements,.it was found that the laboratory phenol-disulphonic acid method can be modified to eliminate the evaporation to dryness of the soil extract, and can therefore be used in the field. A Study of the Factors which Affect the Tilth of Soils. — Work on this project during the year jhas been conducted along two lines, namely: evaluation of consistency and study of friction. Atterberg consistency constants on 28 selected soils have been determined and reported. (J. C. Russel, "Preliminary Report of Laboratory Tests on Soil Consist - ency," in Report of the 9th Annual Meeting of the American Soil Survey Association, 1929.) The balance of a series of 100 selected soils are now under study. Attempts to develop a mechanical means of determining an upper plastic limit on soils have not been successful and a thoro investigation of the nature of both viscous and plastic flow in! soil-water mixtures is now in progress. It is hoped that thereby the point where a soil-water mixture becomes plastic willj be revealed. </seg>
            <seg id="p024">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station A Study of the Restoration of Organic Matter in Soils. — During the year work has been begun on the rate of decay of organic materials under field conditions and the nucleus of an extensive scheme of study has been assembled. The pro- P™ is to install in 24 x 24 x 9-inch frames, open at top and bottom and buried in contact with subsoil, with only a square of hardware cloth intervening, uniform and sampled soil mixed with organic material. These are to be sampled at intervals and studied with respect to organic content and character. Ninety-six such frames are now installed. Ma - terials under study in these include alfalfa hay, alfalfa roots sweet clover hay, corn stalks, corn cobs, horse manure, and wheat straw of three widely ranging carbon nitrogen ratios Temperature and moisture records of the decomposing mix - tures are being kept in alfalfa, sweet clover, blue grass, wheat, weeds, and fallow. The soil was mixed and analyzed for nitrogen m the beginning, and the intention is to follow the changes in the nitrogen content for a four-year period In connection with this the nitrogen falling in rains is de - termined. During the year, 358 samples representative of virgin and cultivated fields of western Nebraska have been analyzed for total nitrogen. The data indicate that nitrogen depletion under western Nebraska dry-land conditions is substantially of the same character and rate as under eastern Nebraska conditions, observations on which have been previously re - ported. Soil Acidity and Liming. — This project has been actively continued in co-operation with the Agricultural Extension bervice. Seventy-eight lime tests, beginning in 1927 in dif - ferent counties, mainly in southeastern Nebraska, have been under observation during the year. In 26 of these, lime was beneficial, over half of those in Johnson county responding favorably. Yields were determined last season on ten selected fields of alfalfa and eight of sweet clover. In these, the in - creases ranged from practically zero to 448 per cent, and averaged 103.5 per cent. The quantity of lime used varied from one to two tons per acre. In several cases where the benefits of lime on sweet clover were outstanding, the crops following the sweet clover were much increased. Untreated soils from ten of the above fields have been used in the greenhouse for studies with a variety of treatments including lime, manure, leached manure, lime and manure' ammonium nitrate, and inoculation. Seven of these soils were from farms where the increase due to liming had been strik - ing. In the greenhouse, only one of these soils responded to </seg>
            <seg id="p025">FORTY-THIBD ANNUAL REPORT liming and it responded equally well to all other treatments excepting leached manure. Co-operative Fertilizer Experiments. — Co-operative fertil - izer work with farmers was carried on during the past year. On account of bad lodging and wet weather it was impossible to get accurate harvest data. Observations showed no sub - stantial benefit from applications of either rock or super - phosphate. • FRUIT AND VEGETABLES Pruning Apples, Pears, and Small \Fruits. — The young orchard at Union has fruited very lightly so far, and it has not been possible to check the effect of pruning by fruit yield. The trees which were pruned lightly when young continued to show greater growth in diameter and total wood production than the more heavily pruned ones. Cane and spur pruning have continued with Concord and Moore Early varieties of grapes, the cane pruning giving a somewhat larger number of slightly larger clusters per bud. However, the system of pruning made relatively little dif - ference in the net results. A manuscript setting forth the results of the cane and spur pruning has been prepared for publication. Fruit Breeding Experiments. — The new variety planting of strawberries produced its first crop this spring. Among the varieties making the best showing were i Dr. Burrill and Pre - mier. Several were not adapted to conditions here. Among new varieties now procured are several from the U. S. De - partment of Agriculture coming from the Western Washing - ton Experiment Station. The new plantings of raspberries, currants, and goose - berries are fruiting lightly this year, which will give a chance ! J"JSF e ue of s ? me of the new varieties. Pixwell and Champion gooseberries are large-fruited varieties which are showing up well. Champion seems to be the more vigor - ous grower. Latham raspberries show prospects for a splen - did crop. «. S * ve * a L new v £ rieties of apples and plums are fruiting for the first time, which will give opportunity to determine their merits. Among these are several Omaha seedlings At the Union Farm a number of varieties of peaches were planted during the current spring. Among these were some seedlings originated by Lantz of Iowa. | Orchard Culture. Union Fruit Farm.— Work has been carried forward as previously outlined. Only a light set of fruit occurred, and the effect of various cultural practices as </seg>
            <seg id="p026">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station revealed in yield has not yet been obtained. The various growth measurements, however, have been continued since the starting of the project. In the three years since the soil management studies were begun no marked difference in growth has been found. This lack of results from varying soil management may be due to a number of factors, such as various degrees of soil fertility, erosion, age of trees, etc. In the growth of the trees as rep - resented by trunk diameters, there was a slightly greater growth where inter-crops of soy beans and cover crops were grown, as compared with clean cultivation. The trees in the clover sod plats had small light-green leaves, indicating a lack of nitrogen. In the spring of 1929 a portion of these trees were treated with sodium nitrate at the rate of one-half pound per inch of trunk diameter and another portion received Calurea at half that rate. The effect of this treatment was noticeable as the season pro - gressed by the fact that the leaves were larger and of darker green. In the study of the effect of the mulching of grapes the year's work showed more new growth under the mulcheS than in the cultivated plats. The study of moisture and nitrate nitrogen content begun last year has been continued. In the mulched plats the moisture content was higher and the nitrate content lower than in the cultivated plats. Vegetable Experimentation. Variety Trials and Cultural Tests. — Several phases of this project have been carried for - ward during the year. The three years' work in the study of the use of superphosphate on tomatoes shows no beneficial effect from its application, either with or without irrigation. The study of the various cultivation practices, including mulching with both paper and straw, has been continued. The data correlate with those of a year ago as far as soil nitrates and moisture are concerned. It would seem that the effect of mulching or cultivation is correlated with water sup - ply, as measured by the yield obtained from most of the crops. With certain crops the variety tests were continued. Fruit Stocks Investigations.— This project is being carried on in co-operation with the Marshall Nurseries at Arlington. It is a test of the relationship of size of seedling root stock to size of marketable nursery trees growing on such stock. A comparison is also being made of wedge and whip grafting. Over 8,000 grafts have been made. At the end of the first growing season the stand from this experiment averaged 46.4 per cent. Whip grafts gave slightly better stands with small roots than with large ones. The wedge grafts were better </seg>
            <seg id="p027">Forty-third Annual Report with the larger roots. A new adhesive tape is being tested as a wrap for both grafts and buds. Growth measurements are being taken. The project will probably be dropped at the end of the current year. Orchard Spraying. — The work under this project is co - operative with Agricultural Extension. In 1928 it was mainly to determine the value of summer oil sprays for codling-moth control. The cool spring of 1928 was unfavorable for the codling moth, and altho the set, of apples was light, worms were very scarce. The apples in all of the spray plats were very free of worms and stings. The variations in results from different sprays were so slight that no conclusions could be drawn. This line of work is being repeated during the present current year. Arsenical residue on fruits has been given considerable publicity in late years. In order to learn the actual condi - tions in Nebraska fruit sections, the apples used in the various spray plats at one point last year were tested for As 2 0 3 . In a young orchard the arsenical residue was less than one-half the world tolerance of .01 grain of arsenic per pound of fruit. In an older orchard where one more spray was applied, the average was .0056 grain of arsenic per pound of fruit, or slightly over half the world tolerance. The current season's work will include some tests for the control of cherry leaf spot and grape black rot. HOME ECONOMICS Water Carried for Household Purposes. — The work under this project has been completed and the results published as Experiment Station Bulletin 234, "Water Carried for House - hold Purposes on Nebraska Farms." This bulletin sets forth the amount of water used in the average rural household, the percentage of homes having modern water systems, the distance the water is carried, and the time consumed in getting the necessary water into the house and emptying it again as waste. Routine and Seasonal Work of Housekeeper. — The data on this study have all been assembled and a manuscript prepared for publication. When in final form it will be submitted for publication, after which the project will be closed. Kerosene Cooking Stoves. — The work: under this project has been actively pursued during the past fiscal year. As . the study was first outlined, the work is completed and has included the following phases: (1) heating speed of burners compared as to type, (2) thermal efficiency of burners com - pared as to type, (3) practical use of burners, and (4) care and management of kerosene stoves. </seg>
            <seg id="p028">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station The method used for determining the practical advantages of the various types of burners was the cooking of food from standard menus. The same methods, utensils, and materials were used for each type of burner. The food was cooked with the minimum consumption of oil and time ; records were kept of the time the burners were in operation and of the oil con - sumed. ■ • . Two new phases of the study have been undertaken, namely, the relation of the size of the pan to the size of the burner and the effect of draft on efficiency. In the study of the former, five pans with perpendicular sides and of varying diameters were used. Water was heated from a given tem - perature to another given temperature. The consumption of fuel used to heat water a definite number of degrees was measured in each case. It is expected that this entire study will be completed during the current fiscal year. Cash Contribution of Farm Home-makers to the Family In - come from Dairy and Poultry Products. — This project is well under way. There are 185 farm homemakers keeping records for the year from April 1, 1929, to March 31, 1930, of the net income they receive from the sale of poultry and dairy products, and the time spent by themselves and by other members of the household upon such products. These records are being kept under the direct supervision of local leaders, but are checked by the project leader. As the records come in they are being summarized and the data carefully arranged. The women co-operating are taking a keen interest in this work. It is contemplated that the record work will be com - pleted in March, 1930. Washing Machine Study. — The objects of this study are: (I) to set up a standard for well-laundered fabrics; (2) to devise a method of testing the efficiency of washing machines; (3) to study, by means of the test devised, the principles of washing as exemplified by the various machines on the mar - ket; (4) to determine whether available machines meet the requirements set up, and if they do not, how they might be improved; (5) to discover the best methods of handling and caring for the different machines. Eight washing machines, of the various types of machines on the market, have been purchased. At the present time experiments are being carried on to determine how cleanli - ness may be tested and to discover a standard dirt to be used in the tests. When a satisfactory method for testing cleanliness has been arrived at, and a dirt solution discovered, samples of a standard fabric, after being soiled, will be laundered in the various machines and cleanliness tested and compared. The </seg>
            <seg id="p029">Forty-third Annual Report machines will be studied from all points, management, effic - iency, cost of operation, etc. It is hoped! to bring this study nearly to completion within the coming year. INSECT CONTROL Investigation and Control, of Injurious Insects, Mammals, and Birds. — Wireworm and false wireworm investigations have been inactive since 1923. Owing to the disappearance of the Hessian fly as a commercial factor in the wheat crop from 1926 to 1929, the work on that pest has also been temporarily suspended, but will be resumed in 1930. The decline in numbers of the chinch bug in 1927 and 1928 caused a suspension of studies on that insectl under this project Studies on stored-grain pests are continuing. A report was made on insects and mites injurious to poultry in Nebraska in Circular 37, published in the summer of 1928. Surveys to determine the spread of the alfalfa weevil in the state were continued but no weevils were found. The Life History and Control of the potato Flea-Beetle in Western Nebraska. — The purpose of this project is to de - termine the life history of the potato flea-beetle (Epitrix cucu - meris) and other injurious species of flea-beetles in the seed - potato growing districts. The work of the past calendar year indicates that Epitrix cucumeris is by far the most numerous species. Systena taeniata was also present, but usually much less commonly. Apparently there are two annual generations of Epitrix cucumeris in this region. Spray experiments to control the beetle were planned, but conditions outside the control of the station so delayed the spraying as to reduce greatly the value of the results. Dusting experiments with 3 per cent nicotine dust and calcium cyanide dust led to no definite results. A Brood Study of the Codling Moth in Southeastern Ne - braska. — Under this project a life-history laboratory was established at the College orchard in order to determine the period of development of the brood of eggs, larvae, pupae, and moths of each generation of the codling moth (Carpocapsa pomonella) in southeastern Nebraska. This information is necessary to the proper timing of spray applications for the control of the moth. In 1928 the codling moth was found to undergo three gene - rations, of which only the first-brood laryae were very plenti - ful. The correct times for application of the first and third cover sprays were indicated as June 23 and July 27, respect - ively, at the time the larvae of the first and second broods be - gan to hatch. </seg>
            <seg id="p030">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Data were obtained on the flight of moths, egg production, £?£? xu larval S rowth &gt; and pupation of each generation. While the control laboratory was at the main station, the work was checked at outlying points thru the use of bait traps. A Study of the Yeafs Food of the Ring-Necked Pheasant in Central Nebraska. — The work under this project is co - operative with the State Department of Agriculture. It was undertaken to definitely answer questions concerning the food habits of pheasants and the probable damage done to farmers by them. A definite number of birds are furnished to the Experiment fetation each month. The crop and gizzard contents are care - fully analyzed and recorded. The work is well under way and the results will be published upon completion of the year's study, after which the project will probably be closed. LIVESTOCK FEEDING Fattening Cattle. — In an effort to determine the value of cane molasses as a supplemental feed for cattle, and the value of ground snapped corn as compared with shelled corn, three lots of grade Hereford steers, approximately 18 months of age, were fed 135 days. The feed rations were: Lot 1. — Shelled corn and alfalfa. Lot 2.— Ground snapped corn and alfalfa, 89 days ; ground ear corn and alfalfa, 21 days; ground ear and ground shelled corn plus alfalfa, 25 days. Lot 3. — Shelled corn, alfalfa, and cane molasses (self-fed). At the close of the experiment the cattle were marketed in Omaha and the lots sold at $14.20, $14.40, and $14 20 per hundred, respectively. The use of a ground snapped corn ration followed by ground ear corn and ground shelled corn in comparison with a ration consisting of shelled corn failed to show any material ad - vantage. The gain per head was smaller by 18 pounds and the cost per 100 pounds of gain was $1.66 greater. In spite of the fact that the gain was smaller, the cattle fed upon ground feed seemed to carry somewhat more finish and sold for 20 cents per hundred more. Their dressing percentage was 1.42 per cent greater than that of the cattle fed upon shelled corn and alfalfa. The lot fed upon ground feed showed a loss of $6.29 per head as compared with a loss of $1.30 ner head in Lot 1. F In the use of molasses an average of 2 pounds per head was consumed daily. This resulted in a slight increase of 2 pounds per head greater gain during the feeding period. The net result was decreased profit, the cost being $1.38 higher per hundred pounds where molasses was fed, and the average </seg>
            <seg id="p031">Forty-third Annual Report loss on the lot fed molasses was $4.96 greater per head than in Lot 1. Factors Affecting the Production and Quality of Meat. — Under this experiment a group of old, range, grade Hereford cows of medium quality were placed on a full feed of ground corn, silage, and alfalfa hay on November 22. The cows averaged about 12 years of age. Three animals were slaughtered at the beginning of the experiment and three at intervals of 35 days over a period of 105] days. The animals slaughtered at the beginning of the experiment were almost devoid of fat and the little present was yellow in color. As feeding progressed the fat covering improved in both color and amount. The dressing yield for the animals slaughtered at the beginning of the experiment was 46.56 per cent, and at the end of 105 days had increased to 53.65 per cent. During the feeding period the fat content increased from 14.65 to 38.02 per cent, and the water content decreased from 68.4 to 45.85 per cent. The color of both meat and fat im - proved with the feeding. The beef from the fed cows was superior to that of the controls. The chief improvement lay in | the increased juici - ness of the meat from the fatter cows. Tj'he flavor of fat was more desirable after fattening. Fattening, made the meat more tender. Some improvement in flavor of lean and in aroma was noted. Whether it is economically sound to recommend the feeding of cows of the type used in this test is problematical because gains were slow and costly. Younger cows might have made a better showing from the standpoint of economy of gains. Lamb Feeding. — The purpose of this experiment is to de - termine the effect of the plane of nutrition and length of feeding period upon the quality and palatability of lamb. Two lots of 118 lambs each were started on feed October 29, 1928, with an average weight of 65 pounds per head. Lot 1 received shelled corn and alfalfa hay, and was brought to full feed as quickly as possible. At the end of 84 days, 20 representative lambs were selected for further studies and the rest sent ta market. Of the 20 lambs reserved, 10 were continued on full feed for 56 days, and 10 were put on a light feed of alfalfa and corn, with the intention of merely holding their weight. Lot 2 was fed alfalfa hay for 56 days, during which time the lambs gained an average of only 1.34 pounds. They were then gradually brought into full feed, and continued 84 days. The lambs remained thrifty during the maintenance period and made excellent gains on full feed, with an average gain of 10.25 pounds per head during the 84-day period. </seg>
            <seg id="p032">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station With alfalfa hay at $20 per ton and shelled corn at 84 cents per bushel, the cost per hundred pounds of gain in Lot 2 was 7 cents less than in Lot 1. In order to study the quality of meat and other factors, three average lambs were slaughtered at the beginning of the test, and three from each lot at intervals of 28 days. Prior to slaughtering, all the animals were graded by the method pro - posed by Spencer. * The carcasses were carefully graded and the percentage and location of fat were determined, as well as a chemical analysis of the meat. As to palatability, no material changes in texture, tenderness, or juiciness were brought about by the method followed in this project. . Forage Crops for Hogs. — Five lots of 10 pigs each were fed on Sudan grass pasture for a period of 90 days. All lots were hand fed and a full ration allowed. Lot A received shelled corn; Lot B, shelled corn and tankage; Lot C, ground wheat and tankage; Lot D, whole wheat and tankage; and Lot E, ground barley and tankage. To produce 100 pounds of gain, 446 pounds of corn was required m Lot A; in Lot B, 380 pounds of corn and 26 pounds of tankage; in Lot C, 389 pounds of ground wheat and 26 5 pounds of tankage; in Lot D, 478 pounds of whole wheat and 32 pounds of tankage; in Lot E, 454 pounds of ground barley and 66 pounds of tankage. The addition of tankage to corn proved to be- profitable Twenty-six pounds of tankage replaced 66 pounds of corn in producing 100 pounds of gain. The ground wheat proved to be practically as efficient as corn. Whole wheat, on the other hand, did not produce satisfactory results, as 89 pounds of additional wheat and 5V 2 pounds of additional tankage were required to produce 100 pounds of gain as compared to the amounts required where the wheat was fed ground. Ground barley proved to be somewhat less efficient than either ground wheat or corn. It required 454 pounds of ground barley as compared to 380 pounds of corn and 389 pounds of ground wheat to produce 100 pounds of gain. MILLING AND BAKING The Relation of Certain Chemical and Physical-Chemical Characteristics of Nebraska Wheat to Its Milling and Baking Quality.— As indicated in previous reports, these studies have been handicapped from the outset by the lack of a suitable and reliable laboratory "yardstick" for measuring, recording, and interpreting flour quality itself, in terms of definite and common understanding, as has been true heretofore of all studies of a similar character wherever conducted. Work on </seg>
            <seg id="p033">Forty-third Annual Report this project has therefore been closely associated with efforts to develop and standardize suitable methods for measuring and interpreting "baking quality" by the experimental milling and baking of small wheat samples. It is felt that appro - priate methods for the ascertainment,, identification, and classification of those flour characteristics that are usually regarded as manifestations of "quality" have now been estab - lished and developed to the extent that they are applicable to small experimentally treated samples as well as to commer - cially milled products. In applying these and other methods to samples of standard varieties of Nebraska hard winter wheat, it has been found that protein content is the pre - dominating quality factor, regardless of the environmental conditions under which the wheat is produced. When com - pared on an equal protein basis with hard winter wheat pro - duced in Kansas or other localities, Nebraska wheats are in no way inferior, contrary to a belief that is frequently ex - pressed m the trade, and despite the fact that Nebraska wheat may be purchased at a price slightly under Kansas wheat A bulletin is in preparation. Standardization of Methods in the Experimental Baking Procedure.— Some further work was done during the past year in an attempt to develop an adequate and standard system for the recording and reporting of results of test bakes made according to the recently proposed and tentatively adopted standard baking test. Preparation and Study of the Cereal Glutelins.— Work SSr e j project was actively resumed during the past year. The department now has on hand a number of preparations of glutehns from the various cereals, such as wheat, corn, oats, rye, barley, and rice. These preparations have been analyzed by the Van Slyke procedure, and altho the glutelins from various cereals differ somewhat tin composition, they show outstanding similarities. In the main their compositions respectively are similar to those of glutelins prepared by older and more conventional methods in the University of Minnesota and in the United States Bureau of Chemistry. It may be noted that preparations from the same cereal vary m composition appreciably among different laboratories, and also with slight modifications of technique in methods of preparation. All methods for the preparation of glutelins in - volve solution in alkali at various stages in the procedure In this laboratory it has been found I that wheat glutenin varies m composition according to factors such as (1) strength of alkaline medium, (2) length of time the protein is dispersed in an alkaline medium, (3) temperature of alk - aline medium, (4) method of precipitation from the alkaline </seg>
            <seg id="p034">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station solution. From these considerations the work of the past year on this project has been devoted to a critical study of wheat glutenin, in an attempt to establish definitely its true character, identity, and individuality. A large amount of accumulated data substantiate the belief that wheat glutenin, as heretofore prepared and studied, represents a derived pro - tein "fraction" rather than a naturally occurring protein, and that methods of preparation involving the use of alkali will inevitably and irreversibly alter the composition and prop - erties of the cereal glutelins, to an extent depending upon the strength of the alkali and other factors previously indicated. We have succeeded in preparing, for the first time, a "glu - tenin" from wheat flour without exposure to. an alkaline medium at any stage of the process. This appears to be a protein of definite and constant composition, as opposed to the indefinite and variable "glutenins" hitherto prepared and studied, both here and elsewhere. A paper entitled "Concerning the Nature of the Protein Extracted from Wheat Flour by Hot Alcohol," by Blish, has been submitted for publication in Cereal Chemistry. NUTRITION A Study of the Comparative Efficiency of Various Proteins in Poultry. — In furthering the attempt to secure data repre - senting the biological values of proteins in poultry feeding, the influence of the individual variation upon nitrogen metabolism in poultry has been studied. In comparing the average amount of nitrogen in milligrams excreted daily by 120 non-molting birds with that of 68 molting birds, the dif - ference between the molting and non-molting means was found to be 171 ± 11.4 milligrams. Since the difference be - tween the two is 15 times the probable error of the difference, the significance of the difference is assured. This definitely establishes a distinct difference between the nitrogen meta - bolism of molting and non-molting periods. Evidence also points to the conclusion that the method of Thomas for assessing biological values will provide relative, but not absolute, values when applied to hens on account of the high coefficient of variability (about 20 per cent) of the amount of nitrogen excreted by birds on a nitrogen-free diet. Another conclusion based on these studies is that a mature hen requires approximately 900 grams of crude protein yearly for maintenance, assuming that this protein is capable of re - placing body losses unit for unit, a condition which is ob - viously not found in practical feeding. This work was re - ported, during the past year, in Poultry Science, Vol. VIII, No. 1, pp. 1-10. </seg>

PLANT DISEASES An Inquiry into the Pathological and Physiological Aspects of Alfalfa Failures in Nebraska. — During the past year the problem has been approached from four angles: (a) wilt studies, (b) pathological anatomy of the disease, (c) selec - tions for wilt resistance, and (d) winter injury and hardi - ness. These studies have been carried (out in part in the laboratory, greenhouses, and in the field, particularly at Lin - coln and in the Platte Valley. Wilt has been found in some fields in all parts of the state. However, the incidence of wilt varies [with the conditions under which alfalfa is grown. Of the 29 fields chosen for observation in the Platte Valley in 1927, only five remain. No plants have been found infected the] first season and it appears that plants must go thru a winter before infection is possible. Plants in seedings on old alfalfa sod or spiked into old fields have shown infection the following spring. Entrance of the bacteria into the plants is effective in at least two ways, either thru winter injury wounds produced early in the spring or at the time of mowing thru the stems. The spread of the bacteria in the field may occur thru surface water or by. the mowing machine. Numerous inoculations have been made in the greenhouse and field to determine more definitely the various avenues of entrance and methods of spread of the_ bacteria. The organism has been found thruout the length of the plant axis in varying quantities, depending on the degree of growing tissues, and is primarily vascular, altho the bacteria are found in the parenchyma and medullary rays. Entrance to the water-conduction vessels is effected in two ways, thru cut stems and thru cracks in the tissues [produced by winter injuries. In the later stages of the disease, the bacteria leave the infected vessels and invade the parenchyma and produce bacterial pockets. With the breaking down of the outer bark the bacteria in the extensive pockets are. released. Evidence has been obtained showing how the bacteria migrate from one season's, growth to another. Approximately 4,000 selections from 15 old fields are now planted at four points in the state. Open and self-pollination seed have been obtained for two years.l These are being </seg>
            <seg id="p036">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station tested for winter hardiness and wilt resistance, in both the field and the greenhouse. Winter injury and hardiness studies of alfalfa were under - taken because of their relation to wilt. During the year, formal co-operation with the office of Forage Crops and Dis - eases of the U. S. Department of Agriculture was undertaken on this phase of the project with Mr. H. M. Tysdal, assistant agronomist, assisting with the greenhouse and field work. The past season's work has been concentrated on two major experiments: (a) studies of two-year-old field plants, and (b) studies of seedlings grown in the greenhouse. In the first experiment, the nine alfalfa varieties were ex - posed to low, controlled temperatures at nine different times of the year. A total of 12,000 plants were frozen and while the data have not been analyzed, they show that there is a great variation in the hardiness and susceptibility to winter injuries in the strains tested. All types of winter injury found in the field have been duplicated under the controlled conditions of freezing. Experiments with seedlings of various ages, grown in the greenhouse, were run to determine the effect of a number of environmental factors on hardiness. Approximately 50,000 seedlings were used in these studies. No conclusions can be drawn until the data have all been analyzed. A Study of Spindle-tuber and Combinations of Spindle - tuber with Other Degeneration Diseases. — During the past year the activities under this project have dealt largely with a study of the transmission of the diseases. An experiment to determine the rate of spread of potato virus diseases was completed and the results have been ac - cepted for publication in the Journal of Agricultural Research as Nebraska Journal Series No. 72. The results may be sum - marized as follows. The experiment consisted of plots of healthy potatoes, 12 rows with 27 hills per row, in which were inserted 4 hills each of mild mosaic, rugose mosaic, leaf roll, and spindle - tuber. Each hill in the plot was cut to a single stalk, dug separately, indexed in the greenhouse, and replanted in the same position in the plot four successive years, to determine the rate and distance of spread. Mild and rugose mosaic were transmitted in small amounts m only two of the four years and their spread can be cor - related with the occurrence of aphids. Leaf roll was transmitted slightly more extensively, to the extent of 9.6 per cent infection after four years, but only to a distance of about three hills away from possible sources of infection. The spread could be correlated with aphid trans- </seg>
            <seg id="p037">Forty-third Annual Report mission, except in 1926 when other insects were probably in - volved. Spindle-tuber was transmitted more extensively, 43 per cent after four years. Transmission occurred in all four years, but was more abundant in 1925 and 1927 when the aphids were present. The spread, of this disease could also be correlated with the presence of grasshoppers, altho other insects may have been involved. None of these diseases was spread more than a few rows distant from the sources of infection. Of the four diseases studied, spindle-tuber is undoubtedly the one to be the most feared under western conditions, altho there was evidence that leaf roll might become a serious problem if it once becomes established. An effort has been made to determine Jthe insects occurring in Nebraska which are capable of transmitting spindle-tuber and unmottled curly dwarf. In addition to aphids, which have been known to be able to transmit these two diseases, the following insects have been added: I flea beetles, Epitrix, cucumeris, Systena taeniata, and Disonycha triangularis; the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa declemelineata; and the tarnishing plant bug, Lygus pratensis. I Some of these have been tested in only a few instances, but inoculated plants have shown distinct symptoms with the adjoining checks remain - ing healthy. Negative results were obtained with flea beetles, leaf bugs, and grasshoppers in transmitting mosaic and leaf roll. Experiments have been conducted by juice inoculation of both seed pieces and growing plants with spindle-tuber and curly dwarf , to determine: (a) The relation of time of infection to the appearance of the symptoms. Most of the plants inoculated in early August and many of those inoculated in July failed to show any cur - rent season symptoms, but the disease appeared the next sea - son. This emphasizes the need of early roguing of diseased plants in commercial fields. (b) A means of controlling the transmission of the dis - ease by cutting knife, seed-piece contact, and picker planters. The experiments indicate that when seed is held over night after cutting, very little transmission occurs. Tests in which the action of a picker planter was simulated resulted in 10 to 12 per cent infection of healthy potatoes immediately follow - ing infected seed-pieces, 2 to 4 per cent of the second healthy seed-pieces and no infection of the third pieces. (c) Dilution tests of juice have shown infection with spindle-tuber at a l-tb-1,000 dilution jbut not at 10,000 or above, while some transmission of unmottled curly dwarf occurred with the high dilution of l-to-10,000. Other tests </seg>

The results to date nave been negative.

A Study of Scab and Ftisarium Wilt of Potatoes in Relation to Infection from the Soil— This project was started last summer by making a survey covering the entire commercial acreage of western Nebraska. The factor of seed infection was eliminated by distributing one lot of . seed potatoes, treated with hot formaldehyde, to 100 growers on farms rep - resentative of the different soil types arid climatic conditions occurring in western Nebraska. This seed was planted as a sample row in their commercial fields, i During the summer, all of these fields were visited and data cpllected on the oc - currence of disease, soil types, and history of the field as to rotation and years under cultivation. Soil samples were also obtained from each field, often in comparison with similar virgin soils, and the microflora of the soil was determined as to numbers of bacteria, actinomycetes^ and fungi present. Pathogenic types of fungi were isolated j and studied. Samples of two bushels each were obtained at harvest time from each field, and the tubers were examined for scab and Fusarium wilt. While complete data are not available, it is evident that soil infection with these two diseases is a serious factor. There is evidence that every field contained scab and the average infection was 53.1 per cent, while 13.6 per cent of the crop graded as scab culls. The highest infection was 100 per cent and 98 per cent scab culls The average amount of Fusarium from these 100 fields was 4.2 per cent. Ninety-five per cent of the fields were infected and. the highest infection was 55 per cent. Over 30 per cent of infection occurred in one virgin soil^ and most fields had not grown potatoes for more than four years. The data indi - cate that the length of time between potato crops is not the important factor, but rather the effect [of the other crops in the rotation. Preliminary experiments in the greenhouse, using para - formaldehyde and mercurous chloride as soil disinfectants, were negative. The treatments either failed to control scab or injured the plants. Fruit Disease Investigations.^-Work under this project during the. year has to be confined to a study of the cherry leaf spot disease, caused by . Coccomyces hiemalis. This dis - ease is again very serious and the sprays being used have shown little effect.

A Study of Degeneracy in Seedr-potato Stocks. — Four dif - ferent phases of this, problem were continued during the past year. (a) Time of Planting and Harvesting as Factors Affecting Seed Potato Production. This phase was continued with Triumph potatoes at Alliance. Conditions were abnormal, due to a period of cold, wet weather th4 latter part of June, which affected the June 20 planting] adversely. Careful studies are being made of the relation of planting time and harvesting time to prevalence and severity of scab, but no conclusions can be drawn until the work is* continued over a few more years. The same comment applies to tuber type. (b) Effect of Soil Conditions on Seed Value. At Lincoln an&lt;j Alliance, seed potatoes grown in trenches filled with dif - ferent soils were tested the following year. At Lincoln, po - tatoes are being grown under straw and paper mulches, and also with ordinary cultivation. In addition plants are grown with half of the soil under one set of conditions and half under another, using the nine possible combinations of the three methods. Tubers will be dug carefully and tested next year to determine whether these conditions will have had any effect on their seed value. (c) Comparative Value of Irrigated and Dry Land Seed Potatoes. Co-operative trials conducted at a number of southern experiment stations during the winter and spring of 1929 indicate that in the absence of disease, irrigation was not a factor in the production of good- seed potatoes. This was corroborated by similar trials at several Nebraska points. (d) The Rest Period of Potatoes. Ethylene chlorhydrin treatments have been found effective in! terminating the rest period and bringing about prompt germination in the fall and early winter. The more mature tubers and those stored in warm places responded most promptly. Treating the cut seed-pieces with a 5 per cent solution of ethylene chlorhydrin stimulated the emergence in every lot of| seed treated. Treat - ing the seed before and after being shipped to Bermuda gave very good results. Satisfactory results were obtained by dipping cut pieces when the dipping occurred within two days after cutting; after two days it was ineffective. Seed pieces from large, dormant potatoes responded more promptly to the treatment than did those from small potatoes. During the current year certain phases of the data ob - tained under this project have been prepared for publication, as follows: "Relative Productivity of Seed Potatoes Grown under Various Controlled Environmental Conditions," The </seg>

POULTRY Nutrient Requirements of Growing Chicks. — Under this project a study has been made of the effect of high tempera - ture on the nutritive value of a chick ration. A ration known to be complete for all nutritive essentials was autoclaved for one and two hours respectively at fifteen pounds pressure The growth-promoting power of the ration was then de - termined. It was observed that growth was impossible on the ration that was autoclaved for two hours, the chicks pre - senting typical evidences of anti-neuritic deficiencies. Chicks given the ration autoclaved for one hour lived but made a much slower growth than did the control lot. This experi- m A W i? s twice re P ea t e d with identical results. Another phase of this project was an attempt to determine the stability of vitamins A and D in cod liver oil after mixing with the ration. The evidence shows that the growth rate of chicks receiving cod liver oil mixed one month or more in advance of feeding was never quite so good as when the same grade and amount of oil was mixed and fed fresh. Whether the slower growth rate was due to a lowered payability of the ration with the oil mixed one month in advance of feeding a 1 " «. • r J? a m '"t 3111111 factors, is an unanswered question A triplication of these experiments gave consistent results. I he same amount and grade of cod liver oil was also added to a basal ration complete for vitamin A, the time of mixing again being the variable. The ration including the f reshlv mixed oil gave slightly better results, according to a growth curve interpretation.

The use of lights from six o'clock in the morning until daybreak, beginning February 1, advanced egg production about a month as compared with another lot re - ceiving the same ration but not the extra light. This work indicates the possibility of obtaining larger and more readily marketable turkeys for the early Thanksgiving market. In a study of trapnesting with laying! turkey hens, it was found that there was more difficulty than with chickens in getting them to use the nests. The younger laying females are better layers than the two-year-old birds, the same as with chickens. Observations of the relative hatchability of eggs laid by hens of different ages were made, but the results are not con - clusive. The egg production of individuals ranged from 9 to 58 eggs in the same breeding unit, and witih the same feed and environment. Some experimental work is under way in an effort to de - velop turkey-raising equipment that will I provide the essential sanitary conditions without too high a labor cost.

Cost of Producing Farm Crops.— An attempt is being made to get information on the cost of producing crops in different sections of Nebraska thru co-operation with farmers. Record books are furnished to the farmers, and in these they keep a record of man labor, horse labor, machine labor, and other production costs. Occasional field visitd are made to the co - operators to assist them in keeping the Irecords.

Data previously assembled have been brought up to date and are used, in connection with current market information, as the background for material presented in The Nebraska Economic Situation." (b) Corn Storage and Prices. An attempt was made to determine the factors that require consideration in deciding whether or not it pays to hold corn in storage from fall to the following spring or summer. Such factors as seasonal price trends, size of crop, the sequence of crops of varying sizes, changes in grade, and changes in amount of livestock were given consideration. The study is still incomplete. (c) Operating Problems of Country Grain Elevators. Financial and operating data from about 125 country ele - vators, nearly, all co-operative, in the form of audit reports, have been summarized and analyzed in part Some idea of the financial condition of the country elevators since 1918 has been obtained. Analysis of the data has brought out the influence of volume of business, sidelines, use of labor, and use of equipment on operating costs. Co-operative Agricultural Organizations. — This project has been actively carried forward during the past year. The question of co-operative organizations is very prominent among the farmers at this time. An attempt is being made to answer their questions from data obtained under this project. SERUM PRODUCTION There was very little cholera reported to the office of the State Serum Plant during the year. The demand for serum and virus was considerably less than in 1928, which goes to show that vaccination is being neglected. This plant has experienced no difficulty in filling all orders promptly and kept a liberal supply of serum in storage (for an emergency. The State Serum Plant has continued the policy of buying its supply of serum subject to retest, and manufacturing its own virus.

During this time a real contribution has been made to the knowledge of soil moisture, its storage, movement, and use by the crops. The effects of tillage on the storage of moisture, the amount that may be stored under given conditions, and various other fea- </seg>
            <seg id="p046">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station tures of the soil moisture problem have been determined. It has been shown that while tillage is important, no system of tillage will create moisture or produce a crop without water, or, stated in another way, weather and soil conditions may be such that no method of tillage will produce a crop. This statement would have been challenged when soil moisture work was begun at this station. Agronomy. — A large share of the experimental work in agronomy is in co-operation with the United States Depart - ment of Agriculture thru the offices of Dry Land Agriculture and of Cereal Crops and Diseases. The various methods of tillage carried on continuously thruout these years are now giving cumulative results that may be relied upon as showing with considerable accuracy the results that will be obtained from similar methods during the next quarter of a century. We know with considerable cer - tainty the effect of summer tillage, the effect of barnyard manure, green manure, grass, and alfalfa on the succeeding crops, and of many similar factors in crop production. The work in crop improvement has progressed satis - factorily. This work, in co-operation with the work in the Office of Cereal Crops and Diseases, has been given special attention for the past six years. New lines of wheat, barley, and oats are being tried out in comparison with local vari - eties of known behavior. Studies in disease resistance and winter hardiness in wheat are being continued. It is hoped to find a wheat that is not only resistant but also has good milling qualities. On the whole the year was about average in crop production. Pump Irrigation. — The studies in the use of supplemental water in crop production have been continued. There seems to be no doubt that where water can be had in sufficient quantities and within reasonable distance, supplementing the natural rainfall by pumping is feasible, and the practice is being engaged in more and more in certain sections of the state. Beef Cattle. — Two herds of beef cattle have. been main - tained, one of Hereford and one of Shorthorn, in about the same numbers as previously. These herds are serving as a source of breeding stock to the community and some of the younger animals are being used for experimental purposes. In the spring of 1929 the problem of fattening cattle on alfalfa pasture was undertaken. Two lots of 10 Hereford heifers are being used for the experiment. One lot is being fed corn and alfalfa hay in a dry lot, and the other lot is being fed corn while pasturing alfalfa. Considerable interest has been shown by the farmers of the state in this practice and </seg>
            <seg id="p047">Forty-third Annual Report it Is hoped to get definite data as to the practicability of the method. Dairying. — The Holstein cows have continued making fine records. There are now in the herd, consisting of 26 cows and heifers that have finished one lactation period. 3 cows with records of above 1,000 pounds of butterfat produced in 365 days. The 26, some as 2-year-old Heifers, have records that average 976 pounds of butter. There are 12 cows with 19 records above 1,000 pounds of butter. Every animal was bred and developed in this herd. This herd has done a great deal to popularize dairying - thruout the western part of the state, and the major portion of the young animals that have been sold from the herd have gone to farmers within the state. i?O£rs.— About the usual number of breeding sows have been maintained during the past year. A portion of the increase has, as usual, been sold to farmers in the vicinity for breeding purposes. In the experimental work carried on during the past year the main purpose has been to find the most practical protein supplement to feed with corn. That cottonseed meal may be used successfully to a limited extent has been shown. That the best results may be obtained from the use of both tankage and cottonseed meal has also been indicated. Sheep. — A farm breeding flock of sheep is maintained, the original stock of which was range ewes. Rambouillet rams are being used to improve the herd. The sheep have shown that they will keep the roadways and alleys free from weeds if given an opportunity. For this purpose alone, a small flock should find favor on many farms. Coyotes have proved a real menace, chasing the sheep to the j buildings while the sun was still shining and killing a considerable number. In fact, in this rough canyon pasture, the coyotes hardly allow the sheep the midday unmolested for pasturing. It would seem that on land of this character, the coyotes should be fenced out or the sheep protected by a shepherd. Poultry. — The usual number of hens of two of the leading - breeds have been kept thruout the year. Egg production fell a little below that of the previous year. The health of the flocks has been quite satisfactory. The demand for breeding stock has been increasing. The turkeys proved their true worth on the farm by ridding fields of grasshoppers where valuable strains of hardy alfalfa had been seeded recently. When all other methods of control had failed, the turkeys were put into the field. They ate the hoppers and saved the alfalfa. While on the grasshopper </seg>

VALENTINE SUBSTATION The past year has been unfavorable for crop yields, being wWifT-,^ subnormal rainfall. In addition to the low rainfall, hail did considerable damage. No improvements were made in the physical plant during the year and the experimental work was carried on along lines previously started. Cereal Crops.— The small-grain plats were damaged by hail and dry weather to the extent that yields ran from nothing to four bushels per acre. Plats on the hard soil north of the station made good yields. Ceres was the high spring wheat E2£&amp;, 1 gift&amp;f m ** t *"" VelV6t b "&amp; "A*^ Forage Crops.— Poor stands were obtained on the listed plats. Amber cane, with 2,300 pounds, was the high variety Cane drilled in at the rates of 2, 4, and 6 pecks oer acrp yielded 1,955, 2,300, and 2,645 pounds respectively. 1^ Sudan grass for the second time in ten years yielded a ton of hav Soy beans again proved unprofitable as a forage crop. Fertilizers— Commercial fertilizers gave insufficient in - crease m yields of corn, barley, and rye to compensate for the cost. .Barnyard manure gave from two to four bushels of increase. Meadow Investigation.— Studies have been continued on meadow composition and the relation of clover and tame grass invasion to yield. On four meadow plots, clover drilled into the native grass resulted in doubling the total yield of hay It has not proved profitable to seed clover on meadow that is more than three feet above the water table. Beef Cattle.— Where calves are wintered with the idea of selling them off grass the following summer, it was demon - strated most profitable to feed a winter ration that gives a daily winter gain of from three-fourths to one pound per head. High winter gains were followed by low summer gains and vice versa. Prairie hay, supplemented with cottoncake at the rate of one-half to one pound per day, resulted in an additional profit of over $5.00 per head above cost of feed Wintering calves on one and one-half pounds of cottonseed cake proved less profitable at the close of the grazing season than where one pound was fed. The good results made with mixed clover hay will warrant the improvement of native hay thru the seeding of clover. The summer range on which the steers grazed has a carrying capacity of approximately one yearling to six acres. </seg>
            <seg id="p051">Forty-third Annual Report Dairy Cattle.-^-The work with the dairy herd is becoming more popular, as general dairying is increasing in the region. 1 he herd of 15 purebred Holsteins averaged 11,805 pounds of milk and 481.6 pounds of butterfat in 339 days The aver- ™ e f . ee d consumption per cow was: hay, 6,018 pounds; sil - age, 4,290 pounds; and gram mixture, 4,051 pounds Poultry— The demonstration work with turkeys has met with good success. The hens averaged 46 eggs up to the first of June. The fertility of the eggs was 94 per cent and the incubator hatches varied from 50 to 85 [per cent, with from 2 to 5 per cent cripples. The feed cost per poult was $1.27.

NEEDS OF THE EXPERIMENT STATION One of the greatest needs of the Experiment Station at the present time is for additional land. Lines of work such as power farming and certain livestock problems cannot be undertaken with the land now available. Furthermore, it is highly desirable to relieve the livestock congestion at the present quarters, thus reducing the danger from various diseases. CHANGES IN STAFF During the year covered by this report the only change in the station staff was the granting of aj leave of absence to Professor O. W. Sjogren. Professor E. E. Brackett was made Acting Chairman of the Department of Agricultural Engi - neering. e </seg>
