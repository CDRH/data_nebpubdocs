t at the same time. 

Pe President — It has been our custom, as we have met 
at the University from year to year, to listen to some 
s of greeting from the head of this institution. We 
with us this afternoon Chancellor Andrews, and I am 
you will all be glad to hear from him. 

Ihancellok Andrews — Mr. President and Members of 
Society — I am very glad to follow out a good custom, 
iys, but I am especially glad to be permitted to say a few 
Is of welcome to you this afternoon. You are welcome 
le grounds of the University ; you are welcome to all the 
clings, to all the rooms, to all the laboratories, to all the 
tries, and every place that you care to go is yours for the 
i being. You are especially welcome to these rooms and 
11 the particular space needed in order to make your 
bits and carry on the meeting. 

The University is interested in your line, and we are doing 
what we can to advance this particular kind of work. 
And I think in the various lines of one sort and another in 
which you are reaching out, the University finds its chief 
strength. You have all doubtless heard the old Greek fable 
of the duel between Hercules and Antaeus. And you remember 
that in that great wrestling match, as long as Hercules' 
enemy could keep him off the earth he beat him; handled 
him; did what he pleased with him. But whenever Hercules </seg>

Iihrsd the earth he felt himself endued with new strength, 
, touching the earth often, he gathered more and more 
ngth until at last he whipped his enemy. I think your 
ety is happy in that your work leads you to consult 
her earth; to see what mother earth can do. That is 
t you are after; to find what new fruit mother earth can 
i forth; endeavoring to solve that question as best you 
That question has not been solved finally, and will not 
n our time. Ton know that for the last hundred years 
sical science, chemistry, physical engineering, and all 
matters relative to those interesting departments have 
ipied the best brains that man has pushed forth; and 
have been able, with the brains that have been used in 
e directions, to solve many perplexing problems and to 
much to the health and comfort of mankind. 

But there are two departments of inquiry which are, if 
possible, even more important to mankind than the physical 
sciences in the sense in which they have been prominen 
during the last hundred years. The first is social science 
the science of human beings; how we may live together in a 
neighborhood; how we may be able to build large cities am 
not be quarreling all the time; how this world may be toler 
ably well filled up with human beings and still keep from 
"scrapping" as our main business. That line of inquiry wil 
be pushed during the next hundred years, and most of those 
problems in our social life that are causing tears to come to 
so many eyes, and sadness to so many hearts, will have been 
solved when our grandchildren stand where we stand this 
afternoon. 

Then there is another most useful line of inquiry with 
which, during the last hundred years, comparatively little 
has been done; that is farm science, to which horticulture 
belongs, looking at agriculture in the largest sense. It is 
true that agriculture has improved during the last hundred 
years, but it has hardly begun to make the improvement that 
haa been attained in the physical sciences, and, indeed, the </seg>

PROCEEDINGS. 

advance has been almost wholly along the line of extensive 
agriculture. The great need now is for intensive agriculture, 
because the world is filling up. The good land, for the roost 
part, is occupied already. Nearly everywhere a good acre 
of land is worth a considerable sum of money. I believe there 
is to be some good land opened up in Oklahoma within a 
month or two, but almost everywhere the good land is taken 
up. Generally speaking, agriculture in the United States — 
at least until within a very few years — has hardly been 
worthy that name. It has been simply land-scratching, grabbing 
the almost spontaneous products of the soil. 80 in 
horticulture. In the new time that is coming — as a new 
time must come — you will find that the pioneer work that 
your people have been doing up to date will bear most abundant 
fruit. I believe the people who stand in your places a 
hundred years from now will look back upon a career of 
advancement in your line similar to the advancement that 
has been made along physical lines in the last hundred years. 
I trust you will be encouraged in the work. The great need 
in this country lies in your direction; lies along the track 
where you are traveling. And I dare say that the triumph 
in this line which is to come will be due in no small degree 
to the labors which are in your hands. 

With these words, gentlemen, and Mr. President, I bid you 
good afternoon, hoping you will have success in your deliberations, 
and that at the end of the time spent at the University 
you may feel that it has been good for you to be here. 
[Applause.] 

RESPONSE. 

Mr. President — I am very glad the Chancellor told that 
story about Hercules; I am very glad we have a chancellor 
who is willing to come down and touch the earth; who is 
not willing to live in the clouds. We want for leader and

teacher in the University a man among men who is willing 
to come in and talk with us and encourage us in our work. 

It is the mission of this society to take care of this earth ; 
to take a portion of it and make the very best of it; to take 
the ideal and make the real ; to take the naked earth and 
make it bloom in beauty. Why, the very air around us is 
full of possibilities, and our mission is to make the ideal the 
real, and we are going to do it. [Applause.] 

Secretary C. H. Barnard read the following 

SECRETARY'S REPORT. 

Mr. President, Officers, and Members of the Society — The 
part year has been one of some successes and some failures, 
but withal an advance, because there has been some earnest 
work- done. While the past year has not been all we could 
hope, it has marked some progress. Among the first things 
attempted under the authority of the Society was this cystem 
of issuing bulletins from time to time. The understanding 
was that the members would prepare these bulletins and 
send them to the Secretary. The bulletins received were 
very satisfactory, and I sent out about a dozen and had them 
published in two hundred county and state papers in our 
own and adjoining states. This was very satisfactory as 
far as it went, but the bulletins soon quit coming, and when 
you ask the Secretary to prepare papers from his own standpoint 
on every conceivable subject and send them out as representing 
the thought of this society, it was a greater responsibility 
than the Secretary cared to assume. I find members 
of the Society differing with me relative to matters pertaining 
to the society's welfare; consequently it was deemed best 
not to publish anything of my own writing under authority 
of the Society until some action was taken that would tend 
to place it in that light. 

Experiment Stations — At our last annual meeting the 
¦atter of experiment stations was taken up. Six stations </seg>

PROCEED I 

hare been established, five of which are in good working 
order and will have reports at this meeting to show what 
has been accomplished with the small means allowed for 
their use. 

I'ekmiums — The question of premiums comes up, and I 
&gt;w I voice the sentiment of the President when I say we 
;ht to return to the old-time custom of offering premiums 
winter fruit at this meeting. As the President has said, 
s only the early apples that are in any shape for a comtee 
to pass upon them intelligently at the September 
w. By offering premiums on winter apples shown at 
i meeting, a good showing of winter fruit could be had, 
I the questions of flavor and keeping qualities could be 
en up and passed upon intelligently. 

IiiBRARY — At the September meeting a year ago the Execu- 
I Board authorized the Secretary to use |50 in paying 
ress charges and other necessary expenses in getting toler 
a library for this society. The Secretary has finished 
the reports of Illinois, and all of Iowa, I think, except 
e of the very early volumes. Kansas and Missouri are 
;ely in, also a majority of the states having horticultural 
eties have a good showing of their reports. I am still 
king on that subject. I will say, however, that the $50 
ains untouched, as the regular allowance of the Secre' 
for express and postage has been found sufficient for 
needs in this line. 

I:gislative Work — At our last annual meeting we had 
; conflab relative to legislative work, and at that time 
as deemed inexpedient to pay anybody's expenses to 
here at Lincoln and look after the Society's interest*; 
equently those who did that work had to do it gratis, 
recent meeting of the Executive Board the Secretary 
instructed to cultivate the acquaintance of the members 
e house and senate, and I wish to say that that work has 
thoroughly done. I have cultivated the acquaintance 
le members to such an extent that I am now second </seg>

titant clerk of the house and in a position to look after 
interests of this society. 

ItEPORTS — We have on hand at this time only eight hund 
copies of the 1900 report. More care must be taken in 
ir distribution, or we shall soon find ourselves short. Of 
old reports many volumes are entirely gone; I even find 
mpossible to secure enough to exchange with libraries. 
1 while I am along this line, if any of the members have 
orts for the years 1891, 1890, 1887, or 1888 which they 
not care to keep, if they will send them to Lincoln the 
retary will be very glad to pay 'the express charges on 
m in order to close up some sets for libraries. 

Buffalo Exhibit — I think I voice the sentiment of everybody 
in this state when I say that I believe the Buffalo exhibit 
to be the best advertising medium possible for our state 
to have. We will come in contact at Buffalo with more people, 
and a better class of citizens, than in any other way. 
I think it would be good policy for this society to take up 
the question of making an exhibit either along the line of 
forestry or fruit, or something in that line. In my opinion 
a forestry exhibit would attract more favorable attention 
than anything else this society could put up. Everybody 
realizes that we grow hogs and corn, and that we grow some 
fruit, but they have no realization of the fact that we have 
any trees in Nebraska. I believe a forestry exhibit can be 
put up at Buffalo with very little expense. At the present 
time we are cutting down on my place Scotch and Austrian 
Pine, European Larch, Catalpa, and some other varieties of 
ornamental trees that are thirty years old. We are taking 
them out because they are in the way, and it would be very 
little expense to get sections of those trees. I presume other 
members of the Society have native or planted trees that 
could be obtained, so that with no great expense a very 
creditable exhibit could be gotten together. 

Bulk Exhibit — I am thoroughly convinced of this fact: 
that a bulk exhibit of fancy, showy fruit at our fairs and ex- </seg>


            <seg id="p017">
17 

positions will attract more attention and do more good than 

all the tables of competitive exhibits you can put up. In a 

competitive exhibit we must necessarily have a number of 

varieties that are insignificant in size, off in color, and per- 

haps more than half green, so that people know but very 

little about them. But if you can put up an exhibit largely, 

say, of apples like Wealthy — a great mass of large, showy 

fruit, it will attract more attention and do more to arouse 

an interest in fruit growing than a lot of plate and collective 

exhibits where all varieties and sizes and colors are mixed up 

together on the tables.

The president appointed the following committees: 

Committee on Secretary and Treasurer's Report and President's 
Address, L. M. Russell, G. 8. Christy, A. J. Brown. 

Committee on Revision of Premium List, L. C. Chapin, 
Pctef Youngers, C. H. Barnard. 

Irof. F. W. Taylor was introduced and spoke relative to 
Pan-American Exposition to be held at Buffalo during 
summer of 1901. He urged upon the society the importt 
of making an exhibit at that exposition. 

I[r. Chapin — In connection with what has been said by 
fessor Taylor, I move you that a committee be appointed 
the chair to prepare resolutions in regard to the Panerican 
Exposition, and present the same to this society 
action at a later meeting. 

The motion carried. 

Khe President — I will appoint as such committee, L. C. 
pin, Lewis Henderson, and G. S. Christy. 

At this point recess was taken until Wednesday morning 
;it ten o'clock. 

Second Session, Wednesday Morning, January 16. 

Ee secretary introduced Hon. Silas Wilson, of Atlantic, 
, as the delegate from the Iowa State Horticulture 8o, 
and Mr. Henry Augustine, of Normal, 111., as delegate 
the Illinois State Horticultural Society. 

On motion these gentlemen were made honorary annual 
members of our society. 

E3E President. — We are glad, indeed, to have these visitbrethren 
with us, and should like to hear a few words 
l each of them. 

Mr. Wilson. — I can assure you it affords me no small degree 
of pleasure to have the privilege of being here with you as 
a delegate from the Iowa State Horticultural Society. I am 
somewhat conversant with your work in this state, and you 
are certainly to be congratulated upon the success you have 
attained. I am pleased to see the interest that is manifested </seg>

here at this meeting. This is not my first meeting with you. 
I have come in contact with your leading members at different 
places: at Chicago, and at the Trans-Mississippi Exposition 
at Omaha, and I must confess that you did well in those 
exhibits. You made an impression abroad that reflects great 
credit on the commonwealth of Nebraska. But Mr. President, 
I came here to learn, and I do not believe I shall be 
disappointed, because, as I said a moment ago, I know something 
of your success and the ability of your members. I 
thank you all for the very courteous welcome I have received 
at your hands. 

Mr. Augustine — Mr. President, I am glad, indeed, to be 
with you. I have felt for several years that there was not 
the degree of cordiality and cooperation between Illinois and 
Nebraska that ought to exist, and when we were near neighbors 
at the World's Fair, also at the Omaha Exposition, and 
I saw your exhibits there, I remembered that you are on the 
same line — in so far as agricultural interests are concerne 
— that we are, and I thought there ought to be a 
greater friendship, a closer fraternal feeling existing between 
the two societies. Consequently, I was more than delighted 
when it was announced that we were to have a delegate 
from your society this winter, but by some mishap he 
failed to appear. I was very glad you took the initial step, 
¦o we could have an excuse to send a delegate to your society, 
to steal all he could get and take it home. 

I think these fraternal visits are very valuable, indeed, 
and I am glad to see that you are interested so thoroughly 
in horticulture. I am glad to see so many young men in 
your society, and I shall expect to enjoy my two days' stay 
with you very much, indeed, and learn all that I can and 
take it back home with me. I hope that we shall have visits 
from your society every year in the future. 

I heard your President say that you are already two or </seg>

more of your time I thank you for this opportunity. Applause.] 


The following reports were presented :

lined the same and find them correct in every particular.

Committee. 

KVe, your committee appointed on President's Address,

Committee. 

On motion, the foregoing reports were adopted as read. 

L. C. Chapin read the following resolutions and moved 
their adoption: 

Ehereas, The Pan-American Exposition will be held at 
alo during the summer of 1901, and 

Ehereas, There seems to be a prevailing opinion in the 
, that Nebraska is outside the fruit-growing district of 
United States, thereby keeping many desirable people 
i locating in our state, and 

Whereas, We believe that the horticultural products of 
Nebraska will compare favorably with those of any other 
state in the Union, and that a proper showing of those interests 
at the Pan-American will do more to dispel those 
erroneous opinions, favorably advertise the state, and thus 
induce the better class of home-seekers to locate within our 
borders than the same amount of money expended in any 
other direction, therefore be it </seg>

Directors: Lewis Henderson, Omaha; E. F. Stephens, 
Crete; W. J. Hesser, Plattsmouth. 

Mr. Barnard — At the summer meeting at Johnson Mr. 
Benton Aldrich paid a membership fee of |5. In looking 
over the old records I find that he was one of the charter 
members of this society, though in some way his name had 
been dropped from the list of members. I therefore move 
you that a warrant be drawn for f5 in favor of Mr. Aldrich 
to reimburse him for membership fee paid twice.

See Special Rules under Class 3. 

rg for Judging Fruits, with a Scale of Points. — General 
Rules. 

1. In all cases the judges are to be governed by the letter 
and spirit of the schedule under which exhibitors have made 
their entries. The general appearance of the fruit, care in 
its selection, and taste displayed in its arrangement or grouping, 
each entry being distinctly separated from the rest; 
these are all elements of the highest importance, and should 
receive appropriate consideration by the committee. 

I. In every group, whether the single plates, the threes, 
s, tens, or larger collections of fruits, there should never 
more than one plate of any variety in any one group. 
ts of names of varieties exhibited shall accompany each 
up, and must be attached to the entry card, and have a 
responding number and designation — with or without exitor's 
name, according to rule. 

3. The same plate of fruits can not compete for different 
prizes, though the several entries for the best ten, five, or 
other numbers, and the best plate, may embrace the same </seg>

they must be duplicates, and in sweepstakes they will count 

for a single variety. 

4. When the schedule prescribes the number of each kind, 

usually three to five, to be placed on exhibition, the exact 

number must be presented. 

5. In general collections of fruit by individuals, counties, 

or otherwise, when the several species of fruits are specified 

in the schedule, they must be presented, or the collection may 

be passed by the committee. 

6. In all cases, but more especially in the display, or great- 

est and best collections, number of varieties is the prima 

facie test of superiority, other things being equal ; but qual- 

ity, relative value, their perfect condition and tasteful ap- 

pearance will be considered, and should rank thus, respect- 

ively: First, number; Second, quality or value; Third, con- 

dition, approaching perfection ; Fourth, taste in display. To 

illustrate on a scale of ten : 

No. 1 may have 100 plates, the largest collection 10 

Quality : some inferior varieties 5 

r; 

( 'ondition of fruit : rather poor 5 

Taste in display 5 

Total 25 

No. 2 may have 90 plates, ranking 8 

Quality : superior in most, ranking 8 

Condition of fruit : perfect, ranking 10 

Taste in the arrangement: good, ranking 8 

Total 34 

No. 2 would in this case take the premium 

In the case of single plates of the several kinds named, or 

in a competition for the best plate or basket of any kind of 

fruit, we may consider condition, form, size, color, and tex- 

ture, with flavor.

Special Rules. 

The judges shall have an ideal standard of perfection in 
all cases, made up of the following particulars : 

1. The condition and general appearance of the fruit 
which must be in its natural state, not rubbed or polished, 
nor speckled, bruised, wormy, or corded; with all its parts, 
stem and calyx segments, well preserved, not wilted or shriveled, 
clean. 

tThe size, in apples and pears, particularly, should be 
ige, neither overgrown nor small. The specimens should 
en in size. 

¦ The form should be regular, or normal to the variety, 
the lot even. 

4. The color and markings, or the surface, to be in character, 
not blotched nor scabby. 

I When comparing different varieties, and even in the 
e kind grown on different soils, the texture and flavor 
important elements in coming to a decision. Five points. 

6. It shall be the duty of the superintendent to appoint 
two assistants, and they, acting in the capacity of a committee, 
shall remove all fruit not in a fit condition for exhibition 
at any time during the progress of the exhibition. 

7. No more than one plate of seedlings of any variety of </seg>

            <seg id="p036">
36 


Kt shall be recognized by the judges in any individual or 
lty display when awarding premiums. 

In the class peaches and plums, etc., the important elements 
are size, form, color, flavor, and condition. Five points. 

E grapes we must consider and compare the form and 
of the bunches, the size of the berries, their color, ripeflavor, 
and condition. Five points. 

In currants we shall have to examine the perfection and 
size of the bunches, and of the berries, their flavor and condition. 
Three points. 

In gooseberries we shall look at the size, color, flavor, and 
condition of the fruits. Four points. 

In judging cherries we have as our guide the size and form, 
color, flavor, and condition. Four points. 

E judging strawberries we shall compare the size and 
, color, flavor, firmness, and condition. Five points, 
shall be shown with stem and calyx. 

Eispberries may be shown with or without the calyx. In 
fruit we shall have to judge of the size, color, flavor, and 
ition. Four points. 

Blackcaps must have size, color, flavor, and condition. 
Four points. 

Klackberries must be tested according as they present size, 
r and form, flavor and texture, and condition. Four 
LtS. 

In all cases it is well to have a convenient scale of comparison, 
for which the number ten is found to be easily managed. 
The highest figure denotes perfection of the variety, and five 
is mediocre; below that is condemnatory. The total of the 
marks should exceed fifty per cent of the possible number, 
or the entry must be passed as unworthy of award.

REPORT OF THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 

iince the strawberry is quite extensively raised and i» heing 
more and more cultivated year after year here in Neska, 
the entomologist has thought it worth while to get 
'ther a brief report of the insect enemies of this plant and 
fruit. Following his customary plan of the past few 
•s, the present paper is made somewhat on the plan of a 
lograph, although, as will be seen, not nearly so complete 
ave been some of the past reports of this kind. 

Iie following bibliography will give the reader an idea as 
here the most important writings on this subject can be 
id, while the list of insects which follows will give him a 
on of what species among our North American insects 
i thus far been detected as enemies of the strawberry, 
le it is true that this list is quite an extensive one, it is 
fair to state that only a comparatively few of them are 
eiently numerous on the strawberry to be considered 
jerous. Most of this kind are taken up in the body of the 
rt, where they are somewhat fully described and figured ; 
remedies suggested. 

Kthe compilation of the list I was materially aided by my 
assistant, W. D. Hunter, and J. C. Crawford, Jr.

THE STRAWBERRY LEAF-ROLLER, 

As this European insect seems to be spreading and increasing 
quite rapidly in Nebraska, it will receive rather more attention 
here than some of the other insects enemies that are 
known to attack the strawberry. Since it has been quite fully 
described recently by Professor J. B. Smith in Bulletin No. 
149 of the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, I 
will give his account of it, instead of writing it up afresh. 
That account is as follows: 

(There are a number of species of small caterpillars that 
I upon the foliage of strawberry, and a number that fold 
neb up the leaves in whole or in part; but there is only 
that occurs in such numbers as to be really injurious; 
i is the larva of the little moth, pictured — many times 
natural size — at figure Id. 

"It is not a new pest by any means; it is one of our undesirable 
imports from Europe, where, however, it does not 
seem to be an injurious species on strawberry or other cultivated 
crops. Curiously enough, though the insect has been 
frequently bred by European entomologists, the complete 
life history has never been written, but the larval and pupal 
stages have been described. Dr. C. H. Fernald, of Amheret, 
a special student of the family of moths to which this little 
species belongs, was good enough to go over the literature 
for me, and assures me that such is the fact In the United 
States, the first good account of the insect is by the late Dr. 
C. V. Riley, who treated it in 18G9, in his first report on the 

(Phoxopteris eomptana Froehl.) </seg>

insects of Missouri. He records that in one place in that 
state they 'destroyed ten acres so completely as not to leave 
plants enough to set half an acre.' One of his correspondents 
was forced by the ravages of the insect to abandon strawberry 
culture, and another wrote 'where these insects are thick I 
would never think of raising strawberries.' 

"Since that time the insect has been frequently mentioned 
as injurious in many parts of the country, but rarely is it 
troublesome for more than a year or two in succession. It 
is also inclined to be local, and its ravages do not often extend 
over wide areas.

LIFE HISTORY. 

P moths make their appearance in the strawberry field 
the first half of May. I have found them abundant 
3th, at which time the majority were fresh and bright 
st hatched; but some were already faded, as though 
I been on the wing for days. In an ordinary season 
y be looked for at almost any time after May 1. 

E'he eggs are laid on the under side of the leaf, in confinet; 
probably also in the field. I expected to find them on </seg>

REPORT OP THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 

57 

the upper surface, because the leaves are always folded faces 
in; hence my field examinations failed at that time to discover 
the eggs. In captivity the moths mated freely and 
began almost immediately to oviposit on the half-grown 
leaves. The eggs are pale green in color, almost exactly 
like the under side of the strawberry leaf. They are round 
or oval, much flattened, very soft, and not more than half a 
millimeter or .02 inch in diameter. They are placed in the 
minute netting 6f the leaf, the mesh of which, when half 
grown, is just about the size of one of the eggs. They are so 
soft that they readily adapt themselves to any little irregularity 
of the mesh, and, as they are so flat that they do not rise 
above the level of the bounding network, they are almost invisible 
to any but the most careful examination. None were 
deposited on the very small or fuzzy leaves in confinement, 
and as size, color, and form all combine to make that the 
most natural place, we may fairly conclude that the eggs are 
generally laid on the under side of half-grown leaves. I did 
not ascertain the number that was or might be laid by one 
female. 

"The shell of the egg is extremely thin, and when the larva 
haa emerged it leaves behind it only the filmiest white skin 
that it is possible to imagine. It is badly torn when the 
caterpillar makes its way out, and when the location is not 
accurately known beforehand it was almost impossible to 
identify the remnant as an egg-shell. 

I In confinement larvae hatched in from five to seven days, 
I I found minute caterpillars in the field as early as May 
always on the upper side and nearly always on the midof 
a leaflet or lobe which was half grown or less. At that 
e there were no folded or webbed leaves anywhere to be 
ad. The little caterpillars were about an eighth of an 
1 long, had eaten a bit into the midrib to weaken it, and 
spun a few threads preparatory to drawing the surfaces 
he leaf together. 

"It is obvious, therefore, that when the young caterpillar </seg>

NEBRASKA STATE HOUTICULTUEAL SOCIETY. 

hatches it must make a journey from the under side of the 
leaf on which it was born to the upper side of the same or another 
leaf, and it feeds for a day or two at least, practically 
exposed, upon an open surface. The importance of this observation 
will be obvious when the matter of remedies comes 
under consideration. 

"At the time mentioned (May 13) about all the good fruit 
that the vines could be expected to bear had already set, 
while none of it was far enough advanced to bar the use of 
insecticides. Moths may be found on the vines until late in 
May or even in early June. Then they disappear, and during 
the first days of June the presence of the larvae becomes 
noticeable, increasingly so as the month advances. 

Irhe first full-grown larvae were obtained June 8, and on 
10th pupae were found, making a period of less than a 
ith — just about four weeks — as the length of the larval 
From these pupae the moths begin to emerge June 19, 
in turn began to oviposit June 22. This gives a period of 
ut nine or ten days as the length of the pupal stage, or 
o forty-two to fifty days from egg to adult. As the early 
Ii8 remain on the plants for nearly three weeks, moths of 
second lot keep coming on until the end of July, at which 
; the early caterpillars of the second brood are already 
ply full grown. 

"But this brood is a very inconspicuous one on the strawberries. 
For some reason blackberry and raspberry plants 
are at this time much more favored, and over the greater 
foliage area the injury is so distributed as to be insignificant. 
Parasites and probable predatory foes now appear, and the 
actual number of larvae coming to maturity is much smaller 
than in the first brood. 

"July 31, while very few larvae could be found on the 
strawberries, a number of full-grown examples were found 
on the blackberries, on which there were also plenty of examples 
half-grown and less. Moths of the third series come 
out in August from the caterpillars of the second brood i but </seg>

they also are comparatively few in number, are mnch scattered, 
and also frequent blackberry and raspberry much more 
than strawberry. Nevertheless, larvae not much over an 
eighth of an inch in length were found on strawberry plants 
very early in September, and many more were found on other 
food-plants. They are not so conspicuous even on the strawberry 
at this late period, because the ground is usually covered 
by a perfect mat of plants, and because the larvae themselves 
do not fold up so large a portion of the leaf or eat so 

(According to the account given by Riley, the larvae change 
wpae late in September and remain during the winter in 
t state, I have not observed this personally, but it would 
n to follow naturally from the observed occurrence early 
September. This completes the life cycle and gives us 
ee annual broods, of which only the first and early second 
at all injurious. 

APPEARANCE AND HABITS. 

"The adult moth is small, measuring with expanded wings 
about two-fifths of an inch. In general color it is a somewhat 
reddish brown, the four wings streaked and spotted with 
black and white, as shown in figure Id. When the wings are 
folded, the dark area at the base forms a somewhat conspicuous 
deeper brown patch in the middle of the back. The hind 
wings are of a soft, dark smoky gray, and both wings have 
long fringes. The insects fly readily during the middle of 
the day, and run rapidly on the leaves, diving to the under 
side or into a fold so quickly that it requires close watching 
to follow their movements. From the fact that newly-set 
fields are often infested, it is probable that they can and do 
fly for some distance to seek their food-plant. 

§he egg" has been already described, and nothing further 
be said on that point. The larva that hatches from it 
first very minute, light green in color, with proportionlarge 
head and long hair, which becomes inconspicuous </seg>

            <seg id="p062">

as the insect increases in size. It is not until it is nearly onequarter 
of an inch long that its effect upon the leaf becomes 
noticeable and that it succeeds in folding up a leaflet. At 
that time and afterward, until just before pupation, it is of 
a rather dark green color, the head and the shield on top of 
the first segment shining brownish, while the minute tubercles 
from which the hairs arise are a little paler in color. 
When full grown and ready for pupation it is nearly half an 
inch long and the color becomes more yellowish. In form the 
little fellows are slender and very active, wriggling about 
furiously when disturbed or removed from their webs. 

"As soon as it is hatched the little caterpillar makes its 
way to the upper side of a half-grown leaf, where the separate 
leaflets are not yet fully expanded, and stretches itself along 
the midrib. I have seen on such leaves little gnawed spots 
that make me believe that the larva feeds a little in that way 
before it begins to draw the leaf together. As a preparation 
for this, it eats into the midrib all along the side close to it, 
and very soon the upper faces of the leaflet or lobe are 
brought together and held in place by numerous silken cords, 
while the insect spins a partial tube or lining inside, in which 
it lives for the balance of its life. Unless disturbed by outside 
influences, this folded leaf is never left, and all the feeding 
is done altogether out of reach of ordinary insecticides. 
Often every lobe on the leaf will be folded and, occasionally, 
when infested leaves cover or touch, an irregular mass of 
foliage is bundled up in which as many as six or eight larvae 
may be found. Every leaf upon which one of these larvae 
feeds becomes brown, dry, and lifeless. 

"On blackberry not so large a part of the leaf is involved, 
and frequently only the tip of one of the leaflets is webbed 
up. Furthermore, the injury is more local, and only that 
part that is actually eaten is harmed. The total amount of 
food really devoured is very small, and were it not for the 
manner of feeding, which interferes with the nutrition of the 
leaf, the strawberry could easily spare tissue for all of these </seg>

            <seg id="p063">
BEPOBT OF THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 

61 

caterpillars that ever infect it. The blackberry loses little 
more than what is actually eaten. 

I "On the raspberry the habit is yet different. Here the 
rva gets into a partly-opened tip and webs it together so 
surely as to check growth. The actual eating shows a rusty 
ace on the upper side of the leaf, and not much other harm 
done. 

"Pupation occurs in the tube made by the larva. The pupa 
itself is brownish-yellow, without obvious processes or protuberances 
and a little more than one-fourth of an inch 

"In a folded leaf of this kind, and in the pupa state, it is 
probable that the winter is passed. It is quite likely that, 
late in the season, there are many more leaf-rollers on the 
strawberry beds than is usually believed, and it is not unlikely 
either that a little modification in the feeding habit may 
enable the plants to support at that time as many as were 
present in the spring, without showing much sign of injury. 

"When the moth is ready to emerge, the pupa wriggles forward' 
in its tube until the head case is forced out into the 
open air; then the moth escapes in the usual way, leaving 
the empty pupa shell sticking out. I found none of these 
empty skins in May, when the new moths were flying; but, 
on the other hand, search among the old leaves was unsatisfactory, 
with the new growth and fruit set overlaying all. 
Mrs. Treat, who has written concerning this insect, states 
that the fall pupation is underground, and that there the 
winter is passed. Hi ley does not directly state where pupation 
takes place, but from the fact that he recommends fall 
plowing to cover the pupa up, it is inferred that he believed it 
to occur as in the early broods. 

"Incidentally, the character of the injury caused has been 
already stated. The moths themselves do no harm. The 
little caterpillars fold over one or more of the leaflets, holding 
them together by silken threads. They feed inside the 
shelter so formed and in such a way as to cause the leaves to </seg>

wither and dry. A badly-infested patch begins to look 
seorehed early in June, and before the middle of that month 
looks as if a fire had been over it. The fruit, deprived of the 
food prepared by the foliage, stops growth, ripens undersized 
and prematurely, or shrivels up altogether, even before it 

NATURAL ENEMIES, 

"Among the caterpillars received from Cologne in early 
June were several that were attacked by an external parasite. 
This was maggot-like in appearance, dirty white in color, and 
about an eighth of an inch in length. It was attacked near 
the middle of the body of its host and usually on one side. A 
parchment-like cocoon was formed about the middle of June, 
and about the 20th there emerged a small parasitic wasp 
(proctotrypid) , which Mr. W. H. Ashmead, of the United 
States National Museum, tells me is Goniozus platynotae. 
There is no doubt that many caterpillars are destroyed by 
this parasite; unfortunately it is in turn subject to parasitic 
attack by an Eulophid, which seems to be undescribed, but of 
which I did not get material enough to justify Mr. Ashmead 
in giving it a name. Another point is that it is not until the 
caterpillar has accomplished its mischief that the Goniozus 
gets in its work; hence the usefulness of this parasite is not 
immediate. 

I A much more effective check is found in meteorological 
ditions. A few days of wet, chilly weather almost invariy 
checked the insects so effectually that little was seen of 
m afterwards. A cold, wet spring would be, therefore, 
for them. A warm, dry season would, on the other hand, 
or their development. 

REMEDIAL MEASURES. 

Eie only way to prevent damage from this insect is to act 
e theory that it will be injurious each year. If we wait 
we are certain that it will be present in harmful num- </seg>

            <seg id="p065">
REPOBT OF THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 

63 

bers, it will be almost too late to check the injury that is 
threatened. None of our insecticides can he applied so as to 
get into the shelter made by the caterpillar, and as this 
does not feed outside of its house, its protection is perfect 
We do not dare to apply penetrating insecticides for fear of 
their effect on the fruit, and, indeed, when the fruit is well 
advanced, all poisons must be, of necessity, kept off. 

"It will be remembered that it has been shown that just 
after it is hatched, and while the larva is yet very small, it 
wanders from its place of birth to the upper side of the leaf, 
feeding here and there, before settling down. It must be the 
object of the grower to poison the foliage so early in the season 
that when the young caterpillar starts feeding, it can find 
no foliage that it can safely eat. Therefore, as soon as moths 
are found flying in fair numbers, spray with Paris green or 
some other arsenite. As the plants grow rapidly and new 
leaves are being constantly added, spray again a week later, 
and the third time the week thereafter. This will catch 
the great bulk of the caterpillars that will become injurious 
in June, leaving only a very few that hatch late and can not 
cause much harm. 

"A single spraying will do comparatively little good, because 
the moths extend the egg-laying period over so long a 
time. The first larvae are almost full grown before the last 
eggs are hatched. As to the actual date of spraying, that depends 
upon the season and the time of appearance of the 
moths. Not when only a specimen is seen here and there in 
the field, but when from every row a moth can be scared every 
few feet or less. The insects fly readily at almost any time 
during the day, and sweeping over the vines with a brush of 
leaves will start up any that may be resting there. The 
grower who has had any experience with the insect will have 
no trouble in determining whether the moths are present in 
any numbers or not. 

"I have suggested Paris green as the spraying mixture because 
it is best known, though not the best material. Arse- </seg>

nate of lead is better and may be used at the rate of one pound 
in eighty gallons of water. Arsenate of lead may be obtained 
under the term "Gypsine" from the Bowker Fertilizing Company, 
Boston, Mass., ready for use; or the raw materials for 
preparing it may be purchased from the same company. Any 
good wholesale drug house will also supply arsenate of soda 
and acetate of lead. 

I Arsenate of lead is formed by dissolving four ounces of 
mate of soda in water, in one pail, and eleven ounces of 
tate of lead ( sugar of lead ) in another. Pour the two soons 
together into a barrel or tank, stir thoroughly, and 
as much water as needed, stirring constantly. Of course 
a forty-gallon tank only half the mixture should be used, 
s material has the advantage of being entirely harmless 
ilants and it sticks better than Paris green. 

"Green arsenoid may also be used, at the rate of one pound 
in one hundred and sixty gallons of water, and to this lime 
equal in weight to the poison should be added. Mix up the 
poison into a paste with water, slake the lime and strain it, 
then stir in the poison so as to mix thoroughly, and dilute 
with water for use. Green arsenoid is obtained from the Adler 
Color and Chemical Co., 100 William St., New York City. 

"If Paris green is used, it should be used in the proportion 
and prepared as directed for the green arsenoid to avoid 
danger of burning the foliage and also to make it stick better. 
If Bordeaux mixture is to be used against the rust on the 
leaves, the Paris green or green arsenoid may be added to it 
as if it were water, without any more lime, and the combined 
mixtures can be put on as needed. 

"If for any reason no timely applications were made and 
the fields become badly infested, nothing practical can be 
done until the crop is off. Then mow the beds, rake off all 
the foliage and burn it. You will burn with it all larvae and 
pupae that are then unchanged. Of course, this does not help 
for the year it is done. It simply lessens the number of </seg>

rs that come to maturity, and so helps somewhat for the 
following. 

"Old beds from which no more crop is expected should be 
plowed down in October to coyer up and destroy the hibernating 
pupae. This will be an extremely effective measure; 
therefore, if possible, old beds should be left as traps until 
October so as to induce the moths to breed there. The mass 
of foliage and the shelter afforded by the weeds that usually 
grow up after picking will prove very attractive to them. 

E^hen new beds are set out, the plants should be closely 
Md, and care should be taken that no leaf-rollers are on 
one of them. This may secure temporary freedom at 

I3n blackberry and raspberry no reaedtel measures have 
red necessary so far. If there arc many caterpillars preslate 
in the summer, it may pay to hand-pick all infested 
es or to crush the larva in the folded 1 eaf . This will tend 
jssen the number that live over the winter. 

"As to machinery to spray the strawberry field, a knapsack 
pump is best on areas of moderate size. With a Vermorel

THE STRAWBERRY ROOT LOUSE.

Iaother insect that is quite important as a strawberry

, is the one known by the above name. While this insect 
not yet appeared in Nebraska in sufficient numbers to

die off. Bare spots occur where all the vines have been killed ; 
the fruit is undersized, where any is present, and does not

indication of the presence of root lice. Their injury is done

they die off. Leaves also are attacked, but not much injury

LIFE HISTORY 

irhe insects winter in the egg stage. The eggs are very 
11, oval, black, shining, and are clustered upon the stems 
along tfct ribs of the green leaves. In early winter as 
y as sixty-live have been found on the stem and leaf 
ne leaf, but many of these fall off and are destroyed 
re spring. 

I flip eggi hatch during early April, the actual date deling 
somewhat upon the season, and the young lice feed 
upon the leaf upon which they were hatched, 
ever, thev work their way to the tender young leaves of 
crown and become full grown in from twelve to fifteen 
*. They are then wingless, parthenogenetic females, called 
in mothers," and bring forth their young alive, bearing 
¦ably fifteen or twenty in a few days. These young do 
differ perceptibly from the mother; they mature and in 
i reproduce, very much as she does, but not altogether 
[i the leaves. 

I Ants appear in the fields in considerable numbers late in 
•il and carry the young plant lice almost as soon as I 
lK&gt;rn from the leaves to tlie roots, through galleries pre 
Bd for that purpose. Prof. Sanderson says: 'The ants 
solely responsible for carrying the lice to the roots, as up 
be time of the ants' appearance no lice are to be found on 
roots. . . . When one plant becomes overcrowded 
apliids are carried to a neighboring plant, and in this way 
ants are almost entirely responsible for the spread of 
aphids throughout a bed, as well as for carryiug them to 
roots of the plants.' 

•The third brood of lice differs from the preceding two in 
that it becomes winged about the middle of May, and winged 
forms continue for three or four weeks later, from this 
and the early part of the fourth brood. These winged individ- </seg>

uals are a little smaller bodied than the wingless types and 
are apparently all black. They fly to other plants or even 
other fields, the distance covered by them depending on the 
wind. They fly farthest on a warm day in a gentle breeze, 
when they can keep a-wing without much effort and drift 
easily along. 

IiVhen they alight upon a strawberry plant the ants carry 
a also down to the roots unless these are already overrded; 
so most of the young, which are born alive as in the 
?less forms, are deposited upon the roots. Part of the 
¦th brood maturing early in June also becomes winged; 
thereafter no other alate forms occur. The lice go on relucing 
throughout the summer and until late in the fall, 
brood following another at intervals of from ten to fifteen 
s until about November 1, in Delaware. It is probable 
; in south Jersey they would continue to about the same 
od in ordinary seasons. 

"Late in October and during November the offspring of a 
brood of viviparous females develop into true females and 
males which pair and produce the eggs that hibernate. These 
oviparous females much resemble the summer broods, though 
the color is green, often with a yellowish or reddish shade in 
the middle of the abdomen. The males are smaller than the 
females, and much resemble the third stage of that sex. They 
are very much in the minority, the proportion being somewhere 
near thirty-five females to one male. Each female deposits 
four eggs upon the leaves or steins as already described. 
It is probable that in some cases individuals of viviparous 
form may also live through the winter, and this may be a normal 
occurrence in the southern states. In New Jersey, I believe 
the egg to be the usual hibernating stage. 

"The insects are spread either by the lice or the eggs being 
introduced upon the plants in setting the beds, or by the 
winged lice, or by being transported by ants. Usually they 
are introduced into a new bed from the nursery or from old </seg>

REMEDIAL MEASURES. 

"Satisfactory remedial measures, strictly speaking, we A&gt; 
not have. The experiments made by Messrs. Powell and Sa» 
derson, in Delaware, seem to indicate that when once the insects 
have established themselves in a field, they are beyond 
the reach of ordinary insecticide application. They are 
above ground during the early part of the season only, and 
the sole chance for any poisons is at that time, before the ants 
appear. Drenching application of tobacco extract directed 
into the crown will probably destroy many of the lice, bat 
when once the presence of the aphids is actually known the 
plants have already suffered so much that insecticide application 
savors more of attempt to put life into a dead body than 
anything else to which they can be compared. Nevertheless, 
where eggs are noticed on healthy plants, such an application 
may lessen the injury very materially and may secure a 
crop which would have been otherwise lost. 

"Prof. Sanderson summarizes the preventive measures in 
Me sentence : 'Clean plants must be planted upon clean land.' 
If this is done, the natural spread of the insect from other localities 
is so slow that a field of any extent is not likely to become 
injuriously infested during its productive life. Clean 
plants are such as to contain no lice in any stage on either 
roots or leaves. To secure such plants they should be preferably 
bought in localities where the insect does not occur. 
Never use plants from an infested field if it can possibly be 
avoided, and do not buy in districts where the louse is known 
to occur, if it can be prevented. If buying from infested districts 
is unavoidable, try to secure plants from vigorously 
growing fields showing no signs of infestation. If only infested 
or probably infested plants can be obtained, they 
should be treated as hereinafter described before being set

I'm it as far away as possible. 

"Assuming that it is impossible to get clean plants, no attempts 
should be made to set them until all the eggs have 
hatched; for none of our insecticide methods will kill i 
with any degree of certainty — not eyen fumigation. This 
would mean not much, if any. before the middle of April, 
and no harm will result from delaying even longer. 

"Plants may be cleaned by either dipping or fumigation. 
For dipping, kerosene emulsion or tobacco decoction may be 
i. The kerosene emulsion should be diluted with twelve 
parts of water. Shake the plants free from dirt and submerge 
them completely; keep them covered not more that three ininutes 
and then wash well in fresh water. This should kill all 
the lice then on the plants if well done.

Fig. 4— Fumigation box for Strawberry Root-louse. [After Sanderson.] 

"Fumigation, Prof. Sanderson believes to be the quickest, 
cheapest, easiest, and most certain way to destroy the aphids. 
If this is done by a nurseryman, the plants should be spread 
out on trays to facilitate the spread of gas, and one ounce to 
one hundred cubic feet of cyanide should be used for ten 
Etes. Three-quarters of an ounce may be used for twenty 
tes. This will kill the plant lice, apparently without 
to the plants. 

"For work on a small scale. Prof. Sanderson describes a

air-tigbt box similar to that shown in Fig. 4. This box is 
2 x 2 x 2\ feet, without a bottom, made of two thicknewei 
of matched wainscoting, with building paper between; the 
cover closes upon a rabbet the depth of the thickness of the 
material and lined with felt; a small door about 6x6 inclxs 
is placed at the lower corner and similarly fitted so as to 
close on the felt ; four or five frames covered with wire netting 
rest upon the cleats, the lower one being about three 
or four inches above the ground and extending clear across 
the box, being about five inches apart. Such a box will hold 
from 1,500 to 2,000 loose plants, placing only one layer on a 
frame, which permits a quick and thorough diffusion of the 
gas.' The only other apparatus necessary is a cup or tumbler 
in which to generate the gas. 

"This box contains ten cubic feet, and requires forty-five 
grains of cyanide for a ten-minute fumigation. . For such 
small quantities the cyanide, which must be 98 per cent pure, 
is best dissolved in two drachms of water, and this had better 
be done by a druggist, who can make up in separate vials 
as many doses as may be needed. There should be an equal 
number of vials of the best-grade commercial sulphuric acid, 
each containing one and one-half drachms of the acid. 

"When ready for work, place the box on a level spot so it 
rests solidly all around, bank up on all sides six inches or 
more, and pack firmly. Place the plants upon the trays in 
single layers, close and fasten the small door, uncork the vial 
with the cyanide solution, and put it, mouth downward, into 
the cup; immediately thereafter drop in the acid in the saino 
way, close the door tightly, and keep closed for full ten minutes. 
Then lift the top and allow the fumes to escape before 
taking out the plants. 

"All these materials are violent poisons, and the gas is 
fatal if inhaled by man or animal; therefore care is advisable, 
and the vials of cyanide solution should always be locked 
up until needed and conspicuously labeled 'poison.' The </seg>

the cup after fumigation is complete should be poured into 
a hole and covered over with earth. 

"It might seem as if, with all these obstacles and all this 
required apparatus, the strawberry grower had fair cause 
for discouragement. But matters are not so bad as the first 
reading of this bulletin might indicate. It is necessary that 
I try to meet as many contingencies and possible conditions 
as I can. Let the grower first read the life histories carefully, 
then the recommendations for treatment, and then let 
him, keeping his own conditions in view, determine which 
of the suggestions meets his case best. Let him then ignore 
all else that is said on other points, and he will find a straightforward 
line of action outlined which he must adapt to his 
own special surroundings." 

STRAWBERRY SAWFLIES.

Another strawberry pest that deserves notice here is the 
one shown in the accompanying illustration in its different 
stages of growth. It belongs to that group of the Hymenopterous

curious and interesting process, in the stems of the plants, 
clinging the while to the hairy substance by which these 
stems are covered. The eggs are white, opaque, and ma.\

orifice at which they were introduced is scarcely visible. 
They soon increase somewhat in bulk, causing a swelling 
of the stalk, and hatch in two weeks — more or less, according 
to the temperature — and during the early part of May 
tlie worms attract attention by the innumerable small holes 
they make in the leaves. Their colors are dirty yellow

I 'Adult saw-flies of this new strawberry pest were found

"When first deposited the eggs (Fig. 6, o) are pure white, 
tapering towards both ends, one side slightly concave, the 
other quite convex; are .475 mm. wide by .875 mm. long. The 
point of deposition can hardly be seen at first, but the swelling 
of the eggs, due to the developing embryo, causes lightcolord 
blisters of 0.6-.75 by .75-1 mm. in size." 

"When ready to issue, the young larvae eat a small hole 
through the inclosing epidermis and emerge. At first they

iays contain larvae, since some buds, particularly those 
t were gathered late in the season, and which had been 
acked and killed, did not show when opened any evidence 
having been perforated for any other purpose than for 

"The flower-stems are cut at varying distances from the 
bud. An eighth of an inch might be given as the average, but 
specimens are commonly found that are punctured at both 
longer and shorter distances from the bud, from a sixteenth 
or shorter, to one and three-quarters of an inch and even 
longer. 

"The object obtained by the puncture of the flower-stem is 
two-fold'. First, the development of the bud is arrested, the 
outer envelopes or sepals and petals turn hard and dry, remain 
folded, and thus retain the pollen and the eggs or 
growing larvae of the insect. If the flowers are permitted 
to develop, the pollen, which furnishes the principal food supply 
of the larvae, would be lost and the larvae would, therefore, 
in any event die of starvation, if, indeed, they did not 
drop out when the flower opened or were not crowded out by 
the growing berry. Berries were seen that showed scars on 
one side as if development had been stopped at this point 
either by the punctures of the beetle or by the work of the 
larvae which had hatched and failed to mature. It is not to 
be believed that a single minute puncture made in the bud, 
such as so small an insect is capable of making, could possibly 
kill the bud, but a slight injury is sufficient to kill the 
narrow and delicate stem above the point of attack. The second 
result obtained is that the buds in most instances drop off 
in a few days to the ground, where it is kept more or less 
moist. If allowed to remain on the stem in ordinarily dry 
weather the injured buds would eventually become so dry as 
to prevent the development of the insect within. 

"To test this matter a quantity of injured strawberry buds 
with their contained larvae were kept in the insectory under 
different conditions or degrees of moisture. A number of the

larvae, a single individual to the bud, and a large number

buds that harbored two larvae, they occupied opposite sides 
and there was ample room and food for both. 

LIFE HISTORY. 

"Tin: BOG. — The egg of Antlionomiixt xir/natus is oval, and 
from about one-fifth to one-quarter longer than wide. The 
surface is perfectlj smooth and highly polished. It is translucent, 
and the general color is a pale yellow. In size the 
ither large in proportion to that of the adult insect. 
.Measurements of different eggs showed a variation of from 
B8 mm. in length to .37-.4T mm. in breadth. 

•ovii'osition. — The greater part of two days was spent in 
an attempt to observe the method of oviposition, to secure 
- for study, and to ascertain the period of incubation. </seg>

            <seg id="p085">
REPOKT OF THE ENTOMOLOGIST. 

83 

Although several females that were almost constantly under 
observation repeatedly punctured the buds, oviposition did 
not take place at this time. Subsequently, when the ini| 
oned insects had ceased work, eggs were discovered in these 
buds. Of the other buds that had been punctured in the 
breeding cages a few were opeaad and found to be empty. 
By this time it was too late to carry on this stage of inv&gt; 
gation, as the egg supply of the insects in confinement 
apparently exhausted. Although the females did not ovip 
while watched, it is presumed that some of the punctures 
were made for the purpose of oviposition, and enough was 
seen to demonstrate that this operation varies somewhat in 
method and time consumed according to circumstances. 

REMEDIES. 

E number of remedies have been suggested, a few have 
experimented with, but uone, so far as I know, have been 
illy tested. 

I Of insecticides, the arsenites are of doubtful value, and 
¦e is possible danger of poisoning the fruit. As already 
ited out in Dr. Ki ley's article on this subject, the ketm 
Ision, or pyrethrum dusted on the plants, would doubtless 
re effective against the adult insect while at work, and 
lime, or sawdust impregnated with crude carbolic add. 
ome other repellent, might be tried. 

tSow that the life-history of the insect is known, a numof 
other remedies suggest themselves. 

I In the first place, where staminate berries are extensively 
wn for the market, all wild plants and old strawberry 
s that might serve as breeding places for this and other 
» should be burned and cleaned away. There can be 
e doubt that the species under consideration, Anthonoi 
aignatus, is derived from the wild blackberry, and unless 
strawberry beds are completely covered over as described 
r on, all these wild bushes in the neighborhood of the 
wberry beds should be destiuvi.l. </seg>

"Another remedy- would be to collect the injured buds and 
place them in a box or barrel covered with cloth or wire 
netting with meshes just large enough to permit the escape 
&lt;&gt;f the parasites, which are considerably smaller than their 
host, but small enough to retain the beetles. A fine mesh of 
what is known as bobbinet mosquito netting would answer 
the puipose admirably. It is somewhat doubtfnl if this remcdv 
would be profitable except on small beds. The parasites 
undoubtedly of great value in keeping this insect in chock. 
l»ut it is probable that none of the four species observed this

THE STRAWBERRY CROWN-BORER.

One of the most important of our insect enemies of the

R almost disappeared in older ones. The prnthorax is 
ly and uniformly pitted. 

"Like a number of similar and closely allied beetles, it pretends 
to be dead when disturbed, and plays possum most perfectly, 
having the rather short and thick beak completely 
hidden beneath the head and thorax, and the legs are folded 
together and bent at the same time, so that no one would believe 
that this object could be a living insect. The beetles 
appear in June and July, and deposit eggs about the crown 
of the strawberry plant. When hatched the young larvae 
enter the crown, burrow downward, and bore and exca\ 
the substance of the crown until full grown, when they appear 
as represented at a in the illustration. After changing 
to a pupa the adult beetle appears during the month of 

Iiis insect has been gradually on the increase throughout 
jrn Nebraska since about 1885, when it was first observed 
be writer. It not only attacks the tame varieties, but 
works in the wild vines. As early as 1886 it was found 
ork in a number of strawberry beds in the vicinity of 
t Point, and in one instance almost destroyed a large bed 
veral thousand plants which the owner thought resulted 
drouth alone. It chose the Wilson in preference to the 
cent Seedling, upon which to work, at least three times 
any of the former as of the latter having been destroyed. 

REMEDY. 

Since old plants are more liable to be attacked by this insect 
than are new ones, it is not so dangerous an enemy after 
all. After two years a plant is about worn out, anyway, and 
Bhould be replaced! Therefore, to destroy this insect the best, 
and, by the way, about the only remedy is to dig up and 
burn the plants along with the larvae as soon as the fruiting 
season is over </seg>

STRAWBERRY BOOT-WORMS 

There are several very common l&gt;eetles aside from the 
Sti-a wherry Root-Borer that in their larval state are known 
tn attack the roots of the strawberry. These belong to at 
least three distinct gmia, viz., Par'w, Oolm$pi», and Qrmph 
opt, and their larvae all work in a similar manner. The 
life histories of these insects, however, "as far as known are 
curiously different in respect to the times and periods of their 
development. The larva of Colmtpis appears early in the seasun, 
and does its mischief chiefly in the months of April and 
.May, ilic beetles beginning to emerge in June. That the eggs 
¦K laid in the preceding year is highly probable, in which 
case the species hibernates in the egg. Paria, on the other 
hand, certainly passes the winter as an adult, doubtless laying 
its eggs in spring, and making its principal attacks upon 
the plants in June and July, the beetles emerging in the latter 
part of July and early in August. Graphopg hibernates in 
the larval condition, pupates in the spring, and emerges in 
May and June. The eggs are probably laid in July, and the 
larvae make their attack upon the plant in August and September, 
continuing it possibly to October as well." 

Es larvae all three of these insects prefer the roots and 
i r ns of strawberry, and in fact are quite dependent upon 
kind of food. Sometimes they are so plentiful as to kill 
plants, as many as fifteen or twenty grubs having been 
id about the roots of a single plant. 

I he three insects mentioned above can be easily distinihed. 
The Colnxpis bruniua is usually of a yellowish 
' color, but ranges to yellowish brown. The body is smooth 
not shining ( See Fig. 13) . Paria canclla is usually shiny 
:k above, varying to brown, with four black blotches on 
wing covers. The legs and antennae are always pale. The

LIFE HISTORY. 

The life-history of these beetles, although differing slightly 
among themselves, may be summed up practically as follows : 
Shortly after pairing, the female beetles creep into the earth, 
especially wherever the soil is rough and loose and more or 
less covered by vegetation, and after depositing their i 
to the number of forty or fifty, die. These eggs hatch in from 
three to five weeks, and produce grubs that feed upon the 
roots of various plants and grow slowly for a little upwards 
of two years, when they change to the pupa stage; within cells 
in the ground which they construct for themselves. Within 
these cells the beetles remain during the remainder of the 
summer, fall, and winter into the following spring, when they 
&lt;ra\vl to the surface and are ready to take active part in the 
destruction of all kinds of tree foliage and to prepare for the 
propagation of future generations. 

REMKDIKS. 

I a account of their underground life the larvae or grubs

Iany of the beetles can be destroyed by jarring the trees

be drowned in boiling water or thrown into the fire and

cts to fight, — circumstances, of course, directing these 
ys against the enemy. In some instances the beetles can 
be destroyed by spraying the foliage of trees with either

FRINGE WINGS OU THKIPS. 

Among the insect enemies of the strawberry are several 
species of very small, delicate insects known as "Thrips." 
These are usually light colored creatures of about one-tenth 
of an inch in length, provided with four wings, and mouth 
parts between biting and sucking. They usually gather in 
the blossoms of various plants where they do considerable 
damage by gnawing away the parts of the flowers before they 
open or before they have time to set fruit. As a rule no

ER. ArcusTiXK — In Illinois we have lost hundreds of acres 
lants by this leaf roller, and we haven't been able to conthem 
at all. 

I'uor. Biuner — One of the methods used with considerable 
success on a small scale has been, at the time the leaves are 
very much rolled up, and the insect is in the chrysalis state. 
to cut off the leaves, pile them in piles, and burn them. Of 
course, in this way you destroy the plant to a certain extejit. 
but it will soon put forth new leaves and be even better than 
before, because in burning the leaves for these rollers you 
also burn the strawberry leaf rot. 

Silas Wilson — Can not the leaf roller be destroyed by 
spraying? 

Prof. Bruner — It can, but those insects which roll up the 
leaves are very much harder to reach than those which do not.

eration of these leaf rollers comes at the time when the fruit 
is on the vines, and if you spray then you lose the crop of 
fruit. Sometimes the second generation j 8 the disastrous one, 
and sometimes it is the first. 

Mr. Auui/stixk — If they are destroyed by burning, is it 
probable that next year the beds will be free from insects? 

Prof. Brixkr — Provided your neighbor does likewise. 

Silas Wilson — Is this roller the same as the apple leaf 
roller? 

Prof. Bkunbr — No, sir; the strawberry leaf roller is found 
on some other plants, but chiefly on the strawberry. 

Mk. Bakxard — Don't you think insects can be reduced to a 
minimum by annual plantings, not allowing the beds to grow 
old aud diseases to accumulate? 

EM*. Bum — Annual planting would hardly do. 
r. Bakxard — Well, not more than one or two years? 

Irof. Bruneb — The strawberry plant is of such a nature 
; frequent replacing of the beds would, as a rule, keep the 
et enemies down. If we leave a bed for years, and allow 
i run to old plants and new plants all mixed up, we can't 
;ct to jj;et rid of the insects. The beds should be kept 
•oughly cultivated, and renewed as often as possible. A 
e year old plant is too old ; the second year it is just right ; 
second year you get the largest crop of fruit. 

fR. Barnard — That has been our policy for the last twenty 
s, never to allow a lied to stand over three years, and the 
year we just let it bear what it will without cultivation. 

Mt. Ai'custixe — My method has been to practice mulching 
dariag the winter, and in the spring we do not remove the 
mulch, hut simply make room for the plants to come up 
throagfa. Then as soon as the fruit is gathered we watch for 
a warm, dry day, and set fire to the patch aud burn the ground 
as clean as this floor. In a very few days the crown beginshow

is capable of encasing itself more tightly, and thus protecting 
itself against spray better than the apple leaf roller? 

iROF. Bruner — I think so; but all of these rollers have to 
e out of the case to feed, and can be reached by the spray. 
r suggestion of burning is an excellent one, and I would 
that would be perhaps the best remedy you could bring 
inst all above-ground enemies. It is only by cultivation 
the frequent renewal of the beds that you can handle 
underground enemies of the strawberry. 

Prof. Emerson — If this method of burning is practiced, is 
there danger that the insects will become numerous between 
that time and fall? 

Krof. Bruner — There are but two generations; it is usually 
second generation that would be caught by the burning, 
very few would escape and live over until spring. 

IE. Meek — I have also practiced burning the leaves as soon 
he fruit is off, and I have never seen a leaf roller on my 
wherries. There is only one danger. Sometimes in a very 
summer, if the ground is very dry for any considerable 
h, there is danger that some of the plants will be injured 
lie roots; but if the ground is reasonably moist there is 
jst no danger of injuring the plants. 

NOTES ON THE APPLE SCAB. 

By Charles E. Bessey. 

A few years ago the Professor of Horticulture in the Uni-ity 
of Nebraska — Professor Card — planned an experiment 
for the purpose of showing the effect of spraying upon 
the Apple Scab. The work was carried out in the proper 
way, certain trees being sprayed while others were left without 
any treatment whatever; but great was the Professor's 
chagrin at the end of the season to find that there was no Bcab 
anywhere. Neither the uiuspiaved nor the sprayed treos ho re 
any scabby fruit. The experiment was a failure because the </seg>

Scab had not yet obtained a firm foothold in this favored 
state. Nebraska apples did not have this'enemy to contend 
With. I had to pick up imported apples in order to secure 
good specimens for study. But a change has come over this 
attractive picture, and now from different parts of the state 
comes the complaint of Scab on apples, and I fear that our 
previous immunity may not be enjoyed again. The disease 
is here, and here I fear it will remain. 

To the naked eye Scab appears first in the form of small 
brownish patches with vague and indefinite outlines, but later 
these become more definitely outlined. It often occurs that 
the disease makes no further progress, and the orchardist 
supposes that it is doing no harm to his fruit. It is true 
that the market value of his fruit is not apparently reduced, 
and he is content to do nothing to check the disease. However, 
when the disease is worse, there are solid black patches, 
from a quarter of an Inch to half an inch or more in diameter, 
which distort and disfigure the fruit so badly as to entirely 
destroy its market value. Now these large black patches are 
of the same kind as the smaller ones, the only difference being 
that the latter are less developed than the former. Scab is 
thus a much more common disease than is commonly supposed, 
but fortunately for the commercial orchardist it often 
¦tl in the practically harmless form just described. 
Apples which have only the small brown patches on their 
skins are commonly considered to be free from the Scab, 
while it is a fact that they have the disease in a mild form, 
and between this form and that which injures the market 
value of the fruit there is every gradation. It is certain, 
moreover, that, as in the case of human disease, the mild form 
of Scab is the means by which the more virulent form of the 
disease is propagated, and that in this way the trouble is 
continued from year to year. I am convinced that this supd 
harmless form of the Apple Scab is largely responsi- </seg>

ble for the continuation of the disease, and that we must no 
longer ignore it in our treatment.* 

On studying the disease we find that it is caused by the 
presence of a fungus which spreads its branching thread* 
out a portion of the surface of the fruit, penetrating only 
the superficial cells, and not invading the deeper lying tissues. 
When these first start they creep over the surface, branching 
very freely, and producing smoky-brown patches, but 
later, on these minute threads there appear small Mack 
specks where the threads are more densely massed. Still 
later the characteristic larger black patches appear, usually 
bordered by a very narrow margin of dead, whitish 
epidermis. In these patches the spores of the fungus are 
produced. They are far too small to be seen by anything less 
than a good compound microscope, and I need not say any 
thing more about them than that they readily blow from tree 
to tree and thus serve to spread the disease. Some of the 
German botanists have made out that there is still a later 
stage in which still another crop of spores is produced, but 
of this I have myself seen no specimens. 

As long ;is it was supposed that the first crop of si&gt;ores was 
all that the fungus produced, it bore the scientific name of 
Fusicladium dendritic um and under this name the Apple 
Scab is generally described, but if we are to accept the view 
of the German investigators the fungus must bear the name 
of Yenturia chloronjiora. I am inclined to accept this later 
view of the nature of the parasitic fungus, and accordingly 
I adopt the second name. 

A further close study of the fungus shows that it is not 

iiOTE —On almost all apples there occur small black specks which have 
snii|x&gt;«ed to be the earlier stages of the Scab. They are about as large 
Hy-speckB," and occur in clusters of a dozen to a hundred or more. It is 
agreed, however, that this is a distinct disease, and for it the name of 
• Speck Disease " has been proposed. It is due to the presence of a mifunjfus 
which has been id ntitied as Leptothyriuin pomi. It is apparently 
(less, or nearly so. However, when too abundant it injures the appearof 
the fruit. Doubtless the remedies recommended further on for the 
will be efficacious in checking this one also. </seg>

confined to the fruit, but that it spreads its branching threads 
over the leaves, especially on the under surfaces. Here one 
may quite easily find the smoky brown patches which indicate 
the presence of the parasite, and after a little practice it is 
not difficult to detect it by the yellow and unhealthy look of 
the leaves themselves. Young trees are especially subject 
to the leaf form of this disease, and no doubt here are laid 
the seeds of the disease which will eventually break out in 
such damaging form on the fruit, perhaps years afterwards. 
I have seen this leaf form more than once on the leaves of 
young trees near Lincoln. It is certain also that this leaf 
form spreads down upon the young twigs, so that when the 
leaves fall at the end of the season the fungus is still on the 
tree, and from the affected twigs it easily spreads again to 
the new leaves, and the young fruit each year. 

I 'ere, then, we have a fungus which affects leaves, twigs, 
fruit, and after the leaves and fruit are removed it still 
ins a foothold upon the tree. These facts must be taken 
i consideration in applying remedies or proposing means 
prevention. 

Since the leaves may be more or less affected it will be well 
to give attention to them. They should be burned or plowed 
under. Either treatment will prevent the possibility of infection 
of the trees the next year from the leaves of the 
preceding year. If the leaves arc burned this should be done 
late in the fall after all the leaves have dropped. If plowing 
is resorted to it should be done as early in the spring as possible, 
before the fungus on the fallen leaves has had time 

E; is necessary to do more than this if we hope to reduce 
amount of Scab. It has been found that spraying is one 
he best preventives which has yet been suggested. This 
ich an important operation that I lay before you at some 
;th the results of a number of investigators. 

As long ago as 1887, Mr. Scribner, of the United States </seg>

NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

Department of Agriculture, recommended the following 

treatment : 

"(1) In early spring before the buds have commenced to 

expand, spray the trees thoroughly with a solution of sul- 

phate of iron, using 4 pounds of the iron sulphate to i gallons 

of water. 

"(2) As soon as the fruit has set, apply the Bordeaux 

mixture or one of the modified preparations of eau celeste 

»:luding the ammoniacal solution of carbonate of copper.) 
(3) If the weather should be such as to favor the de- 

velopment of the Scab fungus, a third application should 
be made two or three weeks after the second, using the same 

materials. 

"In storing the fruit for winter, special care should be 

rto separate all the apples showing any signs of the 
from those which are smooth and healthy, and they 

all should be kept in rooms or cellars free from moisture." 
The formula for making the ammoniacal solution of car- 

"Dissolve the copper carbonate in the ammonia, then add 

the solution to the given amount of water." 

Mr. Blair, of the Illinois Experiment Station, recommends 

spraying with Bordeaux mixture just before the flower buds 
open. He sprays also immediately after the blossoms have 
fallen, and in some cases two weeks later again. It is his 
practice to make a combined solution of Bordeaux mixture 
and Paris green, and to use this, so that in one spraying 
both the Scab fungus and the Codling Moths may be 

destroyed. 

A recent bulletin from the Massachusetts Experiment Sta- 

tion, by Mr. Stone, contains a slight modification of the fore- 

going method as follows : 

mate of copper is given by him as follows : 

"Carbonate of copper (precipitated) 3 oz.

[st application, Bordeaux mixture, when buds are 
lg. Second application, Bordeaux and Paris green, 
•efore the blossoms open, for Canker Worm and 
lio. Third application, Bordeaux and Paris green 
blossoms have fallen. Fourth application, 8-10 days 
Fifth application, Bordeaux, 10-14 days later. In 
f wet season use dilute copper sulphate solution for 
u September. These applications are also made for the 
je of combatting the Codling Moth, Tent Caterpillar, 

|[r. Corbett, of the West Virginia Experiment Station, 
iks as follows in regard to the best treatment : "This dui 
is prevented by spraying the plants, before the buds 
ik in the spring, with a solution of Copper Sulphate, 1 
nd to 15 gallons of water. As soon as the blossom buds 
well formed, and again as soon as the blossoms fall, the 
» should be treated with Bordeaux mixture and Paris 
jn or London purple ; repeat this in two weeks and again 
wo or three weeks, depending upon the weather. If it is 
ly, spraying should be done more frequently than would 
necessary during a dry period, as the rains wash the 
ivs off the fruits and foliage, leaving them exposed to 
attack of the fungus which is more active during warm, 
st weather than during a dry time." 

Mr. Chester, of the Delaware Experiment Station, shows 
graphically by a series of diagrams that spraying with Bordeaux 
mixture becomes increasingly effective year by year, 
its effect being cumulative, until finally it fully prevents the 
disease. He sprayed three or four times each season twice 
before blossoming and once or twice afterwards, the intervals 
being about two weeks in length. 

Mr. Jones, of the Vermont Experiment Station, reports 
upon the results of spraying, in- which the first solution used 
was Copper Sulphate, applied while the buds were all still 
closed; this was followed with five applications of a Bordeaux 
Paris green mixture — the first before blossoming </seg>

and the next sometime afterward. The subsequent applications 
were about the middle of July and in the first few days 
in August. In commenting upon the results he says : "The 
results were most striking. Owing to the peculiar climatic 
conditions of the summer, the Scab fungus was unusually 
destructive upon both the leaves and the fruit of those trees 
not fully protected. In the latter part of the summer it was 
practically impossible to find a single leaf or apple upon the 
uusprayed trees which was not blotched by the Scab fun. 
whereas the trees sprayed most thoroughly were almost entirely 
free from the disease." A little later he says further: 
"The importance of the first and second applications is 
clearly demonstrated. It is not equally clear that the fourth 
and fifth applications were profitable, but they probably 
were, under the conditions of weather of 1897. Previous exlR*rimente 
have shown that in a dry season three or four 
applications are sufficient, the later ones being omitted." 

Iie lessons from the foregoing are very obvious. We may 
control Apple Scab by spraying. For the present I 
Id recommend that wherever this disease has obtained 
jthold in Nebraska the orchard should be sprayed at 
twice, once just before blossoming and once shortly 
1 the blossoms have fallen. For the present I will content 
;lf with recommending but one solution, namely Borx 
mixture. For convenience I append Professor Selby's 
!tiona for making Bordeaux mixture, this being what is 
vn as the "dilute mixture." 

Engredients: Copper Sulphate (blue vitriol), 4 pounds; 
k lime (not air slaked), 4 pounds; water to make 50 
&gt;ns. 

"Dissolve the Copper Sulphate in about two gallons of 
hot water contained in a wooden vessel, with stirring, or 
even better, by suspending the sulphate, contained in a cheesecloth 
bag, in a large bucketful of cold water. With the cold 
water and cheese-cloth bag longer time is required. Pour the

and fill one-third to one-half full of water. Slake the lime 
by the addition of a small quantity of water, and when slaked 
cover freely with water, and stir. Pour the milk of lime thus 
made into the copper sulphate, first straining it through a 
brass wire strainer of about 30 meshes to the inch. Pour 
more water over the remaining lime, stir, and pour into the 
other ; repeat this operation until all the lime but stone lumps 
or sand is taken up in the milk of lime. Now add water to 
make 50 fjallons in tank. After thorough agitation the mixture 
is ready to apply. The mixture should be made fresh 
before using and any left over for a time should be thrown 
out or fresh lime added. 

"For spraying cherries and peaches in foliage, it is hardly 
safe to use the strength given. Half the amount of lime and 
blue vitriol, or 2 pounds of each to 50 gallons of water — a 
150 gallon formula — is strong enough." 

DISCUSSION. 

ER Youngers — In our spraying we use the Bordeaux mixin 
connection with the Paris green, and we have had very 
s trouble with scab. 

Dr. Bessey — How many times do you spray? 

Mr. Youngers — Three and four times. 

Dr. Bessey — And you don't find that too much of a burden? 

Dr. Bessey — Do you use Bordeaux every time? 

EL Youngers — Yes, sir, and the orchard shows for it. 
the exception of Cooper's Early White there was no 
in the orchard the past season. In the nursery we spray 
six to ten times during the season. For instance, on our 
y trees we have to fight the rust, but by the use of Borl 
we are able to retain the leaves clear up until fall. 

Dr. Bessey — I think Mr. Youngers is just in a position to 
help us out. So many people have the idea that spraying is a 
very expensive and burdensome operation that it is difficult 
to interest them in the subject I think Mr. Youngers is in a

position to tell the mem tiers of the Society something as to the 
expense and trouble in the matter of spraying. 

Mr. YorxfiERS — I made a report at the request of 1'mf 
Card, in which I gave ;in itemized statement of the expense of 
a season's spraying. That report was published in a bulletin 
"d by this university. I do not now remember the exact 
figures, but the ezpeaw on a fourteen-year-old orchard \\;is 
about two cents per tree for the season. I remember the last 
time over we sprayed the twenty-four acres in twenty-three 
hours with three men and a team. 

Et. Bmbt — I think Mr. Youngers ought to tell that story 
7 time the subject of spraying is brought up; it would do 
1 to dispel the prevailing opinion that spraying is very 
ensome and expensive. 

I[r. Youngers — In making the solution, our method is not 
hrow the sulphate of copper into the water, but to susd 
it in the water in a gunny sack. We use about six 
nds to fifty gallons of water, and usually dissolve enough 
four barrels at a time. By taking twenty-four pounds and 
pending it in about half a barrel of water at night, all 
have to do in the morning when you are ready to go to 
k is to add enough water to make the required amount ; 
i in the morning suspend another twenty-four pounds in 
same way, and it is ready for use in the afternoon. 

IMPROVEMENT OF APPLES FOR NEBRASKA. 

By Prof. Emerson. 

In the development of any new region a host of new and 
cult problems comes up for solution. To one coming 
a an older region the difficulties seem at first insurmount!. 
Thus it is that settlers from the old fruit regions of 
East so often deceived themselves into believing that fruit 
Id not be grown on the prairies of the West. They came 
t, bringing with them the tried varieties and approved </seg>

109 

methods of the East, where fruit culture was being successfully 
carried on; and yet they met with many disappointments. 
The old methods and the old varieties could not always 
be relied upon. Is it to be wondered at, then, that they 
often became discouraged? Is it strange that they thought 
the problems of the West many times more difficult than 
those of the East? They forgot, as some people even at the 
present persist in forgetting, that the western problems were 
new, while the problems of the East were old and had been, 
in a measure, solved. They forgot, in short, that every question 
is hard when it is new, and that any problem is easy 
when once we know how to solve it. The problems of the 
West are not intrinsically harder than those of the E 
they are simply newer and not, as yet, so well understood. 
The people of the East at one time faced problems as difficult 
as ours. And we of the West may, perhaps, be pardoned for 
thinking sometimes that they attacked them with no better 
judgment than we ourselves display. For witness, consider 
the early and repeated attempts to grow, along the Atlantic 
coast, the European raspberry, the European gooseberry, and 
theEuropean grape according to the most approved European 
methods, while throughout the whole region grew the native 
relatives of these fruits in great profusion, waiting for a 
chance to be tried. 

I hen a region is new many varieties from other places are 
duced in the hope of finding something suited to its 
liar condition. But in more than a few instances little 
;ss has been achieved until the region has had time to de&gt; 
its own varieties. This will come about in Nebraska, 
t will take time. The bees must carry pollen from vario 
variety, making endless combinations ; the birds must 
ripened seeds in fence corners, along roadways, in 
at fields, in draws, on hillsides; cold winters must cut 
l the great mass of seedlings which lack hardiness; dry 
aers must weed out such plants as can not withstand 
ght; late spring and early fall frost must destroy those </seg>

that start growth too early and continue it too late; inand 
fungus diseases must also play their part in selecting ;i 
seedling adapted to the region. Then the trees or plants thus 
¦•ted must produce good fruit and flowers that shall, in 
time, attract attention from some horticulturist sufficiently 
interested in his work to propagate and disseminate them. 
All this takes time. It is nature's way. Nature has a great 
deal of time and is in no hurry to accomplish results. The 
average horticulturist can not await nature's motion and lms 
bttm for a long time, therefore, contriving all sorts of schemes 
to make plants grow where they do not want to. He has tied 
cornstalks about his peach trees and covered his raspbei 
and grapes with straw and dirt to keep them from freezing to 
death in winter; he has cultivated the surface soil, has applied 
a mulch of straw, has cut out the weeds, and has applied 
water by the bucketful and by the acre-inch to keep his plants 
from drying up; he has dusted them with lime and sulphur 
and sprayed them with Paris green, London purple, Bordeaux 
mixture, and all sorts of other concoctions calculated to kill 
or drive away the most troublesome insects and diseases; and 
his success along this line is a monument to his genius and 
perseverance. While the horticulturist has been thus engaged 
in overcoming difficulties by devising new and improved 
methods of culture, he has been watching nature 
slowly develop varieties of plants to resist the attacks of insects 
and fungi, to avoid frosts and to withstand drought and 

Now, if there is anything to be learned from all this it is 
that there are two principal ways of approach toward the solution 
of any difficulty met in horticulture, whether it be now 
or old. One is the development of methods of culture better 
suited to the conditions at hand ; the other is the development 
of more suitable varieties. As has been already noted, men 
have been following the first of these lines of approach for a 
long time, probably ever since plants were first cultivated. 
It is also true that the second approach has been entered. In- </seg>

deed work was begun here a century or more ago. Nevertheless 
it is plain that this side of the problem has not been developed 
with anything like the thoroughness that the other 
side lias. It is only within recent years that a considerable,^ 
number of horticulturists have interested themselves in the 
improvement of plants. That this line of work is coming to 
the frout must be conceded when we note the enthusiasm 
with which it is being taken up in all parts of the country. 
The hopes of modern pint breeders is not without foundation, 
for what nature lias done in this line men can at least 
approximate. True, nature has been working for agm in 
bringing about the results we see, but nature is haphazard in 
methods and wasteful of material. What nature has accomplished 
in centuries men may accomplish in decades by careful, 
scientific work. I am not one who would have you belit 
as some writers would, that the larger part of future iiuprn 
ment will be fortuitous. The mere fact that past improvement 
has come by chance is no surety that future improvement 
must come in that way. Many of the operations of plant 
breeding may be opposed to nature, but they are no more so 
than many of the successful methods of culture. The sooner 
we learn that horticulture, while looking to nature for suggestions, 
must not hesitate to oppose nature if necessary, the 
sooner we shall accomplish the results we desire. 

While not assuming that cultural problems in connection 
them? Some of these questions you can answer better than 
a beginning has been made, I shall not touch upon them hi 
but shall confine this paper to questions of improvement in 
apples for Nebraska. And I might add that, while I shall not 
neglect the former, I shall make the latter the principal line 
&lt;&gt;f work in the Horticultural Division of our Experiment Station. 
And this will apply, not only to apples, but to such 
other horticultural plants as I may, from time to time, take

them? Some of thcae questions you can answer hotter than 
I can. You can tell me what you want. I shall mention a 
few things which I believe to be important, and shall discuss 
means of securing them. We need more varieties of good 
quality for home Me and, may I add, more varieties of good 
appearance for consumption in New York and other "critical" 
markets. But one of the greatest needs of Nebraska. 
especially of southeastern Nebraska, is more good winter 
apples which will keep, with ordinary care, until summer 
apples rijK'n. An equally great need, especially of northern 
Nebraska, is more varieties of winter apples which are hardy 
enough to stand the severest winters. Yarieties for any part 
of Nebraska should be able to withstand occasional drought, 
shuuld be proof against blight even in our rich soil, and 
should produce regularly and abundantly. You can doubtless, 
all of you, think of many other desirable points which 
should be embodied in varieties of applet for Nebraska, but 
you will probably despair of ever getting all I have mentioned 
into any variety. I should say here that I do not consider it 
necessary that all of these qualities be combined in any one 
variety, but we should hope to combine enough good qualities 
in any variety to give it a decided value in some part of the 
State. While it is improbable that we shall succeed in securing 
a variety combining all the good qualities that I have 
mentioned, I do not believe that such a combination is impossible. 
We often hear it said that apples of high quality are 
•ssjirily inferior in size, but Professor Bailey has clearly 
shown that this is not true, since many varieties excellent in 
quality and appearance are rated large or very large in fruit 

iet us now consider the means of bringing about changes 
lants.and discover, if possible, in how far they are applicato 
the improvement of apples. We shall need to consider 
variations and sports, influence of climate, soils, etc., and 
ridization.

(netimes sport. A plant apparenttynormal in other re«ts 
will sometimes prance a branch quite unlike itself 
some character. A well known example of this is the 

origin of nectarines M hud sports from peseta* The only 
cases of this sort that I have seen are the sporting of gerani- 

ums and coleux. Aside from the production of russets from 
pceaiap and greenings from russcis. I have heard of no well 
authenticated cases of sporting in apples. We do not know 
what causes sports and therefore, of course, can not pro«: 
them. We can only watch for them, and if any valuable i 
arise preserve them, if possible, by bud propagation. Vaiia 
tions of a lesser degree are very frequently seen. Two apple 
trees standing side by side in the same soil on the same si' 
sometimes vary markedly in vigor and productiveness, though 
the scions from which both grew may have come from the 
same tree. Whether the peculiarities of these trees can be 
preserved and transmitted to other individuals by bud propagation 
has yet to be demonstrated. We often hear it recom 
mended to take scions only from trees which are known to be 
good bearers. I should, at least, consider it safe to avoid 
propagating from trees which are known to be barren. There 
are those who insist that the selection of scions should not 
only be practiced by nurserymen to insure good results, but 
that it is also one of the principal means of improving varieties. 
This may be true. Nevertheless I believe that we can 
not exj&gt;ect this practice to modify varieties profoundly, at 
least within the lifetime of any one man. The method, !&gt;¦ 
ever, may be valuable in producing minor improvements in 
varieties of apples. 

Now, what modifications may we expect to be produced 
through the influence of different climates, soils, etc., in short. 
through the influence of all those conditions which we know 
collectively as environment? We know in a general way 
that dry climates tend to develop plants with deeper root systems, 
more compact tops, thicker leaves or leaves with thicker 
epidermis, and increased hardiness. In short, dry climates

seem to develop just those characters which render plants 
better able to withstand dryness. This Mag weeded, it 
would seem desirable to secure varieties of apples which have 
ginated in comparatively dry climates. At least, theoretically, 
we should not expect the best results from varh 
which lrave originated in very moist climates. Again, it is 
known in a general way that plants which have developed in a 
m where certain diseases are prevalent will withstand 
their attacks much better than plants which have developed 
where no such diseases occur. As examples, you are all familiar 
with the resistance to phylloxera of native American 
grapes and the non-resistance of European grapes. It has also 
i observed that grapes developed in the semi-arid region(?f 
America, where fungus diseases are comparatively rare,are 
unable to resist the attacks of fungi when grown in the 
moister regions; while grapes which have been developed in 
moist climates are much more nearly resistant to these fungi. 
A case of this sort has come under my observation. The wild 
roses of Nebraska, which have developed without going 
through a struggle with mildew, are extremely sensitive to 
this disease when grown in the moist atmosphere of a greenhouse. 
We know that some varieties of apples are much 
more subject to attacks of blight than others. We know also 
that blight is more prevalent in the rich soils of our 
on than in the poorer soils of some other regions. It 
seems probable, therefore, that varieties of apples which develop 
here may be expected to suffer less from blight than 
varieties which originate in certain other places. 

In regard to northern and southern climates it is well 
known that, in general, the former tends to develop dwarf 
ness in plants, while the latter has an opposite tendency. 
Northern climates also seem to induce plants to start growth 
early in spring and mature it early in fall, thus shortening the 
season of growth noticeably. The standard example of this 
is the case of corn. We know that corn was originally a </seg>

long season for maturity. We also know that corn can now 
be grown in the far north, where it must mature in a few 
weeks rather than in as many months. This effect of clini 
on corn has been experimentally demonstrated more than 
once. Recently the Arkansas Experiment Station has grown, 
side by side, some varieties of corn from seed produced in the 
same latitude and from seed produced both north and south. 
A variety from Texas required two weeks more time for maturity 
than the same variety from Ohio. Northern climates 
are known to exert the same influence in shortening the period 
of growth of many trees and shrubs. Whether the effe&lt; 
found in apples I have yet to learn. If it be found to apply 
here, we should expect northern apples to mature earlier in 
fall and thereby be better prepared to withstand severe winters. 
On the other hand, northern apples might be expected 
to blossom earlier in spring, thereby being subject to injury 
from late frosts. We might also look for earlier ripening 
fruits from the North. Theoretically, then, if we are to secure 
late ripening and good keeping apples we should look to the 
South for them. We know that apples which ripen in late 
winter in the far North become fall or even summer apples 
when taken far enough south. This was noted long ago by 
Thomas in his American Fruit Culturist. Waugh has recently 
called attention to the same thing in A m-erican Garden 
and urges the importance of going south to find good keepers. 
Of course the mere fact that a variety which ripens late 
in the North ripens much earlier in the South does not prove 
that apples which originate in the South are necessarily better 
keepers than those developed in the North. It must be borne 
in mind that, unlike wild plants, an apple may originate in 
the South from seed obtained in the North. We must, therefore, 
know the history of the ancestors of an apple as well as 
the place of its origin. It has occurred to me that it might be 
instructive to compare a considerable number of varieties of 
apples which have originated in the North with others of 
southern origin, to see if the southern apples are actually </seg>

later thai the mat hern ones. A number of difficulties have 
to be met in any such comparison. Aside from the fact just 
¦rationed that apples may originate in one region from seed 
produced in another, there is the further disturbing factor of 
man's selection. There is not the necessity for very late 
apples in the North that there is in the South, and hence 
southern horticulturists have sought more late apples. The 
results obtained from a comparison of north, .n and south 
ern apples are interesting at any rate, and are here given for 
what they are worth. In working up this subject I have taken 
as a basis the varieties recommended in Bulletin No. 8, of the 
Division of Pomology, U. S. Department of Agriculture. This 
list was prepared by a committee of the American Pomoloi: 
ical Society. From this list I have chosen 218 varieties of 
apples, the origin of which is definitely known. Dividing 
these into winter apples on the one hand and fall and summer 
apples on the other, T find that there are 152 varii 
of the former and 66 varieties of the latter. Of the 152 van 
eties of winter apples, 46 per cent, as near as I can determine, 
originated north of the 41st parallel of latitude, and 54 per 
« cut south of the 41st parallel of latitude. Of the 66 vari&lt; 
of summer and fall apples, 53 per cent originated in tin 
North and 47 per cent in the South. On separating the 21 &gt;• 
varieties into late and very late apples on the one hand and 
into early winter, fall, and summer apples on the other, 1 
find that 44 per cent of the late apples came from the North 
and 56 per cent from the South, and that 55 per cent of the 
early apples came from the North and 45 per cent from the 
South. Again, taking only the very late apples, of which Fink 
is a fair representative, I find that 67 per cent originated in 
the South and 33 per cent in the North. It is worthy of notice 
that, taking the very early apples, like Red June, more &lt;&gt;f 
them also came from the South than from the North. There 
are not a sufficient number of these varieties, however, for a 
fair comparison. 

I also found some difference in the size and quality of </seg>

            <seg id="p119">
IMPROVEMENT OF APPLES FOB NEBRASKA. 

117 

northern and southern varieties. Taking the 110 van. 
rated above 6 in the scale of quality, I find that ."&gt;2 per i 
came from the North and 48 per cent came from the South, 
while of the 107 varieties rated 6 or lower, 40 per cent came 
from the North and 44 per cent from the South. Of the 119 
varieties rated above fi in the scale of size, 53 per cent arc of 
northern and 47 per cent of southern origin; while of the 98 
varieties rated 6 or lower, 43 per cent are northern and 57 
per cent southern. Whether these differences are due to the 
small number of varieties considered, to a possibly higher 
ideal of selection in one locality than in the other, or to some 
effect of climate I am not prepared to say. 

I have made no calculations of this kind in regard to the 
hardiness of southern and northern apples, simply because I 
have been unable to find reliable data regarding a sufficient 
number of varieties to make a fair comparison. From analogy 
we might expect, however, that southern varieties would be 
more tender than northern ones. This is well known in the 
case of certain forest trees. There are now growing at the 
Experiment Station black walnut from seed produced from 
various southern and northern states. The trees all have the 
same general appearance. It is interesting to note, however, 
that all of the trees from southern seed have been injured 
repeatedly by our winters, while those from northern seed 
have met with no injury, even coming through the winter of 
1898-99 without harm. Of course these forest trees had probably 
grown in the various localities for a considerable period 
of time, while a variety of apples originating in a certain locality 
may hare come from trees which were grown in that place 
but a short time, or which were grown even in an entirely 
different place. T. T. Lyon has been reported as saying that 
he found many varieties of southern origin hardier in Michigan 
than many varieties of northern origin. On the whole, 
therefore, I am not prepared to predict what may be expected 
as to hardiness from southern varieties. Bailey gives it as 
bis opinion that very little will be lost by bring i </seg>

Pe South, especially if they are brought from the Mis 
valley, or from farther west. It is probable thai 
ss is sometimes as much a matter of withstanding dlj 
s as of surviving the severe winters. If this be true. 
Id expect to obtain good results from apples originatlic 
southwest. 

I am of the opinion that, in many cases the best results are 
e looked for from varieties which originate where it is dei 
to grow them. I have said that walnuts from seeds 
luced in the far North were hardier than those from 
hern seed. It is also interesting to note that the walnut 
I grown from Nebraska seed are equally as hardy as those 
1 South Dakota, or even as those from Canada. In the exment 
with corn at the Arkansas Station it was found that 
corn from the same, or nearly the same, latitude as that 
hich it was planted gave the best results as to yield. 

We now come to the topic of hybridization. I should explain 
that the term "hybridization" as used in this paper 
¦MM cross fertilization between plants of different varieties, 
races, species, or genera. When it is necessary to distinguish 
between the different kinds of hybrids, I shall say generic, 
specific, racial, or varietal hybrids. 

In taking up the hybridization of apples we must first discuss 
some of the general aspects of hybridization and hybridity. 
It is well known that some plants do not hybridize, 
though they are apparently closely related, while others 
which are very dissimilar in structure or habit hybridize 
readily. There are apparently two limits to fertilization. 
Species which are totally unlike each other can not be 
hybridized. No one would think of hybridizing plums with 
pumpkins. If we take plants which are more nearly related 
we may find that they hybridize readily, as for example two 
varieties of American plums. But if we go still further we 
times find that a plant refuses to fertilize another of the 
same variety, as is the case with many varieties of plums, and 
other plants as well. Again, we find that very dissimilar </seg>

species sometimes hybridize, but that they produce hybrids 
which are sterile or nearly so and also lacking in vigor. If 
we hybridize plants which are more closely related we expect 
¦ cine hybrids which are more vigorous than either of the 
parents, while if we inbreed plants the offspring is apt to 
lack vigor. From this we should conclude that seedling 
apples which are produced by hybridizing different varii 
&lt;&gt;f the same species would be more vigorous and productive 
than those which are produced by inbreeding any vari' 
Furthermore, we need not fear to hybridize distinct spc' 
of apples, for it is known that hybrids between the common 
apple and the Siberian crab and between the common apple 
and the western wild crab are very vigorous and product 

When distinct types of plants are hybridized, the offspring 
are quite commonly intermediate between the parents. Now. 
if the seed of these hybrids is sown, the second generation is 
likely to vary markedly, even though the seed was produced 
by inbreeding. For instance, I hybridized a red-seeded race 
of beans with a white-seeded race. The hybrids of the first 
generation had spotted seeds more or less intermediate between 
the parents, and all the beans of this generation were 
very similar to one another. When these spotted beans which 
had been produced by self-pollination were sown, the resulting 
hybrids of the second generation showed great variation. 
Some of them were white like the white parent, some were 
spotted like the first generation, and there were all degrees 
of intermediate forms between the two original parents. But, 
what is more remarkable, some of the hybrids of the second 
generation were like neither parent, being distinctly blue. If 
we hybridize two unfixed varieties, as for instance two varieties 
of apples, we do not get the peculiar results just noted. 
The hybrids of the first generation are likely to show as ¦ 
variations as were seen in the second generation of hybrids 
between distinct races. If we hybridize the common apple 
with the western wild crab we should expect to secure hybrids 
intermediate between the two species of apples, and very simi- </seg>

lar to each other. The Soulard crab is supposed to be just 
sin h a hybrid. If we do not secure better apples than the 
Soulard crab by hybridizing the two species noted we should 
not despair of good results. The second generation grown 
from the seed of the Soulard crab, either inbred or hybridized 
with the common apple, should show great variation. BeBM 
of them aright be expected to resemble the common apple in 
size and quality of fruit. 

I have spoken of hybrids intermediate between their par-. 
We often secure hybrids which are not intermediate in 
all characters, but which combine the characters of the parents 
in very peculiar ways. For instance, a hybrid may have 
fruit showing the good qualities of one parent and at the 
same time have the hardiness of the other. This peculiarity 
of hybrids is of the utmost importance to plant breeders. 
When hybridizing two varieties each of which has some 
stniii" and some weak jMiints, we may secure a hybrid combining 
the poor qualities of both, which would, of course, be 
worthless, and we may secure a hybrid combining the good 
qualities of both, which would be an extremely valuable variety. 
This point should be kept in mind when hybridizing 
apples. Ordinarily I should prefer to hybridize varieties 
which combine as many good qualities as possible. I should 
not hesitate, however, to use a variety which has some weak 
points, provided I could hybridize it with a variety especially 
ng in these points. I might, therefore, use a somewhat 
tender variety for one parent if it had excellent keeping 
qualities, but I should want to hybridize it with a very hardy 
variety. Again, I might use a variety of poor keeping quality 
if it exhibited other excellent characters, but should hybridize 
it with a variety of excellent keeping quality. 

Reciprocal hybrids are sometimes quite unlike each other. 
Sometimes one kind of plant will give its peculiarities to a 
hybrid when used as the female parent and will not do so 
when used as the male parent. Further experiment is nee"W*11

121 

Eince the second generation of hybrids is apt to vary 
kedly, it is often very difficult to fix any peculiarity 
?h may arise, but since apples are propagated by budding 
grafting, any good qualities secured by hybridization can 
ropagated without loss. 

I believe that the common apple should form a part of 
every combination we may secure through hybridization. I 
believe, further, that good results — perhaps the best results — 
are to be expected from the hybridization of different varieties 
of the common apple. We already have such a « 
range of characters, such as hardiness, size, flavor, and k. 
ing qualities of the fruit, vigor and productiveness of the 
tree, etc., that it may not be necessary to go outside the varieties 
of the common apple to secure what we desire. We may, 
however, find that the Siberian crab will be valuable to give 
hardiness to our prospective varieties, but if it is used we are 
very apt to lose in keeping quality, and are liable to secure 
trees which blight badly. By using hybrids with only onefourth 
or one-eighth Siberian blood we may. however, secure 
valuable varieties. The same may be said regarding the use 
of the western wild crab. With this we may expect to se&lt; 
hardiness, especially if parent trees be chosen from near the 
northernmost part of its range. We may also expect to secure 
good keeping qualities by its use. Some trees of this 
crab blight badly, but I have not observed whether this is a 
constant peculiarity of it. I propose to take the safest side 
of the question, and in the work at the Experiment Station 
shall try combinations of the western wild crab with the common 
apple, of the Siberian crab with the common apple, and 
of various varieties of the common apple. </seg>

IMPROVING THE APPLE BY BUD SELECTION. 

By N. C. DuifLAP, Lincoln. 

§1 treating the subject which has boon assigned to me, I 
not endeavor to explain why it is that the apple is so 
lj in need of improvement. There have been several Ikes 
advanced and the direct cause or causes are still a 
ter of dispute. 

I ¦will simply take conditions as they now are and endeavor 
to give a plausible reason why and show how they can 
be improved by a careful selection of buds for propagating 
purposes, leaving you, my friends, to judge as to whether I 
am right or wrong. 

That the apple as we have it to-day is sorely in need of improvement 
goes without any argument on my part. For an 
account of some of the work which is being done along scion 
tific lines in this state, I refer you to the address delivered by 
Prof. R. A. Emerson at the meeting of this society, held at 
Geneva last summer. 

Go into most any apple orchard in this state and you will 
find a great variation in the trees and fruit of any given 
variety. Some of the trees, and I believe I am safe in saying 
a majority of them, are tramps, taking all they can get and 
giving nothing in return. They require as much care and attention, 
except at harvest time, as their neighbors, who generally 
have ¦ good crop of apples. In the spring these worthless 
trees are usually covered with a mass of flowers, many of 
which set fruit. The owner gives them bath after bath of 
fungicides and arsenic sprays, but he is generally doomed 
to disappointment, as most of the apples hit the ground before 
they are as big as cherries. A few hang on, to either fall 
during the summer or are at picking time an undersized, lop'1, 
poor flavored specimen of what they should be. The 
orchardist becomes desperate and generally tries some heroic 
means to make nature react and his trees bring forth a golden 
harvest. I have heard of many of these treatments, or rather </seg>

mistreatments, but as yet have found nothing which produces 
satisfactory results. This is simply a brief account of the 
dilemma which we are in, and now some of our leading horticulturists 
want to throw up the sponge and say we can't raise 
apples for profit in Nebraska. I am glad to say that I can't 
share their opinion. Did not our state carry off the lion's 
share of prizes on apples last summer? Now we have trees 
that will grow apples which can defy the world and which 
bore fruit just as good even as was exhibited at the great 
Paris Exposition. 

fe must not lose sight of the fact that like begets like 
a slight degree of variation. This is as true to-day as it 
4,000 years ago. 

Why can not we, in planting an apple orchard, setthat 
our trees are propagated from buds taken from such 
trees, that by some superior quality, such as&gt;£reeness tram 
blight, apple scab, size, color, flavor of fruit, or for any other 
reason, stand out in bold relief amongst their fellows, either 
in our orchard or the orchard of our friends. 

The nurserymen of this state are a gentlemanly set of men. 
and the most of our tree planters are acquainted with a few of 
them who would be glad to grow for us our young trees from 
buds of our own selection, if we will only give them an opportunity 
and a reasonable compensation for so doing. 

iiudding in seedling stalk has long since been condemned 
Nebraska, and to double work our selected buds would be 
cheapest in the long run even if it cost a few cents bor 
tart with. Put the buds into short or piece root Ben D. 
Fts, or any other variety which starts roots readily from 
scion. This is done to get our bud onto a standard root 
ead of.an uuhardy seedling, so it will be able to stand the 
&gt;re conditions to which it will be subjected. 

E conclusion I want to say that I believe that by a care;lection 
of healthy buds from trees which, on account of 
robust nature have not been attacked by any common 
y, we can in a few generations of the apple produce a </seg>

E which will be practically immune against such diseases 
ight and apple scab, which are responsible for the greater 
of our apple failures. 

DISCUSSION. 

J[r. Augustine — The gentleman sitting by me here asked 
whether I endorsed the idea of Mr. Dunlap, and I said 
s, in the main," and he suggested that I say something on 
¦abject I simply want to say that this is a wonderful subtliat 
Mr. Dunlap has presented to us; a subject that we 
not going to get rid of in a year or two years; a subject 
b is going to reach out into the future. I believe we arc 
beginning to get our eyes open to the fact that there is 
ctliing to be learned on this subject. 

I am not sure, however, but that some of the trouble of 
which be ¦peak* can Ik- attributed to other sources. FTe speaks 
&lt;&gt;f the apple fungus being obviated by a proper selection of 
propagating material. I have serious doubts as to whether 
we can propagate in such a way as to avoid these diseases, 
but I think we attribute some of our failures to the wrong 
source. For instance, I have for years been satisfied in my 
owu mind that we are not attributing enough of our failure 
to a lack of pollenization of the blossoms. It is only recently 
that we have discovered that we can not raise Kietfer pears 
without a fertilizer. I know some people dispute that yet, but 
I haven't found a place where they grew KieH'er without there 
being somewhere in near proximity some other kind of a pear 
that will fertilize the blossom. 

I believe it is true of apples as of plums, that not all trees 
of the same variety, even, are perfect bloomers. I know an 
orchard of a hundred acres of Ben Davis, just as pretty t ¦ 
as I ever saw, loaded with bloom every spring, and, though 
they are fifteen or sixteen years old, they have never given any 
fruit to amount to anything. Recently some of them were 
topgrafted from Ben Davis trees of known fertility. This </seg>

            <seg id="p127">

and they prove to be perfect blossoms. Now the owner proposes 
to top-graft the entire orchard, and his hopes are r:ii 
by the prospect of 100 acres of Ben Davis fifteen or sixteen 
years old from which he is going to get results. But he at 
tribute! all his former failure to the fact that those trees 
were not properly grown : that is, that the lnuls were not exactly 
the right thing. Of course we all understand that the 
same thing holds good of the Wild &lt; loose plum. 

Now I believe the reason why we have such failures is this: 
we have beea in the habit of planting orchards all over this 
country; not so many commercial orchards where one plants 
100 or 160 acres of one variety, but where a man plants a 
farm orchard for home use and very likely happens to plant 
more than one variety in a place and gets the benefit of the 
consequent pollenization without any particular thought or 
effort on his part, so that when we come to plant commercial 
rrt hards of 100 or 160 acres of a single variety we have failed 
to understaud the value cf pollcnization, and make a great 
mistake. So I say, while there is a great deal to be learned 
on the subject dealt witli by Mr. Dunlap, yet I think we are 
attributing a great deal to that source that ought to be attributed 
to lack of pollenization. 

I[r. P&gt;.vi:.vu;[) — 1 want to add just a word. We have had 
the sort of experience that Mr. Augustine speaks of with 
Davis. We have one orchard of solid Hen Davis removed 
a any other variety, and it doesn't beu anything. I 
ik it is due to a lack of pollenization. We all admit that 
wherries have to be set properly for ]&gt;ollenization. We 
seethe same thing in our old orchard which was burned 
• in 1883 and replanted. Rows which were partly killed 
and filled in with other varieties bear much better than 
re the rows are solid Ben Davis. The same is true of the 
le Sap. I think pollenization has a great deal to do with 
fruitfulness of an orchard, and even in so windy a counas 
this the varieties should be mixed.

place where you ate dinner during the summer meeting at 
Jolinson. There is an orchard on the north side of that grove, 
having an east slope, which was planted with the different 
varieties all scattered over the orchard. That orchard for 
eighteen years lias never brought less than |400 a year, and 
from that to $1,000, since it came into bearing. Of course 
that orchard was planted in the early days, and the first 
apples sold for f2.00 a bushel. Just south of that grove, on 
the very same slope, protected by a wind-break, there is just 
as old an orchard. But as Wine Sap and Ben Davis seemed 
n&gt; be making the most money, this orchard was planted of 
those two varieties alone; one-half Wine Bap and the other 
half Ben Davis, with cottouwood and maple trees between. 
Strange as it may seem, that orchard has never made to ex-1 
floO in a single year. The only difference is that it is 
in two solid blocks, Wine Sap and Ben Davis; everything else 
is just as favorable. 

The President — We have been watching this for a number 
of years up in our country, and the results are just as have 
been mentioned here to-day. We had enough faith in it, so 
we haven't planted in any other way for seven years; haven't 
planted a block of any one variety by itself. We run our rows 
north and south, yet in varieties they run east and west. We 
plant only one row of a variety in a place, efcaagiBg vari' 
ry time we change rows. There is another advantage in 
this method of planting. As you all know, some varieties 
are spreading in habit, and some are upright; by mixing them 
up the spreading trees can take advantage of the little space 
that the upright trees leave, and it is quite an advantage. 
We used to plant the spreading trees five or ten feet farther 
apart, but by mixing them we can strike a medium. 

Me. Yolxgers — lias any one noticed how far that pollenization 
will carry? 

Mr. President — I would guess about three rows. 

RR. Youx&lt;;eks— We have planted four rows of Ben Davis 
six of Wine S;m and this last summer the first row of </seg>

next two rows. My idea would be to mix them every other 
row in order to get the best results. 

Mr. Barnard — How was the Ben Davis row next to the 
Wine Sap? 

KR. Youxgers — Loaded right down; much better than 
e away from the Wine Saps. 

Mr. Augustine — That depends largely on the season as to 
the distance they will fertilize. I think if we have a real good 
wiirm spell at the time of blooming that they will fertilize 
half a dozen rows. On the other hand, if we have a dull, 
mucky, cold, wet spell, when perhaps the bees do not fly r&gt; 
ily, they should be pretty close together. I wanted to sp 
nn this subject because so many people are losing so lar. 
on this account. Less than a year ago I talked to a farm 
institute in the eastern part of our state, and some one asked 
the question why some Kieffer pear orchards did not bear. 
I inquired into the particulars, and it developed that tl 
people had acres of Kieffer pear trees from which they \\ 
realizing nothing, though the trees were perfect snowball 
the spring. In the small orchards where the trees were fertilized 
they bore splendidly, and I suggested to them that if 
their trees were all fertilized they would bear fruit. The secretary 
of the institute said: "That one fact is worth half a 
million dollars to this immediate county. " 

I speak of this for the reason that so many people fail hi 
erstand these things. If a man talks to me about plantcertain 
varieties, I tell him by all arm to plant sonicg 
else with them. Then, in the matter of fertilizers, sonic 
must be taken to bring the proper varieties together. 
instance, if a man is planting a KielYer pear orchard he 
t remember that that orchard comes into bearing v

In planting a cnminercial orchard some years ago I planted 
¦ solid eighty acres of Ben T):ivis, another eighty acres &lt;&gt;f 
lathan, and uoiher eighty of another variety. The seai 
happened to be very unfavorable, and about half the trees 
nt by the board — one of the greatest blessings that ever 
&gt;pened to me. The next winter our Dr. Buryl, a professor 
the Illinois University, dropped this remark: "I believe 
will get better fruit, and more pet feet fruit," he says, "I 
uk so, I don't say positively, by pollenixation." I carried 
t suggestion with me, and the next year when I replanted 
orchard I didn't care so much for the looks, but I made 
my mind to have other varieties in there, and to-day I 
uldn't take sever;! thousand dollars, at least, for that litsuggestion 
that Dr. Bvryl dropped into my ear. 

Mr. Slayton — This mum matter was discussed quite thoroughly 
about ten years ago. Our lamented brother, Samuel

have myself profited by it since then. I have planted quite 
an extensive commercial orchard, and I took particular pains 
to plant only two rows of any variety in one place; then two

Mr. Wilson — As Mr. Augustine has said, this question of 
pollenization is one which we have thought very little about 
until recently, yet I believe it is one of the fundamental 
principles underlying the subject of horticulture, and should 
be carefully considered. We know that among our plums 
many such varieties as Wild Goose, Charles Downing, Milton, 
and others, are not self-fertile; yet by mingling these varieties 
we get excellent results. I believe the game holds true of </seg>

t* kinds of fruit. I have had quite a little experience in 
ft'ing apples by intermingling the varieties. I have a row, 
instance, of Jonathan, a row of Ben Davis, a row of Wine 
, a row of Wealthy, and so on. My orchard has alv 
1 very fruitful, though I know of orchards in the neighlood 
that are not fruitful that are planted in blocks of 
or six rows of a kind. 

Prof. Emkksox — This question is very interesting, but I 
am MfTj to wet the other question dropped; that of the improvement 
of apples by bud selection. I don't know how 
much there is in it, but there is certainly something in it. 
We are all accustomed to thinking that when we plant a seed 
we will get a great variation, but in planting grafts or cuttings 
we do not expect much variation. As a rule a cutting 
or graft will reproduce the same variety exactly, but it seems 
that in some plants, at least, there is some variation even 
when propagated in this way. For instance, violets. A gentleman 
in the city of Washington who has been growing violets 
and nothing else, having a number of large houses for 
them, has kept records of the individual plants in one of the 
large beds, noting the number of flowers picked each year, 
and the general vigor of each plant, and has propagated only 
from the five very best plants in this bed, keeping this up 
year after year. He told me he had increased the number of 
Mowers he could get from one plant to double the number. 
Part of this was doubtless due to the culture he gave them, 
but mostly due to the increased rigor af the plants. Whether 
.1 rot the same will hold true of apples I do not know from 
experience, but I believe if we would cut scions only from 
tnm in actual bearing and known to be fruitful, instead of 
cutting them from nursery trees that have not come into bearing, 
we would greatly improve the general vigor as well as 
the fruitfulness of our apple trees. 

Mr. Youxgers — There is no question but that individual 
trees throughout the orchard year after year will give you 
letter quality and more perfect apples than others, Mr.

COVER CROPS FOR CULTIVATED ORCHARDS. 

BY!?. O. EMER8ON. 

Eder this head no a rgu incuts need to be made in support 
•hard cultivation. While some orchards do well when 
ed to become sodded with grass or weeds, especially if 
&lt;1 frequently and the swath left on the grouud for a 
1, it is nevertheless necessary to cultivate all young 
ids during the early summer, and it seems the safer plan 
old orchards as well at least for the greater part of the 
. The only questions here considered are whether culti 
orchards should be protected by a cover crop and what 
should be used. 

Before beginning the discussion of the various crops used 
irchard covers, let us consider briefly what cover crops 
are and what they do. For a fuller preliminary discussion 
Keport of Horticultural Society, 1900, pp. 131-138. 

Eover crops, as the term is generally used, are crops which 
sown in midsummer or later, which cover the soil during 
fall and winter, and which are worked into it the followspring. 
They must not therefore be confused with crops 
a in spring or late in fall and allowed to grow during the </seg>

            <seg id="p133">

OOVEB CROPS FOB 0ECHAKD8. 

following summer, nor with a permanent sod of weeds or 
grass. They are not crops in the sense that they are to be 
removed from the land like a crop of grain. A cover crop 
never robs the orchard of plant food. 

Now what do cover crops do? One of the first things we 
notice after they begin to grow is that they remove water 
fr-ini the soil and lose much of it in the air. Some crops keep 
this up until severe freezing weather kills them. Some are 
not killed by cold but live through the winter and go on wasting 
water as soon as warm weather comes in spring. Other 
crops, however, are killed by the first frosts of fall, stop wasting 
water, and help hold what moisture is left in the soil, 
just as ¦ mulch of straw does. Loss of water from the soil 
in spring may be advantageous iu some places, but it certainly 
i^ not in Nebraska. All the moisture should be saved with 
care for the use of the trees later. Loss of water from the soil 
l;:t i- in fall is probably injurious to many trees which have 
i«eed of considerable water through the dry winters of this 
i e^ion. As regards a loss of water in late summer and early 
fall there is much difference of opinion. There is considerable 
evidence that some trees, especially peaches and many 
varieties of apples, grow too late to properly mature their 
wood for winter. This is especially true of low, rich, moist 
land. Lessening of moisture at the command of such trees 
certainly checks their growth earlier and probably helpmature 
their wood. On high ground or on drier soil these 
s probably mature their wood thoroughly enough for all 
but the severest winters. Again, such trees as cherries and 
maj apples, esjMcially northern varieties, stop growth very 
early, even on low ground. Bearing trees, moreover, are less 
likely to grow ton late than young trees. In such cases cover 
imps, all of which dry the soil more or less in late summer 
and early fall, are more injurious than beneficial. 

Another thing soon noticed when the plants begin growth 
is that a cover crop checks the growth of weeds. Some crops </seg>

            <seg id="p134">
132 

NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

E weeds make a good cover crop, but even if this is true 
should not be allowed to grow. Most of the common 
i which spring up even as late as the middle or last of 
st mature seeds before frost, and if allowed to grow 
add to the stock of weed seeds in the soil. 

Plant foods are sometimes lost by leaching down beyoni 
the reach of plants. This is especially true of nitrates, since 
they are easily dissolved in water. Nitrogen is the most ex 
pensive element of fertilizers, hence its loss should be avoided 
Kapidly growing plants take up these dissolved nitrates 
through their roots and do not liberate them until they decay 
In light soils in warm, moist climates the loss of nitrates by 
leaching is a serious matter. In some regions, therefore, cover 
crops are valuable helps in checking the loss of nitrates 
during the rainy weather of fall, but in Nebraska we need no 
fear the loss of this expensive fertilizer. Our heavy rains 
come in early summer when trees are growing rapidly and 
can take care of the available nitrogen, and our falls, more 
over, are frequently dry, allowing little leaching. The sav 
ing of nitrogen need not therefore be added to the benefits 
derived from cover crops in Nebraska. 

Iiy vegetation which covers the surface of the groum 
ke the flow of water, thus allowing it to soak in and prewashing 
on hill sides. On all but level land, therefore 
r crops may be an advantage in checking the flow of wate 
11 and spring. Cover crops also hold snow against drift 
It is true that comparatively little snow falls in Ne 
ka. What we get, however, frequently comes with wiud 
drifts badly. Any cover, therefore, which holds this 
- , keeping it more evenly distributed over the land, is 
ficial. 

Cover crops protect the soil, and therefore also the roots of 
trees, against deep freezing and also alternate freezing and 
thawing. This will be made plainer when we compare the 
various crops with reference to the freezing of the ground. </seg>

COVEE CROPS FOR ORCHARDS. 

133 

Since we have so little snow in the greater part of Nebraska, 
some cover to prevent root killing is often very valuable. 

When worked into the soil, cover crops add vegetable mat 
ter to it. If a heavy cover is plowed under during dry weather 
it may be harmful by keeping the soil too loose. If the cover 
is not too heavy, or if it is plowed under when moist, this 
result will not follow. Moreover, many cover crops can be 
worked into the soil by disking or cultivating and need not 
be plowed under at all. In most cases the addition of decay 
ing vegetable matter to the soil is beneficial. It makes heavy 
soils more friable and gives light soils more substance. Again, 
it is well known that humus, which is nothing but decaying 
vegetable matter, adds greatly to the water-holding capacity 
of soils. 

Most Nebraska soils contain a considerable amount of vegetable 
matter especially when new, but it is only a matter of 
time when the soil in orchards which are given clean cultivation 
throughout the year will become deficient in vegetable 
matter. 

Some cover crops when worked into the soil not only add 
humus to it but also add nitrogen, which, as said before, is the 
most expensive fertilizer ingredient. This is true only of 
leguminous plants, such as peas, beans, clovers, etc. For 
young orchards, especially for apples, pears, and peaches, it 
is probably injurious to add nitrogenous matter in the form of 
green manures or in other forms, but for bearing orchards, 
especially for cherries and plums, nitrogenous fertilizers are 
often of value in keeping up healthy wood growth. 

The effects of cover crops may be summarized as follows: 
1. They take water from the soils. 

a. All of them do this until frost. 

b. Some of them continue it until freezing weather. 

c. Some of them begin it again in spring. 

2. They prevent or check the growth of weeds and the pro- 

duction of weed seeds. 

3. They sometimes prevent the loss of nitrates from the soil. </seg>

            <seg id="p136">
134 

NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

4. They hold the drifting snow and check the flow of water, 

lessening the loss of water and the washing of hill 

sides. 

5. They protect the soil and tke roots of plants. 

a. Against deep freezing. 

Against alternate freezing and thawing, 
hey add humus to the soil. 

o. Increasing its water-holding capacity. 

b. Making heavy soils more friable. 
c. Giving light soils more substance. 

7. They add nitrogen to the soil, if a leguminous crop. 

I any of these things are beneficial. Some of them may be 
rious or beneficial depending upon the climate, soil, kind 
age of trees, kind of cover crop, etc. Whether, in a parlar 
case, a cover crop should be grown or not will depend 
n whether, under the prevailing conditions, the benefits 
veigh the injuries, or the reverse. It seems very probable 
, in many cases at least, the benefits of cover crops more 
i balance the injuries caused by them, provided the right 
I of crop is grown. 

In attempting to discover what crops are host, let us diacuss 
the behavior of the different crops, which have been 
tested at the Experiment Station during the past two years. 
Xotes on the first year's experience with these crops were 
given at the last annual meeting of this society and published 
in the report for 1900. The past year the following crops 
were tested : rye, oats, buckwheat, rape, field peas, cowpeas, 
soy beans, garden beans, millet, £orn, sorghum, and several 
mixtures. They were grown on uniform soil on plats 10 x 20 
ft. in size. Two plats grew no crops, being used as checks. 
All tlie crops were sown broadcast and harrowed August 14. 
The ground was not in as good condition as it is coinmonlv 
found in cultivated orchards. Notes were made frequently 
on the growth and general behavior of the crops. The percentage 
of moisture in the soil of many of the plats was </seg>

determined at various times. Let us now discuss the behavior 
of these crops and the seven heads given above. 

1. Loss of Soil Moisture. — The amount of moisture in 
the various plats was not determined at the time the seed 
was sown, but it must have been nearly the same in all plats. 
Moisture determinations were made September 20, October 9, 
October 27, November 7, November 20, and December 11. A 
table showing the amount of water in all the plats on all these 
dates would be confusing. The crops are therefore grouped 
in the table which follows. Field peas were such a poor stand 
that they took less moisture from the soil than they ordinarily

and garden beans. It should be noted, however, that none of 
these, with the exception of buckwheat, was planted early 
enough to make a heavy growth before frost. Last year, when 
sown July 23, cowpeas and soy beans took slightly more water 
from the soil than sorghum or millet. This year millet, corn, 
and sorghum took considerable water from the soil in late 
summer and early fall, but, after being killed by frost, the 
heavy mulch they formed held the rains which came later in 
fall, so that at the time winter began the plats on which they 
stood contained as much water as the plats which grew no 
crop. Oats, rye, and rape took more water than any of the 
other crops in summer and early fall and continued taking it 
after the other crops were killed, so that the plats containing 
them were considerably drier than any of the others at the 
beginning of winter. As regards the loss of moisture from 
the soil, then, millet, corn, and sorghum make a very fair 
showing when compared with any of the other crops which 
made sufficient growth for any winter protection. . 

2. Prevention of Weed Growth. — All the crops grown 
both this year and last year, prevented the growth of many 
weeds. This year, when sown as late as August 14, corn, sor 
ghum, and millet succeeded in crowding out practically al 
of the weeds. Last year, when sown July 23, such crops as 
rape, cowpeas, and soy beans also prevented nearly all wee&lt; 

IL Checking Loss of Nitrates. — This could not be deterled 
in the experiments we are now discussing. Plants 
ich grow late in fall, like rye, oats, field peas, and rape, 
;ht be expected to catch more of the leaching nitrates than 
se that are killed by frost. But these late-growing plants 
the ones that leave the soil dry at the beginning of winter, 
was noted before, the loss of nitrates in the fall is probably 
mportant in this state. 

4. Drifting Snow and Erosion. — Since in this test all the 
crops have been grown on practically level land, no direct 
observations have been made with regard to erosion of hill- </seg>

            <seg id="p139">
137 

COVER CROPS FOR ORCHARDS. 

sides. It is evident, however, that the crojm which make i 
heavy growth are superior in preventing erosion to those 
which made a weak growth. 

In regard to drifting snow, plants which stand more or 
less erect during winter, like soy beans, cowpeas, buckwheat 
and millet, prevent drifting better than those that lie more 
nearly flat upon the ground, like field peas, rye, oats, rape, 
corn, and sorghum. Corn and sorghum planted in the middle 
of July stand erect during winter, but when planted as 
late as the middle of August they bend down nearly flat before 
spring. Millet stands more erect, even if planted late, 
only a part of the stems bending to the ground. Observations 
made December 24, 1900, after a fall of snow accompanied 
by strong wind, show the superiority of millet in holding 
snow. The plats without crops were bare. Buckwheat, soy 
beans, cowpeas, etc., did not hold snow well on account of 
having made so small a growth. The previous year, when 
they made a stronger growth, they held snow fairly well. 
Field peas did not hold much snow, most of the ground being 
bare or covered with a thin coat of snow. Kye, oats, and rape 
held snow two or three inches deep. Corn and sorghum, not 
having flattened down entirely at that time, held 6-12 inches 
of snow. In the millet the snow was from 8-14 inches deep. 
Of course these differences are much more marked than they 
would have been if the plats had been larger and had not been 
surrounded by bare ground. 

5. Protection against Freezing and Thawing. — It was 
noticed last year that, having once frozen, the ground protected 
by cover crops thawed much less rapidly than unprotected 
ground. Early in January last year a thaw occurred 
after the ground had frozen several inches deep. The bare 
ground thawed out entirely, before the ground protected by 
the heavy covers had thawed at all, and while that under 
even the lightest covers had thawed only a few inches. 

turing the present winter observations have been made on 
depth of freezing under the various covers and in bare </seg>

ground. On December 24, 1900, the heaviest covers were full 
of snow, while ground devoid of vegetation was bare as noted 
above. The bare ground was frozen from 2-3 inches deep. 
Field peas and buckwheat from inches. Rape, rye, and 
oats from £-J inch. The ground under corn, sorghum, and 
millet was nowhere frozen over inch, and much of it was 
unfrozen. On December 29, 1900, the snow was gone except 
a little in millet and sorghum. The ground was frozen 2-3 
inches under millet ; 3-4 inches under rye, sorghum, and corn ; 
4-5 inches under rape; 5-6 inches under field peas and oats; 
7-8 inches under buckwheat; and 8-9 inches in bare ground. 

On January 12, 1900, a light snow was lying about equally 

deep on all plats, having fallen without wind. The ground 

was frozen to the following depths

of the other crops studied. It is possible that they furnish

causing it to dry out, if they are plowed under when the 
ground is dry. This will probably not occur, however, unless 
they are sown too early, say before the 1st of August. The 
same trouble may be had with rye, if it is allowed to grow too 
long in spring. If, however, it is plowed under early, as it 
should be to avoid loss of water, it will decay readily and not 
keep the soil too light. Such crops as field peas, soy beans, 
i-uwpeas, and rape decay readily when worked into the 
ground. When sown as late as August, field peas made more 
grawtli than soy beans, cowpeas, etc., since they are not killed 
by frost. Cowpeas and the like should be sown earlier, say 
in July, if a heavier growth is desired. Kape makes a strong 
growth, but it appears to be largely water. 

Except with our heaviest soils, it is not necessary to plow 
the ground every spring. It is probably even inadvisable to 
do so. It is worthy of note in this connection that all except 
the very heaviest covers can be worked up without plowing. 
On May 10, 1900, a disk was run over the cover crops sown 
the previous summer. In all cases except rye, which had 
made a heavy spring growth, and millet, corn, and sorghum 
planted in July, the disk stirred the soil well the first time 
over. With corn, millet, and sorghum sown in July, it required 
the disk to be run over twice to stir the surface soil 
well. Even then they were not buried but were broken down 
so that they would form a fair mulch. They were so heavy aa 
to interfere with cultivation with any implement except 
a disk. The same crops sown in August were easily cut up 
by once disking and would not have interfered with other implements. 


7. Addition of Nitrogen. — If it is desired to add nitrogen 
to the soil in a green manure, it is necessary to grow a leguminous 
crop. Of these, field peas, soy beans, cowpeas, and garden 
beans have been tried. If sown in August, field peas will 
probably be most satisfactory. If sown in July, any of the 
others make a good growth. Cowpeas have a disadvantage 
in that they do not usually mature seed in this region. </seg>

            <seg id="p142">
140 

NEBRASKA STATE HORTKTI.TTRAL SOCIETY. 

Field peas make the best winter cover of any of these, but 
drv the soil late in fall. 

Now, just which crop should be grown depends upon many 
conditions. If a leguminous crop is. desired, field peas or sot 
lieans are perhaps as good as any. The latter should be sown 
in July, but the former may be sown as late as August. Hairy 
retch has not been tried. If such crops are not desired, 
corn, millet, or sorghum may be grown. These are the only 
crops which combine many good qualities. They start rap 
idly enough to crowd out the weeds, are killed by the first 
frust, and therefore do not rob the soil of moisture late in fall. 
They hold snow well, protect the soil and roots of trees from 
severe freezing and alternate freezing and thawing better 
than any other crop grown, and they add considerable humus 
to the soil. They are probably best sown early in August. 
As lu'tween the three, millet has some advantage over the 
others in the cover it affords, and it is most easily sown. Rye, 
s rape, and buckwheat apparently have little to recommend 
them. They dry out the soil badly late in fall and do 
not furnish as good a cover as millet. An attempt has been 
made to find some leguminous crop which can be grown mixed 
with millet. But as we have sown it, the millet chokes out 
all the crops mixed with it as readily as it does weeds.

Russian olive trees grew well from cuttings. Thurlow willow 
made an enormous growth. From a cutting planted a 
year ago last spring, cut back last spring, there grew five 
stems whose aggregate height was fifty-seven feet, and aggregate 
circumference twenty- four and one-half inches. Boleanna 
grafted on the Nivea grew six and a half feet last summer. 
Both Boleanna and Nivea very successful. </seg>

lived. Golden elders grew readily from cuttings and made 
¦ marvelous growth. Hop trees came up from seeds planted 
two years ago. Golden hops did well grafted on roots of the 
common hop tree. 

E)nicerus. Upright. — Several varieties did well, growing 
i cuttings. Some of them bear golden berries in great 
usion. Five kinds of climbing honeysuckles did well. 

Golden leaved, Grandiflora, Coronaris, Lamoine, and Avalance 
syringas all did well. 

Spireas. — Quite a variety of spireas were tested. Billardi I 
discarded years ago; Douglassi not much better. The gem of 
them all is the little dwarf Bumalda. It killed down last 
winter, then sprang up and bore profusely all summer till 
frost came. It has a fine pink flower; the grandest of the 
spireas. The largest is the Opulifolea ; the flower is a hemisphere 
about the size of a small baseball ; two flowers make a 
full ball. Flowers are white and turn to gold. Spirea Van 
Hontei is a wholesale bloomer and very hardy. Thunbergi 
very delicate and fine. A gentleman said if he could have 
hut one flower he would take that. Superba bloomed generously 
but was scalded by the June sun. I had several other 
kinds; all seem to do well. 

I fear the Deutzias will be tender. The beautiful Gracilis 
failed for two years; Pride of Rochester did not bloom. 

I have a dozen kinds of lilacs. The Villosa proves a very 
ist June bloomer with purple blossoms. I want to graft 
¦ral strong kinds on the tree lilacs. I have some tree lilacs 
t have grown eight feet in two years. I think by topgraftthe 
smaller kinds on the tree family we can get some hyis 
that will make us all glad. The cut leaved Persian is 
:ry delicate and beautiful shrub. All lilacs graft well on 
common. If you graft on surface roots they will sprout 
the mischief; if on the bottom or tap root, not at all. 
re is great room for lilacs. The Wraggs claim they have 
some fine seedlings ; I am testing them. </seg>

Rosa Rugosa, a large single rose from Japan, is a decided 
success. This should be used for hybridizing. Lord Penzance 
hybrid sweet briar did well. 

Eimbing roses grow from cuttings; they would do better

r of it. White and Folden are tardy in flowering. Other

Yucca filamentosa and Yucca angustifolia, or Spanish Bayonet, 
or Soap Root, do well. 

The large family of imported phloxes are a grand success. 
I can not recommend them too highly for their continuous, 
fragrant, glorious bloom. Oriental poppies showed dazzling 
splendor. They are perennials. No collection should be 
without them ; they are of immense size. 

Ejlumbines did remakably well. I intend to plant a large

8 double purple was magnificent — gilded like a dahlia. 

Eaeonies, two hundred sorts. I hope they will bloom in 
heir splendor, and may you be there to see. I have planted 
a pound of paeony seed. I have over one hundred prom* 
st'edlings to develop. 

Emmon and California privets have both done well. Comprivet 
grows from cuttings, and went through three 
i consecutive drouth in Franklin. 

DISCUSSION. 

Mb. McIntosh. — I would like to inquire of Mr. Harrison 
in regard to the privet. He mentioned the fact that they 
stood three years of drouth; did they stand the cold of '99? 
I noticed in Omaha the privet hedges pretty generally killed 
out that winter. And while I am on the floor I would also 
like to ask if the berberry he mentions is subject to wheat 
rust like the wild berberry of the eastern states, where it is 
charged with being the host-plant on which the wheat rast 
lives over. 

Mr. Harrison. — It is this creeping berberry. I never saw 
any rust on it. I have seen it in the mountains in full bloom 
when you could almost float in the fragrance, it was so strong 
and delicious. In regard to the privet, I saw them growing 
in '98 ; they were all right then i how they came out in the 
spring I don't know, but I think they came out all right. If 
they could stand that terrible three years drouth, they could 
stand almost anything. </seg>

REPORT OF THE EXPERIMENTAL STATION MIN-

January 12, 1901. 

1/V. President 

In making my report to the Society I wish to say that 1 
have for many years been experimenting more or less with 
plums, cherries, and other kinds of fruit in Kearney county, 
and while we have succeeded with quite a number of varieties, 
we have also had failures. I understand that the object 
of the experiment stations is to obtain an exact record of the 
behavior of different varieties of fruit and ornamental trees 
and shrubs in different portions of theState,and under different 
conditions. Consequently I have thought best in this, m v 
first report, to make a detailed statement of stock planted and 
that now living, which the following table will show :

From the above it will be seen that the loss from transplanting 
was very slight indeed, except on the gooseberries 
and evergreens. The stock which survived has made a strong. 
vigorous growth the past season, and has all gone into winter 
quarters in fine condition. I find no difference in the growth 
or appearance of the Pearl and Josselyn gooseberries.

hole half full. During the summer, cultivation gradually 
fills the hole. 

Cultivation. — We commence in spring as soon as the frost 
is nut, aiming to conserve moisture. Cultivate often and 
especially after each rain until August 1, after which time 
we desire the ground to be covered with some cover crop. 
« we find that the common red root answers very well as 
a soil cover. This weed springs up quickly when cultivation 
i nd is killed by the first frosts. Should frost be late 
in coming and weeds too rank, likely to exhaust too much 
moisture, we run a mowing machine. The intent of the a 
crop is to absorb enough of the surplus moisture to assist in 
ri]M'uing the trees and to act as a soil cover in catching such 
flurries of snow as come during the winter. Our dependence 
for moisture is on the frost stored up during winter, and oconal 
summer rains and showers, all carefully conserved 
by frequent surface culture. That this method of conserving 
moisture does secure an ample supply is given by the table of 
growth appended.

Ptations of grapes, currants, and gooseberries. In 
5 of 1900 your Society established this station and 
3 varieties of fruit and forest trees, shrubs, and 
• experimental purposes. Prior to this 65 varieties 
planted, making a total of 148 varieties to be tested. 

Insults. — It is too early yet to make an extended report 
e way of results of fruit yielded. We may say, however, 
a plat of strawberries 50x260 feet, planted in 1897, 
led the following season as a first crop about 1,100 
ts of strawberries. Cherry trees three years planted 
four quarts of choice fruit per tree. From the earlier 
tings raspberries, currants, and gooseberries have fruited 
idantly and promise well. During the year 1900 we seel 
a few Missouri Pippin apples which were of good size 
high color. 

iESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENTAL PLANTING FOR THE YEAR 
). — About 80 per cent is alive, most of the loss being on 
ain small fruit plantations which in some instances 
ered by the drifting soil, but in a greater number of inices 
by being washed under and buried at times of pourrain. 
Doubtless some of these smaller and weaker plants 
e too deeply planted for the kind of season we had in 1900. 

Varieties and Hardihood. — There are thirtv varieties of 
apple, all hardy but three or four, these three or four having 
suffered during the phenomenal winter of 1898-99. Ten 
kinds of cherries, 16 of peach, of which Bailey, Elberta, 
Wright, Russell's No. 2 and 3 suffered least in the winter of 
1898-99. Fifteen varieties of pear, 17 of plums, 9 of grapes, 
of which Elvira is by far the hardiest, 7 of currants, 2 of raspberry, 
2 of blackberry, 3 of gooseberries, 8 of strawberries. 

fdditional time would be required to be able to make an 
lligent report of the adaptation of all these varieties to 
peculiar conditions. Our experience so far indicates 
we shall not only be able to grow hardy varieties of fruit 
American plums, but that we are going to grow abundant 
»s of apples, cherries, small fruits, and at present the </seg>

peach trees are full of fruit buds for the coming season, giving 
bright promise of success in growing certain varieties of 
peach Ins*, The fact that a considerable number of varii 
of peach trees have passed through the very trying winter 
of 1898-99 encourages the belief that the peach can be 
meetmtmOj cultivated, at least as far north and west in our 
state as this locality. 

We think our experience is particularly interesting in regard 
to the question of whether a sufficient amount of soil 
moisture can be conserved by surface culture to secure needed 
growth. Apparently we have succeeded in conserving as 
much soil moisture as needed, as the growth here obtained 
compares very favorably with average growth in eastern or 
middle eastern counties. The problem presented is to conserve 
sufficient moisture to secure a vigorous growth in the 
early part of the season and then to check this rapid growth 
by cessation of cultivation and soil cover, which may be weed 
growth or oats, taking up the surplus moisture and checking 
rapid growth in time to be ripened before severe frost. Fruit 
trees and plants have gone into winter in good condition and 
now promise considerable fruit the coming season. 

I before closing this report we wish to state that we are 
rays pleased to show visitors through the grounds and 
e any information we may possess or such experience as 
i been developed up to this point. We will also endeavor 
correspond. We appreciate the trust reposed in us by 
ir Society and will endeavor to suitably care for trees and 
nts entrusted to us and hope to do ail that rests in our 
* r er to help to develop the horticultural resources of this 
lion of the State.

Mr. Stephens — Pnrdnm is a small town off th&lt;&gt; railroad,

Dr. Bessey — Have you been to the place? 

Mr. Stephens — Often. 

Dr. Bessey — Are you certain as to whether or not he is 
growing those trees on what can be called Rand-hill soil? 

BR. Stephens — It could hardly be termed sand-hill soil, 
gh a portion of the orchard is quite sandy. 

Dr. Bessey — What are the immediate surroundings? Is 
there any timber; is it down in a valley, or up on high land? 

ER. Stephens — It is on what is called the "North Loop

the side of the orchard pitches over toward the valley, 
an elevated table-land. 

Dr. Bessey — Can they grow peaches up there? 

Mr. Stephens — That is to be found out yet; they hare 
fifteen hundred trees planted there as an experiment. 

Dr. Bessey — I think this is exceedingly interesting, for it 
is generally supposed that no work had been done yet in that

ARLINGTON EXPERIMENTAL STATION. 

CONDUCTED BY MARSHALL BBOTHEUS. 

Report January 15, 1901. 

Twelve years ago we began planting various fruit trei 
small fruits for experimental purposes. We gradually increased 
this from year to year until the present time. Of the 
fruits that we have tested long enough to report on will report 
the following: in 1893 we planted the following Russian and 
other cherries: 5 Spate Aminerelle, 5 Vlandirmir, 5 Griatt 
Imperial, 5 Royal Ann, 5 Yellow Glass, 5 Vilena Sweet, 5 
Brussler Brown, 5 Ostheim, 45 Wragg, 10 Olivett, 5 Dyehouse, 
and English Morello, Montmorency, and Early Richmond 
in large numbers. All have fruited, and of the above, 
the Early Uichmond, Montmorency, English Morello, Wragg, 
and Ostheim easily lead for profit and general satisfaction. 
None of the balance are hardly worthy a place in an orchard. 

El 1895 a plum orchard was planted as follows : 10 Hungar- 
Prunes, 10 Ungarish Prunes, 5 Leipzig, 5 Communia, 5 
je, 5 Richland, 5 Moore's Arctic, 5 Moldovka, 4 Voronesh 
ow, 10 Abundance, 10 Wyant, i Rolling Stone. All that 
hardy enough have fruited, and of the entire list, the 
tnt, Tatge, Communia, and Moore's Arctic are the only 
i that promise anything of value, the Wyant giving the 
general satisfaction. 

E grapes twenty varieties were tested. We found none 
equalled the Concord, Moore's Early, Worden, and Pockon. 


Kn raspberries seventeen varieties were tested, the most Mtictory 
ones being Nemaha and Palmer, and for family use 
ne we would add the Older. 

In fifteen varieties of strawberries tested, the most favored 
ones are the Crescent, Warfield, and Bedarwood. 

Ifhere are seventy-five varieties of apples under test, also 
varieties of plums, 22 varieties of cherries, 6 of apricot, 10 </seg>

of peach, 8 of pear, 6 of gooseberry, and 7 of currant, that are 
not ready to report on yet. 

Also different modes of cultivation to sustain moisture is 
being carried on. The relative value of the various commercial 
fertilizers and the barnyard manure, along with i 
tive cost of the same, is being tested. Spring of 1900 the 
State Society located an experimental station with us, to be 
handled in connection with ours, and the following stock was 
secured for test, which were planted and are doing as folio 
S Klondike plums, all growing; 5 Missing Link apple, 3 growing; 
5 Baldwin cherry, all growing; 2.~&gt; Josselyn gooseberry, 
all growing; 50 Wallace raspberry, 2.°&gt; growing; 50 Mills" 
¦berry, 25 growing; 25 native raspberry from western 
part of State, 10 growing; 5 pearl gooseberry, all growing. 

KUSE OF EXPERIMENT STATIONS AND THE IN 
ODUCTION OF NEW AND VALUABLE THINO8. 

We have had too many experiment stations, and they have 
been very discouraging and unprofitable. They are generally 
started in this way: A man will come along with some beautiful 
pictures of something new and wonderful. Perhaps it is 
a new and very hardy peach which could be grafted on the 
Nurth Pole and made to bear enormous crops, but as that 
can not be reached, they are grafted on the Canada white 
root, or on the elm, or soft maple, by a process known only to 
"our firm." So he sells a large amount of trees with a li 
amount of cheek and lip, and the man sets up an experiment 
station and finds, to his utter disgust, he has bought a sell. 
If he could only plant the pictures and make them grow he 
would be all right, but that won't work. I once heard of a 
poor little homesick boy who tried it. He was taken out west 
with his parents to a lonely sod house with no trees or flow 
He missed his grandmother and could not be comforted. One 
day his mother found him in the garden with a spade, planting 
a photograph of her mother. "My son, what are you do- </seg>

XEBiLASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

E"I t'ot," said he with quivering lips and convulsive sobs, 
planted it, it would grow and then I could have my 
na again." Poor little fellow, pictures can't grow! 

Alas for the man with the experiment station. The station 
is left with some curses hanging over it. 

Again, hundreds of dollars have been paid out by intelligent 
and responsible parties to find out what they could not 
do. There is not a nurseryman in this state who has not a 
list of failures. This is hardly fair. It is too great a burden 
on the individual. This is a moving age. We stand in the 
dnorway of a new century and we are in the dawn of horticulture. 
That science which was inaugurated in Eden by 
Adam and wife, who were put there to dress it and keep it, is 
now ready to burst forth from its former bounds to an expansion 
unknown before. There are members of this Society who 
will see wonders accomplished before they die. We are gathering 
treasures from all the world and getting the best we 
can find, and by cultivation and hybridizing are improving 
all the time. We want to "prove all things and hold fast that 
which is good." What a gain the century has witnessed in 
the apple. Perhaps the quality of even the Jonathan and 
Grimes' Golden may yet be improved. What a field the great 
West and Northwest present ! The further north we can raise 
the apple the better it is. 

What room for improvement in plums! As the Japanese 
have an affinity for our natives, a great field opens. 

All honor to the men who have worked Ion" 1 and faithfully 
along this line. H. A. Terry, of Crescent, Iowa, has introduced 
forty-five new kinds, mostly improvements on the 
Americana. Iowa is doing much more through her state 
experiment station than we are. 

When we have a fruit like the plum, which bears from June 
to November, and is in great demand, every effort should be 
made to develop it. The state should help and help generously. 
One of the most pathetic things in the last century is </seg>

P ionized the grape culture of the United States; Gideon, 
&gt;ved the apple belt 300 miles north; one dying in the 
n's home and the other in poverty. And we give honmention 
to H. A. Terry, who, besides improving plums 
erries, has introduced over ninety new and choice 
&gt;s, and John C. Teas, both venerable men, who have 
lieir lives to this age and have reaped small returns. 

Iherries must not be forgotten. The wonder is that more 
iot dune along this line. Nebraska is the finest cherry 
ntry in the world. We want a larger, better cherry than 
Richmond, and one as early. We want to know whether 
Sweet and Duke cherries can be crossed with theMorello-s. 
want to see if we can not do something by way of improv 
those late large Russians. I saw some growing in Colo) 
the last September. If one could get plenty of land it 
Id be a good idea to plant thousands of seedlings to 
n; save those of real value, and top graft those that arc 
thless. I am saving seedlings from the choicest Ned. I 
graft the most promising on bearing trees to hasten their 
ting. 

MULBERRIES. 

There is a wide field for improvement in this fruit. Downing's 
Everbearing and New American are worthless in 
braska. I have picked out two from thousands of Russians 
which I am progagating. The Fay is a very thrifty tree, with 
large, glossy leaves and very large fruit. Mine grew eight 
feet last year. It would pay to raise it for ornament alone. 
but when you get the best of that grade of fruit thrown in it 
is worthy of attention. The Mitchell is another fine tree with 
excellent fruit. Then we have a beautiful tree of our own, 
growing on the Platte, highly ornamental, some with immense 
leaves. We need to see what can be done with this. 
One of the most important things for a state is to improve its </seg>

tie are convinced that Nebraska will yet be the greatest 
:h state in the Union. Red cedar belts for protection and 
hardiest trees will win success. The Bruning family have 
forty years been planting peaches in Iowa and Nebraska 
electing the best and hardiest, and they have now probr 
the best in the State, which produce themselves fairly 
I from the pits. 

THE BUFFALO BERRY. 

I his is our own fruit, and there are great possibilities for 
It grows west of the 100th meridian. You will often find 
1 bald high dry bluffs. It will grow and fruit where you 
not raise the currant. The fruit often hangs on till winter, 
in flavor is equal to the currant. Tons of berries are 
irly borne away from the islands of the Platte. Mr. Brunha8 
found some nearly twice the size of others, which 
vs what their possibilities are. I am grafting some on the 
of the Russian olive, as they belong to the same family, 
pe this may improve their size. 

GOOSEBERRIES. 

We are not fully satisfied with this fruit. The Houghton, 
which is most prolific, is not large enough. I am trying to 
cross these with Lancashire Ladd, which I have raised for 
fifteen years. It is an enormous berry, and the only one of the 
foreign sorts which never mildews. 

Dr. Saunders, of the Canada Experiment Stations, has had 
fine success in hybridizing, having given us the Pearl, the 
launders, and a dozen other kinds. All these should be testrd 
and improved if possible. 

t think we can improve our currants and find for the West 
t the Fay is for the East. I am trying to cross the white 
&gt;e and cherry. I think we should make every effort not 
r to obtain new sorts, but to find out the best way to pro; 
a heavy crop with those we have. </seg>

Again, we need to know how many kinds of forest and ornamental 
trees can be made to grow in the State. The Russian 
mulberry and olive, and the catalpa are foreign to us, ami 
have been a help. Ellwanger &amp; Barry have thirty-six kinds 
of elm catalogued. Most of them would doubtless do well 
with us; as they are grafted in the root of our common elms. 
they would not be hard to propagate. There are in York 
three grand Scotch elms which I planted twenty-five year* 
ago. I have raised Rock elm, and the purple leaved and this 
whole family should have a fair chance. 

Ee beach family you may leave entirely out of all calculabut 
we have the birch, which does well. There are 
n kinds of mountain ash. Ten kinds of flowering crabs. 

Pburr oak is a native of this state, and there are groves 
;e trees 150 miles northwest of Lincoln. Thirty-four 
of oak are catalogued; probably half of them would do 
1 the eastern half of the State. White oaks we know do 

EVERGREENS 

I have eighteen kinds of these trees growing, and do not 
think I have reached the limit. None of us have hardly 
touched two of the hardiest, most drought resisting of them 
all — the brown cedar and pinion pine, which come the lowest 
down on the Colorado foot-hills, and defy sun and the dry 
hot air of the plains. We need further experiments how to 
raise all these trees from seed. I have been at much expense 
along this line, and am at work at it yet, but it is too much 
for one man. The problem of raising red cedars should be 
solved by the State, and given to the public. When men work 
thirty years, as the Brunings have, the process belongs to 
them and not to the public. Otherwise we would have more 
martyrs of the Bull and Gideon order. 

We know not how large a family of evergreens we can 
raise. I am pleased with the Fraser fir and pinus pungens of

thrifty and seemed to like Nebraska well. But it was

A good many experienced men are working out the berry 
problem. These can only succeed by irrigation. We note 
that one man has devised a 4-inch hose, made from 20-ounce 
ducking, which carries water from his high ground pond all 
over his patch. 

FLOWERS. 

Nebraska in the main is a state without flowers. Up to 
date, outside the cities, very little has been done, and yet in no 
te do they succeed better. With 2,000 kinds of paeonics. 
thirty-five kinds of charming columbines, with phloxes, pansies, 
delphiniums, and iris, with scores of fine flowering 
shrubs, it is a shame the people do not have more flowers. 
They must have object lessons and see for themselves what 
wonders our own soil and climate can produce. 

CREATING A DEMAND. 

After things have been tested and proven they should be 
pushed before the people. Very often something of merit is 
offered a nurseryman, and he says, "There is no demand for 
it." It is his business to make a demand. That is what he is 
for. It is a part of his grand mission. It should not be left 
for fakirs and sharpers to introduce things of merit. We seldom 
see as much of harmony and mutual helpfulness as exists 
among Nebraska horticulturists. I would suggest a general 
descriptive catalogue which all should unite in issuing, 
recommending things of merit and giving warning against 
things which can not succeed. Let the various experiment 
urns supply the fraternity at the lowest price, and so all 
have an interest in the dissemination of those things of real 
merit. Then we have a unity of purpose and aim and mutual 
helpfulness. It costs something to introduce new and valuable 
things, and the nurseryman should have his pay for it. </seg>

those is that when any new thing is sent out that is "blowed" 
very high, and shown up with fine colored pictures, as Mr. 
Harrison has said, by the "professionals'" as we call them. 
We get hold of all these things just as soon as they appear, 
and put them in our experiment stations, and have reports on 
them annually at our meetings. In this way we are able to 
tell the people what not to plant better than what to plant. 
And in our farmers* institutes and wherever we have anything 
to say in the matter, we say, "Keep your hands off 
until we have tried this thing in the experiment stations, and 
then it will be time enough for you to waste money on it." 
In that way our experimental stations are of intrinsic value 

Ejferring to the matter of cherries, I should like to ask 
Harrison if he does not have good results from the Mont?ney? 


Mit. Harrison — The Large Montmorency is a very fine 
cherry. 

Mr. Augustine (continuing) — We have a great deal of 
trouble with just such things as that. I think there are 
twenty or thirty or forty cherries in our county that are called 
Mnntmorenoy, and in our experiment stations we find out just 
what the right one is. And, besides that, the nurserymen 
are taking pains now in that direction. They have begun 
propagating from certain trees; they don't propagate from 
nursery rows where a tree marked Montmorency may be anything 
but Montmorency. We go and find certain trees that 
we know are the genuine thing and confine our propagation 
to that. I think we have got to instruct the nurserymen 
through the experiment stations, and I am here to say that 
we get wonderfully good results from our experiment stations. 
We are able to help the people. Our state is four 
hundred miles long. We have three different societies, a 
southern, a central, and a northern ; and in these reports we 
find that what does well in the northern very frequently does 
not do well in the southern, and vice versa. And when people </seg>

CULTURE AND CARE OF THE ORCHARD. 

BY L. M. RUSSELL, WYMORE. 

The subject assigned to me is an old one and nearly threadbare, 
especially to the members of this Society. This same 
subject will be assigned to some member of the Society as 
"Culture and Care of the Orchard," and at the next meeting 
or probably two years later, will be assigned as "Care and 
Culture of the Orchard," and for this reason it will be rather 
difficult to bring out anything new or that will be an improvement 
on what has been said. 

If I should not confine myself as closely to the appleorchard 
as perhaps a great many would, I will leave that for 
some one who has made that their specialty,; as the members 
of the Society well know, our firm has made commercial pead 
orcharding our special work. 

Eiere is no branch of industry by which large profits may 
:pected unless it is rightly managed; and most certainly 
is true of the business of fruit growing in our climate. 

Too many people plant their orchards and expect them to 
live, bear, and do well with very little or no care at all. Of 
course we do not think any member of this Society would 
make this mistake, as we are all so much interested in fruit 
growing that we will give the orchard the very best of care. 
The orchard is too often greatly neglected by the average 
farmer. 

As the season comes on for the cultivation of his farm 
crops, his time and his whole thought is so much taken up 
that the orchard is rather of a secondary matter; and by the 
time his crops are well cared for it in too late to be of any use </seg>

rltivatc the orchard. The giwud being too dry ami hard 
ltivate in any manner. 

I me planters recommend planting apple trees as close as 
) 12 feet in the row and the vows 20 to 2o feet apart, 
r object in this close planting is that the trees serve one 
protection to another, and they advise when these tree« 
! into bearing to cut out a number of them, giving the 
n a chance. Bat this seems to me to be a needless ex 
e, as in the Hist place it requires a greater outlay for the 
base of trees and excuse of planting. I would recom 
1 planting further apart, if you have to protect the trees 
i the sun for a while. 

The expense of cultivating may be greatly reduced by growing 
corn between the rows until they begin bearing; then 
give the orchard a good, thorough cultivation, as it needs all 
the nourishment it can get to ripen the best fruit. . I have 
sci n neglected orchards, during our long dry seasons, that 
have been entirely ruined, while the orchard with thorough 
cultivation will pass through the dry weather seemingly to 
have ¦offered very little from the drouth. The drier the season, 
the more necessity of good cultivation, as it helps the 
tree to ripen its fruit, giving it a much better color and size 
and at the same time forms a belter fruit bud for the next 
season. If the tree becomes affected by the ¦erere winter, it 
is of great Importance that it have the very best cultivation 
tlie following season; for if left to grow to weeds and grass 
it is almost certain death, when, if property cared for, it may 
recover sufficiently to produce a number of good crops of 

Some say begin cultivation as soon as the weeds begin to 
grow, but it is better to begin before the weeds make any show 
at all; for if the weeds once get a start, no matter how small 
they are, they draw the needed moisture from the tree, and

time than after they get up a few inches high. Never allow 
any trash of any kind to grow and remain near the tree, as it 
forms a good hiding place for mice, and they sometimes damage 
or entirely kill the tree by gnawing the bark. 

When we first began growing apple orchards in Nebraska 
it was thought by many that sun-scald was the worst thing 
we had to contend with. But this obstacle being overcome 
by the various ways of protection, such as wrapping with 
coarse hay or slough-grass, paper, or wooden wrappers, we 
find that when the tree is at the bearing age and its drooping 
branches serve as a sun protector, that the codling moth is 
now our wont enemy. I will not attempt U&gt; add anything 
new to this, as it has been so thoroughly described by Prof. F. 
W. Card, in the Nebraska State Horticultural Report of 
1806, on p. 74. But it is certain that we must use some form 
of spraying for this insect. Some large growers have - 
mated the cost of spraying at fifteen to forty cents per . 
for a single spraying. This includes the material and labor. 

THE SCAB. 

This. is a disease which shows itself both on the fruit and 
leaves, in dark colored spots. This can be prevented to a 
great extent by spraying the trees with the Bordeaux mixture. 
Spraying about ten days before the bud ojhmis, and 
three more applications at intervals of two weeks. The mixture 
consists of copper sulphate 4 lbs., fresh lime, 4 lbs., and 
water, 50 gallons. 

fllKKHIKS. 

As to the cherry tree, it will come as near doing well all 
over our state as any other fruit tree. At Wyniore our trees 
have been bearing every year for the last ten years, and are 
repotted as doing equally as well all over the State. 

PEACHES. 

We must not let the peach pass unnoticed, as the people are 
taking very much interest in the planting and care of the </seg>

P chard, especially south of the Platte river; and the 
chard will give returns sooner than any other tree, 
r some of our trees here at Lincoln that had been 
;wo years and four months ripened two to three basne 
fruit that sold readily at fifty cents per basket in 
)ln market. We have had them three years and four 
rom planting produce five to six baskets of nice fruit. 

The mistake a great many will make in planting the peach 
orchard is in planting too close. Our first orchards were 
planted 10 by 12 feet. We have been planting wider, until 
now we are planting 14 by 18 and 14 by 20 feet, and find that 
we get larger and better peaches than when we planted closer. 

The expense of cultivation and caring for them the first 
two years after planting can be greatly reduced by growing 
corn between the rows, the same as mentioned in the apple 
orchard. But I would not advise growing of crops of any 
kind longer than two years. After that, give thorough, clean 
cultivation until about the 20th of July, forcing all the 
growth possible early in the season. 

Iou will find some weeds growing after the cultivation 
«, and you may not like the looks of them, but if we have 
rere winter following, as we had in the winter of 1898-99, 
weeds may prove a great benefit I noticed in that parlar 
winter, where young trees were cultivated late and 
i entirely clean, they suffered much worse than where 
igh weeds or corn-stalks were left to catch the snow. In 
way the weeds serve a double purpose : that of checking 
growth in time to ripen the buds, and by catching the 
r, thereby protecting the roots. 

We use for the cultivation of our bearing orchards the 
"Diamond Reversible Pulverizer," purchased from the Johnston 
Harvester Co., Batavia, New York. We have an extended 
frame on this that enables us to run under the limbs, 
working right up to the body of the tree, throwing the dirt to 
or from the tree, as desired.

DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Swan — Two years ago a fellow came down there into 
our country from Illinois and rented forty acres of land. I 
think there are twenty-five apple trees on that place, say 
twenty years old, and that fellow has sold apples enough off 
those twenty-five trees to pay the rent of that land, and has 
plenty of apples left. I have a hundred trees just as old, and 
have hardly marketed an apple, so I asked him how it came 
that he could raise apples and I couldn't. He said that in the 
spring he simply put a row of salt around each tree and kept 
it there; the codlin moth wouldn't cross that salt and climb 
the tree. That was his idea, and he had apples and none of 
us had any, so last spring I went into the salt business. I put 
salt around my trees four times, and every time I put salt 
around them it happened to rain that night and washed it 

Mb. Harrison — How did your apples turn out? 

Er. Swan — I couldn't keep the salt there last spring ; you 
;mber it rained nearly all the time for two weeks. I am 
g to try it again next spring.

and don't put them into a damp cellar; keep them out in 
the field as long as you can. An apple doesn't freeze en.- 
Sn far this year one could keep apples very nicely in a 
riage house. In fact, you can keep them that way all winter 
by throwing some blanket* over the barrels, and they will 
keep better than in an ordinary cellar. Keep them at just 
as low a temperature as possihle, and never handle apples 
nviT in the winter time. I have in my cellar now a monument 
of mv folly, and I leave them there just to look at once 
in a while. Some years ago I put shelves in my cellar - 
could over the apples five or six times during the winter 
and pick out the rotten apples. Of course the folks would 
¦ae up the rotten apples first, and just ahout the time they 
were gOM I would go over them again, and the CO1 
qnenee was we had the luxury of rotten apples all the time 
[Laughter.] Now when I put my apple* in the cellar 1 
the ban-els on blocks to prevent the bottoms getting damp; 
take the head out so I won't have to jar the barrel when 
I begin to use them, and I don't allow anybody to handle 
only what apples they get out for use. Even though thenis 
a rotten apple in them once in a while, I won't allow them 
handled over. Once you handle them over, then you have 
done the job; then they are going to begin to decay. 

(think the main points to be observed are: handle your 
es just as carefully and just as little as possible. 
i just as near freezing a.s possible, and don't gather them 
¦arly in the season. 

HOW BEST TO INTEREST THE FARMER IN IIOKTI

NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

the very first thing he would do as soon as he could get 
ground broken and in condition for planting, would be to 
plant groves, shelter belts, orchards, and a fruit garden. We 
have all heard many expressions of the sentiment "We would 
not feel content to live in a bleak and treeless region, and 
if we can not raise fruit as we did in the homes from which 
we came we should feel like returning." In those days it 
was very easy indeed to interest a farmer in a grove of five 
or ten acres, which would ultimately have value for shelter 
and fuel, windbreaks around his lines of trees, shelter belts 
for orchards, gardens, and feed yards. Immense numbers of 
forest trees were planted in the years from 1875 to 1890. 
It is true that the enormous number of trees planted during 
that period, so large as to entitle us to the term of "treeplanting 
state" of the West, was stimulated by the timberclaim 
law, and no doubt this was responsible for the planting 
of many hundreds of millions of trees, the end in viewbeing 
to acquire title to additional land. Bnt connected with 
this feeling, and running along with it, was an appreciation 
of the value of trees for themselves, of their value as shelter 
belts for the feed lots, the home grounds, and they were frequently 
planted along the wayside. 

Then there came a wave of dry seasons, nwiny trees closely 
and unwisely planted and cared for were lost by periods of 
severe drouth. Also orchards and shelter belts that were 
not given proper care in very many cases suffered serious 
loss with consequent discouragement. There was a period 
when the financial condition of the country was not such as 
to iavite extensive planting. Passing through this, in the 
eastern half of the State, lands are already very valuable, 
and the farmer who has plowed up the major portion of his 
grazing lands that he may grow additional acres of corn 
and wheat complains of the drain of moisture and the loss 
of corn or grain within one or two rods of lines of trees 
or shelter belts. He feels for the moment as though there 
was a positive loss sustained in noting that within twenty </seg>

Pfeet of a grove there was not moisture enough for 
d or grain and trees. I think we are apt to overfact 
that under the protection of shelter belts lesle 
influence, to some extent, of our violent and arid 
venty acres may yield larger crops than eighty acres 
protection. 

We need at this time also a revival of interest in the plantof 
shrubs and flowers, orchards, and fruit gardens, which 
must be builded on a foundation of belief in the possibility 
of success in this line of work. This naturally leads us to 
the question, How can the farmer be convinced that this 
is possible? How shall he be persuaded to give it the study 
and care required for intelligent, successful planting and 

Our honorable Society for thirty years has been holding 
its annual and semi-annual meetings, bringing together the 
thought and experience of our most successful orchard 
We have also invited our friends and neighbors to come with 
us and to take advantage of the best experience of the State 
brought together and freely poured out for the benefit of 
all who would come to take part with- us. Our state has 
generously made an appropriation for the benefit of our Society, 
and publishes 5,000 of our reports. All this is very 
creditable as far as it goes, and is in the right direction, and 
yet when we consider the immense number of people whom 
we do not reach, it seems like a stone thrown into a wide 
pond, having but little influence over the great body. 

Our efforts so far have been directed almost entirely to 
influencing people of mature years, with some success, and 
yet the preoccupation of mind, the many burdens carried, 
and the varied interests engaging their attention have prevented 
our influencing as many as we had hoped. Perhaps 
we may learn something from other countries where an attempt 
has been made to reach desired results in another 
form. Professor Hansen of South Dakota tells us that trav- </seg>

developed and put into execution for the study of horticulture 
in our public schools? May we not as individuals briag

for the same pur]M&gt;se? Would it not be useful to make donations 
of trees for the improvement of school grounds and 
take a little time to kIiow the teachers and the children how 
best to plant, cultivate, and care for them? At tin- pret 
time I think botany is taught in all of our town schools.

Can we not make increased use of the Farmers' Institutes, 
making an effort, even at considerable personal inconvenience 
and loss of time, to see that the horticultural inter 
secure a fair share of time, and are properly presented at 
each and every institute? Might it not be well to take 
these institutes samples of trees and plants, let the right 
merhods of budding, grafting, planting, trimming, training 
be presented to than so clearly with these object lessons that 
the average farmer would feel that the principles underlying 
all this work were no more difficult than the production 
of crops with which he feels familiar? 

Can we not make a determined, continual effort to very 
largely increase the membership of our State Society, and 
also form local societies? In this way we exercise our personal 
influence over a larger number of people. The man 
who can lie induced to attend our meetings and listen to the

fail to become a convert to the possibilities and advantages 
of planting flowers, shrubs, plants, and trees. And learning

Does not this indicate that their members have been more 
\ e than we in securing new members? Ought we not to 
resolve that, during the coming year, each and every member 
of the Society will hold himself personally responsible for 
influencing at least three persons to join? 

Are we making as much Me as we ought of the potent 
power of the press? The state publishes 5,000 of our rep&lt;&gt; 
and when these are all judiciously distributed they come into 
perhaps 5,000 families. Is it not unfortunate that as at 
present printed the deliberations of our Society held in July, 
i, and the work of the January meeting of 1900 were 
finally published and given to the public in December, 1900? </seg>

NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

Is there not some way of making increased use of the press 
and having all interesting and valuable papers and discussions 
given to the people through the medium of the state 
press, and an effort made to reach at least 100,000 families 
instead of 5,000? The average farm home is scantily supplied 
with the best reading material. There is room for a large 
and more varied amount of reading. Can we not, in readable 
and attractive form, present to them such interesting facts 
and studies in horticulture as we may wish to bring before 
them, helping them to pleasantly pass the winter evenings 
and imbuing a love for our work? May we not feel that if 
we can reach the children and the families that they will 
grow into enthusiastic horticulturists and planters? 

Eght it not be well for each and every member to conte 
to the local press, which I think will surely be found 
to all. We ought also to make increased use of our 
ag journals, all glad to assist in work of this kind. 

HORTICULTURE IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 

By G. H. Van Houten, Iowa. 

E! first thought when the subject was noticed was : Is it 
ible that horticulture should be taught in the public 
Is? The next was: If desirable, is it practicable to 
horticulture in the public schools? 

Patrons, parents, teachers, and pupils are crying out 
against the great number of studies in our schools in Iowa, 
and it is probable that the same is true in Nebraska. Yet 
there are always those who would introduce other studies, 
and when confronted with the statement that there are now 
too many, they say, "drop out some of the less important 
studies we now have and adopt others more important." But 
who is to determine which others are more important? In 
Iowa the latest study for which teachers are required to qual-</seg>

ify themselves is music, so as to be able to teach the readiuir 
of music, that is, the notes. Others demand that instrumental 
music shall be taught, while others demand that the 
German and other languages shall be added, and in the capital 
city of Iowa this question is being agitated. 

When it is asked which of the studies now taught shall be 
eliminated, there is a great diversity of opinion. Some insist 
that Latin shall go, others that the higher mathematics, 
while others insist that physiology shall be dropped,' while 
some would drop grammar except in normal schools. Some 
think that language should be dropped as a special study. 
for they claim that children learn to talk before being sent 
to school, and if not (as some are sent before being able to 
speak plainly), it is asserted that they can learn to talk at 
home, and, as a matter of fact, so they can, but most teachers 
insist that the most difficult thing to teach a child is to correct 
the inaccuracies of language learned at home. As Latin is 
the base of most languages that it is desirable to learn, many 
teachers insist that this shall not be eliminated. Most boys, 
and especially country boys, would almost rebel if mathematics 
was proposed to be left out of the studies of the public 
school, and, in fact, when we look for the studies that 
are to be eliminated we are at a loss to decide which one shall 
go, so, as a matter of fact, we should regard any new study as 
one to be added rather than one to displace one now taught 
in the schools. If we do not do this we will find endless 
trouble in deciding on the one to be displaced. 

I he question now for immediate consideration is to denine, 
if we can, what is to be gained by the new study and 
number to be benefited. Before deciding this matter let 
if we can, determine about the proportion of those to be 
*ht who will be specially benefited by the new study, and 
lose connection with this will be the matter of practicuty, 
not only of the teaching but the benefits to be derived, 
o can teach horticulture in the schools? Certainly not 
young girls who now predominate in the teaching force. </seg>

Then who will we get? Sonic have raggetted that competent 
-•ins lie ¦elected by tin* horticultural societies to visit the 
'ols at stated period* nd give leetarei and make demontions. 
Is this practicable? Hardly, for the reason that 
there arc not enough coin]H'tent peno&amp;l to do this work who 
BO sittiiited that they could do it. Then, ¦gala, those who 
BUght he the most willing to do this work would be the hast 
fitted to do such work. Many of our horticultural cranks 
aright lie willing to devote some time to this work, and some 
of our competent Bonbon would he m\twmi\itlitg eaoogh 
to do something, hut among the great numher of schools and 
the comparatively small number who are competent and willing 
to do this work, this method is impracticable. BappoK 
that it be demanded that the teachers shall qualify for this 
work : Who is to teach them and where are they to be taught? 
Our present agricultural colleges are not enough, and no 
method, so far as suggested, seems adequate to even give 
ini|K&gt;tus to the proposed movement. 

If the question should he asked : Is it desirable that horticultural 
instruction should be given in the school? and, even 
should the answer be in the affirmative, then the next thing 
to be considered is How can it l&gt;e done? The schools of Iowa 
are in a transition stage at the present time, and the schools 
of Nebraska will exjH'rience similar changes in the future. 
Many of the school districts of Iowa have lost in school 
population each decade for the last thirty years, and some 
of them even longer than that. Many of the schools have hut 
few pupils, and now the plan adopted in many distric 
to abolish the subdistrict organizations and consolidate in n 
district-township, with one or more schools in the township; 
then, by contract, hiring the pupils transported from their 
homes to the school, and then returned home again at night. 
This is found to be cheaper and more satisfactory. Fewer 
and better teachers are employed and graded schools are practicable. 
Now, if this condition is to come (and it is rapidly 
coming in Iowa) what is the use of requiring the thousands </seg>

of Machcri to qualify in ¦ now study when few of them will 
be needed to teach the new study? Population in the I'nited 
tes is gravitating to centers and will continue so to 
tate in spite of railroads, trolly cars, telephones, and rural 
mail. I agree that t)iis is not an ideal condition, but the old 
world has come to this and so will we, as much as we deplore 
the final results. Our theory years ago was small farms and 
many of them, but we want the other fellow to have the small 
farm, and if we can not have a large farm we will niov. 
town. Now, remember, this is what we are comimg to. not 
what is desired. In other words, the next &lt;;eneration will 
paj less attention to horticulture and agriculture than does 
this generation. There will be a greater proportion of people 
who live on salaries and a greater proportion of people who 
will live in cities, towns, and villages. Improved machinery, 
reatly increasing productive capacity, the gregariOM nature 
and dunging notions of our people will till up our towns 
to ovcitlowinj;, and consolidation of farms will contiiuh 
that those who will need special agricultural and horticultural 
education will be a constantly decreasing proportion of 
our people. No one can Ik- more sorry to see the chai 
that I predict than I will be, but that will not blind my • 
to the things that are sure to come, unless some unforeseen 
tendency shall change the current hack to the farm. Why 
will men willingly work in town and board themselves for 
about the amount paid for farm labor where board is free? 
Why will gilM and women work in department stores at 
about the price of domestic work in the farm homes? People 
i urse corporations and railroads, and yet plenty of section 
men can be hired at about the price of a day's wage on the 
farm by the month, where each day is considered a wage day, 
wet or dry, work or not, and where board is good and cheap 
and often the washing is done without charge. Counting the 
price paid for board, the farm hand can have twice as many 
dollars at the end of the month, and yet it is difficult for the </seg>

can get all they want, and other laborers are wekiag employment 
on every hand. Then why teach all the pupils in our 
school things that few of them will ever use? Bookkeepiag 
ami many other studies might be used to a greater extent 
than horticulture and are more practicable in the common 
•ill, and a greater number could apply that study in the 
business of the future. So, taking everything into consideration, 
I am not in favor of making horticulture one of the repaired 
studies in the school. Some horticultural friends will 
consider this a pessimistic view of the subject under iia 
sion, but before condemning the argument please consider 
it from the standpoint here outlined, that is, not from the 
future conditions as we would have them, but from the future 
;is it will be, spite of all the influence we may be able to bring 
to bear to retard or prevent the undesirable conditions that 
are coming. You may say that these things will not be. If 
so, please preserve the record and wait and see. 

The views here taken are, however, not pessimistic when 
properly understood. The future holds out bright prosj&gt; 
for the land owner, the farmer, and the horticulturist. The 
fewer engaged in the business the better for those so engaged. 
But to succeed to the best advantage, he must not shut his eyes 
and say certain things ought to be, and, because they ought 
to be will be, but rather take a survey of the field, watch the 
tendency of the times, and be prepared to take advantage of 
coming changes. I have known many men of good ability 
and good judgment, too, who were located in towns that they 
thought ought to become county seat towns and centers of 
population, and because they thought that they should be they 
concluded that they would be, but the prudent business man 
moved to the center of population and grew up with the town, 
and the other fellow some years later moved west to grow 
up with the country. 

K&gt; not consider what is said above as an argument against 
ling horticulture in such of the schools as need it, but 
horticulture should be a required study of each and every </seg>

common or public school the circumstances and conditions 
do not warrant. It is probable tbat more in botany could be 
taught and that practical things might be introduced in the 
way of teaching the distinguishing characteristics of trees 
and plants, and even planning and planting of school grounds 
niijjht be undertaken as object lessons. Where a nursery is 
located near a school it would be a good idea to take a fieldday 
occasionally, and then, with some experienced nurseryman 
or horticulturist to explain and demonstrate, it would 
be easy to demonstrate principles, but this would not be a 
course in horticulture, and from present and prospective 
conditions I do not believe that it is desirable and, if desirable, 
not practicable, to teach horticulture as one of required 
studies in our public schools. 

The time was that any one could be a farmer. The farmer 
of the future should have special instruction, and will get it 
in the college or in the school of experience, which is a dear 
school, but get it he must to successfully prosecute his calling. 
He must be a business man, and if not he will wake up 
some fine day to the realization that some business man has 
a better title to his land than he has, and then he will become 
a renter or move to town to swell the ever increasing 
proportion of urban population. 

Ihousands of children are passing through the grades of 
best schools who have a very imperfect knowledge of 
nmar, can not spell correctly, are poor writers and know 
;tically nothing about rhetoric and composition. If you 
pupil or teacher with the defects of education of those 
ling the grades, you will be met with the statement that 
¦e is not more time to devote to these studies. It may be 
rted that many public men have acquired eminence who 
i no better educated, and this is true, but they were in 
petition with those who had no better acquirements; but 
,ter accomplishments are demanded now and still greater 
be in the years to come, and until the rudiments of a 
1 education are drilled into the minds of the pupils no

more studies should 1k&gt; required. In fart, no more should be 
mitted, but, later, if probable necessity exists, apecia] insiruction 
can begiren in horticulture, agriculture, languages, 
&lt;&gt;r any fad or fancy that tlie parent or pupil, or tlie exigencies 
of each case may reipiire, hut for tlie present, and under conditions 
as they exist, I d&lt;&gt; not favor adding horticulture as 
one of the studies of the public school. This need not. and 
would not, preclude the idea of making the study of botany 
re practical, for those definitions and terms that are 
Ik died to explain horticultural subjects might profitably 
be introduced and taught. This need not he called teaching 
horticulture in the schools; la fact would not be such teaching 
as a study; and what is said of botany could he said of 
many other studies. There is plenty of room for reform 
¦long many lines. For illustration: how much better in h z- ! ho&lt;!z-raphy 
could be taught by making the study more attractive 
by the use of reading geographies, where pictures and maps 
could be introduced in connection with attractive recitals bj 
authors who had ln-en in actual contact with the countries 
to be studied? 

A wide contact with business men in recent years has 
shown that many of them do not regard graduation from our 
Common schools, high schools, business colleges, or universiwith 
the confidence that should be desired, and the reason 
is not hard to understand. Let the following incident 
sutlice as an illustration: The writer was once away from 
home, and, mentioning the necessity of writing several let. 
the business man with whom a visit was being made 
¦laced his stenographer at my disposal; several letters were 
dictated and later, in reading them, I corrected many word* 
that were not correctly sjtelled. The stenographer, noticing 
me making the corrections, asked to see them, and there were 
any corrections that a second letter was written in each 
case, for tlie corrections were so numerous as to appear to 
demand rewriting. Yet this work was done by one who had 
had the benefit of high school and college instruction and </seg>

graduation. Now, as is often the .case, the primary education 
was defective, and the later and social education had not 
corrected (poariMj had not attempted to correct ) the defects 
of early education. The case mentioned is hut an illustration 
of the defects that will be met with on every hand in employment 
of educated yoang people now seeking employment. 
The defects, or rather lack of education of forty to fifty \ 
¦ajo is now often remarked, but in those days pupils V 
drilled on the few studies taken until they could spell well 
at least, and when we consider that in the old days there 
were but a few weeks of school in the winter, and that pupils 
did not have the advantages of good, well lighted, warm 
looms and the hooks, maps, and facilities of the present school 
days, we must give at least a measure of credit to the old 
school system, crude as it was. 

I my way, why should horticulturists demand that all n 
1 should he educated to compete with them? No other 
iness or calling makes this demand, and "why should horilturists 
make any demand that the schools should induce 
re people to engage in the business? Their work and their 
mple should he the incentive and the object lesson, ami 
d, if others are to be taught, there should l&gt;e schools betfitted 
for instruction than the public schools, already a 
led with studies, so that nothing is taught in the thorough 
nner desired. 

Eien, to sum up conclusions: It is doubtful if teaching 
iculture in the public schools is desirable, but even if 
•able it is impracticable under present conditions or 
itions of the near future.

value to the public ; others are a source of wealth to the originator 
and a vexation to the grower. 

Certain unscrupulous men revive old varieties under new 
names and impose them on a too credulous public at the expense 
of legitimate trade. It is the province of our Horticultural 
Society to protect the citizens of the State from 
fraud, test new fruits, and determine their fitness for our 
soil and climate. There are many varieties of apples, old and 
new, that should be tested. We know that the Spy, Baldwin, 
and Russets are failures with us, but it has been learned at 
great expense of money and time. I shall only mention two 
varieties that I think deserve testing, though there are many 
others : the Salome and the Ingram. The fowner I have seen 
fruited with every indication in its favor; the latter I only 
know by reputation, but hope soon to see it in bearing. 

E r e have also many new varieties of grapes that are deiding 
our attention at the rate of a dollar to a dollar and 
ilf each. Some of these have great merit; others many 
erits, and it should be within the scope of our Society to 
rtain the true merits of each and disseminate the knowli 
among the planters. 

Easpberries and blackberries come in for a share of new 
eties, and with the strawberry the number is legion, with 
irospect that we are reaching the limit. 

God told Adam nearly six thousand years ago to "dress 
and to keep" the Garden of Eden, and from the time when 
that venerable person was driven from the garden until tinbeginning 
of the nineteenth century, God was left to care 
for the garden himself. One hundred years ago nearly all 
fruit was in either a natural or semi-wild state. Our forefathers 
gathered the raspberry from the fence corner, the 
blackberry from the wooded hillside, strawberries from the 
meadow, and only seedling apples pleased or displeased their 
palates. A seedling or sport that chanced to be of extra quality 
was soon lost, as but little was known of budding and 
grafting. The uses of the parts of a flower in tbe economy </seg>

I ogress in the nineteenth century has been rapid in all 
ches of agriculture. The invention of labor-saving malinery 
has been remarkable; the improvement in our 
»tic animals has been greater than from the time when 
b changed the color of the cattle in order to get sweet 
lge on his father-in-law to the beginning of the century, 
discoveries in horticulture have been marvelous, and, 
&gt;ugh the last quarter of a century has given us many 
varieties, the science of fertilization is now so perfect 
we may expect greater things in the next generation. 

The research of the last century, remarkable as it has been 
in new discoveries, gives ub still greater benefits in that we 
have learned partially the meaning of the words promulgated 
soon after man's advent into the world — that he should have 
dominion over the earth. The usually accepted idea that this 
referred only to the animal kingdom must give way to the 
knowledge that it applies to not only the animal but mineral 
and vegetable kingdoms, and the elements above us. To what 
extent this dominion will be carried in the twentieth century 
we can only conjecture. One thing we know: the present 
varieties of fruit will soon be superseded by others now unknown. 
To avoid local names and to prevent old varieties 
from coming out under new names our Society should have 
a special committee whose duty it should be to carefully catalogue 
all varieties under cultivation and to work in unison 
with like committees from other states in naming new specimens. 
This committee should be composed of men well

WILL NEBRASKA BE A WINE PRODUCING STATE? 

By J. P. Dunlap, Ihyight. 

This depends upon three things: first, can we produce the 
wine? second, can we sell it at remunerative prices? and 
third, is it an honorable and legitimate business? 

As to producing the wine, all grape growers know that if 
they glow sufficient fruit for (he off years, the abundant 
years give them such enormous crops that it is hard to dis 
pose of the fresh fruit at prices that will barely pay for picking 
and marketing. But if this surplus could be wotted up mi 
as to get remunerative prices by making it into wine, or otherwise, 
then they could plant more extensively so as to be 
able to supply the demand for grapes in the years of light 
crop*. 

Then, again, the cherry produces such heavy and regular 
oops that 1 would place about live hundred gallons as a fair </seg>

Ee per acre, counting each year from the time the trees 
¦ted until they are fifteen years old. And if this strictly 
rticle tan be sold at one dollar per gallon it will be 
very remunerative and will give employment to many 
during the gathering season. 

I hen, can we sell it? That is the question. I do not think 
must compete in price* with a product that depends on 
ltin&lt;; works and gas faetoriei for taste, dye houses for 
&lt;r, and rivers and wells for quantity. But if we can have 
rinjjent law against anyone Belling adulterated wines, or 
w adopt in»; any other name that none hut strictly pure 
e shall be known by, and providing heavy penalties for 
inie selling anything but a strictly pure wine by that 
le, then I believe that the business can be carried on at 
•od profit 

ind is it fair and right to engage in wine making as a busi? 
I know that many at first thought would say that it is 
But when the fact is taken into consideration that the 
9 may be made fermented or unfermented, and as there 
demand for a strictly pure wine for church purposes, 
sick persons, and that many families would like to k 
i, and are willing to pay fair prices for a strictly pure 
¦le, and as we have a good soil and climate for the busi, 
and the trees and plants can be produced in any desired 
itity, and as we have a constantly increasing iMipulation 
are desirous of employment, I do not see any moral reawhy 
it should not be done.

the same opinion as Mr. Wellhouse in regard to the cause of 
orchards dying so young in Nebraska: it is ignorance and 
neglect. If people would manage their orchards here as they 
do in the East, where apple trees live two or three hundred 
years, they would live much longer than they do. White 
tin cad rot is no more liable here than m New York, but many 
here ignore the main cause, especially the nurserymen. Although 
it often starts in two and three year old trees, yet it 
works so slowly that to the casual observer its influence is 
not even suspected for eight or ten years, when the trunk 
and root are found to be decayed at heart and the fruit about 
half size. Many ways have been suggested to remedy this 
matter. In the nursery the best plan is to cut to the ground. 
In old orchards it only affects the limbs, which should be 
cut off at once. 

I hen I was in New York a few years ago I visited an oril 
planted in 1814 or 1815 on clay loam sloping to the 
least. Out of the hundred trees planted, only about a 
a were missing. I couldn't learn the cause, as no one 
5 knew. The grandson had died and the great-grandson 
ght none had died lately. I measured one tree two feet 
the ground twelve feet and four inches in circumference, 
branch three and a half feet from the ground was three 
in circumference; no appearance of decay in any part, 
e trees were planted twenty feet apart each way. 

It does not make so much difference which way the ground 
slopes if the trees are set according to the slope. On a fair 
southern slope the trees should be only ten feet apart north 
and south, and eighteen feet east and west ; while on a northern 
slope two or three times that distance, or even more, is 
required. Yet a close set orchard yields more per acre, and, 
for a few years, per tree. 

Regretting that I can not meet with you at the winter 
meeting (being eighty -one years old last summer) and wishing 
you a successful meeting, I remain, with kind regards,

STRAWBERRIES. 

8TRAWRKKUIES— THE WAY I GROW THEM 

W. A. Swan, Tecumseh. 

Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Horticultural Society: 

In my treatment of the subject assigned me it is my purpose 
to simply give my experience in growing them. I consider 
location quite an item in growing berries, and, in fact, any 
kind of fruit. An intelligent observer will notice that nearly 
all of our natural timber grows on the northern slopes. Then, 
to get in line with nature, select a northern slope if you want 
to grow berries on a large scale. Any land that will produce 
com is all right. I would plow the ground six or eight inches 
deep. Keep harrows and rollers off. Lay off rows eight feet 
apart, and plant twelve or fifteen inches apart in the row. 
I know the books all say four- foot rows, but my experience is 
that in the four-foot rows , if the berries are kept clean, by fall 
the vines are matted so thick that the berries will be small. 
In the eight-foot rows the vines will not reach together except 
some of the freer running kinds, the plants will be thinner 
and more stocky than when they intermingle, as tfcej will 
in the four-foot rows; the second year the old row can be 
plowed out and save resetting so often. In planting I never 
had any success in the man, spade, and boy, as some recommend, 
for when the spade is inserted in the soil and pressed 
forward one or two inches, it leaves a thin space for the roots, 
and when the spade is removed oftentimes it pulls the roots 
up near the surface. My plan is to make a furrow where you 
want the row, get down on your knees, spread the roots in all 
directions, and then press the soil firmly around the plants 
with the hands. Then, wet or dry, give each plant half a pint 
of water. In this way I do not lose more than 1 per cent in 
planting. One man can plant three-fourths of an acre a day

comes the tug of war. For preparing the land and planting

will have growth enoogfe for a nnilch for winter-protection 
in southeastern Nebraska, but it will help the ensuing crop to 
give them every fall a good dressing of weil-rotted iiianure; 
the more the better, so you don't smother the plants. 

I would prefer not to plow under any manure before plant 
as it increases the work in tending them the first year, 
you expect your fruit from the top, hence I would put 
nanure on top after the plants are started. By the fourrow 
process I have grown two hundred fifty bushels per

is only doing what any other man can do who applies brains

Mm. Srn.sox — Mr. Porter at HcCool has a pond fed by two

in the appearance of my raspberries. 

The President — The location makes a great difference. 
Vim can all tell from the way Rev. Harrison talks that he

siuns here that when there is a contradiction it is almost in 
variably due to location of the parties. Mr. Harrison and 
Mr. Stilson are back seventy-five miles or so from the river 
and are associated with the State west of there; Mr. Barnard 
and Mr. Swan are down along the river. 

Mu. Stilson — I would just like to say this : when you talk 
about raising strawberries a hundred miles west of the -Mis

THE GROWING OF PALMS AND FERNS BY AMA- 

TEURS. 

By W. J. Hesser, Plattsmouth. 

The wonderful growth of this branch of floriculture in the 
last quarter of a century is almost incredible. It seems but 
a few years ago that it was generally supposed that palms and 
ferns could only be grown in conservatories or greenhouses 
l»v the wealthy, and that they could not be grown in a common 
living room. But how changed to-day, where you will gee a 
few palms and ferns in almost every house where plants are 
kept, and often you will find some very fine specimens growing 
in a living room. Of course, the prices are very different 
to-day from twenty-five years ago. Well do I remember the 
first two small palms I bought, over twenty years ago, for 
which I paid in Philadelphia, $2 each, and to-day I sell as 
good of the same variety and size for ten cents, and sell hundreds 
of them. 

Palms and ferns are not so difficult to grow as many think. </seg>

PALMS AND PERNS. 

With constant care they can be successfully grown where a 
geranium can, yet they will thrive in a window where they do 
not get direct sunlight. 

One of the great secrets of success is constant care and 
watchfulness. In watering, so many people think if they 
water tlieir plants once a day that is all that is required. 
While in the main that would be sufficient, many times twice 
a day at least would not be enough. Plants should never be 
allowed to get so dry that the foliage wilts or the tender roots 
jMiish. Often if set in or near an open window where a strong 
wiud strikes them, they might perish if watered twice a day, 
while on a cloudy or damp day they might not need water 
for two or three days. There can be no set time for watering 
plants. Water them when dry or before dust dry. They 
should be so dry as not to be mud, but not so dry as to kill 
the tender roots. 

Many think plants should not be watered while the sun is 
shining. That is all right so far as spraying the foliage, because 
if sprayed or sprinkled while the sun was shining 
bright, especially under glass, the foliage would likely be 
burnt or blistered in spots, but when the soil begins to get 
dry, water them, sun or no sun. 

Plants set near radiators in winter might dry out many 
times a day, and if the "once a day rule" was adhered to, you 
would soon have some sick plants. The tender roots would 
lie dead. Then the grower often tries to make up for lost time 
by keeping them constantly soaked with water, which is sure 
to hasten the death or prolong the sickness of the plants. 
You might just as well give a sick person a large mess of rich, 
strong food to help them become strong at once. It would 
surely be the reverse with persons and plants. The water 
is taken up by the tender roots and evaporated through the 
foliage. If the roots have perished by being too dry, they can 
not take up as much water as when they have plenty of roots. 
Then the foliage begins to brown at the tips, or the whole 
leaf dries up. My good people say that the gas, steam heat, </seg>

            <seg id="p192">

t furnace heat is the cause of the plants losing a portion or 
of the foliage, when really it is all caused by the plants 
ttiog so dry that the roots perish; then, as there is nothing 
¦apply moisture to the foliage, it must also periah, and to 
tore it to its former beauty repuires much time and earswatchfulut 
- 

Wlien the roots or foliage are injured or gone, overwate, 
ing is easily done; still the plants should have water before 
they get dust -dry. Ovciwatering is equally as injurious if 
persisted in, but is not so likely to occur except in real cloudy, 
cold, moist weather. 

Ehe foliage should be often syringed or sprayed. Where 
can not be done in a living pool, then use a sponge to 
&gt; them clean. 

It'hile they will live and grow without direct sunlight, yet 
&amp; IKilms and some ferns are benefited by having dire&lt; i 
light. None more so than the NephrokptU or Sword 
us. I give them the place in the greenhouses, 
y grow stiller and more rugged. Should all be grown 
r some window so as to get the direct light, an east win• 
is preferable. In midsummer a north window is all right, 
do not try to grow a palm or fern entirely away from 
e window or light. They will live, but can not make a 
il growth if long kept from direct light. 

Irhe soil I use for fitting is rotted sods, cut as for sodding 
1 toned upside down in a pile until well rotted or the grass 
lend. Then break it . «p — not too fine, unless for very small 
His with one-fifth sharp sand and about an equal 
ount of well-rotted manure. Cow manure preferable, 
mgh I often use old hot-bed manure. I have mixed it with 
' sod when I put it up. Later, chop up with a spade, then 
1 sand as I use it. This is possibly the best way for ama- 
BfCTj grower of plants should keep a pile of such soil 
some out-of-the-way place so as to have it ready for use at 
f time. In potting palms and ferns I mainly use drainage

I am often asked which is the best variety of palms to grow. 
This, in some respects, would he difficult to answer. Thenare 
¦even! good varieties, equally easy of culture. Some 
fancy one variety and some another. I find in mv business 
that the Lutania borbomiom (the real Chinese fan palm) is 
called for more than any other variety. It is a good grower 
and does well in a living room; also, it is very attractive as 
a decorative plant. 

Probably Artet hitcm-rn* is next most called for. It is an 
elegaat gwaa, with pinnated, arching leaves. The stem and 
sheathing petioles are perfectly smooth, yellow in color. Mottled 
with black. It does best in shaded places. It is a n.r 
of Mascareeu. It branches at the roots and throws up many 

Arcra nibm is a very pretty graceful palm from Mauritius. 
It has reddish-brown pinhated leaves. It is not as hardy as 
the Lutescens, but worthy a place in every collection. 

Efter the Lmtmmima and Arrcma, the next in demand is the 
tins. They are really a better and easier palm to grow 
t the Aneos. but cost one-third more to double the An 

K&lt;iitin belmortmmm is a very- graceful pinnated foliage 
palm. It is hardy and very decorative, even when small, 
though more expensive than most other palms, but is alw 
in demand. 

Erntiu fostrriniui is similar to K. belmoremnm, with heavier 
ige and more robust growth. It is a grand decorat 
1. Both Krntiiis are natives of the Lord Howe Islands. 

Next in demand is the PhoenLr reelinetm, which is one of 
the best Phoenixes for culture. The drooping pinnated 
leaves are of a dark green. This also makes a beautiful 
orative palm. </seg>

NEBRASKA STATE HOKTICULTUBAL SOCIETT. 

Bhoenix sylvestris, the wild date, is very similar to the last 
itioned. 

P. tcnuits is more upright and has a more slender growth. 
It is a good grower and is admired by all. 

P. canaricmis is another slender variety. With me it has 
beeD subject to rust; otherwise it is a very desirable sort. 

Bhamaerops cxcchia has fan-shaped leaves. Hather upit 
in growth and quite hardy. 

Chamaerops humilis canarU'iisis is a deep and fine cut-leaf 
variety. 

Corypha australis is similar to (Jhamacrops excelsia, except 
the leaf stems have short sharp spines. 

E'aforthia elegans is a good grower, rather frail, but on 
nnt of its rapid growth and beauty for decorations it is

Oreodixia regia, or royal palm, is similar to the above, only 
much more slender. It has long, slender, pinnated leaves. 
but never more than three to four leaves at a time. It is often 

Rhnpis flabelliformis is a very hardy and ornamental Japanese 
palm, with many slender stems and leaves flabellate, 
upon short flower-stalks and of a dark green color. The 
petioles are slender, sheathing at base, and firmly enclosed in 
a tissue of brown fibers. The leaves are very persistent, so 
that a plant with a stem of six feet may frequently be seen 
with perfect leaves down to the very bottom. 

Ekapis humilis is very similar. The stems are more slender 
foliage lighter. I had a large plant of this specimen at 
exposition which was admired by many thousands of 
&gt;le. 

I yeas revoluta, or Sago palm, is always in demand and Ij 
lired by every one. The leaves are pinnated, from two to 
feet long and from four to ten inches wide, which are of 
lining dark green color on the upper side and lighter on 
under side.

usually only a few inches in height, leaves pinnated, one 
vo feet long, and three to six inches wide, of a dark green

extensively grown. 

Jirahea fiillifcra and Wushingtonia robusta, the California 
palms, have been well advertised by growers of novelties. As 
¦i novelty it is desirable, but for general use as a pot palm in 
a house it is not as desirable as the Latania or many others. 

FERNS AND SELAGINELLAS 

The following are a few of the best ferns and selaginellas 
tor house culture in pots, baskets, or pans: 

For pot or basket culture, Nephrolepsis exeitata bostonen*w 
is more called for than any other fern. It is easy of 
culture. They throw out may runners, and one plant will 
soon fill a six- or eight-inch pot with a mass of foliage. If well 
cared for it is constantly throwing up its beautiful [&lt; 
graceful, drooping fronds. It will thrive in the sunniest window 
if kept carefullly watered, and make a plant to be admired 
by all who see it. A well grown plant is always in demand. 
The old Xephrolrpsis excltata is a good strong, upright, 
stiff variety, and is in good demand. Another that is 
very popular is Xephrolrpsis cordata compacts, a slender, 
upright Lrond, and I find it in greater demand than the 

V. rufescens tripinnatifida is really the finest Nephro 
grown. The fronds are from twenty to thirty-six inches Ion?: 
and three to six inches wide. In appearance they much resemble 
a large ostrich feather, but unfortunately this one is 
rather tender for winter culture, but seems to want rest, but 
in summer is a real beauty all the time and is worthy a place </seg>

E'cris trcmula is possibly the best of its class. It is a naof 
New Zealand, grows two feet in height. The leaves are

§eris argyrea (sometimes called silver fern). FrondH 
tifully variegated with white, is a very pretty variety, 
reasonably easy of culture. 

1'tnis crctica allo lineata is a beautiful dwarf fern and 
very suitable for jardinieres and fern dishes. 

Pteria ttcrrulata and Scrrulata cristata are good hardy 
ferns for baskets and jardinieres.

A. farlcycnse is the finest maidenhair fern grown. Rather 
delicate for house culture, yet with care it can be grown fairly

most attractive and admired plant of the fern species. Every 
one says : "Is not that pretty?" It is very easy of culture if 
never allowed to get dry, but if once it gets dry, the leaves curl 
up and brown and die, yet in time it will make a new set of 
leaves and soon be as pretty as ever; but it pays to watch it 
and keep it constantly moist, not standing in water, but never 
let it get real dry, and you will have a plant to be proud of. 

Selayinella martcnse, an upright species, with heavy

VINES AND CREEPERS. 

By L. C. Chapin. 

In setting out vines (as well as everything else) soil am 
planting are of the utmost importance. I will mention tha 
first, and in this case it is of more than usual importance, a 
many vines and creepers are to be planted near the house an 
porch, near which the soil is poor, containing, as it usuall 
does, brickbats, mortar, pieces of tin, blocks, and the poore 
soil thrown out in digging the cellar. Remove all such rub 
bish and put in plenty of good, rich soil, and plant carefully 
By so doing you have accomplished half you have set out t 
do, and have laid the foundation for much future enjoymen 

After planting, some attention will be needed as to water, </seg>

            <seg id="p199">
197 

VINES AND CREEPBB8. 

etc., as, planted as vines often are, on the sunny aide of a 
house or building, they must receive attention until the roots 
have taken hold and have gone down to moist soil. 

The uses vines and creepers can be put to are many — to furnish 
shade for porches, windows, to shut out the view of unsightly 
places, to cover bare walls, and by thoughtful planting 
they may be used with good effect, as by their graceful 
growth they may be made to produce that much desired effect 
of nature's own planting, which adds so much to the fairylike 
appeamnee of the native woods. 

By growing either on live or dead trees, over stone piles, 
over a rustic summer house, a latticed fence, or a stone wall, 
and by their luxuriant growth, brilliant foliage, many-colored 
bloom, and their delicate fragrance, they tend to make one 
think he is in fairyland for the time being. 

Here, again, we find in our list that of which poets have 
written for ages and have often striven in vain for language 
expressive enough — the rose. They grow rapidly, reach a 
good height, their foliage is heavy enough for shade, and, together 
with the wealth of their bloom, they make an ideal 
climber for porch pillars, trellises, etc. Take for example a 
Crimson Rambler with its bright, glossy foliage and profusion 
of scarlet bloom coming in large clusters and on long 
sprays. No one coming upon such a climber as this can help 
but admire its beauty. There are also Russels Cottage, carmine; 
Seven Sisters, light rose; Baltimore Belle, blush; Prairie 
Queen, deep rose; Sweet Briar, pink; Washington, white; 
Yellow Persian, yellow, and many others. All of the above 

The Clematis. — Of these there are many kinds. I will 
speak of but two: C. Jacknianni, dark blue, and C. Henrvii, 
white. These make very good climbers where a light foliage 
is wanted. They are quite rapid growers and profuse bloomers, 
at times a mass of bloom, the foliage being entirely 
hidden. 

Honey-suckles. — There are many species of these fragrant </seg>

climbers, some with dark leaves, some light, and some variegated 
with yellow. A very pleasing effect may be obtained by 
an occasional planting of one of the golden varieties among 
the green. 

Iiumpet Vine. — This might be classed with the wistarias, 
a very pleasing appearance may be made by so planting, 
ley bloom at different times, and the contrast in the foliis 
good. Both are rank growers and delight to reach the 
s, and from there send out long twiners carrying luxurifestoons 
of loose, airy foliage, and the Trumpet vine ha« 
11 clusters of long orange, while the wistaria has lilac-like 
m. Both of these creepers carry heavy foliage and make 
&gt;se, rank growth and hold their foliage well into the fall, 
g among the last to lose their leaves. 

Ampelopsis Veitchii or Boston Ivy. — This is becoming a 
very popular vine as it requires no trellis or support, clinging 
to stone, wood, or brick, and makes quite rapid growth, producing 
leaves of an olive green, changing to a scarlet in the 
fall. This vine, as it grows on a wall, has a very smooth appearance, 
as though trimmed, and will cover the side of a 
house in a short time. Amp. quinquefolia or Virginia Creeper 
is similar to the above, but has larger leaves, ranker growth, 
and requires a support. 

The Wild Grape also makes a very pretty climber, and may 
be used where a coarse foliage is wanted to grow over trees 
or along the background. The Bittersweet also has a very 
pretty appearance with its bright red fruit. By planting 
these last two together a fine effect may be had, the grape with 
its purple fruit and the bitter sweet with its red making a 
fine contrast. 

fl of tiie above are hardy. There are many more, but as 
ih to add a few tender quick-growing sorts,- 1 will close 
the hardy. 

Cobea Scandexs. — This is a very pretty rapid grower, has 
good foliage, and produces white and purple flowers, very </seg>

pretty for planting around tree-trunks, and will cling to any 
rough surface. 

Pomea Noctifera, or moonflower, has very large leaves, 
grower, will cover the side of a house in a season, pros 
large white or blue flowers, five or six inches across, 
blooms at night. 

Maderia Vine grows from tubers which are easily kept 
packed in a cellar. These tubers planted out in May will produce 
a vine which grows very rapidly, has very pretty bright 
glossy green leaves and long sprays of fine white flowers, very 
fragrant, and on a still evening the air is laden with its per- 

IJinnamon Vine, also from tubers, has foliage lighter than 
above, but of same shape, and is not as strong a grower, 
flowers have the odor of cinnamon. 

Cypress Vine. — This beautiful little vine has a fern-like 
foliage, and a red star-shaped bloom, very pretty where a delicate 
light growing climber is wanted. 

Ii addition to the above the following may be used and are 
r good for covering at back of garden or border. Gourds, 
kinds, hop vine, wild cucumber, morning glory, dutchl's 
pipe, and there are many others both hardy and tender

to this list those they have found good.

and dump it on a pile until it rots, as most florists do, is entirely 
wrong. Green sod causes a lot of unnecessary expense 
in draying and working over several times, and also a constant 
bed of fungus detrimental to all soils and plants. The 
only remedy for this fungus-diseased sod, in case it is detected 
before planting time, is a liberal application of air-slacked 
lime thoroughly mixed with the soil. When the soil is put in 
benches and fungus appears in it, do not cultivate too much ; 
it helps to create more fungus and harms the growth of the 
roses. Use air-slacked lime evenly spread over bench soil; 
it will kill fungus and sweeten the soil ; also be careful in 
watering and ventilating until you are rid of the disease. On 
the other hand, by using sun- and rain-cured sod, you can 
save all the aforesaid trouble and expense. 

I will venture to advise you to have your sod cut as early 
as possible in the spring and allow it to lie in the field for tw.&gt; 
weeks or longer. When thoroughly dry, have it hauled into 
a pile, give it a thorough soaking, allow another week to pass 
that it may heat well, then work it over. In doing this add 
to every yard of sod soil a wheelbarrow full of yellow clay ; 
then leave it alone until you are ready to use it. Mix your soil 
while hauling it in. Do not mix any manure with it unless 
you are a good judge of manures ; you will have trouble, because 
all manures are more or less affected by worms or insects 
of some kind which will attack newly made roots. The'.'e 
is no remedy for this except a change of soil. The most dangerous 
worms are the eel worm and a white worm with a black 
head, which are very numerous in manure. Black flies, also, 
lay their eggs in manure, and hatch out while the manure i* 
in use in doors. Here is the most practical way to succeed 
with soil for roses : put a layer of sod on the bottom of your 
bench, upside down, rough, then take some pure cow dung, 
well rotted and perfectly free from any insects, and smooth </seg>

it over the rough laid sod to the depth of £ inch ; put in your 
prepared soil and you are ready for planting. Thi8 method 
saves a lot of extra mulching. 

When your roses are well established, get their roots into 
tfca manure and the bottom layer of sod, then mulch occasionally 
with sheep manure. Using liquid manure is not a good 
method, as you can not feed your plants evenly without a 
proper ¦yatem. By hand is too much labor. 

Eo avoid insects originating in the manures and infest ing 
soils, you ought to put the manure in a gunny sack and 
iin it or soak it in boiling water for about five hours before 
ing the proper amount of water to it ready for use. Care 
it be taken in applying these liquids in dull weather. 

You can use natural cured sods for carnations. In this 
the sod ought not to be cut till June and not as thick. 
Working this sod over twice before planting time is enough 
to insure good results. Carnations require sandier and lighter 
soil. Cut your sod li inches thick. Don't mix any manure 
into it for carnations. Kemember that the thinner your sod 
is cut the more of the natural fat contained in the soil you 
will get. Thin cut sod can be used for any purpose, for pot 
plants, by adding sand and manure to it, which will give it 
all the necessary porousness, so much needed for potted 
plants. For general pot plant use, take three bushels of well 
rotted sod, one bushel of cow manure well sifted, one bushel 
of sand, and you are ready for use. For calla lilies, cannas, 
and pot roses, add some yellow clay, about half a bushel, to 
the above mixture. You are safe in every case, and your crep 
of flowers is secure if you do not fail to cultivate Nebraska 
sod, which is the richest gift of the Creator to the state of 
Nebraska.

PLANTS FOR WINTER BLOOMING. 

By Lewis Henderson, Omaha. 

Mr. President and Fellow Members of tlie Nebraska State 

Horticulture Society: 

In considering plants for winter blooming, select those that 
thrive inside and are the hardiest during cold weather, and 
also those spring plants that can be forced inside, during the 
winter. Also remember that most plants have a certain time 
to bloom in, and another time to rest in. If starting plants

months from the time of germination to the time of flowering, 
and that this period varies with different kinds of plants; 
therefore commence to plan eight or ten months before the 
winter comes. 

fhose plants which I have found the most successful bloomfor 
winter, I will mention as they suggest themselves to 

iirst, Chrysanthemums, which are the first bloomers ia 
fall. Start the young plants in the spring, or during the 
ter, from the young roots or cuttings of the old plants, 
nge the pots, or plant them in the open ground during 
summer, but lift them early or in the latter part of 
£USt. 

Poixsettias. — These beautiful red flowering plants which 
bloom in December. Propagate the young plants from the 
sprouts of the old plants in April or May. Keep them growing 
in pots during the summer. In the fall take them into 
a house of moist temperature of 70°, and you will have a very 
ornamental, showy flower by the first of December, until 
Christmas. 

Izaleas. — These beautiful plants are deservedly becoming 
e popular every season for window and conservatory decions, 
with their diversity in color, and freedom of flowerwhich 
will always keep them in public favor. These 
ts are mostly imported from Itolland in the latter part 
ctober, as they can not be grown successfully in the Neka 
soil and climate. They can very easily be imported 
forced to bloom from the beginning of December and all 
ugh the winter. Those for early flowering should be kept 
light, moist temperature, from 65° to 70°, until flowerwhen 
they can be kept in a colder temperature. 

fie varieties of azaleas that I have found to be the best and 
; in demand are, first of all, the Deutsche Perle, double 
white, which will bloom in the early part of December, 
next, Mme. Van der Cruyasen, a semi-double bright rosy 
very free and early bloomer, and beautiful. Vervaereana, </seg>

E double beautiful rose, edged with white, early. Apollo, 
semi-double, blood-red, later. Niobe, fine double white, 
id petals, medium early. Simon Mardner, very double, 
le rose, early. Empress of India, fine double, deep rose, 
white, late. 

IHODODENRONS are a very fine flowering shrub. Like the 
leas they are a spring flower, but some of the varieties can 
r easily be forced to bloom in December. They are mostly 
orted and must be forced on the same principle as the 
eas. The varieties best for forcing are: Jacksonian, a 
white, which will bloom for Christmas; Vesuvius, a clea? 
also very popular, as are Madame Masson, white; Mich- 
Watterres, scarlet, and Charles Begley, cherry red. 

E.IMULA. — This charming and beautiful plant is indisable 
for winter or spring decoration. It is one of our 
important winter blooming plants. Sow soods in April 
ay; pot in two inch pots, and shift them as they grow. 

Cyclamen. — Also a charming plant with double foliage of 
rich color, some fragrant flowers, and universally valued for 
winter and spring blooming. The seeds may be sown at any 
time during the winter or spring, in shallow boxes two inches 
deep, at a temperature of 60°. As soon as the seedlings have 
made two leaves, transplant in two-inch pots. Place on a 
shelf near the light, but shaded from direct sunlight. Shift 
into three-inch size, and into larger sizes as soon as the operation 
becomes necessary. 

Cineraria. — Also a beautifully colored plant for winter 
and early spring blooming. The seeds should be sown from 
May to September to be successful. If no winter showing is 
made, July is to be preferred. Cineraria grow so freely that 
the seedling may go straight from the seed pans to thumb 
pots. Afterwards, place in a cold frame, facing north if possible. 
When the plants have become well rooted, shift to 
larger pots until the flowering stage is reached. 

Clerodendron Belfouri. — A beautiful climber admirably 
suited to conservatories or house culture, flowering most pro-

fusely, with bright scarlet flowers, enveloped in a creamy 
white calyx. 

iiEGOxiAs, Geraniums, Fuchsias, Petunias, Helioti:' 
erfew, and Daisy. — I know of no plants better adapted 
niateur cultivation (also including the florist) than these 
wt plants for summer or winter cultivation. They hare 
»d the test for years and years, and still to-day they have 
equal. Start plants from cuttings in the spring about 
&lt;?; keep shifting them from smaller to larger pots as they 

Bulbs or bulbous plants make fine winter bloomers. 

Calla Lily White (Rkhardia Aetheopica), the well-known 
White Lily of the Nile. Like all other bulbs, lily of the valley, 
hyacinth, narcissus, tulips, daffodills, start in the fall, 
iii September or October. Keep them in a cold place for a 
month or two, until rooted. Take them into the house in a 
moderate temperature, or if you want them sooner keep them 
in a higher temperature. 

(arnation is one of the most popular flowers grown for 
cut flower trade. It also makes a good pot plant. Plant the 
11 plants out in the field during summer; lift them early 
he fall, plant them on benches for cut flowers, or in pots, 
p them at a temperature of from 50° to 60°, and you will 
b flowers the winter through. 

The Rose is the queen of flowers. What flower has stood 
the test of time as has the rose? It has traveled through ages 
without changing its destiny or losing its character. How 
often it has been remarked that people "never get tired of 
roses." If we look backward and take a retrospective view 
we find that the rose was mentioned in the earliest writi 
when at all feasts and all great gatherings the rose is spoken 
of as the flower that graced all these functions. The rose has 
been the favorite flower for over 3,000 years. It is the flower 
that the people never tire of, always having new charms, appealing 
to one's love of the beautiful. The homage rendered 
and the love borne it has always been the same, and it has </seg>

            <seg id="p208">

NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

been given the first place in the floral kingdom. There is no 
other flower combining so many charms, and to-day the rose 
holds the same supreme position it did in the early time. It is 
the flower most sought after, appealing to the hearts of th^ 
people of this generation more than any other, and brings the 
highest price in the floral market. 

There are other flowers that have their seasons, but they 
are of short duration. They have their points of beauty 
and their admirers, but what flower combines so many — in 
tact all the good points of other flowers — color, form, fragrance? 
None but the rose, and though people will enthuse 
over the others, in their seasons, they will come back to their 
first love, the rose! It has been so from the earliest ages and 
will be to the close of time. 

{ulture: start the plant from cuttings ten or twelve 
iths before the time you want them to bloom. To groW 
rose successfully during the winter you must keep them at 
rtain temperature 60° to G5°, or 65° to 70°. It also reres 
full sunlight and a moist atmosphere; therefore roses 
grown to better advantage in greenhouses built purposely 
roses. 

ihere is no rose that will compare with the American 
uty, with its magnificent foliage, grand stem, flower, and 
lisite fragrance. We all know it; can any person pass •! 
! or plant of this rose without stopping to enjoy its beauty 
odor? 

E Bride is the rose par excellence of its color, as its name 
ta — purity, whiteness. It is the white rose of commerce 
without peer. 

Bridesmaid is the pink rose which has superseded all others 
in popularity. We have had others, but they have quickly 
given the place of honor to the Maid of that deep, rich shade 
of pink so much sought after. 

Beteor, up to the present, has held the place of honor of its 
r. Its rich, velvety, crimson red always appeals to the </seg>

customer, but it ia lacking in that very essential quality in a 
rose — fragrance. 

Perle des Jardine is the pure golden yellow rose of the day. 
This we find declining in popularity through some of the caprices 
of fashion. It is a grand rose of its color, and I think 
will be more largely grown than previously. 

Elden Gate is a fine rose of a peculiar combination of soft 
and creamy white. It has long, pointed buds, which are 
isitely sweet. It is a strong grower. 

Eiere is a new rose — Liberty. A grand crimson rose that 
been ushered into the floral world this season, that may 
the place of the Meteor rose, with its glowing Jacque)t 
crimson, and sweet perfume. 

Eere are other roses, Sunset, a saffron yellow; Madam 
, a good, light colored yellow; Mrs. Pierpont Morgan, 
Clara Watson, but not as popular as the others mend. 


I'here are many other flowers sweet and fragrant, for winblooming, 
such as violets, mignonette, spierens. lilacs, hi¦us, 
allamandas, and jasminum, that by some care and 
per attention, will prove good bloomers. Don't try tn

CARE OF THE HOUSE PLANTS— HOW TO GROW 

PLANTS IN OUR HOUSES. 

By L. Hexdeksox, Florist, of Omaha. 

Home is not merely four square walls, 
Though with luxuries hung and gilded. 

Home is where affection calls, 

Filled with fumes of blossoms sweet 
Home is not merely roof and room, 

It needs something to endear it </seg>

            <seg id="p210">

Home is where the heart can bloom, 

Where there're some kind lips to cheer it. 

What is home without a flower? 
What is life without its care? 
Home is sweet and only sweet 
Where there's some bright spot to cheer it. 

Ilants have a life. They live and grow. They require caro 
attention as well as we do. First, they require light. 
h air, proper temperature, proper soil, water and m 
Unobstructed daylight exposure should be given when 
lible. To better obtain this, keep your plants as near th 
Jows as possible. Roll up the shades. Throw back the 
ains. Your carpet may fade, but the plants will take on 
lgh extra brightness to make up for all the loss. In ;i 
rly lighted exposure palms, ferns, rubber plants, philadenaspedistias, 
some begonias, -and some foliage plants suc[ 
fairly well; a flowering plant will not. 

Fresh air; this is a necessity with plants as well as human 
beings. It is well to remember that plants and people arc 
made to live together. For the most part, what is good or 
bad for the plants is equally good or bad for us. If they need 
pure air and abundance of light, so do we. If they suffer 
from escaping gases and the dry, parched atmosphere of our 
living rooms, it is equally bad for us. If they are chokel 
with dust and kept unclean, they can not thrive. Neither eu 
we under such circumstances. In short, as a general ruli', 
we thrive best in just such conditions as regards our livini; 
rooms as our plants. More healthy plants would be seen in 
sitting room windows if they were given air daily. Many 
seem to get the idea that they do not require much air and do 
not recognize the necessity of their obtaining fresh supplies. 
It is well to open a door some distance from the plants, for 
some minutes daily and let fresh cold air mix with the warm 
before coming in contact with the. plants.

temperature, keep the atmosphere moist, and have plenty </seg>

of sunlight, success is assured. House plants are as easil 
grown as onions, if once the knack of taking care of them i

their habits, for there is no situation in life to which growin 
plants will not add cheer. If possible, get good, strong 
healthy plants to start with. Do not overcrowd the plants 
Better to keep a few well than a large number of poorly 
cared for. Whenever possible, house plants should be kep

best in what may be termed a high temperature of 05 degrees

best in a temperature of 5 degrees to 10 degrees lower include

treat care should be exercised in watering, as proper 
?ring and moisture are almost everything in the care of 
its. Over-watering is easily done to their injury, and if 
uly dry they perish. Give those which are not in an 
ce growing condition little water; but as soon as there 
signs of growth increase the supply. Keep in mind the

fact that more plants are injured by over- watering than from 
being kept too dry. Kaiu water is generally better than 
spring or well water. Morning is undoubtedly the best time 
to water plants. The amount of water must be regulated according 
to the demands of the plant. The appearance of the 
plants and the conditions of the surface are the guides. If 
I lie soil shows hard and brittle on the surface, water is 
led ; if soft and moist to the touch, do not water; or if dry, 
sharp topping on outside of pot gives a light or ringing sound. 
If not dry it sounds dull. 

As a rule, water enough should be given to reach through 
the center of the ground ; usually filling to the brim of the pot 
answers for quantity. Nearly all flowering plants, when in 
bloom, require much more water than foliage plants. They 
require more in warm temperature thau in cold; more when 
in a state of active growth than when at rest. Never water 
the flowers of a plant, nor allow water to stand in the saucer 
of the flower pots, unless the plants are semi-aquatic. Plants 
in an ordinary living room usually require water once a day, 
and some that especially delight in moisture need it twice. 
Plants thoroughly rooted in their pots dry out more quickly 
than newly potted ones. As a rule, all house plants should 
be examined once a day, with intent to water, if it is necessary. 
Experience alone can determine the proper amount to 
give each plant. 

Apply no stimulant of any kind to a plant not in a condition 
of growth. Some persons, when they see that a plant is 
not growing, dose it with stimulants and fertilizers and in 
most cases kill it. All plants are sure to be injured by an application 
of this kind unless in a condition to make use of it. 

Era them frequently to keep them symmetrical. If this 
glected, the young and growing branches will be drawn 
rds the light, and, in time, the plants will become one. 
A little care at the proper time will prevent this. 

Kerfect cleanliness is all important. If plants are covered

liable to the attacks of insect enemies and fungus diseases. 
The leaves of the plants are their lungs, and should, therefore, 
be kept clean. If the pores of the leaves are filled with 
dust, the plant can not perform its functions and its vitality 
is affected. Go over them — a. a week with a dampened, soft 
sponge or cloth, taking care that both sides are made clean. 
Solution of whale oil or castile soap, also tobacco extracts, 
as directed on packages, may be used as a wash when removing 
scale or other insects. 

E worms get in the roots of the plants, water the plants 
i lime water — common lime mixed with water. Lime is 
injurious to the plant, if not given too much. It is often 
I as fertilizer for some plants. It is a sure death to 
ms. 

Geraniums for winter blooming can easily be had by cuttings 
being put in a bed, or any place convenient, outdoors, 
in the latter part of July; and about the first of September 
pot them in four-inch pots and let them go with ordinary 
care, and when the cold weather sets in, the plants are full of 
buds and ready to bloom. 

A novelty in early spring flowers can be had by a few 
branches of lilacs being cut from the bushes about the first of 
February. They will make a beautiful bouquet of flowers 
two or three weeks later. Cut good sized branches from the 
top of the bush, so as to be sure to get the one that will bloom. 
Put them in vases, with plenty of water, in a warm, sunny 
window. A little charcoal or ammonia in the water will 
keep it sweet, as well as be a fertilizer for the plant. In a 
few days the leaf buds will open, when the buds will show, 
and in a short time the beautiful flowers will appear. They 
will not be full size blossoms nor the clusters as large, but 
they are lilacs just the same. Apple, pear, peach, plum, and 
cherry blossoms can be had the same way. 

A pretty little decoration for the center of the everyday 
home table can be made by placing a few inches of white 
¦and in a deep glass rose bowl of medium size, filling it up </seg>

with water, and inserting branches of some vine that will 
grow in water. Green and white tradescantia looks very 
pretty with its tips trailing over the tablecloth. The center 
of the bowl can be filled with light sprays of bright flow 
that happen to be in season, chrysanthemums, roses, carnations, 
lilies of the valley, etc.; or with cyperus alternifolius, 
which makes a fine plant growing in water, or water hyacinth, 
with their lovely pinkish purple spikes of blossoms 
when in bloom. 

The home, or the bay window, filled with plants and flowwith 
their bright, cheerful, and fragrant leaves, is the link 
which connects the most humble room with the palaces of 
nobles and kings, and the luxurious presentation of nature, 
aided by a reasonable imagination, will furnish the mind with 
well-founded ideas how nature must look where man at noon 
s no shadow. Tropical and subtropical are both the same 
to the window, and we can thus travel by slow and easy stages 
from the oleanders of Palestine and the caladims of Egypt to 
the palms of Trinidad, and the begonias and orchids of the 
Amazon and Borneo. As we gaze at our chrysanthemums and 
lilies, we see the slant-eyed beauties of Japan, the island Yankeedom'of 
the mystic East. 

I. person can see in the culture of flowers a means and stini 
i to useful and delightful knowledge — an educator, which 
been contributed by all the regions of the globe. The

plant or shrub.

With shining leaves and starry buds,

HORTICULTURE IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

HORTICULTURE IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS 

By Silas Wilson, Atlantic, Ia. 

I wish to say, in the first place, that our free school s; 
in America is the corner stone of our greatness as a people. 
We are all lovers and admirers of our free school system. A 
few years ago I had occasion to be in Washington. I had a 
friend there who was superintendent of docks in the Xavv 
Department, and was fortunate enough to have the pleasure 
of going through the department there at Washington with 
him. It is needless to say it was a great revelation to me. I 
had read some of the European criticisms of our navy and our 
battle ships and our cruisers. You know they told us that the 
first time our ships were put in action they would turn over 
or blow up. Well, thia major took me through the department 
there, and, having been a soldier in the Civil War, I was very 
much interested and fired a good many questions at him. He 
showed me the modern guns and all the appliances for fighting, 
and one thing led to another until he made this remark : 
"If we should get into a foreign war" (this was two months 
before the blowing up of the battleship Maine) "we would 
surprise the world. All of our practicing and wasting millions 
of dollars' worth of ammunition is not for nothing. If 
a foreign fleet should approach our ships it is likely they 
would be destroyed before they could injure us. I believe we 
have the most effective navy in the world as far as it goes." 

I ell, this was a revelation to me, and a few months later 
n we did get into a little brush with Spain and were 
ibling in our boots, wondering what the result would be 
a our fleet should meet that boasted "Spanish Flotilla." 
ide up my mind that we were not in as much danger as we 
ght we were; it was simply a lack of information as to 
character and strength of our country. What was the 
It? When those fleets finally did come together we asjhed 
the world. Everything that this major had told me 
demonstrated to the very letter. Every foreign ship that </seg>

came within range of our guns went down, while our ships 
were not materially injured. I say this to illustrate what I 
wisli to mj later on, and it shows how little we know of our 
real strength as a sea-going nation. 

It is a good deal so in the line of education. We have a 
great free school system that is making us greater than any 
other nation on earth, and yet it may be said that the subject 
of horticulture is almost entirely neglected. Mr. Stephens 
in his paper yesterday spoke of the progress that is being 
made in other countries in teaching horticulture in the public 
schools. I have read something of that myself, and have 
lxcn very much interested in it. I quite frequently go out to 
the public schools and talk to the pupils on horticultural 
lines, also on Washington's birthday and other special occasions, 
and I never have found a subject yet upon which I 
could interest the boys and girls as much as the subject of 
horticulture. And for days afterwards I will hear of them 
going home and telling their parents that Mr. Wilson was up 
there and told them all about budding and grafting and this 
and that. This goes to show that these young folks are interested 
in horticulture, and it is a subject that we all ought to 
agitate more and more right along. It will be a great benefit 
to the boys and girls that are being educated all over the 
country to have a "practical knowledge of the trees and flowers. 
There is nothing to me so enjoyable at our home as the 
rose. I was very much pleased with Mr. Henderson's paper 
yesterday in which he mentioned some beautiful roses, but 
not of the kind I am going to speak of. I have the hybrid perpetuals, 
which are perfectly hardy in the open ground, and 
from the 15th of last June to the first of November there was 
never a time but that I could go out into my nursery and rose 
garden and cut an armload of those roses. On the first day 
of November I cut an armload of them. We have six, seven, 
or eight varieties of hybrid perpetual ises, and we enjoy 
them as much as anything we have on the place. It seems to 
me it would be interesting to these young people, as well as </seg>

profitable to them in later years, to have a practical knowledge 
of how to treat and care for these beautiful plants, as 
well as the luscious fruits. 

Inother point : I have two boys. They are bright, beautiful, 
lligent boys (they take after their mother), and my wife 
taught those boys some things in the house which were at 
to them very objectionable and distasteful. One was how 
[&gt;ok. They resisted, of course, but she said, "You must 
q this, because you will find it useful to you some time." 
result is that if Mrs. Wilson happens to be sick, either 
sf my boys can come in and get a good meal. If she wants 
od cake she calls Willie. We read in the Sacred Book, 
ng up your child in the way he should go, and when he 
d he will not depart from it." Why not apply this princin 
training our children as horticulturists? 

DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Barnard — I would just like to add a word to what Mr. 
Wilson has said, and I am sorry the President is not here just 
now. At the farmers' institute at Arlington a year or two 
ago I made a talk on the subject of propagation. I had gone 
out to Mr. Marshall's nursery and got some whole-roots, 
grafts, etc., by which to illustrate the subject, and when I 
got through a man in the audience called to Mr. Marshall and 
said : "Say, do you make any of those things out to your 
place?" There weren't half a dozen people in the audience 
that had ever seen a whole-root graft or a bud or anything of 
that kind. If the older people don't know anything about 
these things, of course the children are not going to know anything 
about them unless they get it in the public schools. 

De. Bessey — I can't allow this topic to go by without saying 
that my old-time friend, the Hawkeye, with whom I 
worked years ago, before I became a Treeplanter, has very 
excellently expressed what has been in my mind for many 
years. And let me say to you for your encouragement that 
thirty years ago or more I began to talk for the introduction </seg>

NEBKASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

Iiature study into the public schools. Sixteen rears ago I 
an to talk it here in Nebreska. We are now having, all 
r this western country, more or less — sometimes it is less, 
very frequently it is more — of just that sort of thing in 
public schools. It takes a long time ; you must talk a long, 
; time before you get people to move, but now the schoolter 
and the schoolma'am know that nature studv is someig 
that should be in the schools. They are not all able to 
it there, but they realize that it is one of the things laid 
ii them. AVhen you come to that point, then the battle is 
, for they take it in their hands and push it along. 

In this matter of horticulture and agriculture in the public 
schools, the work has been begun. This is not the first address 
given in this state or in this city on this topic. You must keep 
this up year after year, and after awhile, just as with nature 
study, the schoolmaster and the schoolma'am will learn that 
it should be taken hold of and pushed forward. 

As to the question whether it is desirable, I have not the 
litest question but that it is desirable. When we come to 
go over the river out of this world into the next world, very 
likely someone will ask us some questions about this planet. 
Someone who came from Mars, perhaps, will want to know 
what kind of plants we had here, and what kind of animals, 
and what we did with those plants and animals. A good 
many people would have to say, "Well, the fact is, I didn t 
pay any attention to that sort of thing." Now that ought not 
to be. We must live in this world as if we felt that this was 
a world worth living in. The Lord made a pretty good world. 
We have passed out of the old-time theology which looked 
upon all material things as being earthly, and worldly, and 
we have come to look upon this world, as it says in the first 
chapter of Genesis: "And the Lord saw that it was good." 
Let us look at it in just this way, and have our children look 
at it in this way. Between nature study and horticulture 
there is no line at all. You can not broaden out nature study 
without getting into horticulture. So I second most heartily 
the excellent sentiments expressed by Mr. Wilson. </seg>

HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE SOCIETY. 

A HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE NEBRASKA STATE 

HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

Ejpteniber 29, 1869, was the day that a few friends of 
iculture met in the office of the State Board of 
ure on the State Fair Grounds, near Nebraska City, aud, 
ng faith in the horticultural possibilities of Nebraska, 
mized the Nebraska State Horticultural Society. 

Elie first thing that was needed was some funds, so memhips 
were received and the amount of each membership 
ed at a dollar each, per year. 

The following gentlemen became the founders and charter 
members : 

I. H. Masters, of Otoe county. 
'. P. Mason, of Otoe county. 
. W. Furnas, of Nemaha county. 
. A. Walker, of Douglas county, 
•avid Butler, of Lancaster county.

After the members had paid their fees an election of officers 
was held, at which J. H. Masters was elected president, R. W. 
Furnas was elected secretary, and Judge O. P. Mason 
beamier. 

The next meeting was held at Brownville, January 5, 1870, 
at which most of the original members were present and quite 
a few new members. A constitution and by-laws were 
adopted, and the annual winter fruit show was held, and 
among the varieties exhibited I find most of the varieties that 
have stood the test of years, such as Ben Davis, Wine Sap. 
&lt;;&amp;amp;lt;-ii&lt;'t, Koine Beauty, Milani, Dominie, and many other vari- 
S not only a single plate but several exhibitors showing 

WHO THE EXHIBITORS WERE. 

Among the exhibitors were many well-known fruit men 
of our state who have grown old and given of their time and 
more of their money that we might now enjoy the fruit of 
their labors. J. H. Masters at this meeting showed some sixteen 
varieties of apples and two varieties of winter pears. 

It. Shepherd, of Otoe county, had some fine Jonathan ; 
is Beaver and Mr. Fridley, of Richardson county, had exts; 
Mr. Lowe, of Otoe county, Messrs. Smith and Alder, 
of Neinaha county, had some fine apples; also our old 
nd, Benton Aldrich, of Nemaha county, was present with 
•xhibit. There were also R. W. Furnas and others with 
us, grapes, gooseberries, and currants in liquor, each one 
mlating the other to better efforts in the converting of the 
it American desert (so-called) to be the place of so many 
py and comfortable homes, with the smallest per cent of 
eracy of any state in the Union, as we find it to-day after 
quite one-third of a century has passed.

HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE SOCIETY. 

"Ben Davis, known also as the New York Pippin, have cultivated 
it ten years, have had it bearing the past four or five 
years. Tree hardy, a regular and even bearer, fruit second 
rate as to essentials but keeps well, and a very desirable variety. 
So the Ben Davis at this early time had to be critic 
as poor, and all through the years since then it has struggled 
through adverse criticism, yet stands at the head for profit. 

As to cherries, all present were of the opinion that the 
Early Richmond was about all the profitable variety we could 
grow in this section of country. Thus these pioneers talked 
of varieties, wind-breaks, soils, pruning, cultivating, and held 
a good meeting, where it took lots of pluck and energy to get 
to the place of meeting, and they all entered into the meeting 
with a zeal worthy the cause they espoused. 

the next meeting of the Society was held in Omaha, June 
1870, at which time an exhibit of fruit, flowers, and v 
es was held, and we find at this meeting a resolution was 
pted thanking one of our ex-secretaries, James T. Allen, 
his untiring efforts to make this meeting a success. 

iit this meeting a committee was appointed to prepare a 
jmmended list of fruits large and small, to report at a 
ire meeting. This committee consisted of J. H. Masters, 
W. Furnas, Perry Walker, Dr. Geo. B. Graff, and E. 
iver. 

Also the following gentlemen were appointed a committee 
to draft a bill to be introduced at the next session of the 
legislature to incorporate the State Horticultural Society: 
Messrs. R. W. Furnas, J. Ryan, and A. Deyo. 

The next meeting was held at Brownville, September 21, 
1871, when the first competitive exhibition was held, when 
there were forty-five entries of fruits and twenty-seven of 
flowers. At tliis meeting was announced the fact that at a 
fruit show at Richmond, Va., the only entry that filled tin 
quirements came from Nebraska, and the certified copy of the 
awarding committee, which gave to K. W. Furnas, of </seg>

complimentary were the notices from the eastern press which 
this award brought out, and we can not calculate the good 
of the advertisement that Nebraska got from this, her maiden 
effort at fruit showing.

1872, a full competitive exhibit was held, and at this meeting 
a resolution was passed recommending the Nebraska Farmer. 
then published by A. Deyo, of Lincoln, as the paper of the 
horticulturists and agriculturists of Nebraska, and worthy 
the patronage of all our members. 

The reports of the Society were printed with the agricultural 
report up to the year 1884, when the separate reports 
were made and bound in cloth. Till this time the report was 
limited to one hundred and fifty pages. The legislature of 
1885 provided for the printing of separate reports, and incKiisinjr 
the number of pages to 300 and the publishing of 
5,000 volumes. 

About the year 1885 the appropriation was increased to 
'00 per annum, for the use and support of the Society. A 
few years later the amount, through some mistake, was made 
f2,000 for the biennium instead of $2,000 per annum, or 
$4,000 for the two years. During the legislature of 1899 the 
imittee on Legislation succeeded in getting the appropriation 
increased to $5,000 for the biennium, or $2,500 per annum, 
$1,000 of which could only be used to pay premiums, 
and $1,500 for the incidental expenses of the Society.

HISTORICAL SKETCH OP THE SOCIETY. 

In 1871 the special premium of flOO was awarded R. \V. 
Furnas for a fruit exhibit at Richmond, Va. The same year, 
at Baltimore, a medal was awarded this Society for collection 
of fruits. In 1873, at Boston, a medal was awarded for 
tlio best collection of pears, and at the same time and place 
one for a collection of apples. In 1874 an exhibit was made 
at Philadelphia, at the Pennsylvania Horticultural Soci&gt; 
and a medal rewarded the effort. In 1875, at Chicago, a 
medal was awarded the Society for a collection of fine apples. 
In 1876. at the Centennial, an award was made this Society 
for a collective exhibit of fruits. At New Orleans, 1884-85, 
best collection of fruits, a medal. Again at Chicago medals 
on fruit exhibit, also forestry exhibit. Then later at the 
Trans-Mississippi, Nebraska secured the only highest award 
for continuous exhibit of fruit; and still later at the Paris 
Exposition several awards were made both to private individuals 
and to the Society. 

Now a few words as to what these awards mean. It is not 
the value of the piece of metal, but the advertisement of the 
possibilities of a young and growing state. Years ago one of 
these awards was of incalculable value to the State, as an 
advertisement, and everywhere throughout the eastern states 
Nebraska has been advertised by these exhibits from this and 
kindred societies. If our Society with its limited funds can 
make an exhibit of fruit and planted timber at the Buffalo 
Exposition, I believe it will add one more award to the list 
already awarded to our Society and give us a good advertisement 
in a territory that we have never entered as a Society to 
make an exhibit. </seg>

CHERRY CULTURE IN NEBRASKA.

The cherry is undoubtedly the best and most successful 
fruit grown in Nebraska. One of its chief advantages is the 
fact that it transplants easily and thrives equally well in 
almost every portion of the Btate. It delights in dry soil, 
and will yield an abundant crop where other varieties of fruit 
fail. Another advantage is its season of ripening. The early 
touting varieties are rijH' and harvested before the intensely 
hot weather begins, and the spring rains are always sufficient 
to ripen the crop. This gives the cherry a decided advantage 
over fruit that must remain upon the tree until October 1. 

Kite cherry needs but very little pruning — in fact none at 
if the tret' is trained right when first started. At most, 
the pruning necessary is to remove limbs that cross each 
it and rub. 

Another reason why the cherry is peculiarly adapted to 
Nebraska is the fact that it ripens its wood and fruit buds 
early in the season, and is thus much less liable to winter injury 
than varieties of fruit that grow late in the fall and go 
into winter quarters with wood and fruit buds only partially 
matured. The cherry has produced more full crops of fruit 
than any other variety of trees grown in Nebraska, which 
would indicate that it is the fruit especially adapted to this 

In preparing for planting, the soil should be loosened to a 
depth of twelve to sixteen inches. The trees should be set 
two or three inches deeper than they stood in the nursery row, 
and the soil should be packed firmly about the roots. There 
is no danger of setting the tree too firm. When near the surface 
dry, loose soil should be used. This will prevent the

tramped soil from baking around the tree, and will also act 

as a mulch or blanket to prevent evaporation of the moisture. 

After planting the trees should have good, clean, cultiva- 

tion. By planting potatoes, sweet corn, or other garden crops 

in the orchard, sufficient returns may be obtained to pay for 

cultivating the ground until the trees require all the space. 

The trees should be planted sixteen feet apart each way for 

three rows ; then leave a space of twenty feet and plant three 

more rows sixteen feet apart, and so on. The object of this 

wide row is to give an opening through which to drive and 

handle the fruit when the orchard conies into full bearing. 
The varieties named in the following table have all been

in the nursery. Plant raspberry 2^ feet in rows, having the 
rows five or six feet apart. Prune in the spring, cutting out 
all old wood and cut back new wood to two to four feet, 
owing to strength of canes at time of trimming. Where old 
canes are not too much of a harbor for insects, it is better to 
leave them until spring, as they help to hold up the snow and 
to keep the new canes from breaking down.

cultivation. Prune blackberry in winter or spring; 
take out all old wood, and cut back new wood to three or four 
feet. Cut off all side shoots that hang over the row or they

and cultivate well. Cattle and horses will not bite them, but 
Might step on them. Set posts in the row and put on two

not climb over the wires. If you want to use more trees, set 
' r together in the row, say ten or even eight feet in one 
row. If you want more than one row, keep the rows fifty feet 
apart; the trees will stand straighter and are easier to cultivate. 
If you want to make a barn or shed of them, make outi«ide 
rows eight feet apart and rest of grove twelve feet apart; 
cultivate well, do not trim until large enough so that the 
eattle will not break them, then trim up the inside trees high 
enough so stock can got under them, but do not trim outside 
row only enough to make a door for stock to get in. 

If you want shelter around the house or anywhere where 
k does not run, make every other tree cedar and Scotch 
pine, in eastern Nebraska. In winter the cedar turns brownish 
and the Scotch pine whitish — fine contrast ; the pine wants 
to grow tall and the cedar spreading. In western Nebraska, 
instead of Scotch pine, use Ponderosa pine, and do not forget 
a few of the brilliant colored evergreens near the house, and 
recollect in handling evergreens that their roots are not to 
be exposed to either wind or sun, scarcely a minute; keep 
tops dry and roots covered with thin mud while handling, and 
then they are as sure as any other tree to grow. The ground 
must not be allowed to bake or crack around them the first

PLANTINC THB APPLE ORCHARD. 

PLANTING THE APPLE ORCHARD. 

Bureau of Horticulture^ 

Nebraska State Horticultural Society.) 

The following suggestions are very simple, and will be 
found useful when put in practice: Location — Under, good 
care the apple tree will grow acd bear on most any slope, yet 
the eastern .slopes are the most desirable, and the western 
and southwestern are the least desirable. Wimi hrmki — In 
all cases the orchard should not be allowed to suffer the full 
force of the wind. A wind-break on the south and west is 
always beneficial, and a shelter belt is a benefit on any side 
where it will check a full sweep of wind. Preparing the 
Land — The lan'd should be plowed deep, subsoiling preferred. 
Drag fine and put in good tilth for grain crop. Mark the land 
out both ways with a corn-planter or marker, then establish 
the distance between the trees by a certain number of rows. 
In this way the corn or potatoes or any cultivated crop that i? 
planted in the young orchard will always fit the tree rows. 
Dig the holes with a spade or by plowing deep furrows. The 
holes must be deep enough to admit the roots in their natural 
position. Before planting, dip the roots in thin mud mortar, 
and never allow them to dry. Plant the tree firmly from three 
to five inches deeper than it stood in the nursery, allowing 
one inch of the surface soil to remain loose to prevent baking 
and to take in the rainfall. Lean the tree slightly to the 
southwest, placing the largest and lowest limbs on that side. 
By this plan and by selecting low-headed trees danger of sunscald 
is much lessoned. The tree should have a central bedj 
with limbs on all sides. Forked trees are worthless. All 
bruised and unnatural roots should be cut off. Shorten the 
top by cutting off one-half of the last year's growth. Distance 
to Plant — In the eastern part of the State apple trees 
should be planted from twenty-five to thirty feet apart.

Ither west and northwest, where there is more sunshine 
dryer atmosphere, they should be planted from twenty to 
lty-flve feet apart. Varieties — For general planting iu 
eastern part of the State the most reliable are Yellow

for summer; Wealthy, Maiden Blush, Porter, Utter's 
i for autumn ; Jonathan, G. Golden, Winesap, Ben Davis,

gives a recommended list for each district. 

PEACH TREES. 

Bureau of Horticulture,} 

Nebraska State Horticultural Society. \ 

Ee peach has been grown very freely in the eastern and 
iern portions of the United States. In the last twenty 
i it has been planted quite extensively in Nebraska. 

Iiriginally the mistake was made of planting the peach on 
warm, sunny slopes and in the sheltered valleys, with the 
lit that the trees grew too late in the fall, the buds were 
imes slightly expanded during mild weather in the winter, 
the trees bloomed earlier than they should. After noting 
ures on that method for some years, experience demonited 
that where planted on higher ground, northerly 
jes, or on the north sides of wind-breaks or buildings, 
trees ripened earlier in the fall, bloomed later in the 
ing, and were much more successfully handled. In plant-

B peach trees, the higher elevations, northerly slopes, and 
lie north side of wind-breaks are found to be the most sucful 
locations. 

Khe peach thrives on very poor soil, and endures drouth 
h better than the apple. The chief dangers to be feared 
late, unripe growth in the fall, premature swelling of the 
8 in February and March. 

11 selecting trees those who plant extensively usually save 
mse by planting the third size, one year trees, or those two 
iree feet in height. Those who plant in smaller quantities 
farm or orchards usually select trees three and four or 
¦ and five feet in height. In trimming, cut back the 
iches to one bud and top the bodies at thirty inches. Corn 
¦ be grown in the orchard during the first two years, or 
¦tables for three years. Care should be taken to cease cultion 
as early as August 1 to be sure that the trees ripen 
ire winter. 

I has been noted in Missouri experiment stations that if 
trees are sprayed with whitewash two or three times durthe 
winter it has some influence in keeping the buds dorit. 
Their experience seems to indicate that it would be 
th what it costs. 

Among the varieties which have been found desirable in 
Nebraska are Alexander, Early Rivers, Hales' Early, Crosby, 
Champion, Hill's Chili, Elberta, Salway. Greensborough 
and Triumph have also been tested with fair success, and 
many others would doubtless succeed. The peach usually 
fruits the fourth season from planting, and may be expected 
to vield profitable returns of fruit five years out of ten. </seg>

THE PLATTE CEDAR. 

(Bulletin No. 5— Series 1901.) 

Nebraska State Horticultural Society. 

We have a photo from the grounds of F. F. Robbins, of 
Fairmont, Neb. Near his door is one tree trimmed into the 
form of a lantern, another is a large gravy dish. He is fitting 
a watch dog to stand guard on another, all ingeniously 
cut out of living cedar trees. This is a fine specimen of what 
is called topiary work. As a general thing we do not like this 
style, but Mr. Kobbins is an artist, and his trees are as fine as 
anything we know of in the United States, unless it be those 
in the Italian gardens, on the splendid grounds of H. H. Hunnewell, 
at Wellesley College, Mass. 

Here we have cheap trees, worth twenty-five cents each, 
transformed into forms of beauty, which greatly enhance the 
value of the place, and Mr. Kobbins has been offered f 25 if he 
would transplant a single tree to other grounds. The value 
of the farm is enhanced several hundred dollars by these 
tree* And yet only a commencement has been made. The 
owner lias his house well set back from the road on rising 
ground, and he has a fine chance to make his grounds worth 
four times as much as they are now, and this shows what we 
have been telling farmers for years, that there is a rich j;«&gt;ld 
mfne in every front yard, if it could only be worked. This 
e trimming of the cedar is not always safe. When 
they are overshadowed by other trees their vitality is reduced 
so they are injured. Again, a long dry season might hurt 
them. 

fut this cut shows what can be done. People often want a 
i'ly sheared hedge. Mb tree does better than this. You 
have a hedge a bird can not fly through, which will keep 
cattle and even hoi;s.

an acre — and put a row of these cedars around it. Give them 
the best of cultivation. They should grow about two feet a 
year. Shear the hedge slightly, to make it compact. Inthis 
enclosure plant your flowers. In the center have an ornamental 
lath screen to shut out half the sun, and under this

well in the open.

you can with good cultivation. Keep the inside sheared, 
the trees grow, gradually pull the tops together to form 
arch overhead. Keep closely sheared within, and trim a 
le on the outside. In a short time you will have a beautisummer 
resort. Put comfortable seats within, and let the 
winds rage — your cedars will take care of you. 

BARNS. 

You can make these any size you like. An acre enclosed 
will do. Plant your trees two feet apart, and take the best of 
care of them. You can shear the inside, and as the trees grow 
large, let them project over the cattle. Shear a little on the 
outside to make it compact. Two rows would be better than 
one. In ten years a barn of this kind, the first cost of which 
would be f20, would be worth f 1,000, and growing better all 
the time.

This prairie country needs breastworks to defend it against 
the hot winds of summer and the terrible blizzards of winter. 
Willows are a failure. Deciduous trees are not the thing, 
for they drop their leaves when most needed. You want an 
evergreen you can depend on, one that will not die out. The

I he summer meeting of the Nebraska State Horticultural

1900, at 10:00 a.m., with President Geo. A. Marshall preng. 
Mayor H. P. Wilson, of Geneva, delivered the follow- 


'» 

ADDRESS OF WELCOME 

Mr. President and Gentlemen of the State Horticultural 

Society: y 

in behalf and in the name of the citizens of Geneva I bid 
welcome to pur city. We hope your stay with us may be 
¦arable ;is well as profitable, and were it not that we 
lit be charged with usurpation of authority we might ex- 
I our jurisdiction and say that on behalf of the people of 
more county we bid you welcome. I know that in doing 
should voice the sentiment of the people of this county, 
if they are not present in large numbers during your sess 
you will know that it is not because they do not feel insted 
in the work you are doing, but rather because of 
es that call them in other places. 

In welcoming you here to-day on behalf of this city, let me 
say that we recognize the fact that you come here, not as 
an ordinary body of men might meet to deliberate, but you 
tome here to-day as leaders in a movement that has been the 
forerunner, that has been the leading spirit in every permanent 
civilization that the history of the world shows. Man 
has gone into new countries and made settlements, broken up 
the ground and tilled it ; he has gone into the mountains and 
opened up quarries and mines; he has built factories and 
shops; but nowhere has man gone yet with the intention of 
making it a permanent abiding place but that he has taken </seg>

with him the tree-planter. The civilized man goes into the 
field and cultivates it because of the dollars and cents there 
are in it; he got* into the factory because of the dollars that 
are in it ; he noes into the quarries and mines for the money 
lie can gH out of them; but when it comes to making for himself 
a home in which to enjoy life, it is then that he calls in 
the tree-planter. And it is eminently fitting that we Arabs 
of the "Great American Desert" sojourning here in the city 
of (Jeneva, should welcome to our midst for their deliberations 
a body of men who have made a study — even though it 
may be in a commercial sense — of the means of mitigating 
those conditions from which we of these western plains 
suffer. 

An eminent authority has said that by actual test an oak 
tree twenty feet in height and of the shape of an ordinary 
apple tree, in a climate that is much drier than this, was 
found to give off into the atmosphere during the month of 
June two hundred barrels of water; during the month of July 
two hundred fifty; and during August about two hundred 
barrels. Now, if this be true (and we have no reason to doubt 
it, as it has received the sanction of the best authority we 
have in the State of Nebraska) then it is also true that trees 
of the character which we grow in this country and in our atmosphere 
would give off much more water. For that reason 
we, as denizens of these western plains, who know something 
of the terrors of hot winds, should extend a friendly 
welcome to every tree-planter and every one interested in 
liing our people how and what to plant. Because if this 
be true as to the amount of moisture given off into the atmosphere 
by a single tree, if we, in this great plain on the 
era slope of the Hooky mountains from the Gulf of Ma 
to the Dominion of Canada, were to plant trees until we have 
twenty per cent of our acreage in orchards and groves, I 
think it is not too much to say that we would find our climate 
entirely changed. Therefore, as I said before, it is eminently 
fitting that we welcome you to our midst, and I can assure </seg>

you that we do this heartily. We have no gates to our &lt; 
so there are no keys to turn over. Everything is open. The 
city is yours and at jour disposal. Our people will welcome 
you to their homes, and anything they have is yours while 
you stay. We ask you to stay with us just as long as you 
can, and when your deliberations close and you go to your 
homes, we hope you will make up your minds to come again 
soon, and we will try to treat you just as nicely next time.

RESPONSE. 

By C. A. Whitford, Arlington. 

Mr. President, and Gentlemen of the Horticultural Soci' 

i'o one here regrets more than I do my being placed in thiH 
ition. Those of you who came here knowing that Govjr 
Furnas was on the program expected to hear the reuse 
from him. It is always a trying position to be pkke&lt;l 
is a substitute; it is especially so when a man of my small 
bre is expected to fill the shoes of a man like Governor 
•nas. I understand that he wears No. 11 shoes, and it 
lid be simply a physical impossibility for me to fill them 
i my small feet. [Laughter.] 

iiowever, the work of this response to the kind and eloat 
remarks by the mayor of this beautiful little city is an 
ortant one which must be performed by some one. It 
as that the president has called on me, taking me entirely 
wares, and as I am a martyr to duty I am always willing 
espond. 

We certainly appreciate the hearty welcome extended to 
our society by the people of Geneva, and I do not know what 
better I could do than to refer briefly to the early work and 
history of this society. I do not know very much of its early 
history except as I have read it and learned of it by conversation 
with others; still I know a few of the charter members, 
a few of the pioneers, a few of the men who blazed the </seg>

            <seg id="p238">

way and made it possible for those of us who are here to-day 
to take up the work and carry it on. I believe it would be 
helpful and inspiring to us all if I should mention the names 
of some of those worthy pioneers. There is ex Governor 
nders for one, J. Sterling Morton, Governor Furnas, Old 
Mr. Masters, Old Gentleman Barnard, and many others 
whose names I can not recall. These are the men who laid 
the foundations on which we are building ; they are the men 
who went forth to battle with the desert conditions which 
prevailed here in the early days, and it is largely due to their 
courage and persistence that those conditions have been, in a 
measure at least, overcome. 

To-day we have a society that reaches almost every county 
in the State where it is possible to raise fruit. We meet 
twice a year; we have our January meeting, which, according 
to statute must be held in Lincoln, then we have this summer 
meeting which can be held anywhere in the State. There 
are both pleasure and profit in these meetings. It is profitable 
for us to meet together and discuss the problems that 
we are called to solve as tree-planters and fruit growers; it 's 
a pleasure to greet each other at these meetings, renewing 
old acquaintances and forming many pleasant new ones. 
The Horticultural Society would be doing a great work if it 
did nothing else than to bring together twice a year from different 
parts of the State the people who are interested in 
fruit growing. On behalf of this society I sincerely thank 
the mayor and people of Geneva for the very cordial welcome 
extended us here. [Applause.] </seg>

MULCHING GROUND FOB VEGETABLES. 

237 

MULCHING GROUND FOR VEGETABLES. 

By H. A. McComb, Lincoln. 

I he Nebraska Experiment Station has begun an experiit 
in mulching ground for vegetables. The results of last 
imer's work may be interesting as well as suggestive of 
it we may expect from more extensive experience. They 
uld not, however, be taken as final, because the actual 
le of the mulch can only be determined by carrying the 
eriment through a series of years. If, however, we work 
the theory that the mulch conserves moisture, and the 
erally accepted fact that conservation of moisture is a 
d thing for most parts of Nebraska, then the things true 
one season's crop will have the chances in favor of simiresults 
other years. The Station expects to give the eximent 
a thorough trial for a series of years. 

In planning the experiment for last summer's work, two 
equal plots were laid off for each vegetable to be tried. The 
one to be mulched I shall call the "mulch" plot and the other 
to be given careful cultivation. This last I shall call the 
"check" plot. This was for the purpose of comparison. In 
order that this may be done more or less accurately care wo 
taken in the selection of a location for the plots, so that the 
general conditions should be as near alike as possible in reference 
to slope, drainage, etc. The ground had a gradual 
slope to the west. In every case the check plot was placed 
just north of the mulch plot with a space six feet wide intervening. 
The treatment of both was identical up to the time of 
the spreading of the mulch, which was after the piants were 
well started and had been cultivated at least once. After 
this of course the culture was entirely different. The one 
was given no care at all except the pulling up of a few weeds 
that worked their way through the mulch, while the other 
was given constant care, including work with the ho* and 
frequent cultivation. </seg>

            <seg id="p240">

NEB] ATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

The results of the experiment were, as a whole, very satisfactory. 
The cultivated or check plots responded well to 
their culture. The comparison of each mulch plot, then, will 
be with a plot of thrifty, healthy, and productive plants. 

El observations were made along three important lines: 
the season of maturity; second, the yield; and, third, the 
et value as resulting from size, evenness, and, in a few 
, flavor. 

I may be well to divide vegetables into three classes deling 
upon the part esteemed for use. Under the first 
3 I shall include root crops, consisting of tubes, enlarged 
8, bulbs, etc., such as potatoes, beets, and onions. The 
nd class will consist of leaf crops, such as cabbage and 
ice, and the third class will include all the vegetables 
vn for their fruits. Examples of this class are the 
ms, cucumbers, tomatoes, and egg plants. In a few cases 
effects seemed characteristic of one or the other of these 
ips. 

No great differences were noticed in regard to earliness. 
The leaf crops, cabbage and lettuce, seemed slightly earlier 
in the mulch, while the rest of the vegetables tried wouM 
average from one to two days later. The musk melons, however, 
were an exception to this rule. The clean mulch bed 
seemed to favor early Honing for them. Cucumbers also 
showed a slight advantage of earliness in favor of mulch. In 
a few cases the season of maturity was somewhat prolonged 
in the mulch plot. This was noticed especially in reference 
to cucumbers, tomatoes, and snap beans. The picking of green 
tomatoes, Perfection, just before frost, was, for the mulch 
plot, 32 pounds and only 12 pounds for the check plot. Then 
in a season which is fairly wet, as last year, we may conclude 
that the mulch plots are but very little later than cultivated 
ground, and that in a few cases at least the longer season of 
fruitfulness will more than make up the difference. 

terhaps the most important thing to look after is the yield, 
following table will perhaps give a good idea as to the </seg>

re merits of the two methods of culture last year. The 
shows the number of fruits picked and their weight. 

• The beets were thinned to equal distance apart, but a part of check plot did not come 

It will be noticed that there is a marked increase in yield 
in a number of cases. The root crops, however, seem to be 
an exception. Here the gain is small and in one case an actual 
loss. For potatoes there is only .06 per cent gain. The 
potato has been mulched more than any other vegetable, and 
opinion varies considerably as to its value. The Michi 
Station in 1893 makes a statement in favor of cultivation

ored the mulch, claiming for it an increase of total yield and 
larger tubers. It may be that the effect varies largely for 
different seasons. With onions there was little difference in 
yield. The thing most noticeable with beets was their general 
regularity and evenness. While there was little advantage 
as to yield, the mulch plot produced much more attractive 
beets. 

The leaf crops, cabbage and lettuce, are interesting because 
of the larger heads from the mulch plot. The lettuce 
was also much tenderer. I have great hopes for the mulch in 
growing summer cabbage. This is often a difficult crop to 
grow. The average weight per head for the Sure Head was, 
in the mulch, a little over eight pounds as compared with an 
average weight of five pounds in the check plot. 

Among the fruit crops, the tomatoes, cucumbers, melons, 
snap and navy beans, and early peas, there was usually a 
very large gain in favor of the mulch. The most conspicuous 
in this list is 1.12 per cent gain for the navy bean under 
mulch. 

It is almost proverbial that "soup" beans, as they are 
called, should be planted on the poorest ground you have. 
With this in mind it is difficult to account for the yield of 
about 45 bushels per acre. 

ifew things were conspicuous with these vegetables be-8 
the yield. With tomatoes there was a greater regularless 
rotten blossom ends, and much less cracking from the 
l end. W r ith cucumbers there was the greatest difference 
ing a dry period. The mulch would continue to produce 
imbers, well filled out to the end, while those in the check 
would fall off in number, and those that grew would be 
;e at the stem end and small and undeveloped at the blosend. 


W r ith snap beans there was an advantage in color, with 
musk melons in flavor. With watermelons the flavor was 
poorer in a number of the melons. This may have been due

I the growth. The melons were smaller but of greater num- 
In the case of the Cuba Queen, the melons were larger, 
no weights were gotten, because the boys found this patch 
Sunday and played havoc with it. The sweet corn and 
corn gave but slight advantage one way or the other, and 
sidering the fact that they require less cultivation than 
ost any of the other vegetables, it is doubtful if the mulch 
prove practical in the growing of these crops, unless in a 
r dry year. The case of the late peas (Champion of Eng-1) 
is rather interesting. It was thought that perhaps 
peas would not need "sticking." This, however, was not 
i. The vines grew larger, became matted over the straw, 
then began to mildew. As a result of this but few of the 
9 matured before the vines had lost their vitality. 

The important effects of the mulch may then be summed up 
under two heads, first, an increase in yield for most of them ; 
and, second, a greater market value, due to the larger size of 
each individual vegetable and the greater uniformity of size. 
A third effect, while indirect is, however, important. This ia 
in regard to the gathering for market or use. The vegetables 
from the mulch will naturally be clean after a rain. 

» shall not discuss the theory of the mulch in a paper of 
length, for I have not the space. Some work, however, 
been done along that line. 

There is a question of vital importance and that ia 
whether mulching is practical or not. Next year we expect to 
make an account for every plot and determine the exact expense 
and labor required in the growing of a crop on it. Until 
then I can not give any definite figures as to the relative 
cost, but as a matter of opinion, from having done the work 
myself, I believe that it will pay well, not only in an increase 
in crop, but in the saving of labor for many if not all of the 
vegetables. 

The average farmer has, as a rule, a considerable amount 
of straw on hand, or can get it very cheap by hauling it himself. 
It is not necessary to use first class straw that would

            <seg id="p244">

NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

ordinarily be used for feeding purposes. The expense in such 
s would be reduced 10 a minimum. The market gudCMV 
would perhaps be at a greater expense. Tbe amount of straw 
used will vary of course with the thickness with which it is 
spivad. It should not be thick so as not to admit rain readily 
down to the soil. I believe that a good spread can be made 
with six or eight tons per acre or even less. This of course is 
only an estimate. 

I regard to the spreading some time is required, but one 
can cover on au average as much ground in a day as he 
1 in a half day with the hoe and cultivator. This is 
y an easy matter except in cases of beets and onions, 
•e it requires a great deal of care. For crops like cab, 
tomatoes, melons, cucumbers, beans, and corn the work 
tually lessend fully a half. This will appear more plauswhen 
it is remembered that vegetables should generally 
iltivated at least once a week, and that they require some 
; with the hoe, in order to get the best results. 

t would say, then, that it is just as cheap if not cheaper to 
ch, provided you have straw or it can be bought at a reaible 
price. If you have to pay a high price, the per cent 
ain will more than pay for it in some cases. The experit 
next summer will show something in regard to this. 

tt the Station we left the mulch on the ground to notice 
(ffect through the winter. I have not yet decided what is 
best method for removing it. Sometimes it might be adble 
to plow it under. Of course it can be raked off and 
led. This would not be a very serious task, it seems to 
on a small farm garden. 

In conclusion, theu, I would say that the mulch proved 
practical last year in the growing of such crops as melons, 
tomatoes, cabbage, lettuce, beans, and peas. The results obtained 
in favor of the mulch with these crops are such that I 
hope others will be interested and try some of them under 
mulch this coming year. </seg>

CULTIVATION AS AN ADJUNCT TO IRRIGATION. 

CULTIVATION AS AN ADJUNCT TO IRRIGATION. 

ior some thirtj* years our society has been wrestling with 
problems presented in the eastern part of the (State. 
rly all of us have been raising fruit by cultivation withthe 
aid of irrigation. But within the last ten years there 
arisen a new factor in the horticultural work of our si. 
ctor that should receive the attention of this society. 

Since the great drouth of 1890 the people living along the 
Republican and other streams of the State have been seriously 
considering the question of what could be done with the 
waters that were flowing past their doors. A great deal has 
been done in the way of leading out the waters of those 
streams and making use of them. We now have under irrigation 
one million acres of land, and it is believed that when 
the other ditches that are contemplated or under process of 
construction have been completed, and our people learn to 
make the utmost use of the water, that is, make the saino 
amount of water we now have do more work, we shall be able 
to irrigate about two million acres more in this state. 

iie proper use of water should be as a supplement to natrainfall. 
Even in the eastern part of the State we have 
een times when, if we could have applied water to our ords, 
it would have saved us a great amount of fruit. WM 
ditches carry more water than farmers are using. Exive 
use of water causes the ground to Income watered; 
leaves of trees turn white; do not make natural 
ith. Trees which receive too much water do not make as 
[ growth as trees receiving excellent cultivation but not 
;r irrigation. 

On the other hand, a good many people are using the water 
judiciously. They frequently have rain, even in irrigated districts. 
Then no water is used. Men like David Hunter, president 
of the Sutherland Ditch company, and Carsten Truelseu

are using water as needed with good judgment. In the winter 
time they make a quantity of boxes. Using 1x4 crib lumber 
and 1x6 fencing, they make boxes 4x4, long enough to extend 
through the bank of the lateral 24 to 30 inches. These boxes 
are supplied with paddle gates working in gains in the water 
end. These paddle gates are raised half an inch or an inch to 
allow a little rill to flow. Care must be taken to let in only 
the proper amount that shall trickle along as a rill in the shallow 
furrows prepared for it, instead of flowing rapidly in 
larger quantities. For some kinds of work they bore in 
this paddle gate an inch augur hole and allow only that 
amount to run at a time. Something depends on the length 
of row to be watered, preference being given to allowing a 
very small rill to run a long period, twenty-four to fortyeight 
hours, rather than a rush of water which, passing 
quickly over the ground, soon coats it with sedirurnt, the effect 
of which is to pass the water forward instead of allowing 
it to soak deeply into the soil. In twenty-four to thirty-six 
hours these little streams trickle forty to sixty rods and the 
rows are thoroughly saturated. Soon after the water is 
soaked away it should be cultivated. 

II. Lute Wilcox. editor of Field and Farm, of Denver, has 
ten a very excellent work on irrigation, and is a pracl 
irrigator. He holds that irrigation, supplemented by 
¦ough and frequent cultivation, can be increased in its 
le two-fold. That is, one-half the water with full cultivais 
equal to double the water with limited or less than the 
jer amount of cultivation, enabling the farmer who wishes 
jver a larger area with the amount of water he has bought, 
xtend the area he can cover with his allowance. When 
ground is well irrigated and the subsoil well saturated he 
extend the water over more acres, and by supplementing 
ith judicious cultivation he gets the amount of moisture 
lired for the growth of a crop in the western portion of 
state and eastern Colorado. </seg>

|:ed by the numerous districts supplied with streams that 
dry a considerable portion of the summer season, owing 
vatcrs being taken out by ditches located above them, 
pled with the natural shrinkage of water in the summer, 
illustration of such problems is found on lands along the 
th Platte in western Nebraska. Ditches in Colorado take 
:he major portion of the water, the surplus running down 
ood times usually well into June, sometimes a little later. 
y, August, and September are usually likely to be dry. In 
ober, a season when ditches above use but little water, 
er again commences to flow in the South Platte. 

As an illustration of what can be done by the judicious use 
of water when it can be had, supplemented with suitable cultivation, 
W. F. Stafford secured a section of land lying under 
one of these South Platte ditches on which he moved in 
March, 1900. Although delayed by the construction of necessary 
buildings, he was able to saturate enough raw prairie to 
enable him to break and seed 70 acres to spring wheat. 15 
acres to barley, 100 acres to corn, 30 acres flax, and 50 acres 
of the wheat ground was seeded with alfalfa. Wheat gave a 
yield of about 15 bushels per acre, barley 20, and 1,400 bushels 
of corn were grown. Flax was a failure because he wm 
unable to lead out a sufficient quantity of water for this particular 
plat. Fie also watered a considerable area of prairie 
land, stimulating the short prairie grasses to develop a growth 
of one ton of hay per acre. In the fall of 1900 this gentleman 
will drill in 80 acres of winter wheat and in the spring of 
1901 expects to be prepared to plant 150 acres of corn, which 
he will follow in autumn with winter wheat and in the spring 
of 1902 will seed to alfalfa. Winter wheat does well where 
it can secure sufficient water in the fall to saturate the soil 
and go into winter with the soil and subsoil well supplied with 
moisture. Fifty bushels per acre is sometimes grown under 
these conditions, and 30 to 40 bushels is an ordinary crop. 
Under conditions similar to these, farmers are rapidly seeding 
their lands to alfalfa, as it better endures the intermittent </seg>

watering of flood times. Fruit trees and plants are succeeding, 
saturating the soil when water can be had in October ami 
November and early spring, and conserving moisture by cultivation 
during the remainder of the season. 

The question presented is, Will lands along streams like the 
South Platte, flooded in the spring when there is an abundance 
of water and that followed by thorough cultivation be 
enabled to retain moisture enough to r,aise a crop. Work in 
progress indicates that this can be done. 

Turning now to the other extreme, the table lands. As an 
illustration of what can be done on elevated table lands in 
western Kansas and Nebraska, Wm. McCallum, farming in 
Cheyenne county, Kansas, is 150 feet to water. This gentleman 
has planted an orchard without other crop, giving it 
frequent surface culture. In three years' time he finds he has 
stored up under the surface moisture to the depth of fifteen 
feet. Trees and plants made a vigorous and healthy growth. 
His method of planting corn is in drills, one stalk in -'• 
inches. Wheat is also drilled in 18 to 22 inches apart and 
cultivated three times during the early portion of the season. 
This method of seeding lessens the number of grain stalks to 
be supported, and this shallow culture lessens evaporation of 
moisture, so that fair crops of grain and corn and excellent 
crops of potatoes can be grown. 

IVe have here branches of trees as an illustration of tree 
wth from one of our society experiment stations, showing 
at cultivation alone will do. Apple trees made a growth of

branches 12 feet, circumference of trunk 13 inches. This or 
chard of thirty-five acres contains about 2,000 apple trees, 7 
acres of pear, plum, and cherry; plantations of grapes, currants 
and gooseberries ; 148 varieties of fruit and forest trees, 
shrubs, and plants have been planted to be tested. The 
growth secured on these various trees, plants, and shrubs in 
dicates that surface culture does hold sufficient moisture 
to secure vigorous, hardy growth, comparing favorably with 
results obtained in the eastern portion of the State. 

METHOD OF CULTIVATION. 

Commence in spring as soon as the frost is out, disc or harrow, 
break the crust, and conserve moisture. Cultivate the 
surface after each rain until August 1. This secures a rapid, 
vigorous growth. Lest a warm autumn with occasional showers 
should continue growth too late and leave trees and plants 
unripe at the beginning of winter, it has been found important, 
to cease cultivation as early as August 1, after which time the 
ground should be covered with some cover crop. This cover 
crop may be oats. At the Purdum station it has sometimes 
been corn drilled in late in July, and in some years it is 
simply red root weeds allowed to spring up and grow with 
considerable vigor to cover the soil and catch the drifting 
flurries of snow. 

In the season of '98 this T. C. Jackson station was cultivated 
until mid-August, preventing the growth of such an 
amount of weeds as should absorb the surplus moisture. This, 
with the warm late fall, kept up growth too late, and trees 
were unripe when winter set in, resulting in some harm from 
the very trying winter of '98-99. This is mentioned to show 
that it is not only possible on table lands to conserve sufficient 
moisture by the use of judicious cultivation to secure a vigorous 
growth of trees and plants, but also to store up more 
moisture than can be safely handled in seasons like the fall </seg>

WINDMILL IRRIGATION. 

There are times and seasons all over Nebraska when the 
moisture which can be conserved by cultivation would be 
greatly assisted, especially in the handling of gardens, small 
fruit plantations, and small orchards, by the application of 
water from reservoirs supplied by windmills. The orchard of 
Mr. Tannahill, of Columbus, was some years ago a very good 
illustration of what could be done with windmills. Thin 
gentleman made use of two Jumbo windmills, pumping into 
a reservoir. While his orchard up to the period of using 
windmills had made a vigorous and healthy growth from cultivation 
only, yet during periods of rapid evaporation from 
strong south winds and bearing full crops of fruit, they suffered 
seriously from dropping in late August and September. 
Over such portions of his orchard as he could conduct water 
from the reservoir, the trees retained their fruit and carried 
it forward to full size and proper time for picking. 

This may come to all of us, no matter how careful we may 
be in conserving moisture in spring or early summer. When 
trees get large enough to carry heavy loads of fruit, they require 
a very large amount of moisture. I fear the problem of 
conserving moisture enough to retain that amount and enable 
trees to carry full loads will be beyond the capacity of cultivation 
unless we plant our trees farther apart and protect 
them by heavy wind-breaks. In our own experience in Saline 
county we have been very thorough in cultivating and have 
succeeded in carrying through some very good crops. Dtutag 
the season of '94 we had twenty bushels of apples of single 
trees, but that fruit would have been considerably larger and 
the crop a great deal better if we could have supplemented our 
excellent cultivation by irrigation.

where that cultivation can be supplemented by the judicious 
use of water at the tine when it is most needed; and orchards 
situated under such favorable conditions as those are going 
to raise better fruit, more of it, and more cheaply than those 
in the eastern portion of the State, Mr. Hostetter, situate! 
fifteen or sixteen miles from North Platte, has an orchard 
eleven years old which is carrying a very heavy load of fruit. 
It is marvelous the fruit those trees are maintaining. Eight 
miles west of North Platte is the orchard of EL Otten. His 
trees are nine years old and are carrying very full crops of apples. 
His grapes and cherries are very successful, peaches have 
made a good growth, and small fruits are a decided success. 
The other day he showed me strawberry plants under irrigation 
which had given eight successive crops without replacing. 
They very frequently gather strawberries for five successive 
years, mid from that to ten, without replanting. 

All this seems to indicate that where you can supplement 
cultivation and rare by the judicious use of water, you can 
grow fruit more freely, more cheaply, and more profitably 
than we can in the eastern portion of the State. 

DISCUSSION 

Kr. H. P. Wilson. — At about what distance from the tree 
hey run those little rills of which you speak? 

I[r. Stephens. — When the tree is first planted it is the 
:*tice of the best irrigators to run these furrows close to 
tree ; one on each side as close as one horse can work with 
iort singletree. The first season they are irrigated three 
is, giving one irrigation at the time of planting and the 
t two later. Strawberry plants and small fruits at picktime 
are irrigated two or three times a week, with the 
lght of watering each time in the evening after the pickhave 
been over for that day that there may be a great 
ndance of moisture to carry forward the growth of the 
ng berries. The probabilities are that the same will apto 
orchards when they get into heavy bearing. That is, </seg>

they will need to be irrigated in August, because the demands 
on the tree at that time will be very great. 

{s the trees grow, of course they exteud their roots, so that 
feeders get farther and farther from the body of the tree, 
find that apple trees the first season will extend their 
s laterally from three to four fe?t. The third and fourth 
on these roots will run twelve to fifteen feet, hence the 
?ring must be farther from the tree. You would perhaps 
three furrows each side of the trees the second and third 
ons, and put these rills, or irrigating furrows, quite a dis¦e 
apart, depending on the character of the soil. 

Mr. Whitfori). — I understand you to emphasize the fact 
that we should stop irrigating and cultivating at a certain 
time, that is, in time for the wood to ripen up. Wouldn't you 
irrigate, then, after the growth has stopped and the wood is 
thoroughly ripened, before the ground freezes up for winter 
I ask this question because I have noticed that when we have 
a good rain just before it freezes up, when it is too late for 
tin growth to start again, with almost any kind of a winter 
following, the fruit buds come through all right. I have seen 
peach buds winter all right when the mercury went to 28 below 
zero for three or four days at a time. On the other hand, 
following a dry fall, when there was scarcely any moisture 
in the ground, I have known the peach buds to kill at 16 to 18 
below. What is your observation and experience as to putting 
the water on just before the ground freezes up, or after 
it is too late for the growth to start again? 

Mr. Stephens. — Mr. Whitford raises a very important 
point. I am glad he has brought this up, because it is one 
of the most important considerations. The ability to wet the 
soil completely late in the fall and allow it to freeze up moist 
instead of dry is one of the most valuable adjuncts to successful 
orcharding in the West. Apparently these western 
orchards commence fruiting younger than our eastern orchards. 
This is probably because they can get a vigorous 
growth there during the early part of the season, and the tree </seg>

CULTIVATION AS AN ADJUNCT TO IBBIGATION. 

I be gotten large enough to do good work younger in years 
i our eastern orchards. And then the very rapid evaporain 
August and September apparently causes these trees 
et fruit buds earlier than they do with us. And then, too, 
arently the years that these trees are fruiting abundantly, 
judicious irrigator can use water so freely that the tree ia 
exhausted by its load of fruit, but can carry that load of 
t and set perfect fruit buds for next year at the same 
2. Then just before the ground freezes up for winter it 
lid be completely saturated, doing this so late that the 
svth has been made and can not be revived. This is a very 
ortant consideration. 

Mr. Duxlap. — In trying to grow trees by surface cultivation, 
have you noticed any differences between the cherry, 
plum, or apple as to their ability to withstand drouth. That 
is, if you had a minimum of water and wanted to grow fruit, 
which would you consider the most reliable to plant, the 
plum, cherry, or apple? 

Mu. Stephens. — For a tree to endure the greatest amount 
of drouth I would place first the American plum, then, perhaps, 
the cherry, and third the apple. We find cherry trees 
living and bearing fruit under very unfavorable condition** 
all over the West where they have been so sadly neglected 
that they do not have the proper amount of moisture. Why 
is it? It is because the cherry is a tree that naturally ripens 
its wood early in the season, and its crop is ripe and out of 
the way before the dry period comes on. 

EB. Yager. — What about the practicability of artificially 
ng water for irrigation purposes by windmills or other? 


E[r. Stephens. — I believe this to be practical for the faniorchard, 
but rather difficult for the man who is raising 
t in a commercial way. . </seg>

RASPBERRIES AND BLACKBERRIES. 

By J. W. Stevenson, North Bend. 

I 'he soil and its location, planting, and after cultivation 
raspberries and blackberries are about the same, so we 
11 include both of them in the most of our remarks. They 
uld have the best of soil, and a moist rather than a dry 
L Raspberries will admit of manuring the rows freely. 
; soil before planting should be stirred very deep so that 
roots may penetrate deeply and thus withstand drouth 
ter. Shallow rooting of plants should be guarded against 
:his state. 

I hen to PLANT. — Planting in the spring is preferable, 
may be done in the fall if the ground is sufficiently moist 
the plants after planting are covered with earth just befreezing 
up, or are protected by a forkful of coarse 
iure over each plant after the ground freezes slightly, 
pberry tips taken up early in October are not sufficiently 
ured and are inferior to plants dug in the spring. The 
e may be said of blackberry plants grown from root euts. 
The tips and plants, if undisturbed, grow till frozen 
lie ground. We would recommend getting the plants in 
spring, and as early as convenient, before the tips comce 
to sprout. 

Planting. — We would recommend that the rows for raspberries 
be six feet apart, and if many rows are planted let 
every fifth space be eight feet wide to allow room for a team 
and wagon to pass through in hauling manure, brush, etc. 
Rows for blackberries should not be less than seven feet 
¦part, and occasionally a row eight or nine feet for passing 
of team and wagon. The plants may be set three feet apart 
in the rows. Some recommend planting black raspberry 
plants only two feet apart in the row, as the plants are very 
tender and manv are damaged in planting or shipping and you </seg>

can not, therefore, depend on having a perfect stand unless 
extra plants are planted. We think the plan a good one for 
black caps. The suckers of red raspberries and blackberries 
soon fill up any gaps in the rows. The plants may be set in 
holes made by a spade, or in a freshly plowed furrow, and the 
soil packed very firmly about the roots. The plants should 
have the most thorough culture, and no weeds allowed to rob 
them of moisture. Thiscultivationshouldcontinuethroughthe 
fruiting season till August 15, or later if necessary. To con•serve 
moisture it is well to stir the surface after each rain. 
The tip ends of the plants (except red raspberries) should 
be pinched or cut off first year when one foot long, and second 
year when one and a half feet long, to make them 
branch. When older, they may be cut when two feet high. 
It may be. necessary to go over them three times, cutting 
them so they reach near that height. Some pinch the ends 
off with finger and thumb. A large pair of shears is very 
good, but where new canes are plentiful we find a sharp hand 
sickle the most effective, and with it we can often cut off several 
tip ends at one stroke. Red raspberry sprouts should 
not be shortened, nor should the lateral branches of raspberry 
and blackberry until spring. Some growers claim best results 
by letting blackberry canes grow as long as they will 
without cutting. They are very inconvenient to take care of, 
and a trellis is necessary for thrifty canes, as many of them 
will be ten or twelve feet long. If new plants or black raspberry 
or dewberry are wanted, plant the tip ends two to four 
inches deep with a spade or dibble, or use a furrow about 
September 1 or later. The tip ends are ready to plant when 
the tips have ceased leaf growth and are hardened. If 
planted while tip ends are still growing they will rot. Pruning 
out the old canes may be done as soon as through fruiting, 
but it is usually done in the spring after buds swell on the 
live bushes, so that all dead wood of old and new canes can 
be cut away. Often many or part of the new canes are winter-killed, 
and all these should be removed or pruned. It is </seg>

rilt for a novice to know what to cut out till he sees what 
rtiag to grow. 

The suckers of red raspberry and blackberry between 
rows should be plowed or hoed out during the summer. They 
are easily subdued, and it is important to keep them down, 
or all will be ruined by an over production of plants for 
which there is not a sufficient supply of moisture. If plants 
could be planted where they could be partially shaded in 
winter time, they would pass through the winters better. We 
have found in our experience with raspberry plants in orchard 
that those planted in the rows of trees and the next 
IVW east were less injured than the other rows. We attributed 
their better condition to the shade of the trees and to 
the greater moisture on the north and northeast side of the 
s. We think it is not extreme cold that injures plants so 
much as drouth and sunshine. The past winter has been 
very mild, yet raspberry plants, black and red sorts, did not 
winter through any better than in the previous very severe 
winter. Red raspberry did not do as well as the year before. 
We think extreme cold will kill blackberries, regardless of 
other conditions. The severe winter of 1898-99 has demonst 
rated the greater hardiness of the raspberry over the blackberry. 


What to Plant. — Drouth, sunshine, snowdrifts, and hard 
freezing may kill the hardiest sorts, but there is a difference 
in the hardiness of sorts. The varieties are legion now, but 
will mention only a few. Tyler and Palmer are early sorts 
and hardy as any. but not very vigorous growers, nor long 
lived, oliio and Older are good medium season sorts, and 
arc quite hardy. The Older will not do for a shipping berry, 
as it is too soft. Conrath and Kansas are fine, vigorous sorts, 
bear large berries, medium in season. They seem to have 
passed through the past winter with less damage than any 
other sorts. We are much pleased with their vigor, hardiness, 
productiveness, and shipping qualities. The Nemaha is 
the finest late sort, much hardier than the Gregg. The ber- </seg>

RASPBERRIES AND BLACKBERRIES. 

ries of the Nemaha and Gregg are almost identical in season, 
size, and color. They are the best shippers we have. 
Shaffer's Colossal, a large red cap, grows vigorously, but 
usually winter-kills to the ground. It produces a good 
many berries on the new growth. Ever-bearing sorts are 
generally" not of much value as ever-bearers. They do not 
bear enough berries after the main crop to pay for the picking. 
There are many new sorts being introduced, some of 
which will likely be of value. 

ff the red sorts the Loudon is a very promising one. It 
not sucker so much as other red sorts. The berries are 
large and hold out a long time. It has so far proven as 
ly as any. The Cuthbert, Turner, and Miller are reliable 
sorts, and about equally hardy ami productive. They 
:er abundantly, and unless controlled, it is useless to 
t them. Red raspberries and blackberries should never 
lanted in an orchard. 

i blackberries. — We have found the Snyder the hardiest 
ugh in a commercial way blackberries have not been very 
Stable with us, we have nearly every season had enough 
family use. Extreme cold will kill the hardiest sorts, but 
ould not be difficult to bend over and cover enough to supa 
family, and thus be sure of a crop. There are other 
s than the Snyder worthy of trial, such as Stones Hardy, 
stern Triumph, Ancient Britton, Early Harvest, etc. 

It is claimed by parties at La Porte, Ind., the home of the 
original Snyder blackberry, that it never winterkills there 
and has stood 42 degrees below zero uninjured. It is also 
claimed that most of our so-called Snyder are spurious, having 
been propagated from wild plants obtained anywhere. 

Propagation of Blackberries. — The blackberry is propagated 
by suckers or by root cuttings. If suckers are used, 
they should be dug out deep enough to get part of the cross 
root from which the sprout has started. If propagated from 
root cuttings, take the roots of two or three year old plants 
in the fall ; those about the size of a pencil will do ; cut them </seg>

with a sharp knife into pieces about three inches long and 
pack them away in sand in a cool cellar till spring. Plant 
them in the spring about two or three inches deep, three 
inches apart in the rows, and the rows three or four feet 
iipart. These plants can be taken up in the fall or the next 
spring and planted where wanted. 

Iewberriks. — The dewberry is a safe sort to plant and is 
ly protected in the winter by a covering of mulch, or 
ch and earth. The vines may be tied to stakes in the 
ng or supported by a trellis. It has no suckers, and is 
ly propagated by tips. It is a luscious fruit, and every 
t grower should have it. 

I'e can not at this time dwell on the packing and market - 
of those fruits. We have always found a better home 
ket for them than for other fruits. We have very few 
ases of raspberries and blackberries. Have very little 
in blackberry leaves. Anthrocknose appears some 
ngst black raspberries, and plants showing it by having 
II crumpled leaves should be destroyed. An application 
Bordeaux mixture is said to be beneficial. An applicaof 
lime dust when the dew is on is very beneficial for 
and insects. If that is not sufficient, use white helle! 
or Paris green. 

DISCUSSION. 

Mr. Barnard. — Have you tried mulching blackberries? 

Mr. Stevenson. — No, I have not. 

Mr. Barnard. — I have tried putting on about an inch and 
a half of straw, and I find it holds the moisture all summer 
through so the soil will ball in the hand, yet the blackberries 
burn in the hot sun. This proves to my mind that blackberries 
derive a good deal of strength from the air as well as 
the soil.

the blackberries burned. 

rR. Stevenson. — Blackberries will burn any year when 
thermometer goes to 100 degrees. 

I[r. Whitfobd. — I don't think there is any particular adtage 
in mulching unless it is for moisture. Straw reflects 
heat in such a way as to heat the ground without drying 
If I were going to mulch at all, my theory and practice 
e been to mulch with dirt. When it gets dry enough so I 
e to do it, I make a dust mulch. It nearly always rains 
ugh in the early part of the season so there is moisture 
ugh stored up in the subsoil to carry a crop through. This 
sture can be retained by surface cultivation, and I think a 
t blanket is the best mulch. 

I[r. Barnabd. — I proved last year that a straw mulch for 
kberries beats cultivation. Even if it does drive the roots 
lie surface, they are a short-livedUplant anyway, and you 
i to renew the plant after a while. There is an immense 
iunt of straw going to waste in our state that should be 
I in mulching blackberries. It keeps the weeds down, in 
so expensive, answers the purpose of cultivation, anjd on 
whole I have found it very satisfactory. 

Mr. Stevenson. — Does it keep the sprouts down? 

Mb. Barnard. — They don't come through it. I never get 
sprouts enough to start new canes; that is my experience. 

KR. Yolngers. — Does it pay commercially to grow blackies?

raking careful estimates, and next year I can tell just 
the crops pay. 

Mb. Whitfobd. — My rows are eight feet apart, and they are 
never so I can't get through them with the cultivator. I always 
have plenty of room to get through if the suckers are 
kept down, and I have no trouble in retaining moisture enough 
to save the berries unless the mercury goes to 100 degrees. If 
it goes to 100 degrees your berries will burn, I don't care 
whether wou have a straw mulch or a dirt mulch. 

Me. Christy. — Are your rows north and south or east and 
west? 

Mr. Whitford. — Both ways; and when it comes to that, 
I don't know, hardly, which way I would plant. 

IR. Christy. — There is a gentleman in our neighborhood 
has been experimenting wfth blackberries, and has been 
e successful. He plants his rows north and south, eigh: 
apart, and right next t &gt; the row of blackberries he plants 
w of corn, very thick. He plants it early, and now for the 
three or four years he has tried that, and a row of 
kberries next to a row of corn will yield double the 
r. About the time the berries commence to ripen the 
is up so it shades them, and I believe it beats a straw 

The President. — I have seen that tried on a plot of forty 
acres of raspberries and blackberries both, but this man has 
quit. I don't know what his reason was, but he quit after 
practicing it six or seven years. 

Mr. Christy. — Does he still raise blackberries? 

I'he President. — Yes ; but he quit planting corn lately. I 
1 give you one suggestion that we practice, and I like it 
t rate, that is, not to summer-prune your blackberries; 
t let them grow. Then in the winter or spring prune them 
vn to about three feet. In this way the new canes stand 
and shade the fruit, answering the same purpose as a hill 
corn. If these new canes are not summer-pruned they </seg>

will not draw any more moisture from the fruit than summer-pruned 
canes. 

!r. Barnard. — That is one of the things that this society 
reversed itself on. Ten or fifteen years ago probably 
y member advocated summer-pruning of blackberries; I 
t know of anybody growing blackberries now who is dothat; 
the pruning is all done in the winter or spring. The 
ition with me in regard to mulching was whether it was 
iper than cultivating. I figured it in favor of mulching 
.use I could do that in the winter when I was not very 
t. I should like to ask Mr. Stevenson how long he ali 
a patch of raspberries to stand without resetting? 

EB. Stevenson. — I have grown them eight years without 
tting. The Palmer and Tyler ought to be renewed every 
or six years. Some varieties, like Gregg and Older, will 
longer than that; I have run them eight years. 

The President. — That seems to be a good deal a matter of 
circumstance; our Gregg do not last as long as our Palmer. 
I presume in some places they will last longer than in 
others. 

Mr. Barnard. — Do you get as good results the sixth, seventh, 
or eighth years as you do the third? 

Mr. Stevenson. — No ; I find that the third or fourth years 
they seem to be the hardiest and bear the best. One or two 
year olds are not so reliable ; the third and fourth years they 
seem to be at their very best. </seg>

ORCHARDING IN CENTRAL NEBRASKA. 

By L. O. Williams, Kearney. 

I he student of horticulture who wishes to gain light on 
topic may do well to study the conditions under which 
present orchards found within this section have proved 
er a success or a failure. These object lessons present to 
mind both the possible and the impossible in orcharding, 
numerous fragments and wrecks of orchards found here 
there show the futility of planting trees at the hands of 
careless and indifferent. The planter who succeeds in 
enterprise must study the wants of his trees just as Careys 
as he would those of a fine blooded animal that he was 
ng for the show ring. Too many of our farmers in their 
itings have less of tree sense than they have of horse sense, 
ir orchards IK well enough planted, perhaps, and then 
to "grow up" as Topsy did. 

Io look for success from this kind of planting is much 
expecting figs of thistles. The successful orchardist in 
section must and will be a true student of Nature and 
horticultural laws. I am frequently asked by visitors at 
ranch, "Do you think this is a fruit country?" Mj anr 
is usually a negative one, implying that it is not a natfruit 
country. That it is possible to make fruit grow 
essfully, however, is beyond question to my mind. 

Last September I visited the orchard of William Nutter, 
limited fifteen miles east of Kearney, which has the reputation 
of being the most, if not the only, successful apple orchard 
in Buffalo county. This orchard, planted about twelve 
years ago, is on the bottom land of Wood river, and situated 
so close to this stream — which is only an ordinary creek — 
as to be overflowed by it at time of the heavy rains. Bfliag 
thus well watered, it has stood the drouths better than many 
neighboring orchards. Mr. Nutter supplements the work of 
the water by cultivation, plowing the orchard every fall or </seg>

spring, and using the harrow once or twice. For mid-summer 
he allows the weeds to grow, and lays great stress on the importance 
of this as a means of shading the ground. The cultivation 
is not so thorough as I should give it, and in place of 
the weeds as a cover crop, I would sow oats or peas. The 
trees are headed low and are well protected by natural windbreaks 
of box-elder. With the use of the pruning saw and 
knife in addition to the other improvements suggested, this 
might be made a model orchard. The location is very favorable. 
On hill lauds remote from water rights for irrigation, 
the question of withstanding drouths becomes somewhat perplexing. 
I believe this obstacle can be largely overcome by 
planting on the zone system, supported by thorough cultivation 
and mulching. 

I lose planting must be the rule, backed up by windtks 
in order to insure protection against our Nebraska 
is. Protection should be carefully attended to to pre; 
ravages of rabbits, the scalding of the sun, and the deying 
insects. I shall not attempt to give the details in 
paper for carrying out the principles above outlined, 
ly well the primary principles first, and gather up the 
ils as you work, would be my advice to the amateur ordist. 
To him who will work hand and heart with Nain

ik fire is better than oats because it gets the trees out of 
way so much quicker. 

Mr. Williams. — I thought I made that plain in my paper 
that these cover crops, as they call them, are only planted in 
the latter part of the season, at the time the trees are ripening.

the University. Professor Emerson gave us the res 
of his experiments with cover crops at Lincoln last winand 
while he didn't state positively which he recomided 
most highly, I gathered from the facts he gave us that 
1 peas and oats were about the best. Perhaps I should 
e given peas the preference in my paper. I certainly 
ik it is better to raise them than weeds. I was in an orrd 
last fall that was so grown up with rag weed that you 
Id hardly drive through it. They were allowed to grow

Mr. Stephens. — The gentleman's paper is entitled "Orcharding 
in Central Nebraska," but he is too modest to tell 
you that he is himself in charge of the largest cherry orchard 
in the State. I think perhaps the meeting would be interested 
in some account of the orchard under his care, the number 
of trees planted, and what they are doing. The largest 
orchard in the State is in the care of the gentleman who has 
just spoken to us. 

Mil Williams. — I did not design telling what we have been 
doing so much as what I had seen. Of course when you come 
to take up the cherry, that is a fruit that grows almost naturally 
in this state; it is grown throughout the State from 
one end to the other. In regard to our own orchard, I might 
¦ay that we have about 15,000 ; 5,500 cherry, 4,500 peach, 2,000 
each of apple and plum, and some pear trees. We have a 
solid block of 5,500cherry trees planted a year ago last spring, 
and they are making a grand showing at the present time. 
We got rather a poor stand of some varieties, but they have 
made an excellent growth and done remarkably well. I consider 
the Montmorency the most successful in orchard. It 
makes the best stand by far of those planted a year ago, and 
it takes right hold and gets there from the start. The later 
varieties made the poorest stand, and are somewhat more 
tardy about coming into bearing. Of the plum trees planted 

year ago, I think it is safe to say that half of them show a </seg>

rTHER DISCUSSION OF THE NATURAL SPREADING 
OF TIMBER AREAS. 

By Charles E. Bessey. 

SPREADING OF PINE FORESTS. 

Since my last report upon this subject, made last winter, I 
have had the opportunity of observing personally a number 
of cases of the natural spreading of timber areas. In a journey 
through northwestern Nebraska I observed with much interest 
that in many places the native pines had spread out 
from the original timber areas, as indicated by the growth of 
small trees. This was particularly noticeable where the Burlington 
railway had cut off the original sweep of prairie fires, 
thus permitting the seedlings to grow unmolested. In many 
places on Pine Ridge the little trees have pushed out from two 
to six or eight rods from the original line of the forest area. 
I am confident that within twenty years, if these spreading 
ureas are protected, the timber line will have advanced from </seg>

264 

NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

In passing through the pine region bordering on the Burlington 
railway west of the Black Hills in northeastern 
Wyoming, I observed the same rapid spreading of the timber 
areas. Here there were in some cases veritable thickets of 
young pine trees which extended the timber area for many 
rods beyond its original line. The general northwesterly direction 
of the railroad cuts at right angles what I take to 
have been the usual direction of the prairie fires from the 
southwest, so that on the northeasterly side of the railway 
these spreading areas or pines were observed. In a small 
number of cases I noted that the pines were spreading (but I 
thought not so rapidly or vigorously) on the southwesterly 
side of the railway. It is probable that in these cases there 
were local conditions which prevented the prairie fires from 
Bweeping over the areas as formerly. 

SPREADING OF DECIDUOUS FORESTS. 

In a paper prepared for the U. S. Division of Forestry last 
winter I speak as follows of the spread of the eastern forests : 

"The deciduous forests of the eastern portion of the State 
are now enlarging their areas wherever man is not actively 
engaged in destroying them. Left to themselves the forest 
areas of elm, ash, oak, hickory, walnut, etc., are spreading 
with a rate so rapid that it has attracted the attention of 
many observers." 

I may add to this statement that wherever I have traveled 
lie State since the presentation of my last paper, I have 
id additional proof of the truth of the statement just 
e. I have the utmost confidence that the timber area-; 
much larger where they have been protected than they 
» twenty or thirty years ago. 

tthis connection I may quote from a private letter 
:en to me by Professor Blankinship, of the Montana State 
&gt;ge of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts. In a convereawith 
him on this subject in June he spoke of having ob¦d 
the same thing in southern Missouri. I requested him </seg>

265 

THE NATURAL SPREADING OF TIMBER AREAS. 

I make the statement in writing, which he did in a letter 
itten in the latter part of June. The professor first speaks 
some observations he made in southern Wisconsin, where 
noted that the forests were enlarging their areas. He 
¦n speaks of southern Missouri as follows : 

"Of southern Missouri I can speak with more certainty, 
for the early part of my life was spent in that region. The 
line between forest and prairie runs from the southwestern 
corner of that state, northeastward to the Mississippi somewhat 
north of St. Louis. Greene county is on that line, and it 
was there that I studied the subject, and the fact of forest 
&lt;'x tension is very evident. This county is about half prairie, 
and these prairies are now confined to the higher uplands of 
that region, the timber apparently having followed up the 
water-courses and united in the broken ground at their heads, 
leaving the prairies as mere islands in the on-coming forest ; 
westward the prairies are larger, and we pass in about thirty 
miles from the unbroken forest to the plains with streams 
scantily forest clad. From the united evidence of the old 
settlers, I found that the timber had encroached on these 
prairie islands about one mile in the last fifty years, and 
that, too, despite the fact that it was being constantly cut for 
log houses and particularly for fencing purposes and firewood. 
The timber is margined with thickets of Rhus glabra, 
R. copallina, Corylus americana, Symphoricarpos vulgaria, 
Rubux rilloxus, R. occidentalis, Rosa seiigera, which are followed 
by Pmnus americana, Sassafras oflicinale, Gleditschia 
tr'uuanthos, Crataegus coccinea, C. tomentosa, C. punctata, 
C. crus-galli, and these are succeeded by the true forest trees 
of the oak, hickory, walnut, etc. The shrubs and trees mentioned 
are the forest harbingers and prepare the way by securing 
the necessary conditions of shade and moisture for the 
germination and growth of the permanent species. The existence 
of these harbinger trees (Gleditschia, Crataegus, Sassafras, 
etcj in forest glades are often indications of prairies </seg>

NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

"In extreme southern Missouri, in the counties of Stone, 
Taney, Ozark, Howell, and Orgeon, in the broken country of 
the Ozark mountains, the whole country is forest, but peculiar 
in that the underbrush is almost wholly absent, there 
being a scattered growth of oak and hickory over the grass 
covered hillsides, the hilltops usually being bare and locally 
denominated 'bald-knobs.' Practically the same conditions 
prevail on the edge of the forest area in the Cherokee Nation 
and parts of eastern Oklahoma, the knobs being absent, 
and here certainly due to the very recent growth of the forest, 
for few large trees are found except in the bottoms. The 
old 'settlers' in southern Missouri say that the Indians in an 
early day reported that the forest was of recent growth and 
that they had chased the buffalo over all that region." 

IS INCREASED RAINFALL THE CAUSE? 

If we take up the question of the cause or causes concerned 
with this very evident increase in the timber areas, we are 
face to face with a very difficult problem. It has been held 
by some observers that the principal cause is the increased 
rainfall upon the prairies and the plains. In the paper from 
which I have quoted, Professor Blankinship is quite positive 
that the increase in the forest areas is to be accounted for by 
a gradual increase in the rainfall, and he makes an argument 
to show that this is the case. In Nebraska, however, we 
have learned that the supposed increased rainfall is an error. 
It is true that fifteen or twenty years ago we had publications 
which seemed to be quite authoritative, in which the 
supposed increased rainfall was discussed, and there were 
maps drawn even to show how, year after year, the rain belt 
moved westward. As you are aware, Professor Swezey has 
entirely overthrown this theory. His careful studies of the 
rainfall through long periods of time show that, while there 
are short periods during which there is an increase in the 
rainfall, there are other periods in which there is a corresponding 
decrease. It is his opinion that there is no ground </seg>

            <seg id="p269">
267 

THE NATURAL SPREADING OF TIMBER AREAS. 

I the present time for the belief that the rainfall in Neska 
has increased during the period of its settlement, 
jre can be no question but that we must throw out of the 
i-ussion the theory that an increased rainfall has brought 
•ut this increase in the forest areas. 

IS CHANGE OF TEMPERATURE A CAUSE? 

It is sometimes said that other climatic changes than those 
directly connected with the rainfall have had to do with this 
increase in the timber areas. We hear the statement made 
that the climate is slowly changing, even where the increase in 
rainfall is not insisted upon. Now the climate of a country 
includes a number of factors. Moisture is one of the most 
important of these. Next to this perhaps may be placed temperature, 
and then wind, light, etc. With respect to these 
factors we have no indication whatever from a careful study 
of meteorological data that there has been any permanent 
change in the temperature of the prairie and plains region. 
Our climate is neither growing hotter nor colder. Here again 
we find that we may have a series of years in which the temperature 
is increased and then a series in which it is decreased, 
but no permanent change has been observed either 
in the way of an increase or decrease in the temperature 

IS LESSENED WIND A CAUSE? 

IVith respect to the winds, this only can be said, that as the 
iund is more and more covered with tall growing vegetan, 
such as tall shrubs and trees, we notice the movements 
the air less and less. It is a fact that if we pass into the 
ata of air above the tree tops there is about as much wind 
ei wooded country as in one where there are no trees. The 
ference is that we live upon the ground, and we judge of 
i amount of wind by what we feel ourselves. So it must 
said that as there are more trees there will be less wind 
it we feel. I doubt very much whether there is any other 
inection than this between the forest areas and the wind. </seg>

            <seg id="p270">
268 

NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

Ebt whether there is any possibility of showing that winds 
decreased and that as a consequence the trees have injd. 
It is rather the opposite; that as the trees have in?d 
they have deflected the air currents upward so that 
el them less and less. 

EFFECT OF LIGHT. 

I 'he only remaining climatic factor which needs attention 
he present time is that of light. Vegetation is dependent 
m light. Without it there is no vegetation. Total darks 
is fatal to ordinary vegetation. On the other hand it is 
ad that too great light is also deleterious. In the language 
he botanists, too intense insolation retards the growth of 
kinds of plants, and as a consequence a lessening of this 
reme insolation would tend to increase vegetation. Here 
in I fail to see that there has been any change which 
;ht account for the extension of the tree growth. 

EFFECT OF REMOVAL OF WILD ANIMALS. 

Coming to matters which are of much more local importance, 
the inquiry may be made as to whether the disappearance 
of the wild animals which formerly roamed over the 
plains and prairies has had any effect upon the timber areas. 
It is certain that the buffaloes, deer, elk, and other herbivorous 
animals must have more or less affected the voting 
timber areas, and yet when we compare the wild animals of 
this kind with the stock which man has brought in since, we 
are compelled to say that the former could have had verv 
little effect upon the timber as compared with the latter. It 
is unlikely that the disappearance of the wild animals has had 
sufficient effect upon the timber areas to be worthy of consid- 

EFFECT OF ADJACENT TILLAGE. 

It has sometimes been said that probably the tillage of the 
adioining fields has had a beneficial effect upon the timber </seg>

            <seg id="p271">
THE NATURAL SPREADING OK TIMBER AREAS. 

269 

areas. I think there is something to be said in favor of this 
suggestion. Here and there, without question, the tilled fields 
affect beneficially the surrounding until led ground. This is 
especially the case where the tilled fields He upon higher 
lands than the adjoining timber areas, and it will be noted 
that this is usually the case. The wash from the tilled ground 
will carry over upon the untilled areas rich materials along 
with the thin layer of actual soil, and so better conditions 
will be made for the springing up of the young seedlings. I 
am inclined to give considerable weight to the suggestion that 
we have here one of the factors aiding in the increase of the 
timber areas, and yet I have seen in many places in the State 
the spreading of the timber areas miles and miles away from 
any possible influence from the tilled fields. It is only here 
and there that this can be admitted as a factor in the problem 
under consideration. 

EFFECT OF STOPPAGE OF PRAIRIE FIRES. 

When we look over the whole field we find that there is, 
however, one factor which is efficient ; namely, that of prairie 
fires. Originally the plains and prairies were swept annually 
with fires which burned down to the ground every living 
thing. These fires coming every year made it impossible for 
the tiny seedlings to live. They had not yet gained sufficient 
strength in their roots to be able to send up shoots 
again and again from the uninjured underground portions. 
There can be no question as to the effect of prairie fires upon 
the seedling trees. Wherever the fires sweep over every 
seedling is destroyed. Since man has taken possession of the 
open lands he has restricted more and more the sweep of the 
fires, and here we have for the first time an efficient cause 
which enables us to understand how it is, and why it is, that 
the timber areas of the open country are spreading. As long 
as the fires swept up to the timber areas the latter could do no 
more than merely hold their own, but now with the disappearance 
of the fires the seedlings are able to live until they </seg>

are themselves great trees forming additional belts to the 
original timber areas. 

HOW THE PINES SPREAD. 

When we make the inquiry as to exactly how the timber 
areas are spread we find that there is some difference between 
the pines and the deciduous trees. Thus in the case of 
the pines, the seeds are scattered by the winds, being aided 
in this by the wings attached to the seeds. Apparently the 
seeds are scattered for considerable distances in the direction 
of the prevailing winds. Those which fall upon favorable 
spots spring up and become the little seedlings mentioned 
above. In the extension of the pine forests the pine trees 
alone seem to be concerned. There are no shrubs or weed 
to form a cover in which the little plants start up. I hav 
seen many places where the pine seedlings were springing 
out of the sparse sod, surrounded by the ordinary prairi 
grasses. I observe that where the sod had been cut, as in th 
removal of the ground for railroad building, the pines spring 
up more abundantly, but I have seen very dense thickets of 
pine seedlings where the sod had not been disturbed at alL 

HOW DECIDUOUS TREES SPREAD. 

In the case of the deciduous forests where they are spreading 
we observe that there is always a fringe of weeds and 
shrubs, and that in this fringe the seedling trees appear. The 
weeds are the common wild weeds of the neighborhood. Thus 
in regions where sunflowers are abundant these will be found ; 
also the taller growing goldenrods, asters, rag weeds, etc. 
Here we have a hint that weeds are not always harmful, as 
in these cases they certainly do serve to cover the ground in 
such a way that the more permanent vegetation is able to 
come in after them. Mingled with the weeds there are always 
shrubs. At first these are small and inconspicuous, 
but later they occupy the ground almost to the exclusion of

weedy belt is furthest away from the timber, while nearest 
to the timber is a belt in which the shrubs predominate and 
where the weeds are of less importance. The shrubs to be 
found in these fringing belts are wild roses, wild plum, in 
some places dogwood and wolfberry (SymphoricarposJ, hawthorn, 
on low land elderberry, etc. 

THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE. 

In this fringe of weeds and shrubs the seedling trees start 
up. Of course a large percentage of these perish. Many of 
them are smothered by the too rampant growth of weeds and 
shrubs, but here and there a little tree persists, and finally 
overtops the other growth; and from this time forward the 
tree predominates. There is a fierce struggle for existence in 
these fringing belts about the advancing forests, and it is 
only because of the immense fecundity of the trees that their 
offspring are able to survive in the struggle. We rarely think 
of the large number of seeds produced by even an ordinary 
sized tree. I recently made a calculation as to the number of 
seeds produced by an elm upon my place in the city of Lincoln. 
The tree is about thirty feet in height, with spreading, 
well balanced, and rounded top of about twenty-five feet in 
diameter. Every year this tree produces heavy crops of seeds, 
and my calculations show that a minimum estimate is one 
million seeds for this tree. I am confident that my estimate 
is too low rather than too high. Now let us stop for a moment 
and see what this implies. One million seeds, if scattered 
over an area in such a way as to have one seed for each 
square foot, would cover somewhat more than twenty-three 
acres of ground. If these seeds were all to grow, it would 
not be long before a great part of them would have to perish 
on account of their interference with one another. I am cer 
tain that my elm tree produces seeds enough so that, if they 
were properly planted and cared for, they would produce a 
forest of from ten to twelve thousand acres each season. Of 
course it is never possible for all the seeds to grow into large </seg>

trees; and it would not be possible even if the seeds were 
properly distributed at the first. What actually happens is 
this : the seeds are scattered within an area of probably not 
more than one-sixth of an acre, or, My, a circle of about fifty 
feet radius with the tree in the center. A million seeds 
scattered over this small area would equal one to each square 
inch. Before the end of the first season these little seedlings 
so closely packed crowd one another so that many of them 
must die. I suppose that out of a million seeds not more than 
one-tenth of one per cent succeed in growing into young 
trees under natural conditions; and yet it is in this war, 
by the lavish use of the seeds which are produced by nature, 
th;it the forest areas are extended. These seeds fall upon the 
loose soil covered with leaf Mould in the fringing belt of the 
weeds and shrubs about the timber, and here some of them 
spring up and eventually become trees. These when growu 
become centers for the distribution of more seeds and the formation 
of more seedlings; and so the growth goes on, and 
in this way the forests are extended. 

RENOVATING AN OLD ORCHARD. 

Trying to bring back to a paying basis an old orchard which 
has been sadly neglected for a term of years is not quite 
such an easy task as any one who has not tried it might be 
led to suppose. For most of the ills which beset our body 
"horticulture" we have a well tried, and, in most cases, a reasonably 
sure remedy. 

I he Codling-Moth can be overcome and its ravages reed 
to a minimum by a careful, and, in rainy weather, an 
ost constant use of arsenic sprays. If we are sly enough 
can slip up to a grape vine and "make life a burden" to 
little leaf hoppers by giving them a shower bath of kero-

sene emulsion ; but when we try to revive an old orchard we 
find that we are up against the "real thing" and the only remedy 
which, to my knowledge, has accomplished any degree of 
success is plenty of elbow grease mixed with a strong solution 
of horse power. Even then it sometimes fails to accomplish 
the desired end and leaves a large balance on the wrong side 
of the ledger. 

Last summer, while working as foreman of the Pomono orchards, 
we tried to reclaim some fifty acres of the Grand 
View Park orchard, which for seven or eight years had received 
no care and but little attention. The bottoms of the 
trees were surrounded by a mass of seedling root sprouts. 
and from the body of the trees long water sprouts had grown 
until in some cases they had reached a height as great as 
that of the trees themselves, while dead and broken limbs 
marred the general beauty of the orchard, as well as handicapped 
the growth of the trees. The ground was hard and, 
in many places, beginning to sod, which, for the past few 
years, had prevented the trees from receiving proper nourishment, 
and as a natural consequence they were lacking in 

As early in the spring as the frost was out of the ground to 
a sufficient depth so that we could get at the roots we started 
on our mission of mercy, armed with a common carpenter's 
footadz with which we cut the sprouts off as near as possible 
where they started from the roots, after which the dirt was 
placed back to prevent the scars from drying, in which case 
the wound would not readily heal. With a saw and pruning 
shears we cut off all water sprouts that were dead or broken 
and all . unnecessary limbs, painting the wound where the 
limbs had been removed with thick common barn paint, to 
which a small amount of white lead had been added to make 
it more durable. 

Eht here I hope you will pardon me if I take the liberty 
phasize the necessity of painting the scars, caused by 
g off limbs to prevent decay, to preserve the wood until

the tree has time to cover them with a growth of new wood. 
I have seen many trees from which large limbs had been cut 
and nothing applied to preserve the wood. After a few years 
a great hole had rotted into the tree, making a fit dwelling 
place for bats and all manner of unclean birds. I always 
make it a point to paint all knots over one-half inch in diameter, 
which may be reducing the thing to too fine a point ; but 
at the same time I believe it is better to paint all knots, both 
large and small, than not to paint them at all. 

ijet us return to the orchard. After the trimming was 
ie and the brush hauled out, we yet had the soddy ground 
our hands, which we proceeded to pulverize with a disc, 
I, after crossing and recrossing a few times, had things in 
airly presentable condition as far as general appearance 
i concerned. 

I low can we expect an orchard to grow, bear fruit, and 
ive if we do not keep the soil in proper condition? The 
and the air are the storehouses from which a tree gets 
substance; and as we in this country have no trouble in 
giving an abundance and ever changing supply of air, we 
e more time to devote to the preparation of the soil in 
h a way that it will absorb and retain the moisture so that 
rill be available when most needed. Experiments have 
ven this to such an extent that we nearly all agree that the 
t way to do this is by shallow cultivation, and the best 
I for the purpose, a disc. 

I have seen orchards which have gone beyond recall, where 
iy of the trees would not make good firewood. In such 
Be the only way in which it could be renewed would be 
lanting a new one in its place. Then, again, many of the 
11 orchards which were planted in this state ten or fifteen 
•s ago are of trees which do not adapt themselves to our 
iliar climate. In trying to bring such an orchard into a 
ng condition would be but a reenacting of the old experit 
of making a silk purse out of a pig's ear or a whistle 
of his t"'!. </seg>

            <seg id="p277">
RENOVATING AN OLD ORCHARD. 

275 

As I write I have in mind a small orchard near Lincoln, 
the owner of which took me out to see his orchard and desired 
that I should express my opinion upon the same. As we drove 
along the pleasant country road he poured into my sympathetic 
ear a tale of woe. Upon our arrival at his place the 
first thing to attract my attention was a solid blue grass sod 
which looked as though it would turn water like a shingled 
roof. All of his trees were strangers to me except the cherries, 
which were May Duke. He informed me that all his 
trees had been brought from a nursery near his old home 
away back in York state. He had horse shoes hanging in the 
crotches of all the trees, all or partly covered by the growth 
of the tree. That was not the only means which he had employed 
to furnish his trees with what he considered a sufficient 
amount of iron which was lacking in the soil. He 
said that he had driven a tomato can full of old nails and 
spikes into every tree on the place, and not a one of 
them had borne fruit enough to make a pie, even though they 
were fifteen years old. 

How many orchards are there in the State which need 
renovating? This would be a hard question to answer. I am 
sure there are plenty of them in Lancaster county, and, no 
doubt, every county in the fruit growing district of our state 
would experience no difficulty in furnishing its quota. How 
does it come that we have so many orchards in such a deplorable 
condition? Many people planted orchards of untried 
and unhardy varieties, and after taking care of them for a 
long time and getting no returns from them, await a favorable 
opportunity to have the boys grub them out. Others 
planted well recommended varieties, working hard to take 
care of them, lured on by dreams of how the little orchard and 
vine-clad cottage of the Nebraska horticulturist was soon to 
become as fair and as fertile as the far famed valley of the 
Nile. But other things gradually drew on their time and attention 
until now we are confronted by the question, "How 
shall we renovate the old orchard"? Oh! What must I do </seg>

rEK VARIETIES OF PEACHES ADAPTED TO 
NEBRASKA. 

L. M. Rumsll. Wymore. 

The past few years — especially the years 1898 and 1899, 
being such a hard winter — more fruit trees were killed out 
than in the last fifty years. Not only orchard trees, but nursery 
stock. So far as I know it would be a little hard to 
bring up any new varieties of peaches since that time. We 
had a great many new varieties planted, but they killed out 
the same as the others. There is one new variety that has 
been more widely advertised than any other that I know of, 
and perhaps more misrepresented than any other, and that is 
the Triumph. It is represented as being a very early freestone, 
ripening with the Alexander. I was out with Mr. 
Brown awhile ago to their orchard and he showed me some 
of these peaches. There is not one ripe here yet, and in place 1 
of being a freestone they are as tight on the pit as the bark 
on a tree in January. The Alexander is just in its last 
stage now. We began picking Alexander on the 10th or 12tli 
of July, and have begun picking as early as the 3d of July 
for market. 

There is not so much difference in the hardiness of peach 
s as some seem to think. Some varieties that are hardy 
in fruit bud are tender in wood; others that are hardy in 
wood are tender in fruit bud, so take it all around there is 
not so much difference. There were two classes of trees that 
killed out badly in the winter of '98-99. One was the young 
trees in orchards that had been well cultivated and grew late </seg>

in the fall ; these trees killed out badly. Also old trees that 
bore a heavy crop of fruit in the summer of '98. While a 
good many of these latter went through the winter and had 
life enough to start in the spring of '99, yet their vitality had 
been so reduced that a great many of them died last winter. 

I don't know that I have anything to add to the general 
that we have been giving for the last eight or nine years. 
e this peach known as the Wright Seedling; it is one of 
very hardiest of peaches, and almost invariably repro;s 
from seed. A good many claim it is the same as the 
ey. However that may be, it is a good peach. The worst 
t that can be found with it is the fact that it is a seedling 
ripens at the time when all the other seedlings are ripe 
the market is glutted with fruit. That is the great adage 
of having budded peaches; you can commence early 
uly and have a continual succession of ripe fruit for 
e months. 

I might speak of the new seedlings that we have been test- 
Out of a large number of seedlings we have two that we 
Lk are going to prove quite valuable. These are Russ 
No. 1 and No. 3. The No. 1 stood through better than 
other variety of peach we have. This year in the young 
lard it has twice or three times as much fruit on it as any 
;r tree of the same age that went through the hard winter 
)8-99. Youngers &amp; Co. have a few of the trees ; they got 
first trees that were sent out from our place. They have 
a fruiting this year, though they suffered from the hard 
ter of '98-99 the same as others. 

Coming down to other varieties, there is the Champion 
that is widely known and is a good peach, far ahead of the 
Triumph. It is a freestone, a good bearer, a large peach, and 
a good seller. Then the Crosby is another that is widely 
known and advertised. It is a yellow peach and is doing well 
this year. In fact, all of the yellow peaches are looking 
better this year than I have ever known them at this time of 
the year. The Elberta is one. When we first planted it we </seg>

didn't think so much of it as we do now. It didn't come into 
bearing quite as early as some other varieties, but when it di.l 
it gave excellent crops of fine peaches, and it markets well. 
It bore a heavy crop just before the hard winter, and most 
of the trees died. We will have enough for a sample this 
year and that is about all. 

Question. — How do you like the Crawfords? 

fR. Russell. — We planted about a thousand trees of them 
teen or twenty years ago, and we have never sold peaches 
lgh to pay the interest on the investment. The wood is 
ectly hardy ; they made a good growth and stood right up, 
they didn't fruit; they are tender in fruit bud. 

Mr. Harrison. — What are four or five of the best kinds? 

Mr. Russell. — That would be owing to the season ; whether 
you want medium, early, or late. I would prefer to commence 
early and continue on through the season, and in that 
case you would have to take more than four or five kinds; 
probably eight or ten. Commencing with the Alexander as 
the earliest, next the Early Rivers, then Hale's Early, which 
is a little more inclined to be a freestone. The next to ripen 
is Russell's No. 1, which is a freestone, with Champion following 
close. Cooledge Favorite is some years a pretty good 
peach, but we do not recommend it as highly as heretofore. 
It is more liable not to get up to size. The trees will look well 
and bear full, but the peaches are apt to be small. Then the 
Elberta comes in, which is a nice yellow peach, then Hill's 
Chili, and for a late peach, the Salway is about the best we 
have in this country. It is a very fine peach, a large, light 
yellow freestone. 

The President. — Did you mention the Wright? 

Mr. Russell. — No, sir, but that should be included in this 

Mr. Murpht. — Have you a better locality for growing 
peaches than we have here? 

Mr. Russell. — No, sir; I don't think we have. We have 
an orchard at Lincoln. Of course, that one is young yet, but </seg>

Pnto bearing this year. We have watched that 
Dumber of years, and we noticed that whenever 
as at Wymore, people in the vicinity of Lincoln 
of the same kind had peaches. Take it as far 
ok and out on that line; when we have peachei

Mr. Williams. — How late in the fall do you cultivate? 

Mh. Russell. — We do not usually aim to run later than the 
middle of July; we did not cultivate quite that late this year, 
as the peaches began to ripen and bend the limbs down so it 
was difficult to get through. We gave the orchard exceptionally 
good cultivation up until that time, but do not expect 
to cultivate any more this year. 

Mr. Galbraith. — Have you fruited the Smock? 

E. Russell. — Yes, sir ; that is a good peach, but does not 
enough to be profitable in this country; it is a little 
r in the bud. 

FEUIT PACKAGES. 

O. YOUNKERMAN, COUNCIL BLUFFS, IA. 

The growing of fruit and getting it into market in proper 
shape are two different things. Any person who is willing to 
plant and take a reasonable degree of care of it can grow 
fruit, but getting it to market in a proper condition and a 
package that will make it salable and at the same time profitable 
is what you want. 

Some people dispose of their fruit for a mere song, simply 
because they do not put it in neat and attractive packages. 
They should be taught different. All fruit packages should 
be well made. Crates properly nailed, and handles put on 
baskets in a substantial manner. We all know that fruit 
packages, as well as others, sometimes receive rough treatment 
at the hands of expressmen who are always in a hurry, </seg>

            <seg id="p282">
280 


t either by spilling or some other way the boxes or baskets 
i received by the consignee are not nearly as well filled as 
should be, and not from any fault perhaps of the shipexcept 
that he failed to put in a few extra nails. 

I lot very many years ago we picked all our fruit in tin 
s, baskets, etc., and berries were measured out and sold 
the quart. But improved packages were brought into 
until we got the Leslie box and crate to match, and as 
nothing better has been made. The Leslie box is % strong, 
ly made, well ventilated, and for strawberries, rasplxi, 
blackberries, currants, and gooseberries this box has not 
1 surpassed, while the proper package for red rasplwi Tics 
le Leslie pint box, with crate to match. 

For marketing cherries and plums there is nothing better 
than the 8-lb. basket; except perhaps for some of the very 
early varieties the Leslie quart box can be used to good advantage 
to both shipper and retailer. 

In preparing grapes for the market too much care can not 
be taken. While being packed they should be handled carefully 
so as not to remove the bloom. Also in covering if you 
are not very particular you will bruise them, and if not prop 
erly cooled off they will soon sour. The grape crop is, I think, 
handled to the best advantage in 8-lb. baskets. This size has 
been adopted by the Council Bluffs Grape Growers' Shipping 
Association and gives the best satisfaction. For very early 
or choice varieties of grapes, such as the Delaware, Niagara. 
Agawam, Champion, etc., the 4-lb. basket may be used to good 
advantage. Too much stress can not be laid on careful picking. 
Careful pickers can do very much toward getting the 
highest market price for fruit. If imperfect and partly decayed 
berries or cherries are put in the box or basket, it ne&lt;&lt;!&gt; 
only a few to spoil the whole lot. There has been a good deal 
of inquiry for something better to market early apples. The 
peach basket, four to a crate, is too small, and as yet we have 
nothing better than a one-third bushel box, or sixteen-quart 
Hallock crate, or the 24-qt. Leslie crate, although the latter 
is hardly strong enough for apples. </seg>

The later varieties of apples are best shipped in well venti 
lated barrels containing about eleven pecks or three bushels. 
For the shipment of Gem melon, or any small variety of musk 
melon, the 20-Ib. Climax basket with raised cover does vrry 
well. For larger ones, crates are the proper thing. For 
shipping tomatoes, 1-3 bu. crates would be a good sired 
package, and for home markets the 1-3 bu. Diamond market 
basket is found to be most convenient
