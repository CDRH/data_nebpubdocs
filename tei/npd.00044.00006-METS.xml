            <seg id="p003">EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CHIEF DEPUTY FIRE COMMISSIONER Office of State Fire Commissioner, State Capitol, Lincoln, Nebraska. To His Excellency, Keith Neville, Governor of the State of Nebraska: Dear Sir : In compliance with the Fire Commission Law of Nebraska we herewith submit to you the Eighth Annual Report of this Department. During the past year this Department has used every effort to reduce the fire loss of Nebraska to the minimum, and we be - lieve that with each year the effectiveness of the Fire Commis - sion Law is more pronounced and its merit and worth more forcibly felt by the citizens of the State. The gradual co-oper - ation which is manifested from year to year is noticeable to a remarkable degree. The seriousness of the country's situation at the present time is probably one reason that during the past year we have received more hearty co-operation from the public than ever before. The necessity of conserving from destruction by fire our food, grain and all necessities of life has interested the country as a whole, so that as never before, our citizenship is ripe to receive lessons in Fire Prevention and Fire Protection that cannot help but produce permanent and beneficial results. The present war has already done and will continue to do more toward curtailing "American Extravagance" than years of teaching and preaching could possibly have done. Ours was a country of prosperity and plenty and it was almost impossible to teach or impress upon our comfortable people the importance of conserving our resources from a prolific destruction by fire. "Insurance" seemed to solve the whole "Fire" situation. Busi - ness men, from the smallest up to the largest, rested easy and unworried in the fact that their property was insured and there- </seg>
            <seg id="p004">6 STATE FIRE COMMISSION fore they had nothing to fear from "fire." Now with our scarcity of food, lumber, grain and all the necessities of life, it is dawning upon our people that Insurance money cannot RE - PLACE that which has been destroyed by fire, it cannot bring back to its material form that which has been reduced to a heap of ashes. Insurance reimburses with money the cash value of what has been destroyed but if there is a scarcity of the commodity destroyed dollars cannot purchase or create it and now when we are facing a scarcity of grain and food people will realize that our citizens or soldiers cannot eat money and the only and sensible course to pursue is to conserve and save from destruction by fire that which we have. Of a certainty this lesson in conservation is being taught us now in a way that will so popularize the science of Fire Prevention that this coun - try will never again lapse back into its lax methods and habits regarding America's great and unnecessary Fire Waste. Our own careless, negligent, extravagant fire losses are suffi - cient to cause us to use every preventive method to reduce them to the minimum, but if a more glaring and impressive object lesson is needed to prove the deadly destruction and irreparable devastation waged by fire we have but to look at what value as a weapon our enemy places upon it. If Germany could destroy by fire in this country our food, grain, mills, munitions and other necessary war and life sustaining necessities, with what could we wage war against her! And it is not alone the destruction of munitions and direct necessities of war that will undermine our wealth and power if we do not reduce our fire losses ; every dollar's worth of property destroyed is just that many dollars worth of wealth forever wiped out of existence. It. is irrecover - ably lost. President Wilson and Mr. Hoover have both repeatedly warned and pleaded with the nation to curtail our tremendous fire losses. President Wilson says "Preventable fire is more than a private misfortune. It is a public dereliction. At a time like this of emergency and of manifest necessity for the conservation of national resources, it is more than ever a matter of deep and pressing consequence that every means should be taken to pre - vent this evil." The President evidently had in mind not alone the munitions and direct necessities of the war but all waste by </seg>
            <seg id="p005">STATE FIRE COMMISSION 7 fire. He had in mind our annual fire loss of more than $250, - 000,000. and the extent to which the prosecution of the war would be interfered with by calling away from it the labor and materials represented by the even partial reconstruction and re - placing of over $250,000,000 worth of property. Naturally the seriousness of the handicap to our country through its enormous fire losses first impressed itself upon the Insurance Fraternity of the country, because Fire Insurance men, more than any other business or professional men, realized long ago the terrific drain upon our resources that our annual fire loss meant. Early last spring after the United States de - clared war upon Germany, The National Board of Fire Under - writers placed at the disposal of the Government its entire amount of detailed information regarding Fire Prevention and Fire Protection together with the individual services of the organized Fire Insurance Companies, and through the consent of these various companies their State and Special agents throughout the entire United States volunteered their services to the (iovernment for the inspection and safeguarding of prop - erty against fire. The Government through the National Coun - cil of Defense accepted this offer of service from these experi - enced men and thereby have received most valuable results. In Nebraska last June the National Board of Fire Under - writers organized and appointed its committee to carry on the conservation work in this State. The western committee of the National Board, headed by Walter H. Sage, of Chicago, as chairman ; James F. Joseph, Sec - retary, and F. S. Danforth, Charles R. Street, Charles LeRoy Hecox and John H. Carr, members of the committee, met in the Governor '8 office at Lincoln, Nebraska. At this meeting were present all the State Officials, The State Fire Marshal and the State Council of Defense. The committee of the National Board was assured by the officials present that they would at all times receive their willing and hearty co-operation and support. At a meeting of the Insurance men of the State, in Lincoln, a State Committee was organized with W. C. Lyle, as chairman, C. U. Hendrickson, Secretary and W. H. Ahmanson. E. S. Free - man, W. S. Harding, C. R. McCotter, C. G. Robertson, J. F. Zimmer, W. S. Ridgell, State Fire Marshal, members executive </seg>

This com - mittee has offices in the Bee Building and the following men of Nebraska have been made members of the association and received commissions as Deputy Fire Marshals. This commis - sion gives them the authority to enter and inspect all buildings throughout the State, and to issue orders for corrections and repairs that they deem necessary: P. K. Walsh, E. H.

Dudley, T. S. Charlton, C. E. Babcock, John F. Zimmer, E. G. White, H. M. Rose. These honorary inspectors, together with the regulaT paid inspectors of the Fire Commission Department have made a most thorough canvass of the State and there is scarcely a town of any size that they have not inspected during the past year. Practically every elevator throughout the State has been inspected this year. From January 1, until the time this com - mittee was thoroughly organized and the inspectors sent out on their tour of inspections, there were two elevator fires, one at Sterling, and one at Burchard, Nebraska, and a mill fire known as the Maney Mill at Omaha. This fire was one of the largest in the state during the year and was caused by a spark from a passing train or a defective electric wire. There has been no elevator fire which has caused any -great loss and there has only been one mill fire since these inspectors </seg>
            <seg id="p007">STATE FIRE COMMISSION 9 were put on the road. This mill was on old building situated at Broken Bow, and the owner was unable to get any insur - ance on this building, and the tenant only carried enough grain in this building to run him from one day to another. This De - partment has no way of telling how many fires have been pre - vented in elevators and mills, from May 1, 1917, but we be - lieve there has been a wonderful saving of food and provisions in the past eight months. This Department is indebted for the able manner in which this matter has been handled to W. C. Lyle, C. U. Hendrickson and C. B. McCotter and the rest of the executive committee. The men appointed by the executive committee to inspect the state, have with one or two exceptions, worked faithfully and completed their work in a thorough manner. There has been two or three instances in the state where we were compelled to threaten elevator and mill men, and we have also had to take the matter up with the State Council of Defense. The Council of Defense has been a great help to this Department in enforcing the orders of the inspectors in the past year. Manufacturers, business men, and citizens, generally through - out the State, have been most anxious and willing to receive suggestions and comply with orders and corrections, asked for by these inspectors. Never before have merchants and busi - ness men been so cautioned and instructed regarding fire haz - ards; carelessness to a great degree has been corrected and neg - ligence in providing ample fire protection has been brought to the attention of citizens in a manner that will surely bring good results. The cleaning up of premises, keeping buildings free from combustible materials, oily waste, excelsior and rubbish of all kinds will reduce losses to a marked degree. The installa - tion of fire extinguishers, water pails and buckets, the placing of reliable watchmen at buildings, all these prevention measures have been taken cognizance of during this past year as never before. Necessity compels and enforces conservation as nothing else will, and never before in the history of this generation has necessity so serious and widespread confronted u«. Not only a </seg>

FIRE CHIEFS MADE DEPUTY FIRE MARSHALS Besides these fire insurance men who have been made hon - orary members of our Department, we have also commissioned every fire chief throughout the State as a Deputy of this Depart - ment. As in past years the fire chiefs throughout the State have given us most valuable service and assistance and when re - quested to do so they have made particular and special inspec - tions of properties that would have necessitated the expenditure of a great deal of money in sending one of our paid men to look into matters which the fire chiefs have attended to locally for us. Without doubt the most valuable asset to the Fire Commission Department is the service rendered by local fire chiefs. Citizens in many cases do not realize the really valuable if not heroic work performed by the local fire Departments. The National Board of Fire Underwriters and the National Board of Defense, recognizes the valuable service rendered by the fire departments and they were anxious for their co-operation in this work of conservation. Under date of June 6, we sent the following let - ter to every fire chief throughout the State and this Department wishes to thank most heartily the Fire Departments of the State for their cordial response to our request. All our inspectors re - port most valuable assistance rendered by Fire Departments throughout the State. Lincoln, Nebr., June 6, 1917. To the Fire Chief: Dear Sir: A Committee representing the National Board of Fire Under - writers, with an endorsement from the National Board of De - fense, met with the State Officials and State Board of Defense of Nebraska on June 27, for the purpose of drafting plans to conserve the State's resources from destruction by fire. An executive committee of seven was appointed and it was decided to appoint one hundred special fire inspectors,- men </seg>
            <seg id="p009">STATE FIRE COMMISSION 11 who are experts along fire inspection lines, and give them a Commission from the Fire Commission Department, signed, by the Council of Defense and the Fire Marshal. These inspectors will call on you when visiting your town and we wish you would give them every assistance in your power. We want you, as an interested official, to call a special meeting of the fire department and request every fireman in your city to act in the capacity of a deputy fire marshal until the war is over. Request them to take special pains and inspect all places of business and report anything that may be wrong to you, and you in turn should report to this office as soon as possible unless you are able to have same corrected through your authority. If you have not received a commission from this Department let us know and we will deputize you as a Special Deputy Fire Marshal. Yours truly W. S. RIDGELL, State Fire Marshal. Fire chiefs as a whole have been prompt and thorough in sending in reports in their localities. As the people of the state become more familiar with the fire commission law its effective - ness increases and each year brings new benefits to both the Commission and the State. The Fire Commission Department wishes to extend to the Fire Departments throughout the State, its sincere gratitude for the hearty co-operation which the Fire Departments have always manifested towards this office. More than any other class of citizens, firemen assist us most directly and we trust we may in the future receive from them that serv - ice and assistance which will work for the good of the De - partment and the State. FIRE CHIEFS TO REPORT FIRES The promptness of fire chiefs in reporting fires to this of - fice assists us in our work of investigation and their interest in attending to many matters which we request has done much to make this department a success. While the Fire Commission </seg>
            <seg id="p010">STATE FIRE COMMISSION 12 Law provides a penalty if fire chiefs, or mayors, where the town has no fire department, do not report promptly to this depart - ment, every fire occurring in their city or village, yet in many cases these officials are not reporting fires to this office as the law provides. During the coming year we are going to insist upon mayors and fire chiefs complying with the law which is as follows: "Sec. 6011, Chapter XVII, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of Nebr. 1909. (Fires, Investigations, Records.) The State Fire Commissioner and the chief of the fire department of every city or village in which a fire department is established, and the mayor of every incorporated village or town in which no fire department exists, shall investigate, the cause, origin and cir - cumstances of eery fire occurring in such city or village and the sheriff of each county when requested by the property owner or anyone interested therein shall investigate the cause, origin and circumstances of every fire occurring in his county without the limits of any organized city or village therein, by which property has been destroyed or damaged and shall es - pecially make investigation as to whether such fire was the result of carelessness or design. Such investigation shall be be - gun within two days, not including Sunday after the occur - rence of such fire and the fire commissioner or his deputy shall have the right to supervise and direct such investigation when - ever he deems it expedient or necessary. The officer making investigation of fire occurring in cities, villages, towns or coun - ties shall forthwith notify said Fire Commissioner, and shall within one week of the occurrence of the fire, furnish to the said fire commissioner a written statement of all the facts re - lating to the fire and cause and origin of said fire and such other information as may be called for by the blanks provided by said fire commissioner. The state fire commissioner shall keep in his office a record of all fires which may be determined by the investigation provided by this act; such record shall at all times be open to the public inspection. " (Officers, Malfeasance.) Any officer referred to in Section Two herein, who neglects to comply with any of the require - ments of this set shall be punished by a fine of not less than Twenty-five Dollars, nor more than Two Hundred Dollars." </seg>
            <seg id="p011">STATE FIRE COMMISSION 13 Besides the fire chiefs who have been commissioned as special deputies, we have also issued commissions to the superintend - ents of the several railroad systems in this state, and wish to thank these officials for their interest and co-operation with the Fire Commission Department. The following railroad men are now acting as deputy fire marshals: Geo. Griggs, Burling - ton; Ed Bignell. Burlington; ('. 0. Congdon, Missouri Pacific; W. E. Merrifield, Missouri Pacific: Geo. O. Brophy, Union Pa - cific. THE GASOLINE HAZARD. We believe that practically all the merchants in the state keep their supply of gasoline buried in safe underground tanks. We are constantly watching the careless storing and handling of gasoline and we mean to make Nebraska as safe as possible from this dangerous explosive. While we believe that during the past seven years we have accomplished our purpose of having all the gasoline handled by the merchants in the state, buried in safe underground tanks, yet it seems impossible to compel the owners of automobiles to limit the supply of gasoline kept above ground in their garages to five gallons or less. It was rather a hard task to reach all the merchants, but it seemed almost impossible to reach all automobile owners. So complicated was the matter and so endless seemed the task that last August we issued a rul - ing to all Oil Companies in the State prohibiting them from filling any tank or receptacle, that was not buried underground, with more than five gallons of gasoline. To be sure and elimi - nate all possibility of any controversy between the Oil Com - panies and this Department we first secured an opinion from the Attorney General in the matter and herewith submit the opinion of the Attorney General and our ruling. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">14 STATE FIRE COMMISSION LEGAL DEPARTMENT OPINION OP THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Mr. W. S. Ridgell, State Fire Commissioner, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You submit to this department a question as to the authority of the State Fire Commission to enforce certain regulations and restrictions with reference to the handling and storing of cer - tain combustibles and explosives. Your question is, "Has this Department, under the fire com - mission law, the authority to prohibit Oil Companies from fill - ing or maintaining cans and tanks with gasoline in excess of five gallons above ground T" This practice, you say, is particularly hazardous, and that all gasoline in excess of five gallon, when kept for use, should be placed at least three feet under the ground and when stored above ground, should be 200 feet from any building or structure. Article 11 of Chapter 23, of the Revised Statutes of 1913, creating the office of the State Fire Commissioner, and defining the authority and duties of such officer and his deputies — and particularly Sections 11 and 12 of the Act, contemplate and provide for the exercise of such authority by your Department as will afford adequate protection against the destruction of property from such cause, otherwise the State would fail in car - rying out the vital purpose of the law. Such regulations as you propose should be observed by the Oil Companies storing gaso - line, as well as by the local merchants and dealers, and your Department should require such observance. Yours truly, Opinion of Attorney General WILLIS E. REED, given August 17, 17 Attorney General </seg>
            <seg id="p013">STATE FIRE COMMISSION 15 RULING AND ORDER BY THE FIRE COMMISSION DEPARTMENT To the Oil Companies of the State : Gentlemen : Under the Fire Commission law all inflammable and combusti - ble material has been placed under the jurisdiction of the Fire Commission, and by a ruling of this department, it was decided that all gasoline in excess of five gallon, should be buried not less than three feet under the ground, and this five gallon should be kept in a five gallon can. This law has been generally obeyed over the state, but on account of the number of Oil Companies furnishing and filling fifty gallon tin tanks, we feel that we are compelled, in the fu - ture, to prohibit any Oil Company, doing business in Nebraska, from filling any tank above ground, with gasoline in excess of five gallon. Where steel tanks containing fifty gallon are shipped into this state and are stored for future use, we shall require that the oil companies see that they are stored at least 200 feet from any building. It has been the practice of the Oil Companies in the past, where no tank stations are located, to ship merchants more gasoline than it takes to fill his underground tank, and this gasoline is generally stored around on the side-walk or in the rear of the building We want this practice discontinued, or else we want the Oil Companies to see that these barrels are stored at least 200 feet from any building. This matter has been submitted to the Attorney General for his opinion, and same is attached to this order. Yours truly, W. S. RIDGELL, Fire Marshal. The Oil Companies of the State are assisting us in every way possible to eliminate the gasoline hazard in Nebraska, and are complying with our ruling in all the towns of the State, so that we believe there are but a few cases, if any, where gasoline in excess of five gallons is now stored above ground. </seg>
            <seg id="p014">16 STATE FIRE COMMISSION CONDEMNATION OF BUILDINGS Our idea of a fire hazard is that a building or property must actually be, because of its condition, particularly suscepti - ble to fire. Frequently complaints eome to us about buildings that are not really dangerous from a fire standpoint, but merely old and unsightly. If the owners of old property keep same in good repair, keep the surroundings free and clean from all rub - bish and inflammable material, we cannot condemn such prop - erty to beautify a neighborhood. We do not at any time wish to work a hardship on anyone and our constant aim has been to be fair and square and broad and at the same time firm in the enforcement of the law. In all condemnation proceedings we have given owners am - ple time to repair and clean up their property and only in cases where they have refused to do this or where the building was beyond all repair have we condemned same and ordered the property torn down. In nearly all cases the property owner has been made to see that it was for his own, as well as for the public good, to re - move his property and put up a new building. Citizens of the state, as a whole, have co-operated with us and have willingly complied with our instructions and orders along fire prevention lines. Having old rubbish and inflammable material lying around premises is a condition we treat most severely. There is never a good or logical excuse for this accumulation of rubbish on any property and our orders in cases of this kind have been and will continue to be very severe. Poorly constructed chimneys, stoves set up with no metal protection underneath, stoves too close to unprotected walls, stove pipes through ceilings or wood partitions, poorly in - stalled electric wiring and numerous other grossly careless con - ditions have to be constantly looked after and remedied. To the average citizen Fire Prevention presents a vague out - line always associated with Fire Insurance. The general idea is that where a building or its contents is destroyed by fire noth - ing is lost if the property is insured. Our citizens must be </seg>
            <seg id="p015">STATE FIRE COMMISSION 17 brought to realize the true economic conditions; they must be taught that loss by fire is irretrievable, and that fire insurance creates no wealth, but merely distributes the burden of the loss by collecting a tax to reimburse those having fires. As the fire loss increases so must the tax represented in premiums be greater and sufficient to repay the loss. During the past six or seven months, it seems, we have been having more complaints and requests to condemn and have removed old buildings than for some time past. In view of the fact that during the war everyone will be called upon to make more or less sacrifice and as money is bound to be scarcer, and material and workmanship harder to obtain, we would make a special request that citizens in the various towns throughout the State would not ask us unless in the most extreme cases, to condemn anyone's property unless the case is a flagrant one, and the fire hazard beyond a question It is a delicate and un - pleasant duty to compel any citizen to tear down and remove his property, but when we deem it best for the community at large and feel that the property is a nuisance and a menace we would not hesitate to condemn it. MOVING PICTURES—THEATRES - FIRE ESCAPES— EXITS. ETC. The Legislature of 1917 amended the Fire Commission Law and took away from the labor department the jurisdiction over moving picture shows, theatre, school houses, hotels and all pub - lic buildings, and placed the supervision of same under this department. During the past year we have taken up the mat - ter of fire escapes and insisted that they be installed on all pub - lic buildings according to law. Last August we sent the fol - lowing letter to the chairmen of all School Boards throughout the state, and are pleased to report that a great many School Boards were interested in having their schools properly equipped with fire escapes. State Superintendent W. H. Clemmons sent the following letter to the various School Boards and we are sure these letters were the means of safe-guarding the lives of a great many children in schools where up to this time fire escapes had not been installed. </seg>
            <seg id="p016">18 STATE FIRE COMMISSION Lincoln, Nebr., August 17, 1917. Chairman of School Board, Dear Sir: The 1917 Legislature placed the fire escape law under the jurisdiction of the Fire Commission. This law requires fire es - capes to be placed on all school houses of two stories or over, also requires them to be stair-way fire escapes and to be ap - proved by the Fire Commission. In case you have no fire escape on your school building or buildings, you will please make arrangements at once to comply with this law, as we shall insist that fire escapes be put on all school buildings in the State of Nebraska. Please let us know when you have complied with this law. The Legislature of 1911 passed a law requiring all schools to teach Fire Prevention, at least, thirty minutes a month. Your County Superintendent has been supplied with Fire Pre - vention Text Books and you will please see to it that all teachers comply with this important law. A fire drill should be prac - ticed at least once a month. Yours truly, W. S. RIDGELL, Fire Marshal. Boards of Education. State of Nebraska. Gentlemen : The Department of Education is asking that you take due precaution regarding fire protection in safe-guarding the lives of children in our public schools. Fire escapes should be provided, giving children ample op - portunity to escape in case of fire.

Please read the law carefully and in making inspections see that buildings have doors opening outward, that fire escapes are provided, and that moving picture booths are properly installed. We want your co-operation in our work of Protecting Life and Property from destruction by Fire, and at all times we will be ready to see that your orders to enforce the Law are com - plied with. We would suggest that you get your eity council to pass an ordinance along the lines of this law so that you will have the assistance of a local as well as State law. Very truly yours, W. S.

Janitors often think their duties are fulfilled when the class rooms are kept clean, but they should be required to keep clean all out of the way places as well. Fires in school buildings nearly always mean death to at least some few of the pupils and everything should be done to truard against this loss of life and property. There is no good reason for allowing combustible or inflammable rubbish to ac - cumulate in school buildings and waste paper should be de - stroyed or sold before the accumulation is dangerous. Those in charge cannot be too careful regarding fire hazards in schools, and there is as much need to inspect them as there is to inspect mercantile or any other business buildings. Under Section 1 of the amended Fire Commission Law the Fire Commissioner or his Deputies shall have authority to in - spect all theatres, picture shows, or other places of AMUSE - MENT and prescribe rules and regulations for the CONSTRUC - TION and OPERATION of same. Under Section 8 of this same law, where any person or corporation shall fail to comply with the orders of the Fire Commissioner within thirty days, the Fire Commissioner has authority to close said place within five days' notice given said firm or corporation. This Depart - ment is making every effort to enforce the law in regard to mov - ing picture shows and theatres and we have informed the man - agers of picture shows and theatres that they must not admit patrons after the seating capacity of the show is exhausted. Standing room in the theatres is absolutely prohibited. Aisles and lobbies inside of the theatres must be kept clear and free from all loose chairs or other obstructions. Every pic - ture show and theatre must have exits indicated by signs and also by red lights. All exits to remain open or unlocked during the performance of the show. All booths must be installed and meet with the specifications called for by law. </seg>
            <seg id="p019">21 STATE FIRE COMMISSION THE LAW GOVERNING THE USE AND SALE OF FIRE WORKS The sale and use of fireworks has been the source of a great many deaths, injuries and destructive fires. For the past teu or twelve years a great inany of the larger cities in the United States have advocated and in many instances enacted laws pro - hibiting the sale and use of fireworks, so that now in a num - ber of cities the Fourth of July and other holidays are cele - brated without the use of any destructive explosives. Having in mind the elimination of any unnecessary fires this Depart - ment made a ruling last year that there would be no fireworks sold in the State. Owing to the fact that when this matter was taken up last summer a number of wholesale houses al - ready had purchased their 1917 supply and not wishing to work a hardship on them we allowed them to sell fireworks last sum - mer, but all wholesalers have been notified that they must not sell them in the State in the future. On July 14th last we sent the following letter to fire insurance companies that do busi - ness in Nebraska. July 14, 1917. To the Various Fire Insurance Companies Gentlemen : This Department has prohibited the sale of fireworks at retail, in the state during 1918, and would very much like to have the assistance of every Fire Insurance Company, doing business in Nebraska, in enforcing this ruling. We request that you notify your agents to withdraw the permits allowing mer - chants to sell fireworks at retail. We are sending out this week an ordinance, drawn up by the National Board of Underwriters to every town in the state, requesting them to pass this ordinance and prohibit the sale of fireworks in their town. We have received notice of four fires caused from fireworks this vear. also have had four accidents from fireworks in this </seg>
            <seg id="p020">STATE FIRE COMMISSION 22 state, and we feel that this loss can be eliminated with the as - sistance of the Insurance Companies and the towns passing this ordinance. Please let us hear from you as soon as possible Yours truly, W. S. RIDGELL, Fire Marshal. On July 25th, we sent the following letter to all Mayors in the State. July 25th, 1917. To the Honorable Mayor Dear Sir: During the last ten years over 40,000 people have been killed and injured from the careless handling of fireworks, and mil - lions of dollars worth of property has been destroyed, and it seems that this is an unnecessary loss of life and property, and it should be remedied by the different states in the Union as soon as possible. We are enclosing herewith a copy of an ordinance, endorsed by the National Board of Underwriters, and we especially urge upon you and the City Council to pass this ordinance as soon as possible, and let us know at this office when you have taken action upon it. In the state of Indiana last year, nearly 100 towns passed an ordinance similar to this, and from the reports which we get Indiana suffered less from the use of fireworks during the period preceding and the 4th of July, than any other state in the Union. We would like to have every town in the state pass this ordinance as we intend to prohibit the sale of fireworks, except as specified in this ordinance, during 1918, and the law would be much easier to enforce if the local towns would assist us in this matter. We have taken this up with the Fire Insurance Companies doing business in Nebraska, and are now in receipt of favorable replies from all of them. We have asked the Insurance Com- </seg>
            <seg id="p021">STATE FIRE COMMISSION 23 panies to withdraw permits for the sale or handling of fire - works in retail next year. We are now asking you and your City Council to pass this ordinance so as to assist us in protect - ing life and property during 1918. Will you plense take this up with your City Council, and let us know at your earliest convenience what you can do in this matter? Yours truly, W. S. RIDGELL, Fire Marshal. FIRE PREVENTION SOCIETIES If we could organize a Fire Prevention Society in every town in the state, have the property owners become members, induce the commercial clubs, and woman's clubs of the town to become interested, have the mayors and village clerks set aside a day at least twice a year (every Spring and Fall) as a "clean-up" day, when every citizen would be requested to clean up his premises and make them free from fire dangers. we would have accomplished much along fire prevention lines. Rubbish, oily rags, excelsior, etc., breed fire. Old dilapidated buildings are a menace, and carelessly handled gasoline and coal oil is a constant danger. Bonfires and fireworks claim their amount of toll in human lives every year. Local fire prevention societies could look into the elimina - tion of these dangers and interest their community in reducing fire losses. We wish we could have these societies organized generally throughout the State. Statistics prove that 75 per cent of the enormous fire waste of this country is directly due to carelessness and ignorance. We are living at a time in the history of our nation when the question of the preservation of resources, natural and created, is receiving a great deal of attention. The preservation of any kind of property from any kind of waste should receive the ut - most consideration from the public. One of our most vital prob - lems and one which is calling for rapid solution is the prob - lem of ur enormous, unnecessary and avoidable fires. Two </seg>
            <seg id="p022">24 STATE FIRE COMMISSION hundred and fifty million dollars of constructed property an - nually destroyed by fire is a direct reproach upon our civil gov - ernment and upon the people. Two-thirds of the $2,000,000 an - nual fire loss in Nebraska is due to carelessness, and is an ab - solute waste and drain upon our resources. It is depleting the wealth of our state. We are burning down almost as fast as we are building up. No state or nation can long endure this absolute waste and drain without feeling the effects in a most unfavorable way. The Mayors of every city and village in the state should is - sue local proclamations asking their citizens to co-operate in cleaning up and removing all fire dangers. The city or village should furnish men and teams free of charge to haul away all waste and rubbish. All Fire Chiefs should make a special inspection of their territory and compel the change of any conditions which would tend to eliminate the possibility of a fire. Every Commercial Club in the state should have a Fire Pre - vention Committee. The committee should send out a call ask - ing all citizens to co-operate in making Fire Day a real Clean Up Day. Women's Clubs should take an interest in the Day and ask every member to look into their home conditions with a view of abolishing every possible fire danger. Heating apparatus, electric wiring and chimneys should be carefully gone over and placed in proper condition for winter use. Public and private institutions, stores, factories, garages and all business houses should be inspected and any changes made that will further protect the premises from fire. The public press can be a powerful factor in the movement of Fire Prevention. By instructive and timely publications they can interest the public as no other factor can. </seg>
            <seg id="p023">STATE FIRE COMMISSION 25 PROCLAMATION BY THE GOVERNOR. FIRE PREVENTION DAY, NOVEMBER 2, 1917 TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE : I feel it incumbent upon me, as Governor of the State, to sub - serve the interests of every one living in the State. We are in every possible way defending ourselves against those who would despoil us of our chief glory as a republic. Our sons are under arms; the daughters of the republic are supplementing every movement of the government in order that the fundamental principles of our country be preserved. But there is another foe that we should guard against threatening property and life and that foe is fire. Let us forti - fy ourselves against the ravages of the enemy by taking care of that upon which he preys. This we can do by a general clean - ing up. Therefore, I set apart the 2nd of November as FIRE PREVENTION AND CLEAN-UP DAY, and ask all to join in the effort to protect our own and our neighbors property. Given under my hand and the Seal of the State this 6th day of October, 1917. KEITH NEVILLE, Governor. OFFICE OF STATE FIRE COMMISSIONER FIRE PREVENTION DAY, NOVEMBER 2, 1917 We trust that every citizen of the state of Nebraska will do his part to bring to a realization the suggestions which Governor Neville has set forth in his Proclamation for the observance of Fire Prevention Day on November 2nd. It is a decided lack of understanding, foresight, and busi - ness judgment for any business man to disregard the Fire Pre - vention Propaganda which the entire country is now interested in. Failure upon the part of our citizens to make personal in - spections of their property and remove every possible fire danger is indeed unpatriotic. Insurance, no matter how much is carried, is no remedy against fire losses. Fire has an important bearing upon the </seg>
            <seg id="p024">26 STATE FIRE COMMISSION "high cost of living" as well as upon the "high cost of insur - ance." The lack of fires will reduce the high cost of both. Any way the intelligent citizen looks at it, "Fire Prevention" is a financial proposition, which if followed will reduce fire losses. A reduction of fire losses will mean the enriching of your community, state and nation. Not only business men, but house-wives should interest them - selves in reducing the enormous fire losses in this country. A large percentage of fires occur in residences and the housewife is generally considered the sole superintendent of the home. Certainly she can do more in correcting dangerous conditions around the house than any one else. Therefore in this bulletin we call not only upon the business man and merchant, but also upon the homekeepers to make this a record year for low fire losses in Nebraska. We ask all citi - zens of the state to try and make Fire Prevention Day a day of real worth by abolishing all fire hazards and eliminating every possible fire danger. The business man and merchant, the manufacturer and mill owner should clean up his premises and keep them clean. Re - move all rubbish and waste and destroy it under proper super - vision. Inspect your property carefully. Correct all defects in electric wiring, chimneys, flues, stoves and furnaces and all heat - ing apparatus. Take no chances in handling gasoline and kero - sene carelessly. Don't put ashes in wooden barrels or boxes. Use metal cans. Use every precaution to guard against fire The housewife should not allow rubbish to accumulate in cellars, back yards or alleys. Store kerosene and gasoline safely and never fill lamps or stoves when there is any danger of ig - nition near. Don't hang clothing or draperies near open fires or stoves. See that there is a proper metal protection under all stoves. Don't start fires in furnaces or stoves without first see - ing that they are properly put up and cleaned out and that all chimneys and flues are safe and clean. Keep matches out of the reach of children. </seg>
            <seg id="p025">STATE FIRE COMMISSION 27 We wish especially to ask the Mayor or Village Clerk of every city and village in the state to issue a local proclama - tion in conjunction with that of our Governor's and ask the citizens to get together in making Fire Prevention Day a day of real worth and merit. Commercial Clubs and Women's Clubs should meet and help outline a program to be carried out so that every city and village in the state would have a real "Cleaning Up." The town board should hire two or more men according to the size of the town and have these men make thorough inspec - tions. The town board should also hire one or more men with teams to go about the city and haul away rubbish that the citi - zens gather together in cleaning up their premises. The town board should pay for these teams and while the amount of money expended will be nominal the good derived therefrom will be enormous. Local firemen should be chosen for the work of in - spection as they are more familiar with fire hazards. This de - partment will be glad to commission any man who wishes to as - sist in this work a Deputy Fire Commissioner so that he may have authority to act in that capacity when he deems fit. Teachers in all schools public and private should arrange special programs for Fire Prevention Day as outlined in the Fire Prevention Text Books which this department furnishes them. A world of good can be accomplished through school children having impressed upon their minds the importance of reducing our fire losses to the minimum. Teachers should ob - serve Fire Day on Friday, November 2nd. We sincerely trust that all citizens of the state will take an active interest in conserving our resources from destruction by fire and that all will join in the movement to make "Fire Day," November 2, a real "Clean Up" day for the state. W. S. RIDGELL, State Fire Marshal. TEACHING FIRE PREVENTION IN OUR SCHOOLS Teachers in all our public, private and parochial schools should make the First Friday in November, a most interesting and instructive day to all school children. Every teacher in </seg>
            <seg id="p026">28 STATE FIRE COMMISSION th estate is provided with a school book "Lessons on Fire Pre - vention" and from this book they can arrange programs that will make this vital subject entertaining as well as instructive. Fire drills, essays on the causes of fire and how to prevent them ; statistics on the tremendous fire waste of our state and nation ; the hardships suffered therefrom, etc., are all outlined in the Fire Prevention Text Book, and we trust that all teachers in the state are doing their duty as required by law in teaching this worthy subject. Nebraska has the distinction of having in her schools the first complete and comprehensive text book ever published on this subject. The book was written and copyrighted by Miss Mamie Muldoon, Secretary of this Department, who spent over two years compiling it. As Miss Muldoon has been Secretary of this Department since its organization and has for several years been interested in fire prevention work she was most ably qualified to write a book of this kind. The book is graded into lessons ranging from the kindergarten through the High School. It covers every phase of the subject of fire prevention, con - tains valuable statistics and an elaborate treatise on fire insur - ance, rate making, etc. Several other states in the union recog - nizing the merits of the book, are now making arrangements to adopt it as they recognize its worth and are anxious to have a standard, uniform text book on the subject to be universally used in schools. One of the leading fire prevention magazines of the United States, and the official paper of the Fire Marshals' association of North America, commenting upon this book says: "Miss Mamie Muldoon, Secretary of the Nebraska State Fin- Commission, has compiled and issued a school book entitled. Lessons on Fire revention, for the instruction of children. It is an elaborate volume and conatins a series of lessons on fire prevention and on the effects of fire carelessness for all grades, beginning with simple stories and rhymes for the kindergarten and running through such statistical and analytical presenta - tions of the subject as are appropriate for the last years of high school. The lessons are not long, but they are comprehensive and admirably adapted to the needs of the respective grades. If intelligently and carefully taught they should prove an ef- </seg>
            <seg id="p027">STATE FIRE COMMISSION 29 fective agency in educating the children of the state to thc need of fire prevention and to inculcate in them habits of care - fulness. "In effect, this book marks the beginning of a fire preven - tion literature, of which there may be said to be practically none. And one is badly needed. The National Fire Protection Association emphasized that fact when it issued its program for the observance of Fire Prevention Day, a couple of months agfo. Too much dependence should not be laid on educating children along this line, because the real work to be done can be accomplished only by appealing to the mature judgment and common sense of intelligent men and women, or by compelling them to.be fire-careful where they will not of their own voli - tion ; but as an adjunct to this broader work it has a distinct field of usefulness and should not be neglected. The book in question may be regarded as a fine start in the development of a fire prevention literature, without which no appreciable de - gree of success could be hoped for in this form of educational work, and Nebraska is to be congratulated that an employee of its Fire Commission has been able to make so auspicious a beginning in this respect." Teaching the youth of the country habits of care and caution regarding fire dangers must certainly result in unlimited good to the nation. Heretofore children of this country have not been taught the value of a match nor have they been told of its destructive powers. In European countries children are not allowed to play with matches and use them as "inexpensive toys." The foreigner roes not throw matches carelessly about because they are cheap. From childhood he has been taught habits of economy. Not only will the teaching of fire preven - tion result in reducing that part of the fire waste of the country due to children's carelessness and negligence, but the child will carry home to his parents accounts of the lessons he has been taught and the parents in this manner will have called to their attention dangerous habits and conditions which they have •never noticed before and which they will willingly' correct. The child, when he leaves school, will have instilled into his mind principles and advice concerning fire dangers and how to avoid them that must ultimately tell the value of this branch </seg>
            <seg id="p028">30 STATE FIRE COMMISSION of education in reduced fire losses in the state. We teach and preach conservation of our natural resources, our forests, our waterways, minerals, etc., and it certainly must appeal to every intelligent, alert, progressive individual that our constructive re - sources should be preserved and a decided reduction made in our nation's annual fire waste of $250,000,000.00. Insurance is only a distributor of this loss, collecting from many policy - holders the amount sufficient to indemnify the polacy-holder hav - ing a fire. We all contribute our share to this ash heap of $250,000,000.00. The insurance companies distribute our con - tributions; the property and material destroyed by fire is abso - lutely and irrevocably lost. We trust our educational efforts will result in a decided de- crease in the fire losses of Nebraska, which amount to about two million dollars annually. The annual fire losses of Nebraska OVER INSURANCE CAUSE OF MANY FIRES The investigations of this Department into questionable fires disclose beyond all dispute the serious fact that fully 90% of the incendiary fires are set for the purpose of collecting the insurance. It is so easy to obtain insurance in excess of the real value of property that "crooks" have organized themselves into an "arson trust" whose specific business is to purchase property for the sole purpose of obtaining excess insurance upon it (and the excess insurance ranges all the way from 25% to 500% more than its real value) and then at the first oppor - tune time to "sell it to the fire insurance companies through a FIRE." It is a most profitable business and takes very little cleverness in its operation. In most cases of this kind the ,8 reported to this office since its organization are as foil low 1910 $2,181,058.00 1911 1,788,123.30 1912 2,251,774.33 1913 1,715,676.10 1914 1,873,071.25 1915 1,789,269.00 1916 1,908,297.46 1917 2,895,935.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p029">STATE FIRE COMMISSION 31 agents of the insurance companies are to blame. Fire insurance policies in any amounts are issued by local agencies without any knowledge of the value of the property insured or the reliability of the assured. State and Special agents calling on local agents also pass on this questionable if not dangerous business and often the premeditated fire is "set off," without any suspicion ever being attached to the guilty parties, and if suspicion is aroused after the fire then the local and state agents call upon us and together with their adjusters demand that we "catch and prosecute" the criminal "Fire Bug" whom they assisted and really abetted by their careless and loose methods of selling insurance. In nine cases out of ten it is almost impossible to obtain any incriminating evidence after the fire is over. The evidences of the crime are burned with the property. We are not directly blaming the Insurance Companies, but they should use the most stringent measures to prevent their local agents from abusing the privilege of writing insurance. Whenever possible a risk should be inspected no matter for whom it is being written, but in every case when the applicant is a stranger the risk should be inspected. We have investi - gated cases repeatedly where property was insured for twenty times its value, and Companies have expected us to ferret out and convict the criminal after all evidences of the crime was burned with the property, and yet the Company never repri - manded their agent, or thought of blaming him. The moral hazard ought to be looked into as well as the physical hazard when writing insurance. Insurance agents will stand outside and look at a building, figure the rate and risk according to the exposures, construction, etc.; they never think to ask if the owner is honest, careful and trustworthy. This should be considered when writing a policy, for a bad moral hazard is much more dangerous and certain to "burn" than even a poor physical hazard. The average lavman has no idea how many dishonest losses Fire Insurance Companies have to pay every year.

For the purpose of correcting this lax method of writing fire insurance the legislature of 1913 enacted a law providing a penalty for the insurance company, the local agent and the insured in case of over-insurance. The following is the section of the law relating to over - insurance : "Sec. 109. OVERINSURANCE— UNLAWFUL. It shall be unlawful for any insurance company or any agent to knowingly issue any fire insurance policy upon property within this state for an amount which with any existing insurance exceeds the fair value of the property or of the interest of the insured therein, or for a longer time than for five years, except as pro - vided in section 134. "Sec. 110. SAME— Insured. It shall be unlawful for any party having an insurable interest in property located in this state to knowingly procure any fire insurance policy upon his interest in such property for an amount in excess of the fair value of his interest in the property, or for an amount which with any existing insurance thereon, exceeds the fair value of his interest in the property. "Sec. 111. OVER-INSURANCE— PENALTIES. Every in - surer who makes insurance upon any building or property of in - terest therein against loss or damage by fire, and every agent who issues a fire insurance policy covering any building or property or interest therein, and every insured who procures a policy of fire insurance upon any building or property or in - terest therein owned by him, is presumed to know the insur - ance value of such building or property interest therein at the time such insurance is effected. Any insurer who knowingly makes insurance on any building or property or interest there - in against loss or damage by fire in excess of the insurable value thereof, shall be fined in a sum not less than fifty dollars or more than one hundred dollars. Any agent who knowingly ef - fects insurance on a building or property or interest therein in </seg>
            <seg id="p031">STATE FIRE COMMISSION 33 excess of the insurable value thereof, shall be fined in a sum not less than fifteen nor more than twenty-five dollars." We earnestly ask the co-operation of the Fire Insurance Companies, their State, Special and Local agents in eliminating as far as possible this serious menace of over-insuranee. INCENDIARY FIRES INVESTIGATED Jefferson Davis, colored minister and truck driver, owned an equity in a small residence in Omaha. The same was par - tially destroyed by fire on November 8, 1916. This Department made an investigation at that time and found the building and contents to be over-insured and the moral hazard had not been considered in the least as Davis had a very questionable fire about a year before. In the spring of 1917 we obtained additional evidence which was filed with the county attorney of Douglas county, and on which a complaint was issued. Davis had a hearing before the police court and was bound over to the district court in April. The main witnesses in the case were colored people living on the second floor of the Davis residence. This Department asked that these witnesses be placed under an appearance bond, which was refused by the county attorney's office. The case came to trial in the December term of court and this Department was asked by the county attorney's office to produce these witnesses instead of issuing a subpoena for them. We were unable to lo - cate these witnesses and the case was continued by the county attorney's office until the January term of court. On January 17, a residence in Louisville burned belonging in part to Mrs. Anna Garrett, the same being vacant at the time. The evidence tended to show that one George Frank, a brother of Mrs. Garrett was hired to burn the building. A warrant was issued for Frank and delivered to the sheriff who has not been able to locate him as he has apparently left the country. John Savin, at Lexington, confessed to burning the building in which he lived, on December 29, 1916. This building was a small two room house and he had obtained $800 insurance on his furniture. He entered a plea of guilty before Judge Grimes </seg>
            <seg id="p032">34 STATE FIRE COMMISSION of the district court and was sentenced and paroled from the bench. On December 24, 1916, there was a clear attempt to burn the elevator which was full of wheat, at Pleasantdale, owned and operated by the Iowa-Nebraska Grain ompany. The at - tempt was made by placing a lighted candle surrounded by oily waste in the cupola. It was discovered, however, before any damage was done. This is the clearest ease of an attempt to destroy food by an enemy of our country that we have had this year. On June 3d, a stock of five and ten cent goods belonging to Mrs. Mary Steel of Aurora, was partly destroyed by fire. Mrs. Steel had received several anonymous letters threatening to burn her out. A competitor, Mr. Kenny, had also received letters of the same character and making the same threats as the Steel letters. These letters were turned over to the Post Office Department for investigation, apparently with no results. After the fire these letters were turned over to our Department and we succeeded in finding a tablet in Mrs. Steel's store out of which these letters had been torn. Mrs. Steel admitted that the paper on which these letters were written came out of her tablet, but denied that she had any knowledge of who had written them. A complaint was filed against her charging her with arson, but was later dismissed. On May 25, 1917, the store building belonging to George Woten and occupied by C. R. Weaver of Rockville, was de - stroyed by fire. This Department obtained evidence tending to show that the building was fired by one Frank Eastman, and we finally located him in Des Moines, Iowa, and secured a con - fession in which he stated that George "Woten, (Woten being his uncle) hired him to burn this building. Woten was ar - rested and charged with the crime, but Eastman refused to testify against him, but went into district court himself and pleaded guilty and was sentenced from one to twenty years in the penitentiary where he is now incarcerated. On the night of July 29th, fire was discovered in the restau - rant of George Smith of Beatrice. The evidence found there, proved conclusively that the fire had been set, together with </seg>
            <seg id="p033">STATE FIRE COMMISSION 35 the fact that the goods were insured for more than doable their value. Smith was arrested and charged with the crime of ar - son, but was dismissed in police court in Beatrice. Alfio Jamma, an Italian, living on the second floor of a small residence in Omaha, secured $500 insurance on his household goods under the name of Alfiio Chippi. The household goods were partly moved out and the place set on fire. No arrests were made as he had a complete "Italian" alibi. August Mickish, of Winnebago, a recluse bachelor, living alone had a fire in his residence on August 12. The fire was started in four different rooms and coal oil was used freely to aid the names. Mickish contended that he had enemies that attempted to burn him out. Complaint was filed against him and he was bound over to the district court where the case is now pending. On July 31, the residence of Mrs. Jessie Deering, "formerly Mrs. Lafe Gallond, of Winnebago" was burned. Mrs. Deering, when she was Mrs. Gallond, had a fire in the same location about a year before. The evidence submitted in the divorce case, Gallond vs. Gallond, tended to prove that she had removed the furniture, burned the property and secured the insurance. Later she rebuilt the house and married Deering. Shortly before the fire she sold the property to one Albert Robinson, but was still holding possession at the time of the fire. Three days after the fire the insurance was transferred to Robinson on consideration of $270 and the money was paid by the Insurance Company carrying the risk, the company taking receipts from both parties. We secured an affidavit from Sam Deering, husband of Jessie Deering, in which he stated that he had removed the greater part of the furniture from this residence and shipped it to Omaha, and on the night of the fire his wife and her brother, Mark Hoover, came there in an automobile at midnight and told him to leave the premises as they were going to burn the building and Deering claimed he did leave and saw the building on fire in a few minutes after he went away. We ob - tained complaints against all three of them charging them with arson. Hoover and Mrs. Deering waived examination and were bound over to the district court. Deering stood trial in the </seg>
            <seg id="p034">36 STATE FIRE COMMISSION county court and his case was dismissed by Judge Carlburg of Thurston county. Cases against the other two are now pending. About midnight on February 1, 1917, a picture show in the Paxton block in Omaha, operated by one Joseph Kohlberg was found to be thoroughly soaked with kerosene oil and set on fire. The principal damage resulting from same was from water. Kohlberg was arrested and tried in the district court of Douglas county. During the time this case was pending there was an - other fire in this picture show which caused considerable dam - age. When the case tame to trial the jury disagreed and the case was later dismissed by the county attorney of Douglas county. Joe Franklin, of Verdon, Richardson county, was charged with burning an old saloon building on August 25, owned by Alexander and Connett, who formerly operated it as a saloon. Franklin was bound over to the district court and was ac - quitted. An attempt tt arson was committed in Fairbury on July the 5th by Mrs. Frank Vansess. She was bound over to the district court and while the case was pending she was adjudged insane and committed to the asylum at Hastings. In February, 1917, an incendiary fire took place on the farm of Elmer Wiggins, about ten miles from Gothenburg. This fire was in stacks of grain situated on two different farms. One of them a farm of three hundred acres and the other on a farm of seventy acres, with the North Platte River between them. There was twenty-six stacks of grain, insured for $15,400, in a thirty days' policy. The evidence tended to show that Wig - gins tried to hire two different parties to set this on fire. The one who confessed that Wiggins had tried to hire him was an ex-convict and before we could complete our investigation he was again sent to the penitentiary. Wiggins was afflicted with an incurable disease and the insurance company was very anxious to get a settlement before Mr. Wiggins died. We spent considerable time and effort with the state agent of the Com - mercial Union Insurance Company in trying to get enough evi - dence to convict Mr. Wiggins of hiring certain parties to fire </seg>
            <seg id="p035">STATE FIRE COMMISSION 37 these stacks of grain. We were unable to do this, however, but were able to secure a settlement for the Commercial Union for $3,700. Mr. Wiggins died within about two weeks after this settlement was made. PER CAPITA FIRE LOSS IN SEVERAL OF THE LARGER CITIES OF THE STATE The losses of Nebraska this year show an increase owing to the fact that four large fires, three in Omaha and one in Fre - mont amount to nearly $1,000,000 in themselves. In Omaha, the old Continental Block at 14th and Douglas streets owned by J. S. Beyers, estate, and occupied by the Hartman Furniture Company burned with a loss of $405,142. The Willow Springs Distilling Company with a loss of $28,000, and the Maney Mill fire with a loss of $157,487 increased the Omaha fire loss $590,629. At Fremont the Nye-Schneider-Fowler Elevator burned on December 19, 1916, with a loss of $325,000 and as our report for 1916 was closed at that time this loss has been- included in our 1917 report. These four fires aggregate $915,926, adding nearly $1,000,000 to our losses. Omaha's fire loss estimating the population at 200,000 would be $5.09 per capita. Lincoln '8 fire loss per capita, estimating the population at 50,000, would be $2.32. This is a low loss ratio when com - pared with the following towns of the state. Grand Island, with an estimated population of 15,000 had a fire loss amounting to $2.76 per capita. York, with an estimated population of 8,000, had a per capita loss of $10.23. Hastings, with an estimated population of 13,000, had a per capita fire loss of $10.63. Norfolk, with an estimated population of 8,500, had a per capita fire loss of $13.73. Norfolk has had an excessive fire loss for the past few years and this unnecessary loss is sure to be felt as a burden on the citizens and fire insurance rates will be increased rather than reduced under these conditions. </seg>
            <seg id="p036">38 STATE FIRE COMMISSION We have counted in the $100,000 loss of the Canning Com - pany in these figures; if that was taken out it would materially reduce the per capita loss for Norfolk, but as the canning fac - tory is a Norfolk industry we must put it under the losses for this town. Fremont, with an estimated population of 12,000, had a fire loss per capita of $27.57. The Nye-Schneider-Powler Elevator which burned in Fremont with a loss of $325,000, brought Fre - mont's fire loss up away above the average and this city should be particularly interested in having her fire losses reduced to the minimum during 1918. Beatrice with an estimated population of 11,000 had a fire loss amounting to $1.14 per capita, which speaks well for the city of Beatrice and her efficient Fire Department. SAFETY FIRST AND FIRE PREVENTION The National Safety Council which has some forty members among the leading manufacturers and wholesalers of Omaha, have taken up the matter of fire prevention in Omaha Local Council number 27. Not until this past year has Fire Preven - tion been made a part of their very valuable and important work. All members are vitally interested in this most progres - sive movement to conserve from destruction by fire our prop - erty and resources. Safety First might well be applied to our fire losses in order to curtail them. The installation of Fire Extinguishers. Sprink - ler Systems, proper Fire Escapes and Exits, the care of build - ings, and heating plants, keeping premises free from all rub - bish and unnecessary waste, all these precautionary and pre - ventive measures can be advocated and practiced by whole - salers, manufacturers and merchants to the greatest advantage in reducing the enormous fire loss of Nebraska. INSPECTIONS. The Department has inspected practically every town in the State during the past year, having made over 18,000 inspections. </seg>
            <seg id="p037">STATE FIRE COMMISSION 39 We believe hardly an elevator or mill has been overlooked, and bad conditions generally have been corrected in most towns. The gasoline hazard has been carefully watched and our rulings regarding the handling and storing of same enforced. All picture shows and theatres in Omaha and Lincoln, as well as in all towns, throughout the state, have been inspected and the law enforced regarding their operation. Careless owners of property and tenants have been forced to clean up premises and remove dangerous conditions and fire hazards. This campaign of "Safety First," from 'All Fire Dangers" will be vigorously carried on during the year 1918. DEATHS CAUSED BY FIRE There were 57 people burned to death in Nebraska during the year 1917, and probably over one hundred other persons were severely and painfully burned. The greatest number of these deaths were caused by gaso - line fires. "Kerosene used in starting fires" caused the next greatest number of deaths. (iasoline and kerosene in homes cause many deaths every year because people will not learn to handle these explosives with the greatest care and attention. A number of deaths were caused by "children and matches." Under no circumstances should small children be allowed to handle matches. Matches should be placed out of the reach of children and they should be cautioned about the danger that lurks in them. Fifty seven deaths in Nebraska from fire is an appalling loss. Very truly yours, W. S. RIDGELL, Chief Deputy Fire Commissioner. </seg>
