Supplement No. 1 163 and 164 between South Sioux City and) O'Neill, Nebraska. ) OPINION, FINDING AND ORDER SWANSON, Commissioner: This is an application of the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Company requesting authority to discontinue operation of passenger motor trains Nos. 163 and 164 between South Sioux City and O'Neill, Nebraska. The request is one of several similar applications made by Nebraska railroads to dis - continue some 23 trains operating over various branch lines in the state. Due notice was given to the towns involved, and the instant application came on for public hearing in the municipal auditorium at Plainview on the 27th and 28th days oi October, 1941. The trains involved herein have been operating over this line for many years, formerly as steam trains, but for the past several years a» gas-electric motors. The trains at the present time consist oi a 275 H.P. power unit and a passenger coach with a seating capacity for 60 passengers. Schedules have remained approximately the same, and at the present time train No. 64 leaves O'Neill (population 2532) at 7:00 A. M., passing through Page (335); Orchard (493); Royal (193); Brunswick (289); Plainview (1411); Breslau (18); Osmond (796); McLean (82); Rau - dolph (1094); Wareham (16); Belden (235); Laurel (861); Duron (226); </seg>

The rail distance between O'Neill and South Sioux City is 126 miles, and it is approximately four miles addi - tional to the Sioux City, lowa station.

Applicant's witnesses, offered the: usual detailed exhibits, showing revenues accruing and credited to. the train's, together with out-of-pocket costs of operation. Period covered by the exhibits was for the years 1939 and 1940, and for the first eight months 0f1941. The application was strenuously opposed by numerous witnesses represented by counsel, and appearing from the various towns through which the trains pass. Because of the present disposition of the* matter, the Commission will not go into detail in its findings and order. Since the date of the last figures shown in applicant's exhibit, many ' grave and important world,events have taken place, which in our opinion may change the present and future .operating statistics.' of .these trains en- - tirely. The Commission.must take judicial notice -of- the. {act that since this case was closed and submitted upon the record, and before the Com-; mission has had an opportunity to reach the matter for disposition, the' . United States has declared war against Germany, Italy and Japan, which has resulted in'many important factors which we deem necessary to consider in arriving at a fair disposition of the application. One of those factors which immediately arose, was the creation of a commodity ra - tioning system effective nation-wide. Because; of the critical shortage of crude rubber stock, the Office of Price Administration, now War Pro - duction. Board of the Federal Government, immediately commenced the rationing of rubber tires and tubes for automobiles and trucks. Local county boards have been set tip and are now functioning, attempting to clarify arid-allocate tires to owners of motor vehicles. . Few.tires are be - ig made available for any purpose, and definitely the owners of pleasure cars are unable to obtain new tires. Effective February Ist of this year, automobile factories have discontinued the manufacture of new auto - mobiles and have turned their energies! toward all-out production of na - tional defense materials and war supplies. Other commodities are to be rationed as time elapses. After long deliberation, sharp increases in wages for railroad employees have been allowed. .A 10% .increase in railroad passenger fares has already been approved by the Interstate .-¦ Commerce Commission and that body is now considering the application of the American railroads for a flat 10% general increase in freight rates. </seg>
         <seg id="p056">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 56 How these matters and others not mentioned will affect the people and the applicant railroad must remain to be seen. However, the Com - mission is of the opinion that the entire picture has so drastically changed since the hearing in this case that it is unable with the information avail - able on the present record to enter a fair and reasonable final order at this time. The Commission does not wish to unjustly penalize applicant in in - sisting that these trains be kept hi! operation at a large financial loss. On - the other hand, the people living in the various communities involved must be (urnished reasonably adequate transportation facilities. Under the circumstances discussed herein, the Commission is of the opinion that in fairness to the public and to the applicant these trains" should be left on tor an experimental period of time, at the expiration of which time said application should be further heard upon extended exhibits and addi - tional testimony, and a final order entered.

The application was set for public hearing and after due notice to the various towns involved, was heard in the Municipal Auditorium at Plainvicw, Nebraska on October 27 and 28, 1941. / After hearing, and before the matter could be reached for decision, a great catastrophe befell our nation resulting in declaration of war, and an immediate change, among other things, in the transportation indus - try. Because of such grave change in conditions affecting automobile and tire rationing, together with numerous other commodities, the Commis - sion under date 1 of February 13, 1942, entered an order staying final dis - position until a later date in order that the effects of the national emer - gency might be ascertained as they related to adequate transportation facilities along the branch line involved. ; .

As a result of said temporoary order, the matter came on further to be heard at Plainyiew on the 6th day of May, 1942, and exhibits and testi - mony were received for the period subsequent to the first hearing.

The rail distance between O'Neill and South Sioux City is 126 miles, and it is approxi-: matcly four miles additional to the Sioux City, lowa station. ' ,; When the line was first constructed and placed in operation, and for many years thereafter, these trains provided practically the only transpor - tation service available to the public to and from the communities along the line. This was true as late as 1923. Applicant's Exhibit 3 shows that in 1923 train No. 163 carried from 19 to 24 passengers per train mile, and train No. 164 carried from 18 to 20 passengers per train mile. Gradually thereafter the use of the trains decreased. In 1930 train No. 163 car - ried between 4 and 5 passengers per train mile, and train No. 164 car - ried between 3 and 5. Continuing the steady decline train No. 163 during 1939 carried 3.2 passengers per train mile; 3.2 during 1940, and 1.5 dur - ing 1941. Train No. 164 during 1939 carried 2.7 passengers per train mile; 2.5 during 1940, and 1.3 during 1941. The train crew required to operate each of the trains consists of three men, a motorman, conductor, and a brakeman, the crew out numbering the passengers. ; Exhibit No. 10 shows revenue from all sources assigned to the trains, including i&gt;assenger (ares, mail, express, milk and newspaper revenue; the actual out-of-pocket cost of operating the trains, and the result of such operation.

Current bus schedules require nearly two Hours less running time than those maintained by the motor trains. In addition to the operating deficit, applicant testified that the re - pairs for the motors were almost impossible to secure; that many of them had to be machined in its own shops, thus taking man hours which could be used to better advantage in other work; that because of the draft; the demand for trained labor in national defense plants, and the extra tonnage being moved by the rails as a.result of the war effort, applicant has lost a great number of men in all departments of the railroad. That, as a re - sult, it is under-manned-and the mcii now necessary to keep the motor trains operating could be used elsewhere on applicant's railroad. ¦'-..''•" Many witnesses appeared and testified in opposition to the granting of the application. Summarized, their testimony was to the effect that the discontinuance of the use of trains 163 and 164 by the public for transportation of passengers, resulted from inadequacy of service; un - comfortable'riding qualities of the motor cars; length of time necessary to reach destination; unsatisfactory train connections.at Sioux City; lack of representation and solicitation of patronage by the applicant along the branch, and by the continued drought in the territory since 1932. Particu - larly were the people concerned about any change in existing mail service. . There is no doubt that many of these objections are well taken. The motor cars are old and do not compare with modern railroad passenger trains. Applicant testified that speed restrictions necessary to safety of operation over this branch limit the schedules of trains 163 and 164 to such .an extent that applicant cannot successfully. compete with motor vehicle traveling along U, S. Highway No. 20. It is expecting too much to believe that people in this territory would discontinue the use of their own automobiles, or bus traveling along the highway and return to the slower and more inconvenient and uncomfortable transportation furnished by the motor cars.: It appears that in the territory tributary to this line, there is an abundance of transportation facilities; private automobiles and busses carry most/of the. passengers formerly carried by' rail, and the </seg>

Representatives of the brotherhoods of locomotive firemen and en - ginemen, railroad trainmen, railway conductors, locomotive engineers and railroad telegraphers appeared at the hearings but did not testify. Through their attorney they later filed with the Commission a statement of posi - tion and memorandum brief, which has received the consideration of this Commission. The brief generally alleged that employees of applicant would be left without employment because of seniority rights, and because they are over 50 years of age, and that equipment used is obsolete and inap - propriate for use in national defense. The Commission is of the opinion that Sec. 75-216. C.S. Nebr., 1929, precludes the Commission from considering employment relationships be - tween applicant and the brotherhoods. In part that section reads as fol - lows : "•••It is further provided that nothing herein contained shall be construed as giving the state railway commission jurisdiction or control of the relations between the railway companies and their employers and employees' orders, either contractual or other - wise." . ¦¦- *¦' Jurisdiction of the Commission in this instance is primarily con - cerned with rail transportation service to the shipping and traveling pub - lic. Relationship between employer and employee does not seem to come under the Commission's jurisdiction, except as pertain to safety in opera - tion, and to certain definite statutory provisions. The contention that the equipment of said trains is old, or obsolete, does not justify the Com - mission in requiring further operation thereof if the public has ceased to use them, and they are otherwise adequately and reasonably served. The duty of supplying an adequate mail service was delegated by Congress to the Postmaster General, in part as follows: ¦ '.¦''¦¦-. "The Postmaster General shall provide for carrying the mail on all post roads established by law, as often as he, having due regard to productiveness and other circumstances, may think proper." (39 U.B.CA. 483) "The Postmaster General shall in all. cases decide upon what trains and In what manner the mails shall be conveyed.. Every railroad company carrying the mails shall carry on any train it . operates, and with due speed, all mailable matter, equipment and supplies directed to be carried thereon." ' (39 U. 8. C. A. 539) </seg>
         <seg id="p061">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 61 From a study of the exhibits, testimony and facts appearing in the complete record,, the Commission is of the opinion that the application should be granted.

         <seg id="p062">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 62 Northwestern Ry. Co. v. Commission, decided July 3, 1942, the Court among other things said: &gt; ¦ "¦- :' .-.-¦'. ¦?"As to the future business to be conducted at this station by virtue of the war, it is too speculative to be considered and too perplexing to be analyzed at this time." (Emphasis supplied). It was stipulated by the attorneys of record that the Commission should take judicial notice of and consider the various orders of the Of - fice of Defense Transportation as they may affect the operation of these trains. I'nder date of June 26, 1942. Mr. Joseph B. Eastman, Director of Defense Transportation, issued an order, in part as follows: "There are many places in the nation in which local accommoda - tion train service is paralleled by bus service. This is true both as to main lines and secondary lines. In all such cases, where the bus service is reasonably adequate it would seem that under present conditions the local train service should be discontinued and the equipment placed in more important uses. This should be done in spite of some degree of local dislocations and inconven - iences, for the war-time needs of the nation must be paramount. I understand that about 180 separate applications are now pend - ing before various State Commissions. I earnestly request, that disposition of all of these cases be expedited and as many as pos - sible granted." In addition to daily bus service, daily except Sunday mixed train service still remains, and applicant should not be compelled to continue operating the motor trains at "heavy monthly losses" awaiting the possi - bility that once again the general public will depend upon rail transporta - tion. As was stated by the Supreme Court in the Burlington train case," if the situation should change along the line "the regulatory power of the Nebraska railway commission will be available to the public for cor - rective remedies." All factors considered, as have above been outlined, the Commission is of the opinion that said application should be granted. i ¦ ¦ ¦ ¦ : ¦ ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the application of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company for authority to discontinue operation oi passenger motor trains Nos. 163 and 164 between South Sioux City and O'Neill, Nebraska be, and it is hereby granted effective September Ist, 1942. </seg>

Larson • COMMISSIONER GOOD DISSENTING: This application as instanced in the majority opinion was made prior to our involvement in an over-seas war. At the then incident hearing, it was purely a matter of lack of revenue upon which applicant based Us contention for removal of these trains without substituting a compensa - tory service. Applicant stressed in its presentation and exhibits that although they were passenger trains, that comparatively few passengers were carried thereon, hence they should be abandoned. As a matter of fact these trains are mail, express and cream trains and more importantly so than might be implied as designated passenger trains and the revenues derived therefrom are substantial and gaining in volume.' The matured and maturing crops obviously indicates an increasing revenue incident thereto, and so it happens that with the prospective increase of business for these trains plus the fact that the system revenues are now greatly increased, and increasing, that the argument for removal hovers' now around war's emergency and the alleged use the equipment and men which might be released would have towards winning the war. Analyzing these two high lights I would say. - •••".¦'¦•:"¦ Ist This equipment although rendering an all but indispensible service, is of such character that it is wholly outmoded. It could not be bought now, nor could it have been obtained new for several years prior to war's alarms. It is recognized as obsolete and repairs are difficult or impossible of attainment. Often they must be machined out at a very high cost. Further the motorized unit has but 275 horse power, said power being wholly inadequate; trailing, as it does, a passenger car, to make even a reasonable speed,.for this reason alone it is found that bus </seg>
         <seg id="p064">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 64 time between terminals is considerably less than the time consumed by these inadequately powered units. iiid. The motorized unit is not an item that could fit economically into any war work activities, nor could it, U released, take the place of other power units. They could not keep out of the way of other trains. Nevertheless, it is on this branch line performing- a real service to the territory and communities served. It further appears there is no place (or the men displaced. They would be in line tor other jobs when open - ings developed. Revenues Discussed Exhibit No. 10 sets up assigned revenues, out-of-pocket expenses and net loss from operation of these motorized trains. It appears that these trains are manned by a motorman, conductor, and a combined baggage man and brakeman, whose wages appear in the exhibit.: A postal clerk also serves on the train, who is not on the rail payroll. Total wage for train operation was $15,471 for 1939 and $15,067 for 1940, or 15 J4 cents per train mile. Fuel, lubricants, round house, cleaning, etc., 11.7 and a total expense of operation for 1939 and 1940 respectively, of 0.3351 and 0J304 cents per train mile., while the assigned revenues were 0.2601 and 0.2460 respectively per train mile. ; For the year 1939. (Ex. 10) the item of repairs — motor cars, passen - ger cars, freight cars and locomotive aggregates $6,498 or 6.9 cents per train mile, or $17.80 per day for repairs. If we add to said 6.9 cents per train mile for repairs to the amount charged for fuel, lubricants, round house expense of 11.7 cents, we find the amount per train mile to be 18.6 cents. . It is a matter of common knowledge that on the famous non-stop' run on the Burlington Zephyr trip from Denver to Chicago, 1,034. miles :. in 1935, that the expense for fuel and lubricants was approximately two cents per train mile. It is freely admitted that such a motorized unit as here discussed is expensive of operation, outmoded and obsolete — that Diesel motorized trains of multiplied weight, power and efficiency, operate at a fraction of fuel and repair expense as compared with said outmoded and obsolete equipment. It appears established in rate cases, and it is held by accountants and commissions that the public must not be penalized by high rates, when modernized equipment would produce lower operating unit costs.

For comparative purposes we find that passenger train deficits . constitute less than nine per cent of total rail deficits for said line. It is notable that, if a passenger travels but ten mites on this, or other branch lines; and notwithstanding he may continue hundreds of miles beyond; yet in the allocation of revenues'the branch line'receives credit for only the said ten miles. And what is said here pertains likewise to freight revenues, all to the disadvantage, in accounting for revenues, of branch lines.

Third, the cost of fuel per train mile is beyond all amount that mi",ht be considered reasonable. It is not unreasonable to assume that the revenue assigned by appli - cant i.e. for 1939. 0.2601 and f0r)1940, 0.2460 per train mile, would not, if modern equipment were used balance the out-of-pocket expense of opera - tion. However if a speedy single power mail express and passenger unit were placed in service, it is reaspnable to expect that then businees would automatically increase. It is a matter of common knowledge that a large bus operates at a cost of approximately 16 cents or less per bus mile. Milk and cream. Recognizing as a fact that the area incident to these trains opera* tions has had an unprecedented era—some 7or 8 years—of drought, we must further recognize that the cow and hen have largely been the sustaining factors throughout those years.

         <seg id="p067">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 67 Passenger Deficits (Bdwards Exhibit) T It is a matter of common knowledge that passenger train operation in general develops a tremendous deficit, as relates to the whole United States. It would appear inconsistent and arbitrary to hold that branch line operation must pay its way, or such service be abandoned, while general passenger operation in the whole United States produces results as herein portrayed. I am here quoting from Commission's Exhibit No. 24, said exhibit was introduced at a hearing held before the Interstate Commerce Commission at St. Louis on July 10, 1940 and is known as ; Edwards exhibit, The said Ford T. Edwards, being an I, C..C. economist and witness. ./ ¦'.' ,::'. ¦ .;¦.'. ¦¦:", ¦¦, ' ¦"¦;. . ;¦.-.. ¦¦/.'¦¦• 'Under column designated "Passenger deficits" (P.

From testimony it appears that the motor power unit has no accom - modation for passengers, so a passenger car must be attached. The cost incident to care of and upketep of said attached car, adds very materially to the expense of operation. It is a known fact that many gasoline elec - tric units have a seating capacity ior 20 to 30 people, which would be very competent for such essential service as is no-w rendered much more ex - pensively. ¦ ; ¦'_.' ¦; .'•¦ .."¦'. .¦.-.¦."¦¦¦'¦ ¦" '. ... "¦-¦.¦•; Released if Trains Discontinued. If this service might be discontinued it would release two outmoded gas-electric power units quite valueless for any service elsewhere. The . trailer cars are not such as would be used in main line operation. Further, discontinuance would necessitate establishment of truck transportation of mail, thus burning up rubber, a critical material, while the rails grow rusty. . : - .V Attorney for the company stresses that inasmuch as passenger busi - ness on these trains is very light—see exhibits —that the operation of these trains has outlined its essential service to the public However, other than passenger service appears to be of very distinct service. As a matter of computation from exhibits the revenues from passenger trans - portation is but approximately 23 per cent of the total train revenue. Postmaster at Plainview testified that on day o! hearing 15 sacks 6i mail was received from these trains.

         <seg id="p068">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 68 It is worthy of special notice that there are no other rails paralleling this line in any part of the large area served. That adequate service would remain, to even a majority of towns and communities affected, lacks proof. The burden of said proof must be established beyond reasonable doubt by applicant company. Much testimony was adduced that reasonable service would not remain, by respondent witnesses. "One of the duties of a railroad company doing business as a com-: mon carrier is that of providing reasonably adequate facilities for serving the public. This duty arises out of the acceptance and enjoyment of the powers and privileges granted by the state and endures so long as they are retained. It represents a part, of what the company undertakes to do in return for them, and its performance cannot be avoided merely because it will be at - tended by some pecuniary loss." In C. &amp; O. R.

It seems this comprehends use of Missouri river bridge, depot and track facilities at Sioux City. This item is of an out of state nature and beyond our jurisdiction. ¦ Depreciation It is a matter of common knowledge that the Interstate Commerce Commission requires that a depreciation reserve fund be set up to pro - vide capital for replacement of equipment when it has completed its service life or becomes outmoded, or obsolete. So we know that provi - sion has been made for retirement but the company has not used, in this instance, the funds set up for the explicit purpose indicated. The last annual report to this Commission indicated there was an unused depre - ciation reserve of $84,805,613.00. Petitions A considerable number of well signed up petitions from towns and areas that would be affected have been presented to this Commission and although they are not accepted as exhibits —the signers not being avail - able for cross examination — they are accepted for the Commission files on the pending matter. </seg>

Protesting witnesses appeared and testified, and -weie represented by counsel. Marion is an unincorporated village of approximately 75 inhabitants, in Red Willow County, on the St. Francis Branch of the McCook Urn - sion of applicant's railroad, 4.44 miles west of Danbury and 11.76 miles east of Traer. Kansas, both of which are open-agency station'!. Train service consists of a passenger motor, daily except Sunday, west - bound through Marion at 10:32 A.M., and eastbound at 5:18 P.M., and a tri-weekly freight, westbound on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and eastbound on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Additional freight service is furnished when needed. •¦-..' The patrons of the Marion station now receive custodial service, which the applicant railroad was authorized to substitute for agency service February 20, 1940. Previously, authority had been granted for discontinuance of telegraph service December 20, 1930. Accounting work for the Marion station is done by the Agent at the nearby station of Dan - bury. ¦'. Marion is 4J4 miles-west of Danbury, population 236, on State High - way No. 89. a gravel-surfaced road which connects with U. S. Highway No. 83 five miles west of Marion, fifteen miles south of McCook, Highway No. 83 is a hard-surfaced road and thus the people of Marion are afforded access to the network o5 State and Federal highways throughout the state. SeveTe drought conditions suffered by the surrounding territory for a number of years have been at least partially responsible for a serious decline in the general business and commercial activities carried on in Marion. The one store handles a small stock of groceries and other arti - cles. The post office has a small grocery stock in connection,and there is a garage or blacksmith shop which operates a service gas pump. The lum - ber yard is not operating at present. There are 8 vacant buildings oh the main street and Marion has been without banking facilities for many years. Two elevators operated by Morrison-Gregg-Mitchell Grain Co., with a capacity of about 60,000 bushels are on the railroad right-of-way, as are also coal sheds and a stock yards. "'"... The present station building which the applicant has requested aur thority to remove, is a two-story building in good condition, 20x40 feet, with office, waiting room and freight room on the ground floor, and four living rooms upstairs. The applicant desires to move this building to Herndon, Kansas where an improved building is needed. It was esti - mated that a new building at Herndon would cost approximately $4,000. </seg>
         <seg id="p071">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 71 It was estimated that it would cost approximately $1,450.00 to move the Marion station building to Herndon, make necessary improvements there and to substitute and properly install a car body at Marion. The carry - ing out of this plan would save'the railroad in the neighborhood of $2,550.00. ; Applicant's witnesses testified that should application be granted, the car body will be located where the present depot now is, and the present platform will be used. The car body will be 9 feet wide, 40 feet long and 10 feet high. It will be partitioned with ample space provided for the office, waiting room and freight room. The office and waiting room will be lined; windows will be installed; a stove, benches and kero - sene lamps will be provided, and the building will be painted. "MARION" signs will be painted on either end of the building and efforts will be made to make it attractive. Similar, car bodjes are now in use at Beards, ley, Wheeler, and Blakeman on the St. Francis Branch. It was stated that the space provided by the car body will be more than ample, and that it will be kept in presentable condition. The applicant introduced an exhibit' showing the revenues at the station o£ Marion for the years 1939,1940,1941 and the first five monthi of, 1942. The exhibit credited the station with 50 per cent of revenue de - rived from carload shipments received at Marion; originating on the C. B. &amp; Q. and from those forwarded at Marion, destined to points on the C. Bi &amp; Q.; 100 per cent of the actual C..8. &amp; Q. revenue on inter - line shipments originating or terminating at Marion; 100 per cent of all L.C.L revenues, ticket sales, milk and cream, and the net express revenue.

Four car - loads of cattle had been shipped in 1940; 7 in 1941, and 3 to June 1,1942. Applicant's witness testified that the custodian should meet all trains, keep the station open, clean and warm; order cars from the accounting station; have cars spotted for loading and unloading, and .that he handles express business. A representative of the superintendent of the Division stated that there had been no complaints received in regard to either the services of the custodian at Marion, or the service rendered by the Agent at Danbury. The custodian is also manager of the elevator and when not at the depot can be found at the elevator, a block away, or at his nearby home. &gt;• ' ¦¦:* Custodial service is now rendered at a cost to the applicant, in- wages and payroll taxes of $381.60 a year. Non-telegraph agency service would cost $1,634.76 a year and telegraph agency service would cost $1,998.00. In regard to the movement of grain, it was testified, that on account of lack of available storage facilities at central markets and the increase oi grain in storage, the movement oJ grain will be more gradual and consequently less of a burden on the agents and station facilities. There were 600 feweT cars of wheat moved on the McCook'Division this year. A transportation inspector for the applicant testified that both of the grocery stores receive most of their merchandise by truck. He testified that livestock moved from the territory was largely trucked to Denver^ or to sales barns. Exhibits were introduced showing a schedule of a bus line serving the town of Marion; a list of private carriers serving Marion with their own trucks and a list of common carriers authority to serve Marion, and a statement of their authorities. .'¦¦' ;' .'."'

He also testified that there were two other livestock shippers who live at or near Marion. . . : , Protestant witnesses testified generally to the greater production of small grain in the community; that there was an increase in the raising and feeding of livestock on the farms in the Marion territory, and that a large part of the wheat produced was now being stored on the farms. One witness especially stated his opinion to be that the return of normal crop conditions would create more business in the next four or five years. The main argument advanced by the protestants in support of their cross-petition for the restoration of agency service was the increase in the movement of grain.

         <seg id="p074">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 74 GOOD, Dissenting: ' - - This is the fourth time the company has sought permission of this Commission to reduce its service at the town of Marion. In the. instant case the said Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad did attempt to take from the town of Marion, the station depot located thereat, and move said depot out of the state and all without permission of this Commission which is given positive statutory jurisdiction in such cases. When the matter was brought to the attention of this Commission, that operations to that end were actually on the way of execution, this Commission caused said operations to cease. The company then filed an application with the Commission, to the end that they be allowed to move the depot to the town of Herndon, which is in the state of Kansas. A cross petition was addressed to the Commission by Donald E. Kelley, representing the people of Marion and vicinity, asking that an agency be reinstated at said town, and the two cases were held jointly at McCook on July 23rd, 1942. The company witnesses indicated that they would substitute a glorified box car for the two story building they would remove. Perhaps the said box car body would better serve this war emer - gency of transportation necessities if it might be left to function in the field of its original design. : ¦ • ¦ Exhibit No. 1 reflects the company's allocated revenues for the years 1939. 1940. 1941 and 5 months of 1942. It is notable that the years 1939 and l°4o reflects the extreme end of 8 or 9 years of drought. The al - located revenues for these years was $3,889 and $980 respectively. From evidence adduced it appears that a fair crop was harvested in 1941, and the allocated revenue was then $9,633, or approximately ten times that of the prior unprecedented year. ¦ The exhibit in its portrayal of the first 5 months of 1942 reflects an allocated revenue of $5,703, or $1,140 per month. Undisputed evidence at the hearing was that a heavy crop of wheat was then being harvested, that the soil had an abundance of moisture, and it is now common knowl - edge that a very good corn crop is all but assured. There appears no credit allowance in company exhibit for the mail mileage revenue which Commissions have held properly allocable to station revenues. Halving the distances to adjacent stations we would find that said distance to be 5 miles and twice daily. The usual compensa - tion for transportation of mail on branch lines is 14J4 cents per mile or 72.5 cents daily, .

However, the rail com - panies elect in recent years to allocate revenues, alleging that one half should be credited to the originating or receiving station. From said records with the Commission, an exhibit designated No. 2 was prepared and submitted reflecting gross revenues for said station of Marion. This shows revenues for the years 1917 to 1928, inclusive— 12 years —said years being prior to applications to discontinue station agency. For this period, the gross revenue was $373,12171. Thus the average gross revenue was $31,093.47. If this be halved to approximate the allocable revenue we would establish the amount of $15,546.73. From this if we deduct $1,600 agency cost we would find the station revenue above the agency cost to.be $13,94673. For this period'the agency cost was approximately 5 per «nt of the gross revenue. Illustrative of greatly improved crop conditions now obtaining, 1 cite from exhibit that for the S month period of 1942 therein depicted the total is $5,703.43. For identical months of the thsee prior years the ' revenues were as.follows: ; ; \ ; &#132; . ¦;'¦ 1939 ._......... ..._...__..;..51,845.64 1940 _..... „ 470.15 1941 &#132;;,.;. .¦;..' .•".¦'.; / , .i,7Q7-i«i ¦ /'Ph. - • rV- ¦'¦¦¦¦;'-:.:v.:".;&gt; :':"¦:¦,;¦'.';'¦¦:¦¦ '¦: Hiw^s -./,.'' ;"... The 1942 revenue (5 months) was $5,703.43. This shows that the 1942 revenue is' more than the total aggregate of the five identical months by $1,590, which reflects conclusively that business conditions at Marion have vastly improved; All incident to crop increases of the year 1941.

Without giving weight to said crops of 1942, as being greater than that of the preceding identical months, I find that the five' months of said year did produce $5,703.43, or $1,140 per months, which if extended for the year would produce, at that rate the sum of $13,680. Bear in mind that this is allocated revenue. If we esti - mate that said allocated revenue is but one half of the gross revenue then we would find the total gross revenue to be $27,360. :.--.. Recognizing the very notable increase in station revenues at Marion, incident to the ending of a prolonged era of drought, it is worthy of note that rail attorneys appearing in station closing cases before this Commis - sion, usually make a statement to the effect that when revenues increase to an approach of normalcy, they will gladly restore an agent to replace a. caretaker, and at the stations of Tarnov and Foster (C. &amp; N.W.) this has been done by said rail company. This assurance has likewise been ex - pressed by this Commission and in this identical case of Marion, as wit - ness in the "Opinion, Findings and Order" wherein the rail company was given authority to discontinue its agency at the station of Marion, and to substitute a custodian or caretaker thereof, and the Commission ex - pressed its attitude in these words. However, if and when general busi - ness conditions reach a standard of normalcy, this CommiMion will gladly entertain a petition asking for a re-instatement of the agent (Emphasis is mine.) Statutory State Provisions Re Station change from full agency to caretaker; Minnesota—lf station has a gross revenue of $8,000 per annum, Commission is without jurisdiction. North Dakota—lf station has a gross average revenue of $6,000 for the past three years, Commission is without jurisdiction. It is obvious that from the rails own exhibit that a station with such a revenue is entitled to a full time agent in either of these states.' . I have made diligent search from many volumes of Utility Commis - sion Reports and fail to find a single instance, where in a purely agri - cultural area a station with so good a revenue showing as has Marion, has been authorized to substitute a caretaker for an agency station.; After a careful study and analysis of the known facts and evidence in the case submitted, I find I cannot agree with the Opinion, Finding and Order of the majority members of this Commission, and front their decision I hereby formally dissent.

Service and) Supplement No. 1 Close its Station at Holmesville, Nebraska.) OPINION, FINDING AND ORDER LARSON, Commissioner: • Notice having been given all interested parties this matter came on for public hearing in the Court House at Beatrice, Nebraska on the 2nd day of November, 1942. Several citizens of Holmesville appeared in op - position to the granting of the application. . This is the third request of the applicant to close said station. Ap - plication No. 11861, after hearing and consideration of the facts, was de - nied on July 14, 1936.. Application No. 13957, after Hearing and con - sideration, was denied on the 11th day of May, 1940. :¦':¦ The evidence disclosed that Holmesville, Gage County, Nebraska, is an unincorporated village of 114 people (1940 census) located on the Manhattan branch of the Kansas Division of applicant's railroad, 8.9 miles south of Beatrice and 4.6 miles north of Blue Springs, both of which are open-agency stations. The territory adjacent and tributary is wholly agricultural and the station is used principally for the shipment of live - stock, agricultural products, lumber and coal. Holmesville fa approxi - mately ,9 miles southeast of Beatrice and 5 miles north of Blue Springs by County Highway. / '¦';"¦ , . At the present time the" Holmesville station is served by an agent - operator, daily except Sunday from 8:00 A.M. to 12 and from 1:00 P.M. to 5:00 P.M. The present train service consists of a local freight north bound at 11:45 A.M. and south bound at 12:15 P.M. There is also a time freight north bound at 6:05 P.M., south bound at 3:25 A.M. Passen - ger motor service was discontinued in January of 1942. No change in train service is contemplated at this time. : ¦ ¦ The revenue statement offered by applicant shows the actual amount, credited to the Holmesville station from all sources as follows: 50% of all carload business received or forwarded at Holmesville which originates and terminates on the Union Pacific Railroad, called "Local" freight; 100% of the actual line haul revenue accruing- to the Union Pacific on carload and L.C.L. shipments originating at Holmesville and destined to points on other railroads and on those originating on other railroads and delivered at Holmesville; 100% of all local L.C.L. shipments received or • forwarded from the station, ticket sales and milk, and cream. revenue. .On that: basis the total revenue credited to the station for the years 1937, 1938, 1939, 1940, 1941 and the first 9 months of 1942 was $2,575, $2,498, </seg>
         <seg id="p078">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 78 $2,585, $3,815, $1,760 and $1,761, respectively. The express business has been nominal. The gross revenue for such business amounted to $111.01 for the first 9 months of 1942. The expense of agent's salary and payroll taxes for the 12 month period ending September, 1942 was $1,754.42. The Assistant Superintendent testified that there was a shortage of telegraphers; that it has not been possible to obtain as many teleg - raphers as needed and that the granting of this application would not result in anyone's unemployment Applicant proposes to discontinue the agency service and dose the depot and to handle the business from either Blue Springs or Beatrice. The waiting room of the depot would remain unlocked and shippers would leave their L.C.L. and cream shipments there until arrival of the train and picking up by the train crew. Billings would be handled from one of the open stations above mentioned. Inbound shipments would be 1' ft in the waiting room by the train crew and picked up by the consignee. Holmesville is served by two telephone companies, one of which fur - nishes free service to Blue Springs and the other free service to Beatrice. The applicant's Assistant Superintendent testified in detail as to th.c manner in which billings on outbound shipments of grain, livestock and L.C.L. merchandise would be handled. It was testified that carload busi - ness could be handled with slight inconvenience to the shipper. W. F. Steinmeyer who operates the grain elevator and is a dealer in livestock and who furnishes the railroad with the bulk of its business at the Holmesville station testified that the increases in business expected at the time of the previous hearing had not materialized largely due to the storage of grain on farms and in the elevator, caused by the shortage of space at terminal elevators. While the volume of business transacted at the Holmesville station does not justify the expense of maintaining agency service, it is, how - ever, sufficient in amount to warrant caretaker service. By reason of all the facts and circumstances appearing in the record the Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the application of. the Union Pacific Railroad Company for authority to discontinue agency service and close its station at Holmesville, Nebraska should be denied as to the closing of the station, but should be granted as to discontinuance of agency service providing that caretaker service is substituted. Should the service rendered by the caretaker later prove to be in - adequate, or even unnecessary, the Commission has continuing Jurisdic - t;on to entertain an application for a further change in service. </seg>

         <seg id="p080">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 80 application was set for public hearing in the District Court Room at Holdrcge on the 29th day of April, 1942 and interested parties .were notified. Oral testimony and documentary evidence were received and the case was closed and submitted upon the record. Under date of November 19, 1940 the Commission entered its order denying the original application after a similar public hearing at Holdrege and the instant request was submitted upon a new application docketed in this case as a supplement. The record in the instant case reveals that Atlanta is an incorporated village oi approximately 173 inhabitants located in Phelps County, Ne - braska on the Chicago-Denver main line oi applicant's railroad. It is ap - proximately 7.4 rail miles west of Holdrege and 15.5 rail miles east of Oxford, both being open-agency stations on said railroad. 24 hour sta - tion service is available at Holdrege. The territory surrounding Atlanta is wholly agricultural and its station is used principally for carload ship - ments of grain during the harvest season, agricultural products, coal and lumber. Acording to the 1930 Federal census the population before the drouth era was 207. At the present time there is but one general merchan - dise store and one elevator. Another elevator has not been in service for over two years. Sevetal business houses and residence properties are now vacant. There are no railroad facilities for handling livestock or petroleum products. U. S. improved highway No. 6-34 passes through Atlanta in a easterly-westerly direction through the state paralleling ap - plicant's railroad. An agent-operator is on duty at said station between the hours of 8 and 5 each day except Sunday. The present local train service consists oi the daily Pioneer Zepher westbound through Atlanta at 3:30 P.M. and eastbound at 6:19 A.M. Several through passenger trains pass through without scheduled stops and while the agent is not on duty. Tri - weekly freight service is scheduled through Atlanta between 2 and 5 P.M., westbound on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and eastbound on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Numerous heavy freight trains pass through Atlanta along the main line, more particularly during the night. The agent is not used in dispatching trains as they all operate un - der automatic block signals. The Burlington Transportation Company operates three westbound bus schedules between Omaha and Denver passing through Atlanta at approximately 5:10 A.M., 2:30 P.M. and 11:50 P.M. and eastbound at approximately 1:30 A.M., 7:30 A.M. and 6:00 P.M. daily. That company also operates a daily motor freight service between Omaha and Denver serving all intermediate points along applicant's railroad. An exhibit offered by applicant and received in evidence shows the total revenue at the station from all sources including CL and LCL ship- </seg>
         <seg id="p081">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 81 ments received and forwarded, ticket sales, cream revenue, express and Western Union earnings. Figures were compiled for the years 1938, 1939, 1940 and 1941. The exhibit credits the station with 50% of revenue derived from all carload shipments received .and forwarded at Atlanta which originated or terminated on the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co.; 100% of the actual line haul revenue accruing to the applicant on CL shipments origi - nating at Atlanta and destined to points on foreign line railroads and on those originating on foreign line railroads and destined Atlanta; 100% of all revenue accruing on LCL shipments and ticket sales and the net revenue to applicant on milk and cream, express, baggage and Western Union forwarded and received at said station. Based upon the above computation the total revenue credited to the station of Atlanta for the year 1938 from all sources amounted to $8029.87; for the year 1939, the sum of $3529.37; for the year 1940, the sum of $2098.03 and for. the year 1941, the sum of $4947.41. Approximately 94% of the above revenue was produced by carload shipments. The actual out-of-pocket cost of operating the station during 1938 amounted to $1921.64; $1927.54 during 1939; $1950.62 during 1940; and $2026.11 during 1941. ..": Seven witnesses including the elevator operator, the merchant and cream shippers appeared and testified in opposition to the granting of the application. Summarized and. condensed, their testimony was corrobora - tive of inconvenience resulting from a change in station service;. that it -would be difficult to bill out cars of grain and cans of cream; that a cus - todian would not be available at all times and it would be difficult to locate him in order to receive shipments of freight; that the telephone line to Holdrege is crowded and does not offer the best service; that the drouth period is now broken and that much grain and livestock will again move by rail to market therefore necessitating the service of a regular agent. Applicant proposes to substitute the. services of a custodian for those now performed by the agent at. Atlanta. Applicant's witnesses testified that the custodian would live in the depot if he so desired; would keep the station open, dean and warm; would secure and furnish information relating to train service; order cars for shippers; have cars spotted for loading or unloading; secure rates and routing for shippers; furnish in - formation to the agent at Holdrege in billing out shipments; LCL ship - ments would be loaded or unloaded from trains and placed in the depot; loss and damage claims would be noted and information forwarded, to the Holdrege station; consignee would be notified of the arrival of shipments; express shipments would be handled in the same" manner as at present; the-custodian would not sell tickets or accept money for freight ship - ments; the present free telephone service would remain available in the depot for the use of shippers calling the agent at Holdrege; passengers would pay their fares directly to the conductor who would also check their baggage if desired; cream shipments would be billed by.the train baggage - man; the station would be known as a "prepaid station"; Western Union </seg>
         <seg id="p082">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 82 messages would be telephoned to the office at Holdrege; station records for Atlanta would be kept separately by the agent at Holdrege. Under the proposal applicant would effect a saving of approximately $1500.00 annually. The witness further testified that due to the existing war emergency man power is becoming more difficult to acquire and retain; that younger men serving as students and apprentices in the railroad industry are be - ine drafted and are enlisting in the armed forces of our country; that under the new labor agreements now in effect vacation periods are man - datory and that the actual shortage of man power is critical. Many factors must be considered in determining the issues presented and each case must be disposed of on its own merits. Factors such as the volume of business done at the station; duties of the agent; amount of time necessary to perform those duties; cost of maintaining the agency service; financial loss—if any—to the railroad company; accessibility to the station; proximity to other stations; highway conditions; location of grain and livestock markets; probability of future development; adequate alternative transportation facilities, and due regard for the public welfare in furnishing reasonably adequate rail service in the community. Numerous Supreme Court and Commission decisions from other states might be quoted relative to allocation of revenue between receiv - ing and forwarding stations; period o! time to be considered; duties of a custodian as compared with those of an agent, together with other prob - lems appearing in this case. Suffice to say, however, that the allocation of revenue used in the instant case is similar to that adopted by;various courts and state commissions. We do not have an interpretation by our own Supreme Court but in an application to discontinue motor passenger train service appealed from this Commission's order denying the authority our Court in Chicago B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. v. Commission 138 Neb. 767, 295 N. W. 389, made several observations pertinent here: .; . "•"Conditions of railroad transportation have changed since 1886, when this branch line was constructed, and the revenues during the entire intervening period are not proper measures of earnings and. expenses under present changed conditions. Earnings and ex - penses since 1932, a period suggested by remonstrants for compu - tations, are hot proper measures of present or future profits and losses. Applicant must reckon with conditions resulting in present losses." (Applicant in that case relied upon revenue and operat - ing figures covering a period of 2 years and 9 months) "*?* Motor passenger trains operated on a branch line of railroad at a toss may properly be discontinued, where adequate public transporta - tion is otherwise furnished, though the main line is operated at a profit." . ; </seg>

In the instant case the citizens may. suffer some inconvenience by the change in agents, but that inconvenience, according to the evidence, will be mild in comparison to the losses to be suffered by the company if it be forced to retain the regular. .agent. The facilities demanded here Would not be commensurate : with the patronage and receipts from that portion of the' public to whom the service.is to be rendered. And such is the test to be applied. If the caretaker replaces the agent at Ripley the public may continue to use all means of transportation now ex - isting; only the manner of payment for such service is changed, and in this there is no increase or additional expense worth con - sideration." •'¦: '.••:••¦¦" &#132; .Among other leading cases in which identical questions were pre - sented are: Southern Ry.

Apparently they either forwarded or received all of the shipments shown on the exhibits. Other than during the grain shipping months when most of the wheat goes out of the elevator, the only demand for an agent would be for. the lum - ber, coal, milk and cream and miscellaneous shipments. Less than carload shipments of merchandise are negligible. We do not believe that the </seg>
         <seg id="p084">THfRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 84 general public at the present time, demands the continued services of a lull-time agent at Atlanta as reflected in the evidence and in the revenue figures submitted. Numerous stations of similar size in Nebraska are now being operated by custodians and, with few exceptions, the Commis - sion does not hear of any complaints pertaining to the services furnished to patrons on the various railroads. It appears that in this era of an abundance of transportation facilities, the private automobile and motor busses carry most of the passengers formerly carried by rail, and the motor truck has superseded the rail service in handling most of the LCL shipments. From the statistical exhibits and the testimony, it will be noted that the shipping public is no longer wholly dependent upon appli - cant to furnish transportation facilities to the village of Atlanta. Under the circumstances and after a full consideration of the record in this case and the decisions above mentioned the Commission is of the opinion that the present revenue at Atlanta, the duties performed by the agent, the services furnished by other means of transportation, the short - age of man-power during this war emergency, the requirements of the general shipping public and the general conditions under which the car - rier is operating, require that in the honest, efficient and economical man - agement of applicant's railroad, said application should be granted. If and when business conditions should again reach a state necessitating the services of an agent, this Commission will be available to the public for corrective remedies.

Upon consideration of a motion for rehearing filed by the applicant and argued orally, the Commission va - cated and set aside its order and set the matter'for further hearing on February 13, 1941.

From Scribner to Albion the branch traverses a rich, fertile, productive territory, largely devoted to farming and cattle feeding, about 70 miles long arid 35 miles wide, bounded on the north by the applicant's main line and on the south by the Union Pacific. From Al - bion to Oakdale the branch serves and traverses a well-baJanced agricul - tural territory. In addition: to that part of the territory to the east and several miles to the west, which is devoted to farming and cattle feeding, </seg>
         <seg id="p088">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 88 the territory (or many miles to the west and northwest is well adapted (or, and largely devoted to livestock raising. The Albion branch intersects the Columbus-Norfolk branch of the Union Pacific at Humphrey and connects with the Columbus-Albion branch of the Union Pacific at Albion. Spalding, Pacific is 19 miles due west of Albion. Burwell, the most northerly point on the Aurora-Burwell branch of the Burlington, is 55 miles west and 5 miles north of Albion. The main line of the applicant extends northwest-, erly from Oakdale. The surrounding territory is wholly agricultural, the Creston station being used principally for the shipment of livestock and grain outbound, and livestock, coal, lumber, (arm machinery, building materials and gen - eral L.C.L. merchandise inbound. Open-agency service has been maintained for many years at Creston. Living quarters are furnished in the depot. The expense of maintaining the Creston agency in wages and payroll taxes was $1,804.64 for 1937; $1,892.82 for 1938; $1,873.89 for 1939, and $1,940.54 for 1940. Other ex - penses would remain substantially the same should caretaker service be substituted. The record was not clear as to whether the item of $10.00 per month added to the agent's salary for operating applicant's pump - ing station would still be present under a caretaker. The evidence showed that part of the agent's wages for 1940 included extra payments on ac - count of the operation of main line trains over the Albion branch because oi washouts on the main line. Mixed train service is furnished, operating through Creston westbound on Tuesdays and Fridays at 7:05 A.M., and eastbound on Wednesdays and Saturdays at 1:05 P.M. No change in train service is contemplated at this time. . Several matters were presented at the hearing which emphasized the importance and seriousness of the problems involved in the application and the need for extreme care on the part of the Commission in weighing the evidence and rendering its decision. The applicant introduced an exhibit showing the system income ac - count for the years 1931 to 1940, both inclusive. There were deficits after fixed charges in each of these years which ranged from $6,034,125 in 1931 to the large losses in 1937 and 1938 of $14,811,098 and $15,275,983 respec - tively. These losses were reduced to $9,109,868 in 1939 and to $5,222,369 in 1940. This exhibit can be of little help in determining the merits of the application for if agencies should be discontinued and caretakers sub - stituted because of system deficits, then all stations should be given sim - ilar treatment, leading ultimately to dissolution of the entire system. Careful study of this exhibit does show that many years of large losses is </seg>
         <seg id="p089">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 89 no proof that improvement cannot be made. The deficit of 1938 was re - duced $5,000,000 in 1939 and another $5,000,000 in 1940. Reports subse - quently filed with the Commission revealed further improvement in 1941 of over $6,000,000 resulting in a System profit of $1,460,117. This is the first profit shown in eleven years. This fact, coupled with the improvement made in the system revenues, while under the difficulties of receivership, should assure the patrons and the management that upon the railroad's final emergence from receivership more determined efforts may be possi - ble to meet present day competition. The applicant offered, as exhibits, time studies designed to show the actual amount of the agent's time needed to perform certain duties in - cidental to station operation. The duties enumerated were janitor work, telegraph work, preparing freight and way bills, collecting freight charges, making remittances, assisting in unloading freight, correspondence, wait - ing on the public, working on express shipments and weekly and monthly reports. According to these schedules, idle time was shown as 9.510 minutes out of 12,480 minutes in August 1940, and as 9,210 minutes out oi 12,000 minutes in September 1940. These studies are of little value in making a decision in this case. As the management well knows, the agent should have no idle moments. In numerous cases it has been testi - fied that the agent uses his spare time soliciting business and' otherwise making effort to meet present day conditions. . : Another of applicant's witnesses testified that he was informed that the Albion branch 1940 operating deficit was approximately $40,000 and that the elimination of the expense of the agent's wages at Creston, would reduce the deficit that amount. .If this method of reducing branch line losses were followed to its logical conclusion and all agents removed, there would still be losses, but no business representatives. Abandon - ment would surely result This evidence is of little assistance to the Commission in determining the merits of the matter before it. It should be pointed out, however, that this method of reducing losses entirely over - looks the fact that losses can also be reduced or eliminated by increasing revenues; ¦:;-'¦'¦ - "¦ \ ¦"¦'¦, y' \J ¦ ''. ~: : : - • - . - Below is a tabulation of gross and assigned revenues for the years of 1937, 1938, 1939, and 1940.

Is there any likelihood that the business at the station will increase or improve in the near fu - ture? Can the needs of the patrons of the station be adequately served by the proposed caretaker service? If the proposed change would in - convenience the patrons at Creston, would there be a greater benefit to the applicant? , The revenues allocated to the Creston station are in. excess of the agent's wages and therefor continued operation on the present basis should not be a burden on other traffic of applicant's railroad either on the branch, in Nebraska, or on the system. ¦.."-. Creston is still a substantial community surrounded by a territory wholly of agricultural character which has suffered a serious and pro - longed drought but which is now showing definite improvement. Wit - nesses testified as to an improved crop condition at the previous hear - ing. The business done at the station was approximately as good in 1940 as in 1939. Testimony revealed that there was grain in storage on farms in the community and that there had been an increase in the number of cat - tle. One of the protesting witnesses who had kept weather reports for many years stated that the average rainfall for the vicinity was 27 inches, but that there was only 21.36 inches in 1934; 21.88 in 1935; 16.90 in 1936; 21.37 in 1937; 20.42 in 1938; 14.64 in 1939 and 20.43 in 1940. He stated that the condition in February of 1941 was better than at any time in a period of ten years. Another witness, a resident of the community for 38 years, testified that the recent drought was the only one affecting the Albion branch territory that he knew of. ,'¦ ¦ ' * One Creston shipper paid gross charges to the railroad in 1940 of $3,414.44. The present use of the applicant's facilities by this shipper and other patrons, together with the outlook for the immediate future, points to an increase in the volume of commodities handled. This improvement should have a beneficial effect upon the revenues of applicant. " ' • A subsequent report filed with the Commission substantiated test!- </seg>

Gross earnings for the year of 1941, exclusive of express, were shown to be $9,468.85, of which $7,549.84 repre - sented gross carload business, and $1,685.18 represented gross L.C.L, business. '..••'. ''¦ . .'; ¦ ..- '. ¦ . ¦."¦ ''¦¦. . - . ... ¦¦' ... '. L.C.L. business has remained fairly constant. Its relationship to the carload business on a percentage basis varies with the amount of such carload business. An exhibit was introduced by the applicant showing in detail the L.C.L. shipments forwarded and received at the Creston sta - tion between January Ist and September 30th, 1940, giving the date of each shipment and the name of the consignor or consignee and other data. Careful study of this exhibit discloses that 327 shipments were received, and 22 forwarded. Outbound shipments were made by 8 different ship - pers. Inbound shipments were received by 67 different consignees; seven receiving five or more shipments each, accounted for 244 shipments and 60 receiving four or less, accounted for 83 shipments. The evidence clearly shows that the pickup and delivery, service furnished the patrons at Creston would be discontinued should a caretaker be substituted. The Commission is not called upon here to determine whether the inconven - ience to patrons of the Creston station should a caretaker be substituted would be reflected in further loss of carload business by the applicant. - A schedule is set out below showing the:carload business, both in - bound and outbound, by commodities for the years of 1937 through 1941.

The soil is deep black loam and with normal rainfall can and does produce generous crop returns. It is a matter of common knowledge that at the date of this finding, the soil throughout a large area, of which Creston.is apart, win a most thor - oughly saturated condition. :• . ; ¦ ' ¦¦¦-.„¦ ¦ * '.''¦¦.:'. It is {or comparative purposes, notable that in the past year the Union Pacific asked for and'received permission of this Commission to re-open the agency for six month period at the town o{ Tarnov, popula - tion 98, and at a distance of 15 miles southwest of Creston. The gross total revenue at Tarnov. was $6,196: for the years 1937-1940 inclusive (4 years), or an average revenue of $1,549. Creston has a population of 346 and the gross average revenue for the past five years was approximately $8,292, or over five times that of the neighboring town of Tarnov. It is further a matter of concern that the Creston gross revenue for. 1941 — $9,468, is twice that of 1940. In the files of this Commission are the monthly reports of revenue from each rail station in Nebraska. In the year 1937 these were discon - tinued upon application of all the rail companies operating in the state. From said record statement has been prepared by our Rate Department setting forth the gross station revenues for the years 1917. to and in - clusive of 1937 (21 years) as a summary of this compilation there is re - flected an average gross revenue at Creston of $31,901.80. : '/¦; The obvious reason why revenues have declined at Creston was drought. True the convenience offered by trucks in the transportation of livestock and L.C.L, shipments has caused, some, but not large loss by rail, and is given due consideration in these findings.

However, as relates to the agri - cultural productiveness of this eastern Nebraska farm land, operated by - modern farmers, there can be no question but that, given normal rainfall, the soil and feed lots will produce as much or even more material products requiring transportation as in any era of the past As relates to hours actually required of an agent attending office or other work, it is somewhat comparable with that of a switch crew at minor division points, or a tower or crossing man. Their actual hours or minutes of activity may appear small, but nevertheless they are — like the duties of an agent—quite essential to the operation of a railroad system, a specific duty being to serve the public. ; I hereby concur.

Thomson, Trustee of the) Property of the Chicago and North) Western Railway Company, for authority) APPLICATION NO. 14881 to Discontinue Agency Service at) Emmet, Nebraska, and to substitute Care-) laker service therefor. ) OPINION, FINDING AND ORDER LARSON, COMMISSIONER: This is an application of Charles M. Thomson, Trustee of the'prop - erty of the Chicago and North Western Railway Company in Reorganiza - tion Proceedings, requesting authority to discontinue agency service at Emmet, Nebraska, and to substitute caretaker service therefor. Due no - tice was given all interested parties and the matter came on for hearing in the Court House at O'Neill, Nebraska, on the first day of October, 1941. Protesting witnesses appeared and testified and were represented by counsel. . Emmet is an incorporated village, population 89 (1940 census), in Holt County, Nebraska, on the Nebraska division of applicant's railroad, 8.2 miles west of O'Neill and 9.8 miles east of Atkinson, both of which are open-agency stations. Train service at Emmet consists of a west - bound passenger at 5:44 A.M., and freight at 3:35 P.M., and an eastbound passenger at 1:22 A.M., and freight at 3:10 A.M. all daily. No change in train service is contemplated. </seg>
         <seg id="p095">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 95 Emmet's trade territory was described as extending approximately 25 miles to the north, 25 miles to the south, 5 miles to the east, and 6 miles to the west; the north half being generally devoted to farming, and the south half to the raising of livestock. , ': • , The present cost of maintaining the agent in wages and payroll taxes is approximately $145.00 per month. Testimony of applicant's witnesses disclosed that a large part of this expense would be saved should a care - taker be substituted. The caretaker service proposed for the Emmet sta - tion is similar to that provided at a number of other stations on appli - cant's railroad. : : _ ¦•:.¦ ' "%\ Applicant introduced exhibits showing the revenues at the Emmet station for 1937, 1938, 1939, 1940, and the first four months of 1941. The revenues assigned to the station include 50 per cent of the carload and L.C.L. revenues on shipments received or forwarded at Emmet from or to other points on the Chicago and North Western, called "local freight"; 75 per cent of the actual line-haul revenues on shipments received or forwarded at Emmet from or to points on foreign railroads called "inter - line freight"; all revenues received at said station from ticket sales and miscellaneous charges and the net express revenue. The revenues assigned to the Emmet station as outlined above, using, however, the accepted 100 per cent basis for "interline freight"/ instead of the 75 percent used in applicant's exhibit, were $8,695.03 for 1937, $5,580.74 for 1938, $2,109.72 for 1939, $3,173.53 for 1940, and §458.99 for the first 4 months of 1941. Supplemental exhibits of gross revenue and car loadings, at the Em - met station, were .received for the months of May, June, July and August, 1941, at the time of the hearing and subsequently a report was filed for the months of September, October and November, 1941. A tabulation of gross and assigned revenues is set forth below, cov - ering the years 1937, 1398, 1939 and 1940, and the first 4 months of 1941, showing monthly average's, with the gross revenues for the months of May through November, 1941, and estimate of assigned revenues for that period added, for the purpose of comparison.

They; testified that shipping demand for hay had been limited due to Federal crop restrictions. ; . The carload exhibit shows a substantial increase for the first 11 months of 1941 over the years of 1939 and 1940. The revenue tabulation above shows that gross revenues received during the 7 months of May through November, 1941, totalling $7,767.51 and averaging $1,107.64 monthly, represented a substantial increase over the monthly averages of, any year since 1937. The assigned revenue for the same period would be approximately $3,882.20, an average of $554.60 per month, or more than three times the amount of the agent's wages. Even after combining the revenues for the months of May through November with the excep - tionally small revenues for the first four months of 1941, as set forth in the chart above, it will be observed that the assigned revenues were am - ple to pay the agency expense more than twice over. ' ; On the basis of the decreasing volume of business at Emmet during 1939, 1940 and the first four months of 1941, to the point where the as - signed revenues were actually less than the agent's wages and payroll taxes/the management of the; applicant's railroad was justified in ques - tioning whether there was further public need for its agency service: . The basis for applicant's allegation that an investigation by its repre - sentatives indicated that conditions in and around Emmet were not such as would result in any improvement in business in the near future was proved to be erroneous, not only by testimony of protestant witnesses. </seg>

The extent to which the patrons of the railroad will be inconvenienced by the proposed change must be considered., It would be necessary for the shippers to go to the depot each time they wished to make a tele - phone call, without extra charge, to the agents at either Atkinson or O'Neill. Shippers doing business with their local bank would have to wait for the return of their bills of lading from neighboring agents, or drive nine or ten miles for them. Inconvenience to the patrons would in - crease as their business would increase. Considering all of the facts presented, the relationship between the public's present and future needs, and the present and proposed station service, the present and potential revenues and station expenses, the lack of evidence that either the public or the applicant will benefit by the pro - posed change, and particularly considering the substantial increase in: the amount of business done at Emmet during 1941 and the outlook for the immediate future, and having due regard for the honest, efficient and economical management of the applicant's railroad, it is the opinion of the Commission that this application should be denied.

         <seg id="p100">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 100 IN RE APPLICATION NEBRASKA STATE CHICAGO &amp; N. W. RY. CO. RAILWAY COMMISSION v. ¦¦'.-.. ¦ ¦&#132; '•"¦'. ; 31449 (H2 Neb. 477) December 4,1942 Heard before Simmons, C. J-, Rose, Eberly, Paine, Carter, Messmore and Yeager, JJ. YEAGER, J. . This is an appeal by Charles M. Thomson, trustee of the property of Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railway Company, appellant, from an order of the Nebraska state railway commission, appellee, denying the appellant authority to discontinue the service of an agent at Emmet, Holt County, Nebraska, a station on the line of the Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railway Company, and to substitute therefor a caretaker. The substance of the reason for the application to discontinue the service of the agent at this point is a claim that the business of the sta - tion and the convenience of the shippers do not justify the cost of re - taining an agent at this point, and that the order appealed from is arbi - trary, unreasonable, null and void, and deprives the carrier of its property without due process of law under the state and federal Constitutions. It is pointed out that the cost of maintaining an agent is approximately $1,600 a year, whereas the cost of a caretaker would involve only the fur - nishing of living quarters in the station with heat, water and light. On appeal from an order of the state railway commission, the func - tion of this court is to determine the questions of whether or not the action was unreasonable or arbitrary, and whether or not it exceeded any powers or violated any rule of law. The rule is stated in Furstenberg v. Omaha &amp; C. B. Street R. Co., 132 Neb. 562, 272 N. W. 756, as follows: "On an appeal to the supreme court from an order of the railway commission administrative or legislative in nature, the only questions to be determined are whether the railway commission acted within the scope of its authority and if the order complained of is reasonable and not arbi - trarily made. Where the action of the railway commission is not un - reasonable or arbitrary and does not exceed its powers or violate a rule of law, this court will not interfere with its findings of fact for the reason that they involve adminstrative and legislative rather than judicial ques - tions." ¦ We direct our attention first to a dt-ermination of reasonableness of the order, and for this purpose it has become necessary to examine the evidence adduced by the parties relating to this matter. The record discloses, among other things, that Emmet is a village in </seg>
         <seg id="p101">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 101 Holt county, Nebraska, with an advertised population of 89 inhabitants. It is situated on the line of the appellant and also on state highway 20, which is a main east and west arterial highway. It is 8.2 miles west of O'Neill and 9.8 miles east of Atkinson, which places are also on the line of the railroad. The trade territory of Emmet is estimated to extend 5 miles east, 6 miles west, 25 miles north and 25 miles south. The north half of the territory is generally devoted to farming and the south half to live stock production. The important products forwarded from the sta - tion at Emmet have been hay, grain, grass seed, cattle and hogs. The important products received have been coal, feed; gasoline, fuel oil, oil, potatoes, kerosene, cottonseed cake, asphalt, cattle, sheep, oil meal, agricultural implements and flour. The major portion of the shipments have carload lots. In 1937, 299 carloads were forwarded; in 1938, 135; in 1939, 30; in 1940, 26; and from January to November, 1941, 61. In 1937, 17 carloads were received; in 1938, 25; in 1939, 16; in 1940, 33; and from January to November, 1941, 18. Shipments forwarded from Emmet in less than carload lots for 1937 were 15; 1938, 7; 1939, 2; 1940, 16; and from January to April, 1941, 4. Shipments received at Emmet in less than carload lots for 1937 were 236; 1938, 176; 1939, 202; 1940, 176; and from January to April, 1941, 75. ; Computation based on these items shows 567 inbound and outbound shipments were handled through this station in 1937; 343 in 1938; 250 in 1939; 251 in 1940; from January 1, 1941, to December 1, 1941, 79 carload shipments; and from January 1, 1941, to May 1, 1941, 79 less than car - load shipments. No information is furnished as to less than carload ship - ments from May 1,1941, to October 1, 1941. We have therefore a record of a total of 158 shipments for the period covered in 1941. It will readily be observed that in no full year set forth in the analysis, except 1937 and 1938, was the agent called on to perform service in con - nection with forwarding and receiving freight as often as once per work - ing day even assuming that each carload represented a separate shipment, and this application must be considered in its relation to freight ship - ments since the matter of passenger service was neither presented nor considered. ¦¦'.'...' While it is not conclusive, we think the matter of time necessary to be devoted to the performance of duties by the agent is of very consider - able importance in determining whether or not the commission acted arbi - trarily and unreasonably in denying the application to discontinue the agency at Emmet. If this were the only consideration we could not hesi - tate to say that there was no justification for the retention of this agency. It would not be reasonable to require the carrier to pay the prevailing wage for an agent for the small amount of service required. ,-.:: Historically and legally a common carrier, in addition to being a com - mercial and transportation enterprise for profit, is a public service facility </seg>
         <seg id="p102">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 102 with duties owning to the domain it traverses, and to the people resident. and commercially engaged in the areas tributary to the carrier. Thf necessities, requirements and convenience of the tributary areas must be considered and, moreover, reasonably protected. This application considered in this light brings us to the very definite conclusion that necessity does not require the maintenance of an agent at Emmet. The evidence is conclusive on the proposition that all of the essential service now furnished by an agent may be supplied by a care - taker, however, with a degree of inconvenience. ¦' If abandonment is allowed, no physical facility will be abandoned or changed and no essential service discontinued. The important incon - veniences will be that no paper work may be done at Emmet, no freight bills for either incoming or outgoing freight may be paid there, registra - tion of complaints will have to be made elsewhere, incoming freight bill* will have to be either prepaid or received at an adjacent station where there is an agent, and cars for loading will have to be ordered direct by the shipper or through the caretaker by telephone. There are perhaps other inconveniences, but these are the most important ones. Subject to these inconveniences business would continue as usual at this station; Taking into consideration the amount of service required of an agent, the saving to be effected by substitution of a caretaker, the limited amount of shipping, the fact that no essential shipping service is discontinued, and the prospective inconvenience to the few shippers concerned, we conclude that the railway commission acted arbitrarily and unreasonably in deny - ing the application to discontinue the employment of an agent at Emmet and to substitute a caretaker. It is substantially urged that the income of the station for freight charges results in profit to the carrier and therefore the agency ought not to be discontinued. Of course this is an element to be considered along with all other elements, but assuming that the station is highly profitable to the carrier we know of no rule of law or reason which requires the expenditure of earnings from a particular community in that community contrary to the requirements of reasonable service. We, however, do not assume and we cannot so conclude from the evidence adduced. We could not arrive at a safe and satisfactory conclusion on this proposition without having before us an analysis and accounting of all matters per - taining to operation of this carrier as a system. ;, It is also urged that with the contemplated increase in railroad trans - portation this agency should not be discontinued. This argument » purely prospective and speculative and can have no force or influence here It may well be said that the ruling on this question by the rail - way commission or this court does not amount to an adjudication for the future. It is only a judgment on the condition presented by the applies- </seg>

The towns of Mead and Yutan are but a short distance off this highway on good gravelled roads. State Highway No. 79, a good gravelled high - way, practically parallels applicant's railroad from Lincoln through Ray - mond, Agnew, Valparaiso and'Touhy, and intersects paved U. S.

The Interstate Transit Lines operate one round trip daily serving Wahoo, leaving Lincoln 3:00 P.M., arriving Wahoo 4:30 P.M., arriving Fremont 5:15 P.M., making connection at Fremont with rail and bug schedules both east and west, returning leaving Fremont 6:15 P.M., ar - riving Wahoo 7:00 P.M., arriving Lincoln 8:00 P.M.

Several witnesses from the various towns between Lincoln and Valparaiso, mainly from Raymond, testified to the need oi these trains ior mail express service. However, the evidence shows that.this service so far as the towns between Lincoln and Valparaiso are concerned can be performed as satisfactorily by the remaining motor train, receiving shipments of mail and express at Grand Island coming from Omaha, ar - riving at towns between Valparaiso and Lincoln early in the morning and by mail and express from Lincoln returning to points from Lincoln on motor train No. 540 serving towns between Lincoln and Valparaiso. Appearance was entered by the Lincoln Chamber of Commerce who presented no evidence, and offered no testimony relative to any need of these motor trains. Mr. Placek, representing the Chamber of Commerce at Wahoo, examined applicant's witnesses relative to the need of this motor train arising out of the proposed Government bomb-loading plant near Wahoo and Mead. Since the hearing in this case, war has been declared by the United States against Germany, Italy and Japan and </seg>
         <seg id="p107">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 107 the bomb-loading plant referred to has taken on greater proportions. The matter of transportation for the numerous mechanics and laborers tobe employed at the plant has received a great deal of consideration by this Commission. Conferences have been held with motor carriers furnish - ing bus service from Omaha, Lincoln and Fremont. Possible shuttle train service b also being considered. It will at once be noted, however, that the service furnished by applicant in the instant application can be of little, if any, benefit because of the size and type of the unit operated, schedules, running time and rail distance. Larger trains will be needed if the plant develops as proposed. Already, additional bus service has been author - ized by this Commission between Omaha and the plant and between Fremont and the plant. From information available it will be several months before mass transportation facilities need be available. There is no doubt that the curtailment of service such as proposed herein would result in some inconvenience to persons along the line. It cannot well be denied- that the improvement of highways and the conven - ience, speed, comfort, and flexibility of the automobile and truck trans - portation has: made the competitive feature a serious and important one. It is.expecting too much to believe that travelers.will abandon their use of motor vehicles and return to the slower and more inconvenient service offered by the motor trains. The present case is a good example, with the slow train schedules and the excessive rail mileage. It appears that in this era of an abundance of transportation facilities, the private automo - bile carrying, most of the' passengers, formerly carried by rail and the motor track has superseded most of the rail service in handling most of the L.C.L. shipments. This is especially true in'towns situated, such as are found in this application, all being very close to the metropolitan centers of Lincoln and Omaha, which can be reached by automobile or truck from any point in the territory involved in less than an hour's time. Passenger travel on applicant's trains shows that at no time during the years of 1939, 1940 or 1941 did applicant's trains average as much as two passengers per train mile. In recent similar application filed by the Burlington Railroad to abandon motor train service between Holdrege and Beatrice, the proof revealed a, loss of some $500.00 a month. The Commission denied the application and upon appeal to the Supreme Court of Nebraska in the case entitled C. B. ft Q. R. R. Co. v. CommU - ¦km, 138 Neb.767; 29S N. W. 389, decided December 20, 1940. the Court reversed the Commission's order, and among other things said: * .. \, "??•lncome from passenger traffic, averaging less than two passengers per train mile, is out of all proportion to the cost of operation; as shown by uncontradicted evidence. There is no public necessity for exclusive' passenger trains operated as such without compensable revenue nor is there any competent probative ; evidence' of a material increase.'

They preferred a convenient, speedy and comfortable way to travel on highways constructed and improved at public expense. They started from their own doors. They were not hampered by railroad time tables or limited in speed by motor trains or delayed by stops at stations. It is expecting too much of human nature, of opti - mism, oi forecasts for moisture, and of proper attitude toward the railroad company, to find that trains 97 and 98, if continued, will be substituted for automobiles in the transportation of pas - sengers between Beatrice and Holdrege. Conditions of railroad transportation have changed since 1886, when this branch line was constructed, and the revenues during the entire intervening period are not proper measures of earnings and expenses under present changed conditions. Earnings and expenses since 1932 a period suggested by remonstrants for computations, are not proper measures of present or future profits and losses. Applicant must reckon with conditions resulting in present losses. The slight decrease in the loss occasioned by the operation of the motor passenger trains in 1939 was due in part to dismissal of one member of a train crew. Neither the evidence nor the findings of the commission show a public necessity for trains 97 and 98 as means of transporting passengers between Beatrice and Hol - drege, when the daily service, equipment.and connecting links of trains 102 and 103 are considered with other available services of applicant and of other common carriers. Do the franchises and public duties of applicant require it to operate these passenger trains for the incidental purposes of transporting United States mails, express and cream? It is not a duty of a railroad common carrier to run passenger trains at heavy monthly losses for years on a branch line of railroad after such trains have been abandoned by the public for general and ordinary passenger traffic producing only a small decimal of operating expenses, where adequate facilities and public services are provided by daily mixed-service trains carrying passengers, mail, express and freight, and by other public utilities. Motor passenger trains operated on a branch line of railroad at a loss may properly be discontinued, where adequate public transporta - tion is otherwise furnished, though the main line is operated at a profit."

Instead, all motor cars designated as 275 N.P. units operated on the entire Burlington system were pooled; the cost of labor and repairs added and the total mileage being considered, an average cost per mile of operating 275 N.P. units was ascertained. Multiplying the average cost per train mile by the number of miles operated by the motor in - volved in this case produced $2,437 during 1939; $2,553 during 1940, and $1,713 for the first eight months of 1941. </seg>
         <seg id="p113">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 113 It does not appear that this method of allocation is proper or Correct. Other items shown in the various exhibits offered by applicant were taken from the records. It would seem that labor, and repair costs vary too much in the several stations in which applicant's railroad operates. Geo - graphical topography in the various states in which applicant's railroad operates causes considerable variation in the mechanical wear and tear of such motors. Costs of total complete reconditioning of motors on other lines of applicant's system were added to obtain .the average cost of the repairs to the motors in the instant case. Motors involved in collisions causing costly repairs and replacements were also added. The record is silent as relates to collision, complete overhauling, or compari - son with operating conditions on applicant's system as a whole. \ Other items shown on Exhibit 9, such as "lubricating-and cleaning passenger cars" and "roundhouse service" were not clearly explained. In an application for the discontinuance of train service showing a very nominal loss, in cost of operation compared with the assigned reve - nue income, such as in this case, where the loss was $496 during the first eight months of 1941; $471 during the entire year of 1940, and $1,139 dur - ing 1939, inaccuracy or inappropriate allocation such as herein above re - ferred to could very easily result in a profit instead of a loss. Especially is this true under the decision of the Supreme Court of Nebraska in Chicago, B. ft Q. R. R. Co. v. CommitMon, 138 Neb. 767; 295 N.W. 389, where among-other things this statement was made: . . ••"•???lt is not a duty of a railroad common carrier.to run ..passenger trains at heavy monthly losses for yean on ¦ branch ¦¦"'¦• line of railroad after such trains have been abandoned by the public for general and ordinary passenger traffic producing only a small decimal of operating expenses, where adequate facilities and public services are provided by daily mixed-service trains ' carrying passengers, mail, express and freight, and by other public utilities." (Emphasis supplied.) : . In the instant case "heavy monthly losses for years" does not ap - pear in the record. "Passenger traffic producing only a small decimal of operating expenses" likewise cannot be applied to the instant case. Adequate alternative service is likewise not available in the instant case. Proposed mixed train service does not serve some of the intermediate towns and Star Route mail service is proposed in the event the" motor trains are discontinued. Buses operating over the paved highways be- . tween Lincoln and Columbus do riot serve the immediate towns as they are located some distance away from the improved highways. ¦¦..'¦ 'Since the hearing in this case the Commission must take judicial no - tice of the declaration of war by the United States against Germany and </seg>

Company to Discontinue Operation of) APPLICATION NO. 14957 Passenger Motor Trains 45 and 46 Be-) Iween Lincoln, Nebraska and Ravenna,) Nebraska. ) .-"'.".'.' OPINION, FINDING AND ORDER BY THE COMMISSION: This is an application of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company for authority to discontinue the operation of passenger motor trains Nos. 45 and 46 between Lincoln, Nebraska and Ravenna, Nebraska. After due notice to the various towns along the line between these points, the matter came on for public hearing on October 30th, 1941, at the Yancey Hotel in Grand Island, Nebraska. The trains in question operate over a line of railroad of the applicant extending from Lincoln, Nebraska to Billings. Montana. The towns served by the trains with their respec - tive populations are as follows: Lincoln (81,984); Emerald (125); • Pleasant Dale (140); Milford (759); Ruby (25); Seward (2,626); Tamora' (131); Utica (539); Waco (203); York (5,383); Bradshaw (339); Hamp - ton (310); Aurora (2,419); Murphy (24); Phillips (205); Grand Island (19,130); Ovina (80); Abbott (8); Cairo (411); St. Michael'(26); Ravenna (1,429). At the time of the hearing and for some time prior thereto train 45 was scheduled to leave Lincoln at 10:20 A.M. daily; arrive at Grand Island, 1:15 P.M., and at Ravenna at 2:10 P.M. Train 46 was scheduled to leave Ravenna at 2:45 P.M.; Grand Island 3:36 P.M., and arrive at Lincoln, 6:45 P.M., with stops for each train at all intermediate stations. The rail distance between Lincoln and Ravenna, the termini oi the trains, is 128 miles, and the scheduled running time is 3 hours and 50 minutes westbound, and three hours eastbound. The trains are operated for the purpose of transporting passengers, baggage, express, creamY and United States mails. Their primary function is the transportation of passengers. Applicant also operates over this line between Lincoln and Ravenna two other passenger trains daily in each direction, so that the discontin - uance of trains 45 and 46 will not operate to deprive the traveling public of all passenger train transportation. Previous to 1939, trains 45 and 46 were known as trains 39 and 40 and were operated on about the same schedule. In the early days be - fore the development of the automobile and the building of highways, these trains and the other trains of the applicant over this line provided </seg>
         <seg id="p117">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 117 practically the only means available for the transportation of persons to and from the towns along this line and there was substantial use of the trains for that purpose. As shown by Exhibit 7, as late as 1923 and 1924, there was a large volume of passenger travel on these trains. For in - stance in 1924, train 39 carried from 27 to 36 passengers per train mile. Train 40, from 20 to 29 passengers per train mile. Substantial use of the trains continued with gradual losses until in 1932 train 39 averaged be - tween 4 and S passengers per train mile and train 40 between 5 and 6 passengers per train mile. The use of the trains continued to decline un - til in 1941, as shown by Exhibit 1, traiii 45 averaged 2 passengers per train mile and train 46, 2.8 passengers per train mile. The crew required to operate these trains consists of a motorman, conductor and brakeman — 3 men, and now exceeds the average number of passengers carried. The reason for the discontinuance by the public of the-use of these trains grows out of the building of the highways, the substitution of motor bus service, and the development of the private.automobile. Applicant's line of railroad between. Lincoln and Grand Island is paralleled by an improved hard-surfaced highway. From Lincoln to Seward there are two of these highways, No. 34 and No. 2. No. 2 goes via Woodlawn to Seward and No. 34 via Emerald to Seward. Between Grand Island and Ravenna Highway No. 2 continues westward about 9 miles from Grand Island and then north to Cairo where it parallels ap - plicant's railroad from there to Ravenna. Highway No. 2 passes through, or close -to, every town on applicant's line between Seward and Ravenna. In addition, Highway No. 2 is intersected about every 20 or 25 miles by an. improved highway running north and south. The entire territory be - tween Lincoln and Ravenna is adequately served by a network o/modern improved highways. . ' ' : ; A great many people having occasion to travel between towns on this line, who formerly used rail transportation, now use private automo - biles over the highways. Those who do not have automobiles or do not care to drive them, have available a large amount of highway bus service operated by the Burlington Transportation Co. That company operates 4 schedules daily in each direction between Lincoln and Grand Island, making stops at all of the towns on this line. It also operates one schedule daily in each direction between Grand Island and Ravenna. It is ap - parent that there is adequate public carrier transportation service, both by railroad and highway, available to the communities along this line and that the public no longer relies or uses trains 45 and 46 for passenger transportation. ¦¦¦, .- '¦'¦.'/¦¦ -.." ¦..; :. ¦'¦'_'..¦ . .¦: y': .'¦'•. ; Exhibit 8 shows that trains 45 and 46 for the first 8 months of 1941 werei operated at an out-of-pocket loss of $957.00 per month. The prin - cipal item of revenue arose from the transportation of mail and the total revenue for that period aggregated $13,833.00. The actual out-of- </seg>
         <seg id="p118">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 118 pocket expenses, the principal items of which were wages for the crew, fuel, repairs, and maintenance, for the 8-month period aggregated $21,490.00, making a net loss for the 8-month period of $7,657.00. Since the hearing and submission of the case, the demand of appli - cant's employees for increased wages has been disposed of, with an in - crease approximating 10 per cent, so that at the present time the labor costs both for operation and maintenance are approximately 10 per cent higher than those shown in Exhibit 8, and the loss or deficit arising from the operation of the trains is substantially greater. The calculation of expenses and revenue offered by Mr. Rector, Chairman of the Order of Railway Conductors, is substantially in accord with applicant's exhibit showing revenues and expenses. Some conten - tion was made by protestants that the trains were needed for the trans - portation of the United States mail. The Post Office Department of the United States will provide additional mail service on highways between these points if and when they are convinced by the public that such serv - ice is necessary or required. As pointed out by the Supreme Court of Nebraska in Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. v. Commission, 138 Neb. 767, 295 N. W. 389, it will not be assumed that the Postmaster General will fail to perform his duty to furnish adequate mail service. No objection was made by the Post Office Department to discontinuance of these trains. Representatives of the brotherhoods of locomotive firemen and en - ginemen, railway trainmen, order of railway conductors, locomotive en - gineers, and railroad telegraphers, filed a statement of position and memoradum brief in which it was asserted generally that employees on these trains will be left without employment because of seniority rights and becairse they are over 50 years of age; that the equipment used is obsolete and inappropriate for use in national defense. , " We are of the opinion that Section 75-216, C. S. Nebraska, 1929, pre - cludes the Commission from considering employment relations between the applicant and the brotherhoods. In part that section reads as fol - lows: : ¦¦ "•?•lt is further provided that nothing herein contained shall be construed as giving the state railway commission jurisdiction or control of the relations between the railway companies and their employees and employees' orders, either contractual or otherwise." Jurisdiction of the Commission in this instance is primarily concerned with adequate rail service to the shipping and traveling public. Labor contracts and agreements between employer and employee do not seem </seg>
         <seg id="p119">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 119 to come under our jurisdiction except as they may pertain to safety in operation of trains and in furnishing adequate transportation service to the public and to certain definite statutory provisions. The other con - tentions urged are not material to the question to be determined, and that question is whether or not the trains are reasonably necessary to serve the needs of the public for passenger transportation. Under all of the evidence the Commission is of the opinion that trains 45 and 46 are not needed or used for the transportation of passengers and that the cost of operation far exceeds the revenue they earn; that the public need for transportation, both by railroad and by other means, will be adequately met and taken care of by the trains remaining on applicant's railroad, the motor bus service, and the highway.facilities available, and the Commission finds that the honest, efficient and economical operation of applicant's railroad requires that the application be granted. This is particularly true in the light of the decision of the Supreme Court of Nebraska in a similar case entitled Chicago, Burlington ft Qirincy R. R. Co. v.

F. A. GOOD BEFORE THE NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION In the Matter of the Application of) Charles M. Thomson. Trustee of the) Property of the Chicago and North) APPLICATION NO. 15005 Western Railway Company for Authority) to Substitute a Caretaker for its Agent) at Nenzel, Nebraska. ) OPINION, FINDING AND ORDER LARSON, COMMISSIONER: This is an application of Charles M. Thomson, Trustee of the prop-. erty of the Chicago and North Western Railway Company to substitute a caretaker for its agent at Nezel, Nebraska. Due notice was given to all interested parties, and the matter came on for hearing in the City Hall at Valentine, Nebraska, on the 4th day of December, 1941. Pro - testing witnesses appeared and testified and were represented by counsel. The evidence disclosed that Nenzel is an incorporated village of ap - proximately 125 people, in Cherry County, Nebraska, located on the. Black Hills division of applicant's railroad, 8 miles west of Kilgore and 7.6 miles east of Cody, both of which are open-agency stations. Except for an area south and east of Nenzel, which is devoted to farming, the territory adjacent and tributary to Nenzel is devoted to the raising of livestock. Nenzel is served by U. S. Highway No. 20, a hard-surfaced road which affords direct connection with the network of State and Fed - eral highways. ''¦•:' At the present time, the Nenzel station is served by a part-time non - telegrapher agent. The expense of maintaining the Nenzel agency in wages and payroll taxes was $1,041.60 for 1937, $1,110.47 tor 1938, $1,132.02 for 1939, $1,480.29 for 1940, and $935.86 for the first 8 months of 1941. Should a caretaker be substituted, since there are no living quarters available in the depot building, it will be necessary that hisi </seg>
         <seg id="p121">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 121 wages be entirely paid in cash in an amount not determined at the hearing. The Division Superintendent testified that the on-duty hours of the agent were 8 to 11 A.M., and 12:30 to 3:30 P.M. The protestants testi - fied definitely that the present agent could always be found on duty from 8 to 12 A.M., and from 1 to 5 P.M., and that he was courteous, dependable, and willing to serve. They further testified that the present agent had been stationed there only a month or two. • The train service westbound consists of a passenger train at 8:45 A.M. and freight trains at 8:25 A.M. and 10:15 P.M.; eastbound, passen - ger train at 8:25 P.M. and freight trains at 7:20 A.M. and 5:37 P.M. Applicant introduced exhibits showing the revenues at the Nenzel sta - tion for 1937, 1938, 1939, 1940, and the first 8 months of 1941. The reve - nues assigned to the station include 50 per cent of the carload and L.CL. revenues on shipments received or forwarded at Nenzel from or to other points on the Chicago and North Western, called "local freight"; 75 per cent of the actual line-haul revenues on shipments received or forwarded at Nenzel from or to points on foreign railroads, called "interline freight"; the gross revenues received at said station from ticket sales; and miscel - laneous charges, and the net proportion of express charges. The revenues assigned to the Nenzel station, as outlined above, using, however, 100 per cent instead of 75 per cent, as the basis for "in - terline freight," were $7,642.55 in 1937, $5,416.90 in 1938, $4,085.68 in 1939, $5,632.01 in 1940, and $1,79&amp;02 in the first 8 months of 1941. Because of seasonal variations in traffic volume, the total of $1,798.02 for the first 8 months of 1941 is not a definite indication of what the reve - nue would be for the entire year of 1941. Careful study of the month by month figures shown in the 6th and last columns of Exhibit No. 1, shows that the business done in the first 8 months, represented 63 per cent of the entire year's revenue in 1937, 47 per cent in 1938, 49 per cent in 1939, and 70 per cent in 1940, or an average for the 4 years of 58 per cent.. The assigned revenues for the first 8 months of 1941 are hot conclusive as to what the future volume of business at Nenzel will be, and are still sub - stantially in excess oi direct station expense: The reduction in volume in 1938 from that of 1937, and in 1939 from that of 1938, would have indicated a further reduction in 1940, but instead there was an actual increase in 1940 over that of 1939 of 40 per cent. : ;• The totals of freight forwarded, as shown by the 2nd and 3rd col - umns of Exhibit No. 1 for the years 1937, 1938, 1939, 1940, and the first 8 months of 1941 are comparatively small, representing less than .10 per cent of the freight received during the same period, shown in' Columns 4 and 5, $2,561.63 forwarded and $27,137.75 received. Protestant witnesses testified as to their need for service at Nenzel for incoming freight be- </seg>
         <seg id="p122">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 122 cause of its being their trading point. They also testified that the small amount of forwarded shipments was partly due to the railroad's lack of stock-watering facilities at Nenzel, which made it necessary for them to ship their livestock from either Cody or Kilgore. -.-•-.- ¦¦'. / Testimony of protestant witnesses indicated dissatisfaction. with the service rendered by a previous agent. They stated, however, that the services rendered by the present agent were satisfactory and that they would increase their business with the railroad on that account. Giving careful consideration to all of the facts presented and espe - cially to the relationship which the needs and requirements of the public bear to the applicant's revenues and cost of maintaining the agency, it is the opinion of the Commission that this application should be denied. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the application of Charles M. Thomson, Trustee of the property of the Chicago and North Western Railway Company, for au - thority to substitute a caretaker for its agent at Nenzel, Nebraska be, and the same is hereby denied. ¦ MADE AND ENTERED at Lincoln, Nebraska this 2nd day of January, 1942.

         <seg id="p124">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 124 for a caretaker. The matter was heard at Valentine, Nebraska, before the railway commission on December 4, 1941. On January 2, 1942, the commission entered an order denying the application. On January 12, 1942, the applicant filed a motion for rehearing, which was denied Jan - uary 28, 1942, and on February 18, 1942, applicant filed with the com - mission notice of intention to appeal and a cost bond which was fully approved. The case comes here for review on the record. . The record discloses that the incorporated village of Nenzel, with a population of 125, is 7.6 miles east of Cody, Nebraska, and 8 miles west of Kilgore, Nebraska, in Chewy county. The chief traveling auditor of the railroad prepared exhibits containing statistics as to revenues and traffic expenses of the station, which are found in the record as exhibits 1 to 6, inclusive. The exhibits were prepared on the basis first of gross revenue. They likewise contain the subject of the traffic received and forwarded, and show items and the expense of operating the station with an agent: than a comparison of such expense with that of the average station on the whole system. Exhibit 1 is a statement of the gross reve - nue as follows: In 1937, $14,899.27; in 1938, $10,415.19; in 1939, $7,699.52; ' in 1940, $10,987.88; in the first eight months of 1941, $3,211.55. Exhibit 1-A shows gross revenue $833.58: local revenue $387.36; gross passenger revenue $70.21. for the period of September and October, 1941. Exhibit 2, having to do with the traffic involved, shows the following: 1937, 132 carloads received, 79 of which contained gravel for road-build - ing: 1938. 47 carloads received consisting of corn, coal, cotton seed cake, feed, etc.: 1939. 43 carloads received, consisting of cotton seed cake, coal, posts, feed, etc.: 1940, 84 carloads received, of which 34 cars contained gravel and 15 cars asphalt for road-building; the first eight months of 1941, 14 carloads received, of which seven were coal, two posts, four cotton seed cake, and one gravel. Outbound movement of L. C. L. (less carload lots) and carload traffic: 1937, 20 cars of cattle, one car of hay; 1938, five cars of cattle: 1939, eight cars of cattle; 1940, two cars of cattle; and the first eight months of 1941, one car of cattle; September and October. 1941, three cars of cotton seed cake and four cars of cattle received. Exhibit 2 shows L.C.L. to average less than one shipment per day on the "received" and one shipment every four days on the "for - warded." . . "'.. Exhibit 3 is a statement of the station expenses from 1937 to and including August, 1941. under the heading "Station Labor," which means the agent's salary: 1937, $982.64; 1938. $1,047.61; 1939, $1,067.94; 1940, $1,396.50: first eight months of 1941, $882.89. -Social security and rail - road taxes: 1937. $58.96; 1938, $62.86; 1939, $64.08; 1940, $83.79; first eight months of 1941, $52.97.

The 100 per cent, of pas - senger revenues is assigned to the; station for the reason that it is thought the return trip will give to the other destination its correct proportion. The express earnings are assigned on the actual basis. The express agency is an independent agency, owned by the railroad and 22 per cent, of its earnings was paid to the railroad.

For example: In 1940 it took a trifle over three and one-half days to get a carload shipment and a little more than one day to get an L. C. L. ship - ment throughout the year. In 1941 it took 13.60 days to get a carload or forward a carload, and 1.15 days for the L. C. L. shipment.) . Referring to exhibit 1, the railroad revenue is broken down into car - load and L. C. L., which shows 1937, the carload business was $1,306.58, , while the L. C. L. was $55.21, that is, for freight forwarded; for freight, received, the carload was $8,340.22 and L. G. L. $804.50, about 90 per cent, carload. In 1940, freight received amounted to $5,350.38, a carload, while L. C. L. was $693.34, or about 88 per cent, carload. The freight forwarded amounted to less than $100 on either account. The first eight months of 1941 show revenue from freight forwarded $42.90 carload, and $15.11 L. C. L. This is all the outgoing business for this period. The freight received shows $1,176.93 carload, and $364.15 L. C. L. . It the agent's services are terminated and a caretaker substituted, freight will be received prepaid; patrons will communicate with the sta - tion agent at either Cody or Kilgore; telephone communications will r'. - main from Nenzel to such other stations, and the agents thereof, depend - ing upon the direction of the movement, will sign the bill of lading or live stock contract as the case may be. Most business is inbound and in car-~ loads. The Cars could be spotted by a caretaker as well as by an agent. Road-building material is usually handled on spur tracks, where there is no agent or station; the train crews spot the cars each day when load - ing is desired, and in the evening they pull the cars away. With refer - ence to coal, the freight charges would be paid by the dealer in his in - voice, rather than to the local agent. If stock feed, such as cotton seed cake, is received, with draft attached, the car would be hauled to the next station, and upon surrender of the bill of lading; it would be spotted in the usual way. As to the express, the train crew would put it in the warehouse which is kept locked, and it would be delivered to the customer by the caretaker. With reference to government shipments, if such ship - ments were received collect, they would be held at the last open station before reaching Nenzel. and the consignee notified, and shipments de - livered in the usual way. If there is telephone connection, the consignee would be notified. In the event of receipt of cotton seed cake C. O. D., the shipment would be billed to the last open station, and the party re - ceiving the shipment would do business with the agent at such station, or the shipment could be billed to Nenzel and the agent at the next sta - tion east would notify the consignee, and when the bill of lading was taken up, the shipment would then be -forwarded to the station at Nenzel for unloading. This is not an uncommon practice in large cities. Inspec - tion, if authorized, could be made at the last open station before reaching: Nenzel. </seg>
         <seg id="p127">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 127 The division superintendent testified: Nenzel has a population of 125, a general store, another grocery, a poultry and egg concern, and a filling station which receives its oil and gas by truck. The patrons are mostly ranchmen. Nenzel is on paved highway No. 20, which runs across the state. The railroad facilities consist of a depot, without living quarters; farming in the community is negligible; just enough feed is grown for the horses; grain is not shipped out. The stockyards consist of two or three pens and a loading chute and lack water facilities; cattle constitute the only live stock shipped, there are some privately owned coal bins on leased ground. The railroad tracks consist of the main line, a pass - ing track and a house track. If the agent is removed, a caretaker can be employed for about $10 a month, annual expense thereof being $120 &lt;as compared with $1,400 at present. The stations of Cody and Kilgore are heavier stock-shipping points; the stock yards in each town are provided with other facilities, and scales are provided at Cody.. Freight is calcu - lated on destination weight, as far as live stock is concerned; there are no scales at Nenzel. Passenger service consists of one train each way daily, going west in-the morning and back at night, The passengers can pay their fare oil the train from Nenzel. They do so now on the east bound train, because there is only a part-time agent, who is not a tele - graph operator, and he is not on duty when the east bound passenger train goes through. AH Western Union messages are now sent either, to Kilgore or Cody and phoned to the ranchers. The agent serves six hours a day, from 8 to 11 and 12:30 to 3:30 o'clock. The protestants offered the testimony of Edward Arnold, a rancher, who, with his father, had operated a ranch for 30 or 40 years in the vicin - ity of Nenzel. The witness testified that he shipped a load or two of cat - tle each year out of Nenzel; that they probably had 35 carloads a year, the greater part of them going into central and eastern lowa and some into Illinois, and they are shipped from Codv and Kilotore, because the scales are available at such places; that, if the same facilities existed at Nenzel, it would obtain 75 per cent, of the business; that the cause for the reduction in revenue at Nenzel was the agent who preceded the one now in charge, in not attending to business. This witness favored rail shipping, but testified: "We've been shipping practically everything by truck. M the present time we have some orders in Omaha, I don't know what their weight will amount to—probably 10,000 or 15,000 pounds; they were ordered to be,filled at the company's convenience, whenever they could get them filled; probably amount to 20,000 or 25,000 pounds by the time we.get it all together." Witness stated he expected to have six or seven cars in, consisting of feed,, in the next 30 days, that last year his concern paid $1,700 in freight to trucks. He lives 11 miles north of Nenzel, and his ranch is 14 miles from Kilgore. In the past year he has paid $25 or $50 to the railroad. The cattle going to Iowa: are de - livered to the purchaser at Cody; cattle to go to market are shipped from : Cody or Kilgore and "once in a while from Nenzel." The truckers come </seg>
         <seg id="p128">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 128 to the ranch and pick up the stock, thus doing away with driving the stock to the railroad stock yards. Stock shipped from Cody by rail is driven in. Truckers solicit business; they ship into lowa and sometimes into Illinois, going a distance o{ 800 or 900 miles; in such case the pur - chaser pays the freight. The truckers usually take four or five trucks. The trucker comes to the ranch, the cattle are weighed at the town scales; when shipped by rail the cattle are not weighed at the ranch. The witness John G. Lord, a forest ranger, Jives 19 miles south of Nenzel, on the Nebraska- National Forest. He receives some shipments, consisting mostly of creosote, which comes in each year, posts and wire, government shipments. The witness testified that if the services of the agent at Nenzel were terminated he would have to go to Cody or Kil - gore to handle the bills of lading. This would amount to about a 20-mile trip each time. In going to Cody or Kilgore he goes to Nenzel first and then takes the highway. He is paid mileage by the government. Witness Graydon D. White lives in Nenzel and is employed by the Joe Satterlee general merchandise store, having a stock of about $15,000 ; to $18,000. He testified that, if the agent were removed at Nenzel, peo - ple would go elsewhere to trade; he believed he would get credit from the mines for the invoice of the coal, but doubtd if the mines would.want to give credit for the freight charge which he paid to the agent at Nenzel. He admitted he could pay the agent at Kilgore just as well. His bank - ing business is done at Kilgore, and if the coal comes prepaid it would not inconvenience him very much. He stated that if they had had the right kind of agent at Nenzel there would have been less trucking and more railroad business; that the store ships by truck to some extent. Another witness, Elvin Adamson, lives 22 miles south of Nenzel; has been in the ranching business since 1913. He stated it would be incon - venient to receive cotton seed cake at Nenzel if there were no agent there; they would have to go to Cody or Kilgore to take up the draft; that his shipments were mostly made from Cody, but if they had better facilities at Nenzel he thought they would be made from there. On cross-examination, he testified that when he received a shipment of cotton seed cake, with sight draft attached, it goes to the bank at Cody; that before he obtains the shipment he has to arrange by telephone with the bank at Cody to take care of it. His testimony, was to the effect that if Nenzel had better facilities business would go there instead of to Cody. Exhibit 7, shows station revenues at Nenzel, freight and passenger, for the years from 1917 to 1936, inclusive, making a grand total for 20 years of $253,384.41, with a 20-year average revenue of $12,669.22.

"Due not.cc was given to all interested parties, and the matter came on^ for hearWgjn Se District Court Room at Nelson, Nebraska on the 4th day of Febru - ary. 1942. Protesting witnesses appeared and testified and were repre - sented by counsel. ... . ¦-¦;• Oak is an incorporated village, population 177 (1940 censusV in Nuckolls County. Nebraska, on the Fremont-Superior branch of the Ne - braska division of applicant's railroad, 7.6 miles west **&amp;*&amp;¦*£ «£. east of Nora, and 18.8 miles east of Superior all of which are open agency stations. Superior is the terminus of the branch at which Joint applicant 1! railroad connects with three other railroads. Tram se vice at Oak consists of a tri-weekly mixed freight westbound on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays at 1:40 P.M., and eastbound on Tuesdays". Thursdays and Saturdays at 11*0 A.M. No change in tram service is contemplated. ¦ . ¦ The people in the territory surrounding Oak are generally..«wd. in ,he farming business and incidental livestock ra.smg^nd feedmg.

         <seg id="p133">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 133 surfaced, county maintained connecting roads. Oak is approximately 10 miles from Davenport by highway and about; 7&amp; miles from Nora. The filing of this application emphasizes a transportation problem' of vital importance, not only to'the community of Oak and the applicant railroad, but also'-to similar communities, other railroads and the general public as well. . The applicant railroad is a part of a nation-wide transportation sys - tem. Its operations are complex and highly technical in character. In the early days of railroad development the carrying of passengers and the handling of freight, express and telegraphic communications was exclusive and non-competitive. The need for agents or representatives to transact bMßiness with the public, the need for buildings to shelter passengers and merchandise and the need for telegraphers to transmit messages resulted in the establishment of telegraph station agencies. Today the widespread use of privately owned automobiles has re - sulted in the almost total loss of passenger business on many branch lines. The curtailment of passenger train service has reduced express traffic. The development of the motor truck and its use by both common and private carriers caused a further reduction in express business and also reduced the volume of L.C.L. traffic. The almost universal use of the telephone and expedited mail delivery has reduced the demand for telegraph service at many stations to an insignificant amount. Although drastic changes have taken place in the transportation habits of the public and competition must now be reckoned with, the type of station service, the methods of agency station operation, and the costs of main - taining such service have changed little. Other factors have also affected the problems ot the railroads. While trucks are being used in direct competition with railroads, they are also used to augment or supplement rail service. The shift of popu - lation from certain small towns to nearby or more distant large towns, has affected the need for specific service at many points. Many years of drought and depression have had their effect on tonnage and reve. * nues. Loss of tonnage ad reduction of revenues has affected the finan - cial stability of many railroads. Operating losses give added emphasis to the need for new methods to meet changing conditions. The diffi - culties of making changes in the complex machinery developed under previously existing conditions are readily apparent. The services extended by the railroads and the use made of such services by the public are peculiarly interdependent. A railroad is as much obligated to improve its service to invite increased business from the public as the public is obligated to increase its offerings of business to retain essential service and produce a profit for the railroad. On the one hand, business is obtained by the quality o! service and on the other, essential service is obtained by the offering of business. ¦•, </seg>
         <seg id="p134">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 134 A railroad transacts business with the public through representa - iivis. cal'.cd agmts. The agent is the business and service keystone of railroad transportation. The accessibility of agents to the shipping, or traveling public determines the ease with which business can be trans - acted. The manner in which the service is adapted to present day com - petitive conditions determines the extent of the available business ob - tained. Where revenues have been seriously reduced either an improve - ment in service is needed or a less costly service commensurate with the business obtainable should be permitted. .. : The applicant alleges that the business done at its Oak, Nebraska station no longer warrants the maintenance of an agent; that as - signed revenues have been reduced to less than $3,000.00 per year; that the business is practically all carload business; that most oi the L.C.L. hauling business at Oak is done by truck, and that the cost of maintain - ing the agent at Oak of approximately $1,700.00 per year can be saved by the substitution of a caretaker. The Oak station is now served by an agent-telegrapher 8:00 A.M. to 500 PM daily, except Sundays and holidays. The cost of main - taining the agent in wages and payroll taxes is approximately $1,700.00 annually. The caretaker service proposed for the Oak station is similar to that provided at a number of other stations on applicant's railroad. The caretaker would live in depot quarters, and would keep the nation open, clean and warm. One of applicant's witnesses said that, the caretaker would be around when someone wanted him. Telephone service would be maintained in the station toDavenport and Nora The caretaker, would on request, secure information from neighboring agents relating to train service or rates; would order cars for shippers upon request, and have cars spotted for Joadmg and^n - loading. Livestock would be loaded as at present. On request, bills oi lading and livestock contracts would be sent to neighboring agents for signature. The caretaker would not have authority to handle money _forth» railroad. Incoming shipments would have to be prepaid. L.C.L. ship - ments would be unloaded horn trains and placed in the depot for delivery to consignee. Damage or loss could be reported to ne.ghbormg agent. Outgoing L.C.L. shipments would be loaded into cars and billed collect by the agent at the next station. Cream shipments would be handled as at present, except that billing would be made by baggageman on the train, who would also check baggage. Express business would be handled by the caretaker under arrange - ments to be made with the express agency. . </seg>
         <seg id="p135">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 135 Telegrams could be handled by telephoning to the neighboring Passengers, if any, would pay their fares to the conductor on the train, at no extra charge. : • Applicant's witness testified that it should be possible to obtain a caretaker merely by furnishing living quarters, coal for heating and kerosene for lights. On cross examination, it was admitted that the caretaker must obtain his livelihood elsewhere, but that at several points a cash payment of $50.00 annually was made in addition to living quar - ters, heat and light From the testimony thus given, this substitute service, if authorized, would save the applicant, in wages and payroll taxes, approximately $1,650.00 per year. The applicant introduced an exhibit showing the system income ac - ¦ iSS?* rJ««L earS °f 193° throUgh 1941- There were-profits shown h, 1930 of $437,000 and in 1941 of $1,460,000. There were deficits, after fixed charges, m all of the intervening years ranging from six million dollars in 1931 to the larger losses in the years of 1937 and 1938 of close to fifteen million dollars. Losses were reduced approximately six mil - lion dollars in 1939, further reduced about four million dollars in 1940 and another six million dollars in 1941. This exhibits of little help in determining the merits of the application. Should caretaker service be substituted because of system deficits, then all stations could be given simitar treatment leading ultimately to dissolution of the entire system Careful study of this exhibit, however, reveals that many years of large losses is no proof that improvement cannot be made. The im - provement made in system revenues, while operating under the diffi - culties of receivership, should give assurance that upon the railroad's final emergence from receivership, more determined and successful efforts may be expected to meet present day problems of service and cempetition. Another exhibit was introduced showing the change between the years of 192? and 1939 in passenger-miles traveled, and ton-miles hauled by various means of transportation. This exhibit, like the one mentioned above, can be of little help in determining the merits of the application, but it does offer a challenge to the management of applicant railroad to make needful changes and aggressively meet present day competition. Although revenues alone are not controlling, they are important and musrbe fully considered and given due weight. Several tabulations from applicant's revenue exhibits are set forth. 'y The tabulation shown below gives the gross freight revenue, local and interline, credited to its Oak station, separated to show the share ot other roads in interline revenue and the applicant's share of interline revenue plus the gross revenues on freight which originates and termi - nates on its own lines.

In making these estimates, the applicant's accounting department made a study of the carloads iorwarded during the three months oi the year in which this traffic was the heaviest, established a percent of applicants share of interline, and then applied this percent not only to the-wrlwd. forwarded revenues for the entire year, but also to the L.C.L. tramc. The same procedure was followed in estimating the percentage of re - ceived traffic. There was no evidence presented that the L.C.L. move - ment either forwarded or received, was identical or even approximated the airload movements insofar as applicant's share of interlme was con - cerned. To this extent the figures shown above for L.C.L. revenues, forwarded or received are mere guesses and cannot be definitely con - sidered as showing the use made of applicant's station services at Oak for L.C.L. traffic by the shipping public. </seg>

OPINION, FINDING AND ORDER SWANSON, Commissioner: This matter comes on for consideration upon the application oi the C. St. P. M. &amp; O. Ry. Co. tor authority to discontinue daily, except Sun - day, mixed train service on the Crofton and Bloomfield. branches and to substitute tri-weekly service in lieu thereof. After due notice to all of the towns involved the matter came on for public hearing in the Dis - trict Court Room at Wayne on the 15th and 16th days of July, 1942. The evidence revealed that steam train No. 91 leaves Emerson, daily except Sunday, at 9:55 A. M. passing through Ridge, Wakefield, Wayne. Carroll. Sholes, Randolph; Magnet, and Wausa, arriving Bloom - field at 2:00 P. M. Returning as train No. 92, it leaves Bloomfield at 2:30 P. M. passing through the above towns arriving Wayne at 4:30 P. iJ. and Emerson at 5:25 P. M. The rail distance between Emerson and Wayne is 18.4 miles and is 42.8 miles between Wayne and Bloomfield. Average scheduled speed of train No. 91 is 17.1 miles per hour and of train No. 92, 21.4 miles per hour. ; ¦' Applicant's exhibits 26 and 28 show the revenue derived from pas - senger, freight, mail, express and miscellaneous, together with the cost of operation, between Wayne and Bloomfield during 1940, 1941 and the first five months of 1942. Briefly they reflect the following figures: Jan. 1 to May 31 1940 1941 1942 Revenue $22,724. $33,403. $18,306. Expenses 52,394. 56,733. 19,853.

Applicant's exhibit 17 is a statement of carload and less, than car - load freight handled by the trains on the Bloomfield branch. Broken down it discloses 1.8 carloads per train during 1938; 1.5 during 1939; 1.5 during 1940; 2 during 1941 and 2.5 during the first five months of 1942.

Mixed steam train No. 31 leaves Emerson daily, except Sunday, at 9:45 A.M. pasting through Ridge, Wakefield, Concord, Laurel, Coleridge, Hartington, Fordyce arriving Crofton at 1:30 P.M. On the return trip train No. 32 leaves Crofton at 2.00 P.M. daily, except Sunday, passing through the above towns arriving Wakefield at 4:15 P.M. and Emerson at 4:50 P.M. The rail distance between Emerson and Wakefield is 9.3 miles and between Wakefield and Crofton it is 48.9 rail miles.'

Expenses 60,763. 61,845. 22.294. . . Tax Accruals 8,209. 8.699. 3.775. Loss $39,853. $31,712. $5,536. Exhibit 15 is a statement of carload and less than carload freight handled on the Crofton branch. During 1938 the trains on that branch averaged 2.3 carloads; 2 during 1939; 1.9 during 1940; 23 during 1941 and 2.3 during the first five months of 1942. L.C.L. freight averaged 2,924 pounds per train during 1938; 3,062 pounds during 1939; 3,078 pounds during 1940; 3,189 pounds during 1941; and 3.767 pounds during the first five months of 1942. No showing was made of the earnings from the branch line traffic accruing to the applicant's system as a whole or of the expense of its transportation beyond the junction point N Applicant's exhibit 23 is an income statement for the entire system covering the years 1932 to 1941 inclusive and reveals net deficit each year for the entire period amounting to $2,864,234.00 in .1932 and $705,679.00 during 1941. Extended in a similar way for the State of Nebraska for the period 1937 to 1941 inclusive, exhibit 24, excluding in - terest on funded debt, reveals losses each year in the amounts of .$188,014.00, $107,049.00, $240,822.00, $348,604.00, and $213,847.00, respec - tively. Numerous other company exhibits show the nature, revenue and volume of the shipments handled for the period shown. Carload busi - ness consisted of the usual commodities, such as oats, barley, corn, lum - ber, coal cement hay, etc.. . .;¦'¦¦¦¦.".¦¦,.';;'.:¦¦ ' Applicant proposes in the instant application to reduce the service on the two branches to tri-weekly service thus allowing one train and. crew to leave Emerson every, other day serving the Crofton Brandh </seg>
         <seg id="p144">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 144 and returning to Emerson, and on the alternate days would serve the Bloomficld branch. Such an operation, in the opinion of the applicant, would reduce the over-all expense approximately 50% in addition to making available one locomtive and a train crew for other service sorely needed in the National war effort. Applicant's General Superintendent testified that both branches hero involved were investigated late last year with the intention to request the Interstate Commerce Commission for authority to abandon the en - tire lines. Before doing so, however, the executive officers of the. appli - cant company decided to attempt to retain the rails by reducing the train service and thereby reduce operating costs. In order to obtain the fullest use of the railroad equipment the Office of Defense Transportation issued an order curtailing the use of locaJ merchandise rail cars and since July 9, 1942 applicant has, in ac - cordance with that Federal order, diverted its local merchandise traffic to motor truck carriers operating along the lines. Such an arrangement .-o far as is now known will continue throughout the duration of the National Emergency. The L.C.L. merchandise is handled by the motor carriers from Sioux City and other terminals to the depots along the line where delivery is made to consignees by the railroad station agent. Exhibits offered by applicant and received in evidence show numerous common, contract and private motor carriers operating throughout the territory served by the railroad. Bus lines Surnish service to nearly all of the towns involved and the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. operates a line of railroad through Randolph and Laurel. . Towns along both branches were well represented by counsel. Wit - nesses were heard and numerous exhibits were received showing the nature and quantity of shipments handled by them. , They represented the principal shippers along both branches and acounted for .nearly all of the revenue. Their figures do not appear to be at variance with figures submitted by the applicant. Most of them indicated an increase in busi - ness within the past year and every indication points toward a gradual recovery from the drouth condition which has prevailed in that terri - tory for the past several years. Especially was the testimony of witness Vincent Rossiter, of Hartington important. His testimony was the re - sult of a thorough investigation and study relating to agricultural con - ditions in Cedar County. He testified that at the present time there are 1.378.443 bushels of corn under Government seal in the County which should move at least 75% via applicant's railroad prior to January 1, 1943; that the estimated corn crop for this year is 5,250,000 bushels. He testified that cattle, hogs and sheep are increasing in great numbers in the County but testified on cross examination that in his opinion most of the livestock would continue moving to the Sioux City market via motor trucks. He testified that as a banker, he uses the service of appli- </seg>
         <seg id="p145">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 145 cant in the transportation of currency to supply the merchants in the County. ¦ :v . .-¦, Mr. C. A. Ross likewise was an important witness. He was called as a traffic and rate jexpert of many years experience and he offered testi - mony and exhibits relating to the reVenue and carloadings produced on the branches in the past, and compared the present increase in traffic with the lean years of the drouth period. He criticized the method used by the applicant in the allocation of revenue to the branches and con - tended that as feeder lines 1 they should be given more consideration. Traffic men, regulatory commissions and courts seem to, be completely at variance in a proper allocation of the branch line revenue" and cos: of operation. The witness testified that the National Association of Railroad and Utility Commissioners approved a uniform system of alloca - tion in 1924 although he did not personally agree with it. That system ¦was the one used by applicant according to the witness. The Inter - state Commerce Commission in rail abandonment cases has frequently discussed various methods of arriving at a fair and equitable allocation of revenue to branch lines. . A study of a long line of those cases reveals that a mileage pro rate was used and ultimately adopted. See Detroit, Toledo &amp; Tronton R. Co. Abandonment, 187, I.C.C. 433; Long Island R.R. Co. Abandonment, 199 I.C.C. 471; Louisville ft Nashville R. Co ißr I.C.C. 314.. ¦¦¦•¦¦¦;¦.¦;¦¦¦.¦ :¦¦;¦¦.. -'. ¦' \ ¦'::(:. : ..¦ :,;f. ¦;¦;. There was much testimony relative to the service performed by these trains between Emerson, Wakefield and Wayne, From the record it ap - pears that applicant operates those trains in said manner strictly as a matter of convenience; that facilities at Emerson are better for servic - ing locomotives and trains and that another freight train operating be - tween Emerson and Norfolk daily except Sunday could and would handle the. business at those points on the days the trains under applicant's present proposal would hot operate; that exhibits offered by applicant do hot consider operation of the trains except on the branches. Protes - tants allege that such a change in the present service would work a hard - ship and an inconvenience in the prompt movement of carload shipments and in some instances would cause cars to be held for a longer period on the branches than actually required. ', : Testimony relative to discontinuance of the mail service has been considered. Revenue produced from that source amounted to $3,428.00 for the year 1940; $3,581.00 for the-year 1941; and $1,258.00 for the first five months of 1942, on the Bloomfield branch. For the Crofton branch it amounted to $3,443.00 during 1940; $3,449.00 during 1941 and $1,419.00 during the first five months of 1942. Revenue produced from the car - riage of mail should be considered along with other facts and circum - stances in the case. ; ¦..::''¦ ¦/; The duty of supplying an adequate mail service was delegated to </seg>
         <seg id="p146">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 146 the Postmaster General by the Congress of the United States in the following language, in part, as follows: "The Postmaster General shall provide {or carrying the mail on all post roads established by law, as often as he, having due re - gard to productiveness and other circumstances, may think proper." (39 U. S. C. A. 483) "The Postmaster General shall in all cases decide upon what trains and in what manner the mails shall be conveyed. Every railroad company carrying the mails shall carry on any train it operates, and with due speed, all mailable matter, equipment and supplies directed to be carried thereon." (39 U. S. C. A. 539) Our own Supreme Court in a recent case, infra, referring to a simi - lar complaint had the following to say, to-wit: ¦'.-.¦ "It should not be assumed or found, in absence of evidence, of which there is none, that county officers will fail to perform their duty to keep county roads in a reasonably safe condition for mail and express routes and for other public purposes; nor that the., postmaster general of the United States will fail to perform his ¦ duty to furnish adequate mail services {or the people rending along this branch line of railroad." (Emphasis ours.) (The Commission has been advised that effective September 1, 1942, U. S. mail is no longer handled by the trains on the two branches in - volved herein.) Representatives of various railroad Brotherhoods were present at the hearing. Their analysis of the employment situation, seniority and emergency use of the facilities for war purposes does not coincide with applicant's version. So far as the relationship between employer and employee is concerned the Commission is of the opinion that under Sec-, tion 75-216, C. S. Nebraska, 1929, it has no jurisdiction.' That section in part reads as follows: ' ...¦¦-' "***lt is further provided that nothing herein contained shall be . construed as giving the state railway commission jurisdiction or control of the relations between the railway companies and their employers and employees' orders, either contractual or other - wise." The Commission almost daily receives reports and orders from the Office of Defense Transportation in Washington relative to transporta - tion service. Among others is one received June 26, 1942 from Mr. Joseph </seg>
         <seg id="p147">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 147 B. Eastman, Director of Defense Transportation, which in part, reads as follows:;. .'¦.•¦¦¦.' •¦'•: - ¦: :.¦* : .. : ' :: ";. .: ¦• _' :¦' . ',i, "There are many places in the nation in which local accommoda - tion train service is paralleled by bus service. This is true both as to main lines and secondary lines. In all such cases, where the : bus service is reasonably adequate it would seem that under present conditions the local train service should be discontinued and the equipment placed in more important uses. This should . , be done in spite of some degree of local dislocations and incon - veniences, for the war-time needs of the nation must be paramount. I understand that about 180 separate applications are now pend-. ing before various State Commissions. I earnestly request that disposition of all of these cases be expedited and as many as pos - sible granted." ; ¦ .. :• The curtailment of any service furnished by a public utility or com - mon carrier is always the object of grave concern; not only to the peo - ple residing along the branch line railroads but to all of the people of the State.: There can he no doubt that the curtailment of service such as proposed herein would result in some inconvenience,to the shippers along the tines and more particularly to the witnesses who appeared and testified during the hearing. In the main their objections were well founded; As regulatory officials it is our bounden duty to see that reason - able, adequate service is provided the general public under the facts in the record. In so doing we must confine ourselves to the rules and regu - lations of administrative law and: to the various court decisions inter - preting and reviewing commission orders. It must be remembered that this application does not propose to completely abandon; : service on the 1 two branches. The most serious injury that could result would be de - lays in some instances in the shipment of commodities. The intimation of "the abandonment of the entire branch should also be given some con - sideration by the Commission and also by the communities served by the applicant. At the present time there are a great many tri-weekly schedules in effect on the various railroads in Nebraska. It would ap - pear that in this case to deny 'applicant the right to supply tri-weekly service,: especially during this National Emergency and thus save up to $30,000.00 annually i with no serious curtailment, would amount to a denial of due process and to confiscation of applicant's property.

Dissenting: Applicant company arrogantly assuming they possessed an inherent and legal right to change operating train service from daily, except' Su - nday, to a tri-weekly operation of trains, on these branches of their sys - tem, did, without the knowledge of this Commission, proceed to arrange other mail service and set a date for the transition to a three day a week change. All of this was done despite the fact that we, as a Commission, had constitutional and statutory jurisdiction over service, all of which was further buttressed by our General Order No. 11. Our attention from, other than official rail sources, came to this Commission and was brought by us to the attention of the Attorney General of the state, and through his office a peremptory mandamus was issued from the Supreme Court, halting said illegal action by the rail company, said action being in con - tempt of this Commission's jurisdiction. And now, after flaunting the authority of this Commission we are appealed to for authority to do the thing which they sought to do sur - reptiously and illegally. In other words, they do not come before thi*' Commission with clean hands. Their objective is camouflaged by waving a war effort alibi. . It is a matter of common knowledge, that formerly there were three daily trains on these branches. . From authorative sources it will be here shown that branch lines where revenues are based on allocated prorata mileages, do practically al - ways show paper figure losses. </seg>
         <seg id="p149">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 149 From rail exhibits it will be shown that each and all the towns served, are and have been good and sufficient revenue producers to warrant daily service. It will be further shown that if service might be made tri-weekly that little or ho equipment will be made available for rail war effort transportation. ¦ ,-'-.' :... ¦¦: ¦ Branch line Revenues.

Does all the switching along the line? , , . A. Does all the switching along the line. Arriving Bloomfield ¦;.-¦: 2:00 P.

This service at Wayne as far as switching is con - ; • concerned has been done by this train, to my personal knowl - ledge for 37'/i years. There has been times during snow blockades and wash outs, whereby the station switching at Wayne has been done by some other Norfolk main line train This Bloomfield line train has not always went to Emerson. • In.former years the terminus was at Bloomfield. </seg>
         <seg id="p152">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 152 Q. That was always the terminus? A. Started out at Bloomfield. Came down to Wayne and made their connection and the station switching at Wayne and re - turned with the Bloomfie\d loads and L.C.L. That is about all you want isn't it? Q. Go to the other line. The Crofton line. A. The Crofton line at the present time, train Number 31 leaves Emerson at 9:45 A. M. arriving Wakefield at 10:05 A. M. Does all of the station switching at Wakefield waits there for connection from the Bloomfield line and follows later out of Emerson with the Sioux City connection. They likewise handle all of the business from Omaha west bound to Wake - field and Crofton. Do the switching and L.C.L. work, Wake - field to Crofton inclusive. Arriving Crofton 1:30, departing eastbound at 2:00 P. M.. picking up all of the east bound business on the branch and all the east bound business at Wakefield. Arriving Emerson at 4:50. The same condi - tion would prevail on this line, the same as Bloomfield. The terminus of the train was Crofton. Started at Crofton com - ing to Wakefield, doing all of the station switching at Wake - field and with the exception of snow blockades and wash outs on this branch, which at those times the station switch - ing was done at Wayne, by some extra or some Norfolk line on account of wash outs or snow blockades. Q. So as a matter of fact at no time during your experience has this so called main line done any switching? A. None at Wayne or Wakefield except as I mentioned. Q. That situation has existed for 36 years? A. As far as switching at Wayne and Wakefield, it is always done by these crews. Summary. :, Because granting of this application would result in little or any contribution to our war effort as instanced; Because the revenues based upon a prorate of mileage is wholly un - fair to branch lines; Because no revenue credit is given these trains for doing switching at Wayne, Wakefield and Emerson, said service being wholly beyond the branch line operation; Because revenues have increased $36,887, on these branches since 1937; ¦•' 5 V.-,; ¦ .../ </seg>

FINDING AND ORDER LARSON, Commissioner: This is an application of the Union Pacific Railroad Company for authority to discontinue agency servce and to close its station at Odessa, Nebraska. Notice having been given to all interested parties, this mat - ter came on for. public hearing in the District Court Room at Kearney, Nebraska on the 16th day of September, 1942. Several citizens of Odessa and vicinity appeared in opposition to the granting of the application. : The evidence disclosed that Odessa, Buffalo County, Nebraska, is an unincorporated village located on the main line of the Nebraska Divi - sion of applicant's railroad, 9.2 miles west of Kearney and 6.3 miles east of Elm Creek both of which are open-agency stations. A paved highway, U. •S. No. 30, which connects Odessa with Elm Creek and Kearney, parallels the railroad. The adjacent territory is wholly agricultural and the station is used principally for the shipment of livestock, hay and alfalfa, sugar beets and coal. The business establishments consist of a garage and filling station, now operating; a general store and post office, a hay barn and feed lot, a portable beet dump on the railroad right-of-way and a four bin coal house. Odessa has neither an elevator nor a bank. V At the present time the Odessa station is served by an agent-opera- : </seg>

The present train service consists of a local freight westbound at 6:30 A.M. daily except Sunday, and eastbound at 5:30 P.M. daily ex - cept Saturday. There are several passenger trains which stop when flagged. Most of these trains are scheduled through Odessa at a time when the agent is not on duty. The revenue statement offered by the applicant shows the actual amount credited to the Odessa station from all sources as follows: 50% of all carload business received or Jorwardedat Odessa which originates and terminates on the Union Pacific Railroad, called local freight; 100% of the actual line haul revenue accruing to the Union Pacific on carload and L.C.L. shipments originating at Odessa and destined to points on other railroads and on those originating on other railroads and received at Odessa: 100% of all local L.C.L. shipments received or forwarded at the station, ticket sales and milk and cream revenue. On that basis the total revenue credited to the station for the years 1940. 1941 and the first 7 months of 1942 was $3,133, $3,796 and $5,015 respectively. The express business has been nominal. The gross revenue for such business having amounted to $245.63 for 1941, and $181.87 for the first 7 months of 1942. &#132; The gross receipts for Western Union messages were exceedingly small having been $27.43 for 1940: $23.04 for 1941, and 12.85 for the first half of 1942. The L.C.L. business was not large. The number of such shipments in 1940. 1941. and the first 7 months of 1942 was. 261, 232 and 113 respec - tively resulting in gross revenues of $266, $244, and $239. . . Carload business during the period consisted of 23 cars of coal in - bound and 49 cars of sugar beets and, 172 cars of hay and alfalfa out - bound. These shipments accounted for 85% of all carload business. The expense of the agent's salary including payroll taxes was stated to be approximately $2200.00 per year based on the salary for January, 1942. \ ¦¦¦¦ It was testified that there exists a grave shortage of telegraphers on applicant's system caused by induction into the armed forces; greater volume of war time traffic on main lines and mandatory vacations since recent salary adjustments. Also, it was testified that a telegraph oper - ator was not needed at Odessa in the operation of trains..- Applicant proposes to discontinue the agency service and handle the business from its Kearney station. The waiting room of the depot would be kept open by the section foreman, and shippers would leave their L.C.L. and cream shipments there until arrival of the train and would then be picked up by the train crew. Billings would be han- </seg>

Inbound L.C.L. shipments would bt left in the waiting room by the train crew and picked up by,the consignee. A telephone would be maintained at the depot, or some other convenient location, affording the patrons free service for the transaction of busi - ness with the Kearney agency. Mail would be handled as at present . Applicant's witness testified in detail as to the manner of handling carload shipments should the agency service be discontinued. Inbound shipments of coal would be handled as at present, except for the pay - ment of the freight charges which would be made direct to the company shipping,the coal, or arrangements could be made through the Kearney agency. No sugar beets were shipped in 1941 nor were any expected for the 1942 season. Sugar beets are handled by the sugar companies who run the dumps and consequently the grower would not be affected by any change in station service. It was stated that most of the hay is bought by buyers and shipped through Kearney, and there .would be little inconvenience to the shipper of hay if the agency were discontin - ued. /.'¦ . -.' ¦..,-,'. ' '..". .;¦' ¦ .':; ¦¦•'¦: '¦.'¦'..¦• ' ¦¦¦¦ ¦ ¦ Three protestants testified at the hearing. One, a general merchant, and the postmaster testified that most of his shipments'/were received fey rail, these consisting of one or two shipments a week. Another, testified that he was a buyer of fat hogs and cattle and has been ship - ping almost exclusively by truck, said that if the rubber shortage gets worse he will have to use railroad more. The other witness, a hay buyer, partner in a hay company, who lives at Kearney testified that his major problem in the event of discontinuance of agency service would be the need for assurance that his loaded cars would be picked up. Under date of December 4, 1942 our Supreme Court in Chicago ft N.W. Ry. Co. v«. Conuninlon reversed an order ot the Commission de - nying the railroad company authority to substitute a custodian for an agent at Emmet. Paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of the syllabus read as follows: "Historically and legally a common carrier, in addition to being ,a commercial and transportation enterprise for profit, is a pub - lic service facility with duties owing to the domain it traverses, and to the people resident and commercially engaged in the areas tributary to the carrier; and the necessities, requirements and convenience of the tributary areas must be considered and reasonably protected. - ; ¦ '; -..¦;.". "While income of a railr6ad station is an element to be considered in determining whether or not an agency shall be discontinued, it is hot in itself controlling. It must be considered along with all ¦.'..'"¦' other elements bearing upon reasonableness under all the dis - closed conditions. . . ¦ . ;¦ </seg>
         <seg id="p156">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 156 "The ruling o! the railway commission or o! this court on the ques- ' tion of discontinuance of an agency at any given time does not amount to an adjudication for the future. It s only a judgment . on the condition presented by the application and relates to the time and conditions presented." There is little doubt that there remains some "essential service" to be provided at Odessa. Neither can there be doubt that "the necessities, requirements and convenience of the tributary areas must be considered, and moreover, reasonably protected". To discontinue all service and close the station will deny the reasonable protection and service that the volume of business and revenue produced, warrant. By reason of all of the facts and circumstances appearing in the record the Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the: applica - tion of the Union Pacific Railroad Company for authority to discontinue agency service and close its station at Odessa, Nebraska, should be de - nied as to the closing of the station, but should be granted as to discon - tinuance of agency service, provided that caretaker service be substi - tuted. Should the service rendered by the caretaker later prove to be in - adequate, or even unnecessary the Commission has continuing jurisdiction to entertain an application for a further change in service. /.

FINDING AND ORDER SWANSON, Commissioner: .: ' •This is an applicaton for substitution of caretaker or custodial servi ice for "open-agency service by the C. &amp; N. W r Ry Co., at Brainard, Nebraska. The matter came on for public hearing in the^Court House at David City on the Bth day of October, 1942. </seg>
         <seg id="p158">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 158 The evidence reveals that Brainard, Butler County, Nebraska, is an incorporated village located on the Fremont-Superior Branch of appli - cant's railroad 7.8 miles south of Bruno, and 7.4 miles north of Dwight, both being regular open-agency stations. The 1940 federal census/shows the population to be 444. The Central City-Valley Branch line of the Union Pacific Railroad Company also serves Brainard. passing atong the east side of the village; applicant's line passing along the west side.. It is approximately two mile's south of U. S. paved highway 30-A, connected by a hard surfaced road; to the west approximately five miles State highway No. 15. a hard surfaced highway extends in'a northerly and southerly direction, thus making available the network of Federal and State highways to all points in the state. " . At the present time and for many years last past, an agent-operator has been maintained at Brainard between the hours o! 8:00 A.M. and 5:00 P.M., daily except Sunday. Living quarters are furnished in the depot. The agent does not dispatch trains and, does not handle train orders. Tri-weekly mixed train service is furnished westbound on Mon - days, Wednesdays and Fridays, due at Brainard at approximately 8:05 A.M., and eastbound on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, due at Brainard at approxmately 5:25 P.Jtf. No mail is handled by the trains. Telephone service is available via commercial telephone and also via company telephone to both Bruno and Dwight for the benefit of patrons. Exhibit 6 introduced in evidence by the applicant shows the total revenue at the station from all sources, including C.L. and L.C.L. ship - ments received and forwarded, ticket sales, cream revenue, express and Western Union earnings. The figures were compiled for the years 1937, 1938, 1939, 1940, 1941, and the first four months of 1942. The exhibit credits the station with 50^ of the revenue derived- from all carload shipments received and forwarded at Brainard, which originated and terminated on the C. &amp; N. W.; 75% of the actual line haul revenue ac - cruing to the applicant on carload shipments originating at Brainard and destined to points on foreign railroads, and on those originating on foreign railroads and destined Brainard; 100% of all revenue ac - cruing on L.C.L. shipments, ticket sales, miscellaneous revenue, and the net revenue to applicant from express, baggage and Western Unioa r forwarded and received at said station. Based upon the above computa - tion the total revenue credited to the station of Brainard for the year 1937 from all sources amounted to $3,622.73; for the year 1938 the sum of $2,409.03: for the year 1939 the sum of $18,037.74; for the year 1940 the sum of $2,337.01; for the year 1941 the sum of $2,504.25 and for the first four months of 1942 the sum of $680.32. Nearly all the revenue was produced by carload shipments. During 1937 there were 68 cars received and 18 forwarded; during 1938, 28 CMS were received and 17 forwarded; during 1939 there were 697: cars re- </seg>
         <seg id="p159">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 159 ceived and 15 forwarded; during 1940 there were 37 cars received and 12 forwarded; during 1941 there were 33 cars received and' 27 forwarded; during the first nine months of 1942 there were 47 cars received, and six forwarded. During 1939 the heavy inbound movement consisted of sand, gravel and road construction equipment and material used in con - struction of a new highway, and is a non-recurring item. .'.' . The actual cost of operating the station during the same period, in-, eluding wages paid to agent, payrott taxes, fuel, telephone building main - tenance, stationery and supplies amounted to $1,838.80; $1,870.66; $1,838.67; $1,870.20; $1,932.73 and $713.74,, respectively. The average yearly salary for the agent, including payroll taxes for the period shown approximate $1,750. Applicant testified that the substitution of custodial service would effect an annual saying of the amount paid the agent in salary and payroll taxes. .'."'. '..". ¦ : Two witnesses appeared and testified in opposition to the granting' of the application. Their testimony condensed was to the general effect that the decrease in revenue at the; station was the direct result of continued drought in that territory; depressed business conditions, and shortage of livestock and grain; that the general conditions are now im proving; livestock is returning and crops aje better. Many thousands of bushels of corn are under Government seal, bank deposits are up, and with the return of better crops the community will again require the return of applicant's agent and railroad. , There is one elevator on applicant's side track, which has been closed but is now being: used for storage of grain. It is operated by the Farmers Co-Op who also has its office and operates elevators and yard* on the Union Pacific on the other side of the village. _ In disposing of a case of this character numerous factors must be considered and there is no hard and Sast njle that may be applied in de - ciding this and similar applications. In determining the question such fac - tors as the volume of business done at the station; gross and net rev - enues resulting therefrom; duties of the agent; amount of time neces - sary to perform those duties; cost of maintaining the agency service; financial loss if any to the railroad company; accessibility to the station; proximity to other, stations; highway conditions; location of grain and livestock markets; probability of future development; adequate alterna - tive transportation facilities, and due regard for the public welfare in furnishing: reasonably, adequate rail service commensurate with the de - mand for service^by the community; adequacy of service proposed by the substituted service. . - .: : • / ¦ In a recent case the Commission after hearing and due consideration to all concerned, denied applicant railroad company authority to substi - tute caretaker service for agency service at Nenzel, Nebraska. The facts </seg>
         <seg id="p160">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 160 were similar to the ones in the instant case. On ¦ appeal to the Supreme Court in Chicago &amp; N. W. v. Commission, 141 Neb. 687, 4 N.W. (2d) 756, the Court among other things said: "It is apparent that the volume of business transacted at Nenzel is such that the agent may be readily dispensed with; the protes - tants showing that the necessity for an agent is based on the ¦ proposition that the former agent was unsatisfactory in that, he did not attend to business, and further, that i£ the facilities of the station were improved by retaining the agent now serving ; the business would improve. This, of course, is founded upon' pure speculation. As to the future business to be conducted at this station by virtue of the war, it is too speculative to be con- . sidered and too perplexing to be analyzed at this time." ' "It is a matter of common knowledge that the highway trans - portation facilities throughout the state and nation make the ac - commodations for shipment by trucks easy and delivery of freight by truck much simpler than by rail. The trucks make the load - ing at the home of the shipper, thus dispensing with considerable .-. extra labor on the part of the shipper; especially is this true where live stock deliveries are made direct to the home. Bus travel on the highway is such that a bus is ordinarily obtainable more readily than passenger service on trains. Railroads are subject to strict regulation, and highway competition is not so subjected. Common-carrier trucks compete with the railroads for L.C.L. and short-haul business, and manufacturers and whole, sale houses have, in many instances, put on their own fleet of trucks and compete not only with the railroads, but with the com - mon-carrier trucks as well. The decline of business on the rail - roads for the last decade can be easily accounted for."*** ¦-..'. "We conclude that in the instant case the order o{ the state railway ¦ commission is arbitrary and not sustained by sufficient evidence. It is hereby vacated and the application of the appellant trustee sustained. As to any future considerations demanding the serv - ices of an agent at Nenzel, this matter may be properly deter- : mined when the occasion arises." Under date of December 4, 1942 our Supreme Court in Chicago &amp; N. W. R. Co. v. Commission, reversed the order of the Commission de - nying this same railroad company authority to substitute a custodian for an agent at Emmet, the Court among other things said: "This application considered in this light brings us to the'very definite conclusion that necessity does-not require the mainte - nance of an agent at Emmet. The evidence is conclusive on the ~ </seg>

The important' . inconveniences will be that no paper work may be done at Era - . met, no freight bills for either incoming or outgoing freight may - be paid there, registration of complaints will have to be made elsewhere, incoming freight bills will have to be either prepaid ¦'" or received at an adjacent station where there is an agent, and . cars for loading will have to be ordered direct by the shipper or through the caretaker by telephone. There are perhaps other in - conveniences, but these are the most important ones. Subject to these inconveniences business would continue as usual at this station.. . '¦' ¦ ¦: ¦. '. ¦¦ ¦:.': ¦. ' ¦¦ .' ¦'¦ : . ¦ ; Taking into consideration the amount of service required of an ". agent, the saving to be effected by substitution of a caretaker, the - limited amount of shipping, the fact that no essential shipping service is discontinued, and the prospective inconvenience to the . few shippers concerned, we conclude that the railway commis - , sion acted arbitrarily and unreasonably in denying the applica - tion to discontinue the employment of an agent at Emmet and to substitute a caretaker."*** "It is also urged that with the contemplated increase in railroad transportation this agency should not be discontinued. This , argument is purely prospective and speculative and can have no force or influence here. It may .well be said that the ruling , on this question by the railway commission or this court does not amount to an adjudication for the future.

COMMISSIONERS CONCURRING: (Signed) F. A. Good (Signed) Duane T. Swanson . (Signed) Richard H. Larson GOOD, Concurring in part: In view of the fact that the town is served by two railroads, necessi - tating two depots, side tracks and agencies, thus in a way producing an uneconomic situation as relates to equipment and expense of operation, and after our attempting to effect an agency consolidation of the station agency, which now appears futile; hence I reluctantly acquiesce in grant - ing the rails petition. I had proposed a cut over from the C. &amp; N. W.s tracks to those of the U.P., which appeared feasible to me, but. was ob - jected to by C. &amp; N. W. officials, they alleging that a large expense would be involved in track laying and signal systems. As relates to the findings of my colleagues, I am not in accord for the most part. The finding that a very large share of the station revenue was from carload operation is absolutely in common with that of all small towns in the entire state. The paragraph having to do with "numerous factors must be considered and there is no hard and fa A rule that may be applied", and followed by a list of what is designated as determining factors is largely or wholly inconsequential for they are all inherit of all the small towns. They all have roads on, or leading to all weather state and federal roads, leading everywhere. They all are dependent on agriculture and have no industries located therein. They all have some truck facilities, likewise bus, and it is seldom that an agent has work enough to keep him busy eight hours per day, etc., etc . The railroad companies were in a large way cognizant of these facts when the road was built, and the station established. Now when rubber is becoming scarcer every day, and other types of transportation disap- </seg>
         <seg id="p163">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 163 pearing, they seek curtailment of service to the public, despite the fact .that all the rails are reaping a great harvest of revenue. &#132; , ¦ Citation of recent Supreme Court decisions wherein this Commissions majority order denying the C. &amp;N. W.s petition to close and substitute careUker' service for agency was reversed as it-related to the Stations of Nenzel'and Emmet, is portrayed somewhat at length. It is a matter of fact that the Commission has statutory jurisdiction in such cases and to be reversed the. court must find that the action of the said Commission is arbitrary and unreasonable and which they have so done. ¦ ; It is a factual matter that more than one hundred such applications for station closings have been filed and hearings held thereon during the past six years; Very naturally the Commission has had wide experi - ence, has had contacts with Commissioners, of other states; has allthe public utility reports published, and has annual reports from most other States. A thorough perusal of all available information assures this Com - missioner that in no other state have the Commission or Courts closed a station in a purely agricultural area where the gross revenue was so much as at the stations i.e. Nenzel and Emmet, cited in this opinion. What then is the dominating reason why an agency station should be abandoned or petition denied? Let us look to what state legislatures have done about it In the state of North Dakota the legislature enacted a law, removing; from the jurisdiction of their utility commission, a sta - tion having a revenue in excess of $6,000 of gross average annual reve - nue. Likewise the state of Minnesota, except the minimum revenue was set at $8,000. .No Supreme Court has attempted to reverse the statutes of these indicated states; yet if a like la\v" obtained in this state the Commission could not have entertained ah application as relates to Nenzel or Emmet. Nevertheless our Supreme Court—without knowledge o( station closing; cases except from a; general portrayal by counsel for ' the rails, not buttressed by confirmatory citations, takes over station closing cases and without setting up any guide boards in their decision, waives the Commission out of their rightful statutory jurisdiction. As aforesaid, this Commissioner concurs for reasons already set forth, but holds that the citations of the court in a case wholly different from that of Nenzel and Emmet is irrelevant thereto and not properly brought into the instant matter..,.: . - • , :.['.¦:¦¦¦ ¦¦''¦;' ; •"¦¦¦¦ -¦'¦.;¦• ".''"¦•¦'.¦¦ (Signed) F.

         <seg id="p164">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 164 IN STATE, EX REL. QUINN v. MARSH (141 Neb. 437) 31419 Filed May 8, 1942. Heard before Simmons, C. J., Rose, Eberly, Paine, Carter, Mess - more and Yeager, JJ. YEAGER, J. This is a special action authorized by the provisions of section ¦32-1129, Comp. St. 1929, providing for judicial review of the action of the secretary of state in passing upon certificates of nomination or nom - ination statements of candidates for public office. The action as orig - inally instituted in the district court was by the state of Nebraska on relation of John B. Quinn, who will be hereinatfer referred to as relator, against Frank Marsh, secretary of state, who will be referred to as respondent. ¦ ¦ The substantial facts arc the following: John B. Quinn, a duly quali - fied voter affiliated with the Republican party, on the 6th day of No - vember. 1941, filed in the office oi the secretary of state an application or nomination statement to have his name printed and carried on the official primary ballots for the primary election to be held throughout the state of Nebraska on August 11, 1942, for the office of state railway com - missioner tor the regular term commencing in January, 1943, which ap - plication was duly accepted by the secretary of state. On November 14, 1941, an objection and protest to the application was duly and regularly filed on the ground that by reason of his age relator was ineligible to become a railway commissioner in the light of the statute (Comp. St. 1929. sec. 75-101. as amended by the laws of 1933 and 1941), whicfi pro - vides that no person is eligible for membership of the railway commis - sion who is less than 30 years of age, whereas relator would not become 30 years of age until July 26, 1943. The substantial facts contained in the objection having been admitted to be true, the secretary of state re - jected the application. From the ruling of the secretary of state the relator filed his action for review in the district court. On review the district court held thai section 75-101, Comp. St. 1929, in so far as it provides that state railway commissioners shall not be less than 3*o years of age is unconstitutional, null and void, and that such requirement as to age is arbitrary, unreason - able and capricious, and thereby contravenes and conflicts with section 18, art. 111, section 1, art. 11, and section 22, art. I, of the Constitution of Nebraska. 1875, and in consequence ordered forthwith the reinstatement of the application. </seg>
         <seg id="p165">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 165 ' From this action of the district court the secretary of state has ap - pealed and as ground for reversal, among others not necessary to be dis - cussed, urges that the decision is contrary to law. ".. . The facts not being in dispute, the only question for determination is the constitutionality of a part of section 75-101, Comp. St. 1929, which part is as follows: "The members of the' state railway commission shall be resident citizens of this state, and qualified voters under the Consti - tution and laws thereof, and not less than thirty years of age." The part of section 18, art. 11l of the Constitution, brought into question here is the following: "The Legislature shall not pass local or special laws in any of the following cases, that is to say: * * * The open - ing and conducting of any election, or designating the place of voting." ¦ Section 22, art. lof the Constitution is as follows: "AH elections shall be free; and there shall be no hindrance or impediment to the right of a qualified Voter to exercise the elective franchise." . We are, therefore called upon here to determine the question of whether or not the provision of section 75-101, Comp. St. 1929, which prohibits persons under the age of 30 years from holding the office of railway commissioner is legislation which contravenes one or both of the quoted constitutional provisions. To begin with it appears to be conceded, and it cannot be denied, that where the Constitution creates an office and enumerates the qualifi - cations for eligibility to the office the legislature is without power to impose other conditions of eligibility. Janiky v. Baldwin, 120 Kan. 332, 243 Pac. 302; Humphrey, v. Wall., 169 Md. 292, 181 Atl. 735; Mechem, Public Officers, p. 27 efc teg. I It appears appropriate then to inquire into the question of whether or not section 20, art. IV of the Constitution, which is the provision cre - ating the office of state railway commissioner, and which became a part of the Constitution by amendment in 1906, enumerates any qualifications for eligibility' The section is as follows: "There shall be a state railway commission, consisting of three members, who shall be first elected at the general election in 1906, whose terms o! oßce, except those chosen at the first election under this provision, shall be six years, and whose compensation shall be fixed by the legislature. Of the three commis - sioners first elected, the - one receiving the highest number of votes, shall hold his office for six years, the next highest four years, and the lowest two years. The powers and duties of such commission shall include the regulation of rates, service and general control of common carriers, as the legislature may provide .by law. But,' in the absence of specific legislation, the commission shall exercise the powers and perform the duties enumerated in this provision." </seg>
         <seg id="p166">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 166 It will be observed that there are no provisions pertaining to eligi - bility. However, it is the contention of the relator that, the Constitu - tion having imposed no conditions of eligibility, no power existed in the legislature to impose any such conditions, and, even assuming the power to impose conditions, that those imposed are arbitrary, unreasonable and capricious. . . The relator urges the following: (1) That the statute is violativc of the true intent of the Constitution and that it exceeds the 'general express and implied constitutional purpose; (2) that where the depart - ments of government are definitely separated as are those of Nebraska, the legislature may not establish arbitrary exclusions from office nor annex qualifications to constitutional offices of the executive department where the Constitution has not established exclusions or annexed qualifi - cations; (3) that the courts will not permit one class of voters to be given more power in governmental affairs than another class; (4) that in view of the fact that since section 2, art. IV, and section 7, art V, of tin- Constitution contain specific prohibitions on the question of age of certain constitutional officers, this must be conclusively presumed to be a bar to legislative declaration of conditions of eligibility based upon any age other than that of an elector; (5) that the legislative.limitation in question is a legislative encroachment upon the executive department of Kovernment. No case like or of a similar character to this one has ever been be - fore this court, and but few have been before any of the courts. One ap - proaching it as closely as any to facts from another jurisdiction is the case of Attorney General v. O'Neill, 280 Mich. 649, 274 N. W. 445. In that case the right of O'Neill to hold the office of circuit Judge was brought into question. The Constitution of Michigan contained no ex - clusionary provisions against the holding of judicial office. The statutes, however, did contain certain exclusionary provisions. They provided that no person should be eligible for election or appointment to the of - fice ol circuit judge unless he had been duly admitted and licensed a? an attorney and counselor in all of the courts of the state for a period of at least eight years. O'Neill was admitted to the bar on motion in the circuit court for the county of Saginaw, but did not file with the clerk of the supreme court the necessary affidavit to entitle him to practice, in all of the other courts of the state. In that case three opinions were written, all arriving at the ultimate conclusion that O'Neill was entitled to hold the office of circuit judge, but each arrived at its conclusion on an entirely different basis. The three opinions arc mentioned for the reason that in them are collected references to most, if not all, of the reported cases having a direct bearing on the question presented here. </seg>
         <seg id="p167">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 167 ¦ In the majority opinion numerous cases were reviewed which re - sulted in the following pronouncement: "The conclusion is inevitable that under the division of powers in the Michigan Constitution the judiciary is an independent department of the State government and the legisla - ture, has no power to annex.qualifications for circuit judges not found in the Constitution." It will be noted that the majority opinion turned on a question of division of powers of. government. In the second opinion, after review and quotation from numeorus decisions, the conclusion was arrived at.that where the Constitution im - posed no restriction as to eligibility of circuit judges the legislature was without power to do so. „¦ \ In the third it was concluded that O'Neill was qualified to hold the office of circuit judge since he had actually been admitted to practice Jaw in the state for more than eight years, and that the requirement that he file affidavit with the clerk of the supreme court should be held to be merely directory. In this opinion it was concluded that, where the Constitution fails to prescribe qualifications for public, office, the legisla - ture had the right to prescribe the conditions, upon which the right should be conferred. The following from Mechcm, Public Officers, p. 22, sec. 66, was quoted with approval: "Where, however, the Constitution does not prescribe the qualifications (for public office), it is the province and the right of the legislature to declare upon what terms and subject to what conditions: the right shall be conferred." In the opinion in the case of Humphrey! v. Walls, supra, cited by refator, the following is found: "It is a general rule that, where the Con - stitution states the essential qualifications of an official, elective or ap - pointive, created by it, they cannot be varied by.the legislature unless - authorized by the instrument itself;" also the following: "But where, as in this state, the Constitution has declared so unequivocally the condi - tions essential to the eligibility to some offices, and has stated with equal precision other conditions which will render a person ineligibile for any office created by it, it may be assumed that, when it failed to prescribe any special qualifications as essential to eligibility to constitutional of - fices, it did not intend any." With reference to the asserted assumption that a constitutional failure to prescribe special qualifications indicates an intention that there should be none, a reading of the opinion disclose? that this is dicta, since the court was dealing with a situation where'a constitutional restriction had been .imposed to which the legislature sought to add other restrictions. The constitutional restriction was senatorial scrutiny and .'approval. : •,: . v ; •.; From the decisions of this court relator cites. State y, Bartley, 41 Neb. 277, 59 N.: W. 907, and Sttte v. Moorhetd, 99 Neb. 527,156 N.W. 1067. In the opinions in these cases the following is found: "An act </seg>
         <seg id="p168">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 168 which violates the true meaning and intent o( the Constitution and is an evasion of its general express or plainly implied purpose is as clearly void as if in express terms prohibited." From this and the other cases cited it is argued that, from the fact that the Constitution contains no provision for eligibility of-railway commis - sioner* to hold office, it was the implied purpose that there should be none imposed by the legislature. On the other hand it is the contention of the respondent that in the absence of restriction, and in the light of the silence of the Constitution in tliii regard, the legislature has (1) the power to impose conditions ol eligiWliiy upon railway commissioners to liold office which are. not unreasonable, and (2) that the fixing of a minimum age limit of 30 yean i» not unreasonable, In support of respondent's contention with regard to legislative liower, our attention it directed to a number of decisions. In the opinion In Jiniky v. Baldwin, tupra, the following statement* arr found: ' "ThU section ol the Constitution In silent as to requirements of eligi - bility.- It It the rule that when the Constitution of a state creates an nfllre, uml natm&gt;« the requirement* of eligibility therefor, the legislature hat uo uuiliutlty to muko iiutllllotml requirements, nor to provide that one way Imtd the office who docs not have the constitutional require* menu. • • * : "Our (,'onilfiuiloil (arii 5, dt't'i. 2, 5 and 6) has placed certain r«« tiriiiliui* HjMiJi the right ol ttuStraiie and the riflhl to hold office, So long u&gt; ti lc(j|slmlvc net does not Infringe upon those rejtrlclloni, It cannot lie «aid to lie uneonillltiilonal, * * * Suitable educational qualifications ami previous vxperlenee of such officers a* county superintendent 01. imWw iiifiruttipo flmiiflfc with eh/inged eomUtlon* ol the people.

Such reasoning Is very fallacious. This provision was simply intended to limit the number from whom the various officers of this state might be chosen to those having a voice in the selection of such officers, and not In any sense intended to determine the qualifications necessary to properly dis - charge the duties of any office." As has already been pointed out, no similar case has been previously before this court, but very early In the history of the state the court an - nounced a policy and certain principles to be applied in the determina - tion of the legislative prerogative and power when weighed again*! claimed constitutional limitation and Inhibition whleh policy and prin - ciples have been steadfastly adhered to, In HatttnbMk v, Hihn, 2 Neb, 377, It mi Hated!

         <seg id="p170">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 170 In Che recent case of Swaiuon v. State, 132 Neb. 82, 271 N. W. 264, it is stated: "The principles above enunciated have long been approved in this jurisdiction, and we are fully committed to the doctrine that the Constitution of this state is not a grant but a restriction on legislative power, and that the legislature may legislate upon any subject not in - hibited by the Constitution." Other cases supporting this doctrine are State v. Unwttr County, 4 Neb. 53;.- State v. Dodge County, 8 Neb. 124; Shaw w. State, 17 Neb. 334, 22 N. W. 772; Magneau v. Fremont,. 30 Neb. 843. 47 N. W. 280. After examination and analysis of the pertinent constitutional provi - sions and the decisions and authorities, and in the light of the established doctrine of this state pertaining to the power of the legislature to enact laws, we hold: That section 75-101, Comp. St. 1929, is not violative of the true express or implied intent and purpose of the Constitution, That the section docs not establish exclusions from constitutional office, nor annex qualifications expressly or impliedly prohibited by the Constitution. That the section does not have the effect of granting to one class oi voters powers in governmental affairs in excess of those granted to others. That no presumption arises from section 2, art. IV, and section 7, art. V, oi the Constitution, of an intent that the legislature should be without |io\ver to require that railway commissioners should possess reasonable qualifications as a condition of eligibility to hold office. That the limitation oi section 75-101 is not an encroachment by the legislative upon the executive department oi government. We are now confronted with a determination of the question of whether or not the legislative restriction contained in section 75-101, Comp. St. 1929, is unreasonable. This court is not committed to any doctrine on the question of whether reasonableness should be a test of legislative restriction on the right to hold constitutional public office. nor to a method or procedure for the determination of the question of reasonableness if it shall become an issuable matter. The courts of Wisconsin have determined that the question pJ rea^ tonableness is a proper subject of inquiry and judicial review on the theory that legislative restrictions on the right to hold constitutional office are matters coming within the police power. In the case of State v. Phelpi, 144 Wis. I, 128 N. W. 1041, it was held: "It is further ele - mentary that, the extent to which the legislature may go in the field of </seg>
         <seg id="p171">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 171 police power, is primarily a matter for its judgment. As to the case in hand, the same as others, it could not properly go beyond reasonable regulation. However, what is and what is not reasonable, is primarily for legislative judgment, subject to judicial review. Such review does not have to do with expediency. It only deals with whether the inter - ference, from the standpoint of a legitimate purpose, can stand the test of reasonableness, all fair doubts being resolved in favor of the proper exercise of lawmaking power." Whether it be, as in Wisconsin, under the police power, or under the general power of the court, to review the acts of the legislature in a proper action instituted for that purpose in pursuance of the division of the sovereign powers of the state government, it appears clear that the reasonableness of a legislative restriction upon eligibility to hold a constitutionally created office is a proper subject of judicial review, and accordingly that becomes the considered determination of this court. As an aid in determining the reasonableness of the restriction in question, few, if any, extraneous facts are presented. In truth, none could have been presented. We must resort, therefore, to an examination of the constitutional provision creating the railway commission'and prescrib - ing its duties and functions (art. IV, sec. 20), and the statutes adopted in pursuance thereof (Comp. St. 1929, eh. 75. with amendments thereto). In pursuance oi and witton trie power conferred by this provision the legislature, in a full chapter (chapter 75, supra), occupying 20 pages of the statutes not including its. amendments, has defined the many duties of the railway commission. Among the many important duties this commission is called upon to perform are the following: To regulate rates and services of all common carriers, to investigate violations oi law by common carriers, to conduct hearings, to enter orders, to enforce provisions relating to sale of liquid fuel tractor engines in the state, to regulate rates and: service and to have general control over pipe lilies for oil and gas, to regulate the issuance of stocks and bonds of common carriers, to find the valuation of public service corporations in the state. From an examination of this constitutional and these statutory provisions, it is safe to say that no other agency of the state subordinate to the sovereign government itself has more broad, far-reaching and important powers and functions than does the state railway commission. In the light of the common knowledge that the proper understand - ing, determination, administration, execution and control of big prob - lems and multifarious activities require knowledge and experience, and that while age is not the sole factor in the; acquisition of knowledge and ' experience it is an. important one, can this court say that the require - ment that an elector shall have attained the age of 30 years before he </seg>
         <seg id="p172">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 172 shall be eligible to hold the office of state railway commissioner is un - reasonable? We conclude that the question requires a negative answer. From this record we do not know anything about the qualities or in - dividual qualifications of the relator to perform the duties of a railway commissioner. It may be that his personal qualifications are such as would permit him to perform the duties of the office with credit and dispatch, but that is not a matter for proper inquiry here. The only question here is the reasonableness of the restriction in section 75-101, Comp. St. 1929, and it is held that in the light of the importance of the {unction:, of the office as disclosed by the Constitution and the statutes the restriction is not unreasonable. ¦ It is, therefore, the opinion of this court that the decision and judg - iiu-ni of the district court should be and are reversed, and the petition oi relator is dismissed.

         <seg id="p197">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 197 BEFORE THE NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION In the Matter oi the Application oi the) Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway) APPLICATION NO. 15430 Company for Authority to Institute Se-) /ective-Stop System. ) ; ' BY THE COMMISSION: This application, filed October 22, 1942 by the Omaha and Council Bluffs Street Railway Company, contemplates the elimination of a num - ber of street car and bus stops on applicant's transportation system for the duration of the war. The proposed plan of street car and bus stops is referred to by the applicant as a "selective-stop system." ¦¦V. - ¦ ' : ¦-'..¦'¦¦ " ¦ . :¦ ¦ . Under the selective-stop system, street car and bus stops would ap - proximate alternate street intersections outside the business district ex - clusive of stops' at churches, schools, hospitals, railroad stations, trans - fer points and other places of public assembly. The term "business dis - trict," for the purposes, of the selective-stop system, is deemed to mean that portion of the downtown business section of the City of Omaha •which is bounded on the east by 10th street, on the south by Leaven - worth Street on the west by 24th street, and on the north by Cutning Street and is further deemed to include the business sections of Benson and South Omaha. . V ¦ . This application results from proposals by the Office of Defense Transportation of certain war conservation measures to be followed by bus companies and street railway companies. The Office of Defense Transportation proposals suggest, among other things, the selective - stop method of receiving and discharging passengers. The basic formula for the selective-stop method has been expressed by the Office of Defense Transportation in the following words: ; "The number of passenger stopping-places on bus and street car route's should be reduced wherever possible. A stopping-place within 500 feet of another is undesirable and wasteful and should be eliminated. A reasonable standard is to space stopping-places .at distances of 680 feet to 1200 feet." The distance between stopping places under applicant's proposed selective-stop system will average about 750 feet. - Applicant expects the selective-stop system to decrease wear and tear upon its equipment, tracks, and roadway, thus conserving material and to also conserve electric energy and man-power. \- The Commission is of the opinion and finds: 1. That the proposed selective-stop system is in the. public interest and the application should be granted, and applicant authorized to institute </seg>
         <seg id="p198">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 198 a selective-stop system upon its street railway and bus lines based upon the standards of reasonableness promulgated by the Office of Defense Transportation. 2. That an emergency exists and applicant should be authorized to inaugurate the selective-stop system on its street car and bus lines upon one day's notice and to continue said selective-stop system {or the dura - tion of the war or until further order of this Commission. . v ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that application No. 15430 be, and is hereby granted and the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway Company be, and it is hereby authorized to institute a selective-stop system upon its street railway and tins lines based upon the standards of reasonableness promulgated liy tlie Office of Defense Transportation.

The activities of the Commission in the motor transportation! field in prior years are related in the 1937, 1938,1939,1940 and 1941 annual reports of the Commission. The Commission has jurisdiction under the Nebraska Motor Carrier Act to regulate the activities of both common and contract carriers en - gaged, in Nebraska intrastate commerce. The number of motor vehicles registered with the Motor Transportation Department during the year 1942 was 4821; of this number 4127 units were registered for the trans- </seg>
         <seg id="p208">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 208 portation of property. The remaining, 694 units, were licensed lot the transportation of passengers, including both buses and taxicabs. During the year, 319 new, supplemental or extension applications were filed with the department. With the exceptions of sand and gravel applications, transfer applications and temporary authority applications, hearings were held before Examiners of the Commission and all appli - cations have been acted upon. ¦ . During the year the construction of many defense plants has been authorized in the state, some have been completed and are in. actual oper - ation, many are still in process of construction. The large influx of la - bor at these points has required the issuance 1 of temporary authority in order to assure their transportation to and from their place of employ - ment. Numerous problems have arisen but the 'Commission has pro - vided sufficient and reasonably satisfactory transportation service to meet the requirements of the large number of both the military and civilian personnel at these places which include ammunition plants and depots, air bases, bomber plants and internment camps. The carriers are experiencing increasing difficulty in securing equip - ment and repairs; much more difficulty in the future may be expected. Together with the manpower situation these needs cause grave concern. The Commission is cooperating with federal agencies, and the carriers to do everything possible to conserve equipment and to curtail opera - tions to essential transportation in order to avoid a complete breakdown in our motor transportation system. This policy, however, has in- no way jeopardized transportation facilities available to the public. The inspectors oi the Motor Transportation Department have con - tinued to be an effective enforcement division of the Nebraska State Railway Commission. Most of the violations have been wilful, inasmuch as truck operators throughout the state have had sufficient time to be - come acquainted with the provisions of the Nebraska Motor Carrier Acr and the rules and regulations of the Commission. The problems oi the enforcement division have increased due to the increased operations of the carriers resulting from the increased demand for their services. Many certificates of public convenience and necessity have been sus - pended or "frozen" for the duration because the carrier has been inducted or volunteered for service in the armed forces, or has become engaged in essential war work. A few certificates have been suspended because of the serious manpower and equipment situation resulting in the in - ability of some carriers to continue their operations. In this connection the Commission has provided the communities affected with.motor-trans - portation services. To the knowledge of the Commission there is no community in the state which does not have available the services of motor carriers. </seg>
         <seg id="p209">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 209 Many private industries have discontinued the use of their own equipment and as a result, a large load has been thrown upon the common and contract carriers under the jurisdiction of this Commission. In many instances an immediate need has arisen for their services. This has also occurred in connection with the operations of passenger car - riers, especially in defense areas. To take care of this immediate need the Commission has granted temporary authorities without a hearing so that this service could be furnished immediately and without the usual lapse of time between the filing of the application and the granting of authority by the Commission. '¦¦ An interesting case is now pending before the Supreme Court to de - termine the Commission's authority to classify regular and irregular route carriers. .'. ¦ • On June 4, 1941, the Commission issued an order against William kassebaum, dba Kassebaum Truck Line, Hebron, Nebraska, to appear and show cause why his certificate of public convenience and necessity should not be suspended, cancelled, anulled or revoked for wilful failure to comply with the Nebraska Motor Carrier Act and the rules and regu - lations of this Commission. This order was issued on the basis of in - formation and investigation that Kassebaum was operating regularly be - tween Hebron and Lincoln in violation of his irregular route authority. After hearing, the Commission on November 19, 1941, issued an order to Kassebaum to forthwith cease and desist from said regular route oper - ations between these points; Motion for rehearing was duly filed by respondent, Kassebaum, (*) and on January 28, 1942, the Commission issued its order overruling said motion. An appeal was perfected by re - spondent to the Supreme Court of Nebraska on April 27, 1942. Briefs were duly filed by the respondent and the Commission. The matter was argued before the Supreme Court on October 9, 1942, with Mr. Edwin Vail, Assistant Attorney General, appearing in behalf of the Commission. The matter is still pending in the Supreme Court, and the Court's opin - ion will undoubtedly be filed within a very short time. During the year 1942 the Commission has continued its policy oi cooperating with the Interstate Commerce Commission by attending informal conferences. All joint board hearings in which the State of Nebraska is interested have been attended.: This policy has resulted in close cooperation between the Commission and the Interstate Commerce Commission relative to problems affecting either Commission. .(?)

He further testified thai the 1.T.1., operation between Fremont and Lincoln has never made any connection at Fremont with the Norfolk bus, and that the proposed schedule herein will make connectons not only with its Norfolk bus, but also with the Burlington Transportation Company's east bound conti - nental fius which arrives in Fremont at 7:38 P.M. He further stated that loi-al ticket sales of I.T.L. showed that unless applicant could get the lung-haul business as well as the local business on its Lincoln-Fremont operation, it would be unable to comply with G.O. No. 11 of the Office of Defense Transportation, which requires that the number of passenger miles on each schedule shall not be less than Aof c of the number of seat miles. Protestant, L. F. Fisher, a certificated motor carrier under the juris - diction of the Commission d/b/a Elkhorn Valley Stages, Fremont, test}-' fied that, to his knowledge, I.T.L. had never attempted to make connec - tions with its Norfolk bus at Fremont at any time prior to October 15, 1042; that he commendecd rendering bus service between Lincoln and Fremont about six years ago and has, until October 15, 1942, made con - nections with the I.T.L. Norfolk bus; that his bus left Fremont' at ap - proximately 7:45 P.M. with minor changes from time to time which were made for the purpose of coordinating his schedule with that of the I.T.L. Norfolk schedule; that this connection supplied him with eight to ten passengers daily and about twenty passengers on Sunday; that if he were compelled to make connections with the Burlington east bound bus only, he would secure about one passenger per day from this interchange; that he is desirous of maintaining his connection with the Norfolk bus and that, in his opinion, if the application is approved it will result in a dupli - cation of service and neither Lincoln-Fremont operation will be profit - able and will result in forcing protestant out of business. He testified that in view of the six years of hard effort he has spent in building up a business on this operation, his continuous connection with the I.T.L. Norfolk luis and the I.T.L. failure to make the connection, the proposed schedule of the applicant should he denied.

It seems clear that these ' provisions prevent the defendant from making such changes in the service without first obtaining the authority of the state &#132; railway commission so to do." -. ¦ .':.:- In affirming the Commission order, the Supreme Court in Funtenberg v. Omaha ft C. B. Street R. Co., 132 Nebr. 562, stated: "In 1907 the legislature adopted an act defining its powers and duties and provided generally; the authority that the railway commission may exercise over common carriers. Both by the Constitution and statute the railway commission is given full power to regulate and control them. The railway commission is thereby clothed with administrative, legislative and judicial powers. No specific legislation has limited or affected this power, and the people have given; the railway commission all the . control over common carriers that they themselves could exer - cise. In re .Lincoln Traction Company, 103 Neb. 229. We have </seg>
         <seg id="p254">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 254 said that such powers thus possessed by the railway commission are to be liberally construed. In re Yellow Cab &amp; Baggage Co. I&gt;6 Neb. 138"». The facilities of administrative law with the combination of ad- ¦• ministrative, legislative and judicial powers such as the railway commission have been developed by the people of this state and in the country generally for the purpose of providing direct, swiftly-moving, effective, nonpolitical protection of the&gt; public. The primary object of the regulation of public utilities by the rail - way commission is not to establish a monopoly or to guarantee the security of investment in public service corporations, but first and at all times, to serve the interests of the public." . In Dixie Greyhound Lines v. Mississippi Railroad Commission, 174 Miss, i, 16.' So. 443, the appellant, Dixie Greyhound Lines operated one schedule a day between Jackson and Vicksburg. Its competitor, the Motor Transportation Company, operated three schedules per day over the same highway between the same termini. Subsequently, the appel - lant discontinued its one schedule and the- Motor Company secured au - thority from the Commission to operate four schedules per day. There - after, the appellant applied to the Commission for approval of a time schedule of operations between the same termini. The Commission de - nied the application. The circuit court dismissed the direct appeal, since no such appeal was deemed to have been provided for by any statute then in force and dismissed the appeal by certiorari on the ground that the order of the Railroad Commission, which denied the appellant's ap - plication to operate an additional schedule was legislative and adminis - trative, not judicial. The court did not consider the evidenct-heard be - fore the Commission, since it was not reviewable on certiorari but did lake cognizance of the fact that the Dixie Company had permitted a period oi one year to lapse without resuming operation, and. Motor' Tran - sportation had in the meantime with the approval of the Commission be - gun to fully meet the public convenience and necessity by four schedules each way per day. • In MawhaU v. Bush, \O2 Neb. 279, the Supreme Court in vacating an order of the Railway Commission with reference to passenger train service stated: ; "There is a distinction, however, between imposing the duty of service and the regulation of rates. It may become necessary, in order to furnish proper service, as required under the charter, that a railroad company be required to operate a branch line at a loss, or to furnish certain other service for less than actual cost. V. It is also true that the nature and extent of the existing facilities ' furnished by a railroad company must be considered in determin - ing whether a requirement that such facilities be increased is : .-¦¦¦¦ : ¦ i. </seg>
         <seg id="p255">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION" 255 just and reasonable. If it'were shown that the enforcement of the order would so affect the'general scheme of the operation of the entire system, that it would inevitably require its operation : at a loss, then the order might be considered so unreasonable as to violate the Fourteenth Amendment." ¦ ¦ In Southern Motorways v. Perry, 39 F. (2nd) 144, the Georgia Su - preme Court stated: -¦¦ ¦ . ¦ ¦'¦.-¦¦'. '¦' ',:'¦¦'¦¦"... "This brings us to the; regulation by restriction of the schedules. Such a regulation appears to have a double source, partly for ' "convenience of the : public in having certain and regularly • spaced schedules and partly in the interest of safety on the road and'in having top many or too. speedy ones. No serious ques - tion of the power to regulate in these respects seems possible, unless the regulation be an arbitrary one. 1' '.: On April 8, 1908, the Nebraska State Railway Commission adopted General Order No. 11 which required that railroads obtain permission from the Commission in order to discontinue train service. In State v. C. AN. W. Railroad Company, 112 Neb. 177, the railroad company con - tended that General Order No. 11 was void and made without jurisdiction. The court upheld the validity of the Commission's order. In Tri-State v. Transit Company Extension, 9 M.C.C. 531, the appli - cant sought a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the transporatton oi passengers between Many, La. and Nacogdoches, Tex. over certain highways. . The applicant, had authority to conduct such operations from Natchitoches to Many, La. The purpose of the extension was to connect with bus lines then operated by applicant from Shreveport, La. through Nacogdoches to Houston, and from Shreveport through Many to Lake Charles, La. A through bus could be operated from Natchitoches to Nacogdoches connecting at: that point with appli - cant's own line or with other carriers for points in central and southern Texas. Applicant then operated one trip daily from Natchitoches to Many and under the proposed through-route from Natchitoches to Nacogdoches, applicant would operate three round trips daily. Protestant conducted three round trips daily between Nacogdoches and Many, the route over which applicant proposed to operate. .The Commission held that the service of protestant was adequate to take care of the needs of both intrastate and interstate traffic and that the volume of traffic over the new route was not sufficient to support another bus line. In Smoky Mountain Tours Co. 10 M.C.C. 127, in deciding two appli - cations {or the same extension simultaneously filed, the Commission granted one and denied the other. The Commission said: ; . . ¦ "However, since the Stages Company has maintained a regular ¦ service over a period of years in the; immediate vicinity of the </seg>
         <seg id="p256">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 256 extension requested, serving a majority of the. principal points ¦ during that period, we are of the opinion that to authorize opera - tion by Dayton Brothers at this time would offer opportunity to that carrier to secure business now and previously enjoyed by the Stages Company." •-'. ¦'"..•¦ In Chicago Motor Bus Company v. Chicago Stage Company, 287 111. 320. 122 N.E. 477. it is said: "l( both companies were equally capable ot rendering adequate service to the public, fairness and justice required, it seems to us, that preference should have been given appellant, in view of the time and money it had spent in developing its business and ren - derig adequate service to the public." In re: Harry White, PUR 1924 E, 316, the Maryland Public Service Commission held that a motor vehicle operator who has built up a busi - ness between specified points after years of effort should not be deprived of the fruits of his labor and of the capital he has invested in his opera - tion by a larger concern desiring to operate between the same points. ; (n Electric Railway Company v. P.U.C. of Ohio, 118 Ohio 173, 160 N.E. 685, the Railway Company on its operation between Lorain and Cleveland had a schedule 1 fifty minutes after every hour from 7:50 A.M. to 7:50 P.M. and at that time the Coach Company had a similar schedule forty minutes after each hour on the same run. Subsequently, the Rail - way Company requested and secured permission to alter its schedule to forty minutes after each hour. Then the Coach Company requested a change in its schedule to every half-hour mark, which request was the issue in controversy. The evidence showed that the Coach Company busses had been stopping at the Railway Company ticket office and picking up its passen - ger^ The Court, in reversing the order of the Commission approving the change of schedule, said: "It is evident that this change in schedule is requested not because o! public convenience and necessity, but plainly in order to pick up prospective passengers from a competing traction company. I'nder such circumstances, as clearly established as this record shows them to be, it is unreasonable and unlawful for the Public Utilities Commission to authorize a change of schedule." In John McFayden v. Public Utilities Consolidated Corporation, 299 Pac. 671, the Idaho Supreme Court in affirming the Commission's order granting a certificate of convenience ad necessity authorizing the rendi - tion of natural gas service, held that as between two utilities of like ability to furnish like service under the Public Utility Law, the company already serving a given field has the right to preference. </seg>
         <seg id="p257">NEBRASKA. STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 257 . In re: ~ Interstate Transit Ltaw, P.U.R., 1931 A 318, the Missouri Public Setvice Commission in denying the application for a certificate oi public convenience and necessity, held that the Commission doe» not seek to establish either a monopoly or competition in the matter of bus service, but its policy will be guided entirely by evidence as to what the public convenience and necessity requires, giving due consideration to trans - portation service being furnished by existing carriers. ¦:.;'¦ The Supreme -Court of Illinois in Superior Motor Bui Company v. Community Motor But Company, 150 N.E. 668, held that the action of the Illinois Commerce Commission in granting a certificate of convenience and necessity to operate motor busses over a route for which a similar carrier has been given a certificate, and whose service has been meeting all the requirements of the public and. the Commission, is unreasonable and confiscatbry when there is not sufficient traffic to justify the operation of two lines. ; From the application, the evidence adduced, and the statements and representations of counsel, the Commission, being fully advised in the premises, finds as follows: - • (1) That protestant, L. F. Fisher, has made connection on his - Fremont-Lincoln operation with the I.T.L. Norfolk opera - tion for the past six years. . ' . (2) That protestant L. F. Fisher, is ready, willing and able to .; continue said connection. .-'. . V (3) That the service proposed by the applicant is identical with ' . : that presently rendered by protestant. ;; : (4) That applicant failed to prove that the present and future public convenience and necessity require the proposed serv - ice, nor has applicant shown that the service rendered by , protestant, Fisher, on the Norfolk connection was inadeq - quate to meet the needs of the travelling public. i (5) That the present situation has arisen by reason of the various . orders of the Office of Defense Transportation,, and not / through any fault on the part of protestant, Fisher. : '¦,: (6) That the approval of the applicant's proposed schedule would result in the destruction of protestant's business. : , (7) That Fisher should be permitted to continue affording con - nections; with the Norfolk bus. , '-¦'¦¦'¦"'•' (8) That the application of Interstate Transit Lines for the ap - proval of its proposed service schedule between Lincoln and ; Fremont, Nebraska, filed October 9, 1942, and as amended i October.

Recognizing the inhergnt advantages of transportation by motor carriers, and in order to develop and preserve a highway transportation system properly adapted to the needs of the commerce of Nebraska, the Commission prescribed and adopted certain rules and regulations, here - inafter more specifically referred to, which have tended to foster sound economic conditions in the motor transportation industry and among regulated motor carriers of the state in the public interest </seg>
         <seg id="p288">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 288 More than 6,000 applications for certificates, permits and transfers have been heard; more than 4,000 certificates and permits have been issued and more than 2,000 certificates and permits are now in active force authorizing the carriage of the various commodities moving in the com - merce of Nebraska. Operations have been authorized between fixed termini over desig - nated highways at regular intervals of time, and operations hay; been authorized from radial areas to and from named destinations and other - wise generally throughout the state over irregular routes, and at irregu - lar intervals of time. Rules and regulations have been prescribed and adopted governing the filing and approval of policies of insurance, qualifications of carriers, self-insurers, and for the filing of other securities or agreements con - ditioned to pay all judgments recovered against motor carriers for bodily injuries to, or the death of, any person resulting from the negligent opera - tion, maintenance or use of motor vehicles under certificates or permits, and for the loss or damage to property of others. Regulations have also been prescribed and adopted requiring common carriers to compensate shippers for damage to lading in transit. Motor tariffs, and supplements thereto, have be'en adopted and pub - lished, providing a method for computing distances to and from all points and places throughout the state by airline measurement; lading has been classified and rates prescribed for the carriage of general commodities to and from all points and places throughout the state; a uniform bill-of - lading has been prescribed and adopted; forms of freight bills have been standardized and uniform regulations adopted governing their issuance and use in the movement of all lading. Numerous hearings have been held all over the state to explain the tariffs to carriers, shippers and everyone interested therein. The importance and necessity of charging the rates prescribed in the tariffs and all other rules and regulations there - in havt been stressed. The cooperation of carriers and shippers alike has been gratifying. There have been violations, due to honest mistakes and to misinter - pretation, not only of the Motor Carrier Act, but also of the rules and regulations prescribed thereunder by the Commission. These violations have not been repeated when called to the attention of the offenders. Willful violators have been prosecuted in the courts and fines of varying amounts have been imposed. Injuctions have been obtained in extreme cases against both carriers and shippers who willfully, habitually and con - temptuously disregarded the law. The Commission, having had the benefit of numerous conferences, hearings, complaints, investigations and actual experience in enforc - ing and supervising the provisions of the Motor Carrier Act, being fully advised in the premises, is o5 the opinion that an order should be entered </seg>

Our decision was made effective by publication of the tariff of Official Common Carrier Truck rates, Classification, Rules and Regulations effective Feb - ruary 14, 1938. The prescribed tariff as modified is now in effect in Of - ficial Motor Vehicle Tariff No. 2 and effective supplements thereto. . These tariffs -were prescribed to govern the ordinary transportation of freight. They did not provide rules, regulations, rates or charges covering special or unusual transportation services by motor vehicle carriers. At the time these tariffs were made effective applying to ordinary freight transportation by motor vehicle carriers, four applications for au - thority to continue operations as common carriers of motion picture films, theatre supplies and related commodities were pending before the Com - mission. Such applications were filed on behalf of the common carrier? listed below. ¦ i '. '»•;¦¦"¦ ¦ ' ¦ ,:. -::¦¦ . . '¦ '¦'¦¦.'¦:'¦¦.¦ -.¦¦'¦¦¦ "'¦ M. G. Rogers and F. P.

Lysinger, dba Rapid Film Service, Grand Island, Nebraska. These film transport common carriers operate light equipment, at high speed and usually at night. Their principle function is to deliver, new films and pick-up used films required in the changing programmes of the motion-picture theatres of this state. Such service also involves dis - tribution of posters or other theatre advertising matter and supplies.; Such operations, at night after motion-picture theatres arc closed, make it necessary for the carriers to have keys to the theatres served and to en - jny the complete confidence of patrons. The failure of the film transfer company to deliver the proper film at the right time might entail heavy losses to the motion-picture theatre served. As an incident to such express film service these carriers transport limited quantities of small parcels, magazines and daily newspapers in connection with which high speed regular service is necessary. The nature of these special services of common carriers of motion picture films and related • commodities was known to the Commission when the regular freight service rate schedules became effective February 14, 1938. Concurrently with the effective date of such freight tariffs a hearing was held on February 7, 1938, at which the film transport carriers were directed to show cause why the rates and charges, then in effect, should not be prescribed for future application by order of the Commission. Schedules showing such rates and charges were filed with the film carriers application for a certificate or in the files of the Commission responsive to the order to show cause. While there has been little or no complaint concerning the rates and charges applicable to the special services of the film transporter, the carriers involved have conferred with the staff of the Commission from time to time for the purpose of determining more uniform charges, and rates, to clarify the applicable rules and regulations and to make such rates, rules and regulations harmonize with those applicable to the freight carriers with whom the film carriers compete as to a limited volume and class of traffic. ; As the result of these hearings, conferences and co-operative efforts of the Commission and the regulated carriers, a tariff of rates, charges, rules and regulations governing transportation of Motion Picture Films, Theatre supplies and Related Commodities has been prepared. A copy of the tariff is attached hereto and marked Exhibit A. As a result o5 our hearing and investigation, herein we are of the opinion and find: I. That just and reasonable rates, charges, rules and regulations, as </seg>
         <seg id="p293">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 293 set forth in "Exhibit A" attached hereto and made a part hereof, should be published in tariff form to be known as "Official Film Carrier Tariff, Resolution 146, Division A" and should be prescribed as the only lawful basis for determining rates, charges, rules and regulations governing the transportation of Motion picture Films, Theatre Supplies and Related Commodities, between points in Nebraska by motor vehicle common car - riers authorized to transport motion picture films. ..-..'¦ ¦ n.¦;-- ¦¦.¦¦¦¦ . ¦'¦¦: ; -..'¦¦" ¦' That the initial prescription of such uniform, rates, charges, rules and regulations governing transportation" of motion picture films, theatre supplies and related commodities constitutes an emergency justifying the. prescription of the new tariff schedule to become effective March 13, 1942.

The proposed increases were requested to compensate the petitioning rail carriers for wage increases resulting from mediation by the Presi - dent's Emergency Board which allowed various increases in wages retro - active from September 1, and, in part, from December 1, 1941, and also to take care of increased costs of materials and supplies. At the hearings in Ex Parte 148 at St. Louis Jan. 5, 1942, The American Truckers' Asso - ciation and local truckers organizations from all parts of the United States, including the Nebraska Commercial Truckers' Association, intervened and requested the Interstate Commerce Commission to permit them to make increases in their rates and charges equal to those authorized for rail car - riers and for the same reasons of increased operating expenses arising from increased wages and costs of materials and supplies. Incidentally, it may be noted that barge lines operating on inland waterways, water carriers" on the Great Lakes and coastwise steamship lines also filed their peti - tions in intervention seeking rate increases comparable to those granted competing rail lines and for the same reasons. ¦ ¦ _•• . : All Nebraska railroads filed their application No. 15073 with us, ask - ing authority to make the same increases in Nebraska intrastate rates, fares, and charges as may be granted for interstate application in Ex Parte 148. Nebraska regulated motor vehicle carriers considered the need for increased rates and charges at 12 district meetings held in .all parts of Nebraska and voted in favor o! submission of proposed increases in.rate? and charges to the Commission. Following these district meetings The Nebraska Commercial Truckers filed this petition for an increase of 10 percent in all truck rates and charges. Hearing on this petition was held at Lincoln on February 19, 1942. Applicants amended their petition to re - quest the same increases in rates and charges as may be granted to the </seg>
         <seg id="p295">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 295 railroads and asked that such increases be made effective simultaneously with the changes in railroad tariffs. Applicants say that they have suffered heavy increases in labor costs, in prices of materials and supplies and that they have suffered from the loss of revenues from many important commodities of commerce such as automobiles, tires, refrigerators, machinery, etc. which are no longer being produced and shipped in normal volume because of war conditions. Some general estimates of increased costs range from 12 to 20 percent. One witness testified that terminal employees wages at Omaha, Lincoln and Grand Island were 45 cents per hour in 1938 and are now 52% cents to 57yi cents per hour.' During the same period clerical salaries have been increased 60 percent. On January 19th, 1942, over the road drivers re - ceived an increase of 13.33 percent retroactive to November 16, 1941. An exhibit of record shows that the operating expenses, depreciation, taxes and rents of a large truck line operator were from 95.43 percent to 9821 percent of gross revenues during the years 1939, 1940 and 1941. It is estimated that if this line earned the same revenues, in 1942 as in 1941 the increased Wages and expenses would equal 110.83 percent of the gross revenues.. ¦ '. '...¦'- '¦'.¦&gt; ¦' '¦ ¦ '.'¦¦}¦¦¦¦, -¦'-'-.[¦ V ' '¦¦"'.. A large number of typical operators offered supporting testimony, alt tending to show that the small, medium and large truck lines are all fac - ing the same problem of expenses increased more rapidly than , rates or revenues. The witnesses were agreed as to the necessity for making . the requested truck rate increases the same as those granted to the rail - roads and that the increased truck rates and charges should became ef - fective simultaneously with any increases in railroad rates and charges. On March 2, 1942, the Interstate Commerce Commission made iv decision in Ex Parte 148 authorizing increases of six percent in rail rates and charges with the exception of basic agricultural commodities, animals and products and products of mines which were subjected to an increase of 3 percent. Authority was given to publish the rate increases on 10 days notice to the public. Tariffs have been prepared to make the increases effective March 18, 1942. : In our, decision of March 6, 1942, in Application 15073 we have ap - proved intrastate increases in railroad rates and charges the same as those authorized by the Interstate Commerce Commission with certain'clarify - ing minor additions, to become effective. March 18, 1942. The decision of .the Interstate Commerce Commission iii Ex Parte 148 provides authority for the intervening truck lines, barge lines and other water carriers "to make the same increases as the Class I rail - roads". : ; ¦¦""'¦¦ .;:':V.:;..-;: -'.' v: -v ¦•"'¦ ¦¦' ' ;'" '¦'¦'¦¦'"¦ ¦ From our discussion of the evidence received herein it must be ap- </seg>

BY THE COMMISSION: • This application was filed February: 13, 1942 by the McCook Ditch Company of Lincoln, Nebraska and came on for public hearing in the Court House at McCook on the 18th and 19th days of March, 1942. The Mc- Cook Ditch Company, a Nebraska corporation, by its application seeks authority to .increase, its charges to patrons receiving water from its irriga - tion system in Hitchcock and Red Willow Counties. The charge now:in ef - fect by virtue of a former order of this Commission (F.C. 209, November 13, 1914) is $2.00 per acre per annum-maintenance charge to holders of perpetual water rights. The application states that $3.00 per acre per annum is the charge to non-holders of water rights; i.c.'to patrons who have not purchased water rights but who are furnished water on an an - nual rental basis. Applicant proposes the following charges: $3.00 per. acre per annum operation and maintenance charge 1 to holders of perpetual water rights; $4.50 per acre per annum operation and maintenance charge to non-holders of water rights.-';*;: ....-•.. '.-¦• &#132;',; The McCook Ditch Company acquired titje to the property on April 28, 1936. The immediate predecessor of the McCook Ditch Company was W. H. Ferguson who, on March 28, 1916 acquired title by Receiver's Deed from Roy H. Kirk, Receiver of the McCooklrrlgation and Water Power Company.

         <seg id="p298">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 298 Formal Complaint No. 209 was considered by the Commission after hearing and an order was made and entered on the 13th day of November, 1914. The Commission's order, in briei, provided: 1. The McCook Irrigation and Water Power Company was author - ized to increase its maintenance charges to water right holders from $1.00 to $2.00 per annum per acre. 2. Said Company was required to set aside each year $4,500 of its revenues for the operation, maintenance and betterment of its ditch and appurtenances, and to place any portion of that amount unexpended in the operation for any year in a reserve or depreciation fund, the same to be used only in an emergency resulting from floods or wash-outs or in the replacement or betterment of the ditch and its appurtenances. '¦•{¦ This order of the Commission was appealed to the Nebraska Supreme Court and was affirmed April 3, 1915. (See McCook Irrigation and Water Power Co. v. Burtless, 98 Neb. 141; 152 N.W. 334). It is apparent that the Commission in authorizing The McCook Irri - gation and Water Power Company to increase its maintenance charge to water right holders from $1.00 to $2.00 per acre per annum, intended that a contingency fund be created which would be used to rehabilitate the company's irrigation works in cases of emergency. From figures sub - mitted in evidence in the instant matter by the McCook Ditch Company, it is obvious that no such fund exists for the reason that all revenue de - rived from operations has been used to pay operating expenses. The record shows applicant's total assets in the amount of $15,953.72 as ol December 31, 1941 consisted of cash in bank, $148.97; a truck $400.00, and an irrigation system, $15,40475. As of the same' date it had accounts payable to others, $1,55170; to Ferguson and Company, $11,106.74; Capi - tal stock $10,000.00 and a deficit of $6,704.72. The deficit was the result of operations since 1936 and the absorption of $5,000.00 paid in surplus that applicant provided at the commencement of its business in 1936, The results of operation, reported on a cash basis, are reflected a* follows: RECEIPTS D _^ Water Annual • Front or Year Right Land Rental* Total EXPENSE Lot! 1936 $4,142.3S $240.00 $4,382.35 $10,157.46 $ *5,775.U 1937 4,581.58 465.00 5,046.58 7,464.76 ?2,418.18 1938 4,277.94 583.00 4,860.94 5,958.51 »1,097.57 1939 4,634.60 825.00 5,459.60 4,836.43 623.17 1940 4820.00 682.50 5,502.50 6,185.94 * 683.44 1941 4,645.10 795.73 5,440.83 7,694.32 ?2^53.49 • Loss '¦-.' - </seg>
         <seg id="p299">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY; COMMISSION 299 In the instant proceeding, the objectors' chief complaint is that ap - plicant does not have an adequate diversion dam on the Republican river. The Republican river flood of 1935 scoured out or lowered the river bed thereby making it necessary to maintain a higher dam in order to divert water into the McCook Ditch Company's canal. Applicant company, from year to year, has built a sand bag dam for diverting water. This, however, is neither economical nor satisfactory. It is uneconomical be - cause it is a recurring expense making up a large part of the company's annual operating expense. It is unsatisfactory because a sand bag dam may be washed out when the irrigators' crops are greatly in need of water. This was the case during the summer of 1941 when a flood washed out the diversion dam. At that time the potato crop needed water and it was alleged suffered damage because of the lack of water. During the hearing remedial measures' which might be beneficial at the diversion dam were discussed. It seemed to be: the consensus of opinion of the irrigators that a.sand pump or suction dredge used on the river at the diversion dam would benefit both the company and the irrigators. It appears that if a sand pump could be successfully operated at the diversion dam, the company's operating expense over a period of time would be reduced while tending to insure an adequate supply'of water to the irrigators In view of the company's experience, it is very desirable that a different method of constructing a diversion dam be tried. The choice of method, however, is within the scope of managerial dis - cretion, so long as the method results in economical'and efficient opera - tion, and should not be prescribed by the Commission at this time. Mr. Robert L. Ferguson, president of the firm of Ferguson and Company, which owns the controlling interest in. the McCook Ditch Company, on cross-examination by Mr. Kelly testified as follows: "Q. You have'asked in this petition that is on file here for a $3.00 raise, that is for a $1.00 raise—a raise to $3.00 for maintenance to be charged for the perpetual water right owners—do you feel that in view of the experience of the last two or three years ;., that it will require the full $3.00 to take care of the operating ' ; expenses? .¦ -_¦ ;'-' : - '¦¦¦'-¦:' ; ' " ..;.-/¦ A. Well our average operating costs for the years 1937 to 1941,.inclusive, figures out approximately $2.50 an acre. . Q.

         <seg id="p300">THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 300 tion of approximately 50c an acre on an average for the last 5 years—a total loss of $6,452. With a $3.00 rate we would have enough money to operate the canal, provided we can do so at no greater expense than we have had on the average for the past 5 years, and we would have approximately $1,100 - a year as reserve, or cushion to take care of any extra operat - ing expenses that may be forced upon us because of War conditions and one thing and another, and reimburse the ditch company for the $6,500 they have lost in the last' 5 years. It is obvious such an arrangement as we 1 have now, in which the big end of Worthington's salary is paid by us for farming expenses, and the office expense and the auditor is not charged for, that arrangement may not be possible to continue, xx x , Q. How much of the increase have you figured for reimburse - ment ior past deficiencies? A. Well, in my own mind I feel it would, require approxi - mately $2.75 an acre for actual operating expenses, unless we are lucky this year and don't have any flash floods that take out our dam. If we are, it won't require that much money, it would leave perhaps 25c a year or approximately $500 or $600 a year that can be used to bolster the* ditch company's financial condition, pay some of its debts and accumulate some money against the time when they will be faced with another severe loss. Q. Do you feel that the operating expenses will increase over the five year average? A. 1 do. The sacks have gone up from $37.50 a thousand to $110.00 a thousand unless we can find some substitute material, and no doubt, perhaps not this season, but eventu - ally, we will be faced with the payment of higher wages for the work done on the ditch. Q. Do you contemplate a continuance of the present diversion set-up you have at the in-take? A. We shall until we figure out something better." • '".., It must be realized that any rate 1 prescribed by this Commission should not be in such amoujit as would enable recoupment of -past operat - ing losses. Under a charge of $2.75 per acre to users with perpetual water rights (on 2,251.5 acres), the annual receipts will amount to $6191.63. Witnesses for applicant testified that revenue derived from annual renters amounted to approximately Wfo of the amount received from water-right holders. Based upon such an estimation, the gross anticipated revenue would amount to $6,810.79 per annum. It will bf </seg>
         <seg id="p301">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 301 noted that this amount is less than the expenses incurred during the years 1936, 1937 and 1941. In this connection it is observed that those: years were extraordinary by reason of floods and washouts. Whether it would be possible to establish a charge that will meet these contingencies is problematical. Furthermore, it is doubtful that a charge that will bring a reasonable return, on the investment in property used and useful in rendering service, would be beneficial to either the applicant or its customers. Mr. Ferguson testified that applicant is not requesting a charge that will result in a reasonable return to which it may be justly entitled. Chances are if such a charge were fixed, it would be - come burdensome on the water-users, and might be in excess of what the service is worth to them.' On the other hand the Commission should authorize a charge sufficient to produce funds adequate to pay actual operating costs. Any balance of funds remaining should be set aside as a contingency reserve. ¦' ' ; ' The Commission, is of the opinion that the applicant is entitled,to relief and should be permitted to make an upward adjustment .'of its charges, but feels that the full increase prayed for is not warranted and should not be'allowed. The.Commission is also of the opinion that an annual operating and maintenance charge for water-users not hold - ing waters rights should be established. The irrigation season in that area commences, April Ist arid.,said charges should become effective immediately. , ..... : Having given due consideration to the evidence in this matter and be - ing fully advised in the premises, the Commission finds: 1.

(For extension of time for Nebraska exchange. ) conversion of the Ord ex - change to September 26, ¦__ 1943.) OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: The order herein entered on the 26th day of September, 1941, stipu - lates that the conversion of the Ord Exchange shall take place within a period oi one year from date of September 26, 1941, unless extended by further order of this Commission. In this instant application we are advised by the applicant that upon receipt of Supplemental Order No. 1. dated October 10, 1941, it immedi - ately proceeded with its plans for the purchase of material to complete - the conversion. It has received all of the new telephone (monophone sets) for the conversion of the telephones. The switchboard order was placed on December 9. 1941. and accepted by the manufacturer and scheduled for shipment on June 16, 1942. This was cancelled by the manufacturer on April 15, 1942. on account of the WPB order L-50. Filing then was made with the Director of Priority, Washington, D.C., under applica - tion PD-200 covering this project which included the building, telephones and the switchboard. On July 27, 1942, the Director General for Opera - lions of WPB granted applicant relief for the replacement of its present magneto central office equipment with a three position common battery central office equipment (which includes switchboard, main frame, power, ringing equipment, and station equipment). However, it is necessary that applicant obtain relief under order L-41 which relief would be granted upon the approval of its application under PD-200. Applicant has received a telegram early this month from its repre - sentative in Washington, D. C. that they considered favorable action </seg>
         <seg id="p311">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 311 •would be granted in the very near future on the said application under PD-200. If and when this is granted, it would immediately place the applicant in a position where it could begin the construction of the build - ing at Ord, Nebraska, and also the manufacturer would give considera - tion to the switchboard order. \ On account of the conditions which have confronted the applicant since the proposed conversion of the Ord Exchange, it has been im - possible for it to meet the. terms of this Commission's order as to the date of its completion.

FINDING AND ORDER BY THE COMMISSION: This is a proceeding instituted by The Lincoln Telephone and Tele - graph Company, applicant herein, on the 13th day of October, 1941, to establish a revised schedule oJ basic net rates for exchange service at eighty-four (84) of its exchanges in the state of Nebraska, through the medium of grouping these exchanges according to size and type of .crvice in seven (7) groups, with varying basic net rates for each, of such exchanges falling within the respective groups, and the revision to l&gt;c effective with respect to the class and kind of service described in Exhibit £ attached to said application, and otherwise the existing and effective rates not &gt;o designated for revision, throughout the system of the applicant, to remain unchanged; and to establish an annual composite rate for depreciation expense, to be reserved against the book cost of tin- depreciable plant ot the applicant in the amount of 454%. An answer filed in said proceedings by the City of Geneva, Fillmore County. Nebraska, on the 9th day of December, 1941, in which it is alleged that said City is not informed as to the accuracy of the allega - tions of tin- application, and therefore denies the same. \'o other pleadings wrte filed prior to setting a date for public heating on said application. : On November 21. 1941, notice of public hearing on the!application was mailed postpaid by the Secretary of the Commission to the Mayors, Lity Clerks. Cliambers of Commerce or other similar clubs, of each town whose telephone rales were proposed to be revised as set forth in the application, together with a copy of the application and exhibits attached.

The total net operating income before provision for bond interest or dividends on outstanding stock is shown to be as follows: : Net Operating Income (Before Bond Interest and Dividends) y ear Amount J940 $558,904 1941 (Based on extension of 10 months experience) $570,392 5. The applicant presetted testimony summarized by Exhibits 4 and S3 reflecting the estimated increase in operating expenses which the appli - cant expects to be required to meet in the year 1942, in addition to the operating expenses in the year 1941 as projected on a ten months' basis. At the time of the filing of the application in this matter, the United Stale 9 was not at war. The original exhibit prepared prior to the declara - tion of war, in connection with these additional expenses, reflects an anticipated increase in expenses of $209,980. At the time of the hear - ings, war had been declared by the United States against Japan, Ger - many and Italy, and agencies of the federal government had taken various steps and precautions for the protection of the communications business, which has placed additional operating burdens and resulting expenses upon the applicant in the estimated amount oi $15,000, 33 set forth in Exhibit S3, making a total of $224,980 as applicant's esti - mate of additional expenses of operation in the year 1942 over the year 1941. These additional expenses will he discussed separately, as follows: (a) $52,439 of additional operating expenses (Exhibit 4) reflect an increase in wages which the employee unions have negotiated with the applicant undct date of November 6, 1941. The wage increases are to be made effective on a similar basis to the employees in the traffic and executive departments. The wage increases will result through the adoption by the applicant of Wage Progression Schedule* for the various classification of employees in the several departments. The wage increases appear to be reasonable and required to meet competi - tive labor conditions and increased costs of living, and under proposed plans are to be made effective upon the effective date of an order of this Commission prescribing increased exchange rates; no part of said wage increases includes any provision for increase in executive officers' salaries. . . </seg>
         <seg id="p315">NEBRASKA STA^E RAILWAY COMMISSION 315 The aforementioned Wage Progression Agreements will impose a further increase in wages in the year 1943 over 1942 levels in the amount of $44,864, as estimated by the applicant. This item is not here con - sidered. , ; (b) $15,000 of the estimated additional annual operating expenses (Exhibit 53) relate directly to the declaration of war and the require - .nients of further safe-guarding and protecting the communications sys - tem of the applicant, through maintenance oi additional guards, watch - men and others. Such precautions were requested o! the applicant by the National Defense Communications Board of the Federal govern - ment and by the Governor of the state of Nebraska, and such expenses further include the expense of training operators for telephone service to be installed by the applicant in connection with the construction and operation of the bomb-loading plant in the vicinity of Wahoo, Nebraska, now in process of construction. ..•¦ . . • ...¦/• ' (c) $30,000 of the additional annual operating expense (Exhibit 4) will result from increased federal taxes. While the amount is an esti - mated figure, it appears to be conservative, as the estimate was made prior to the war budget proposed by the President on January 7, 1942. (d) $5,925 of the additional annual operating expenses (Exhibit 4) will result from increased costs of materials and supplies used for main - tenance purposes only. &#132; . , ¦ (c) $33,816 of the additional operating expenses (Exhibit 4) arises from the requirement of the applicant to its annual accrual for the Employees Pension and Disability Benefit Fund of the 1 applicant, in.order to accrue a total of 5.48% annually on the payroll of the com - pany. This additional amount is required to meet current accruing lia - bilities of the Pension Plan in the opinion of George B. Buck and associ - ates, actuaries of New York, New York. The report of this firm on their study of applicant's plan for Pension Reserve Fund and the amount of necessary accruals thereto was testified to by the witness D. Me. Overholser, as associate of George B. Buck, and reflected in Exhibit 39. The foregoing increase in annual accruals for said Pension and Disabil - ity Benefit Fund does not include any provision for meeting the present unfunded liability in said Pension Fund as reflected in the report of said actuaries, due to insufficient annual accruals in past periods. . • The applicant's Pension and Disability Benefit Plan is identical with the Plan of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and Bell System companies, and according to applicant the company itself has no property rights in the Pension Reserve Fund, legal title to which is in the Bankers Trust Company'of New York as Trustee, and the trust is for the sole benefit of the employees who qualify under the plan. ¦¦ A similar plan was fully discussed and approved in State v. Tri-State </seg>

The total estimated additional annual operating expenses of the applicant, in excess of those experienced in the year 1941, not including any additional provision {or depreciation accrual, will be approximately $137,180. The applicant contends that in addition to the foregoing expenses it requires an additional sum of $87,800 to be reserved annually for depreciation expense, over that reserved in 1941, based on a rate of 4'A eA on its depreciable plant and equipment. This item will be- given fur - ther study as hereinafter provided. 6. The proposed schedule of rates for exchange service, affecting eighty - lour (84) ol its exchanges, will result in increased annual gross revenues from exchange service in the aggregate amount of $212,146.20, assuming lhat the subscriber stations in service as ot December 31, 1940 remain in service, and in the same grade of service. This amount includes the; revenue from the 15c surcharge for handset telephones. The trend of subscriber station revenue has declined in the last several months and with the revision of rates as proposed it may be expected that the appli - cant will suffer some further loss of stations. 7. The Commission has for sometime considered ordering applicant to show cause why the collection of the 15c surcharge for handset tele- I hones should not be discontinued over its entire system. This was met with considerable resistance on tl&gt;e part of the applicant. Figures sub - mitted to the Commission by applicant reveal that as of November 30, 1941 there were 27.330 handsets in services. On the basts of 15c per month this resulted in an annual revenue of $49,194. Similar surchargel! have been ordered discontinued in numerous other states and also in our own state, and there appears no good and sufficient reason why said hand set telephone charge's should not be discontinued by applicant. 8. The evidence adduced shows that the anticipated net income of the applicant under the proposed rates, not including the revenue de - rived from the 15c surcharge for handsets, and without allowing for any loss of stations, would not exceed the following percentages on the fol - lowing basis: (a) Percentage return on present fair value of applicant's telephone </seg>

However, at the hearing it was asserted by President Woods that the applicant felt that no matter what basis was adopted, whether the basis of appraisal, on the theory of reproduction cost new less depreciation, or the ascertainment of historical cost the result would \ be that applicant would not receive an unfair or unreasonable return under the proposed rates. : ¦¦'.

The welfare of the State requires that rates for telephone service be so fixed as to encourage the development of the ¦. telephone field to the smallest village and community. From the stand - point oC the applicant it is necessary that rates be sufficient in the aggre - gate to cover the over-all system-wide cost of the service, including a /air return, and from the standpoint of the public it is necessary that the rates be no more than the service is reasonably worth. These con - siderations according to the applicant make desirable the establishment of system-wide rates as a whole divided into proper exchange group - ings as the basis for rate making purposes. Such procedure is common practice in many states and is not new in Nebraska. 10. The existing rate structure of the applicant, as it relates to exchange service at the eighty-four (84) exchanges whereat rates are proposed to he revised, contains many disparities in rates for comparable service as between similar communities. AfteT a study of various rate combina - tions and comparisons with rates prescribed for similar exchanges, the Commission is ol the opinion that the rates hereinafter set forth ap - pear to be fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory and should become effective and remain in effect during further investigation and until the further order of the Commission.

The Commission deems it in the public interest, in the proper maintenance and operat'on of the applicant's communication system, that the rate schedule hereinafter set forth be immediately established on a temporary basis for a period of six months; that the ISc surcharge for handset tele - phones be discontinued: that the Commission and its staff continue its investigation of a reasonable rate of return.

(Signed) Richard H.

The monthly report of June 30, 1942 shows a total plant investment of $13,451,239. less the depreciation reserve', excluding therefrom the amount derived from sur - plus $2,836,844, there remains $10,614,395. The materials and supplies averaged on a six months' basis are in the amount of $354,756. By reason of the fact that the cash, averaged on a six months' basis, ex - ceeded the amount of $441,332 contended for by the company witnesses at the hearing, that amount will be used in arriving at the total invest - ment of $11,410,483. From the operating and income statement, for the five months' periods ending June 30, 1941 and 1942, we find that the net operating income (or the 1941 period was $254,514 and for the 1942 period it was $225,090, a decrease of $29,424. As to the 1942 monthly reports, ending with June 30, the reports indicate that there are included in the revenues since January 1, $47,520 of non-recurring revenues realized during the construction of the Nebraska Ordnance Plant and the Lincoln Air Base. The principal amount of this revenue was derived from contractors with some additional revenues received from army officials for temporary </seg>
         <seg id="p323">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 323 services during the construction period.' The total- operating revenues as reported for the first six months of 1942 are $1,469,823. Deducting therefrom the non-recurring revenues of $47,520 there remains $1,422,303. The full force of the increase in wages of employees is not apparent in the reports for the first six months of 1942, as the next advances under the Wage Progression Schedules do not become effective until August 1942. Since the compilation and submission of these reports, the revision of the Internal Revenue Code shows that the operating taxes of $208,384 should be increased by $7,807 to a total of $216,191. In carrying on its activities at the Nebraska Ordnance Plant and the Lincoln Air Base, the company has used its regular maintenance and' construction crews from throughout the system, thus eliminating the necessity of employing a great deal of extra help. : The total operating expenses for the first six months of 1942 are reported as $1,000,712. Adding to this the operating taxes of $216,191 as above set forth, results in a total of $1,216,903. Deducting this amount from the operating revenues of $1,422,303, there remains the net oper - ating income of $205,400. Extended for a twelve months', period, the total would be $410,800, which amount is 3.6% on the total investment of $11,410,483. In the previous findings herein, the net operating income (before bond interest and dividends) for the year 1941, based on extension bi ten months' experience, was estimated as $570,392. Actually there was only $546,479, a decrease'of $23,913. Since the order herein entered on the 15th day of January, 1942, the conditions have been abnormal, irregular and uncertain, and even though the results of operation under the rates granted are reflectd by the reports at hand, they clearly do not afford a fair or reasonable criterion or measure for fixing permanent rates at the present time. Under the prevailing facts and circumstances, the Commission is of the opinion and finds, that the rates hetein granted by order entered on,' the 15th day of January &lt; 1942, should be continued in full force and ef - fect until March Ist, 1943, unless otherwise ordered by the Commission. .¦¦¦¦¦'• ¦¦ ¦ ;;i '"ORDER.'.."

McCook Ditch Company for an order) APPLICATION NO, 15132 validating the issuance of stock. ) OPINION AND FINDINGS DV THE COMMISSION: Pursuant to notice, this matter came on to be heard in the Com - mission's offices at Lincoln, Nebraska, on April 13, 1942. The McCook Ditch Company was organized on the. 27th day of \l ri), 1936, under the laws of the State oi Nebraska, for the purpose of operating an irrigation project known as "The Meeker Ditch" in Hitch - cock and Red Willow Counties, and which at one time was owned by the McCook Irrigation and Water Power Company, On the 28th day of April, 1936, applicant entered into an agreement with VV. H. Ferguson, who was then the owner of the real estate and other property of said irrigation project, to exchange said property for 100 shares of stock, which is now held by the following: W. H. Ferguson, 1 share, Robert L. Ferguson, 1 share, Hoyt R. Hawke, 1 share, Fergu - &gt;«n and Company, 97 shares. •'.'"., No other stock has ever been issued by the applicant corporation and the 100 shares of the par value of $100 each, a total of $10,000, is the only issued and outstanding capital stock of the applicant corporation. * ¦ The applicant, in the transaction of April, 1936, was not aware of the terms of Section 75-1201, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1929, dele - gating jurisdiction to this Commission over security issues of common carrier companies, and the failure to comply with said statute was inad - vertent and not willful or intentional. ¦ : . The record shows that the property conveyed to the applicant was originally valued at $50,000 and that on and since the date the same was transferred to the applicant, it has been of the value oi not less than $10,000, the amount of the par value of the stock issued jn payment for it. ' A witness for the applicant estimated the reproduction cost new »&gt;f rhc property at $49,300.00, less depreciation $40,000. The property was originally entered to applicant's records at $15,000, and was offset by 100 share's of stock in the amount of $10,000, and $5,000 paid in surplus. Since 1917 a substantial part of these properties have been rebuilt and improved and considerable money expended for maintenance thereof.. At the time W. H.

The applicant is not so much concerned in obtaining a return on its investment in the irrigation project, as it is to obtain water for irrigation purposes, the Ferguson interests owning. 720 acres of the 2240 irrigable acres in the district. By recent order of this Commission, the applicant was permitted to readjust its rates, and by reason thereof it may be anticipated that ¦"fu - ture receipts will be greater than in the past. By reason of different methods to be adopted, the. operation expenses should be reduced. It is apparent.that on basis of past operating experience, a reasonable return on the capital stock is not assured. : However, the applicant does not propose to transfer or sell any of the outstanding' stock to the public, and concurs to.'terms prohibiting fu - ture transfer or said of thfc stock/without express order of this Com - mission. ¦¦ ;¦' -•' ';;¦/. ¦¦;¦¦:¦ •-.-.

OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: Union Transfer Company is incorporated under the laws of the state of Nebraska, with an original authorized capital of ; $100,000. By amendment to its articles of incorporation, the' authorized capital is now $150,000. Applicant was organized for purposes of transferring mer - chandise of all kinds, including live stock; the storage of merchandise including household goods; the buying and selling of trucks and other motor vehicles and to carry on and conduct any and all business incidental to or which may aid in the conduct and transaction of sa d business as may be deemed necessary. ; This application is to comply with the laws of the state of Nebraska, and applicant requests the validation of the original issuance of its Common Stock in the amount of $100,000.00, that has heretofore been issued without Commission authority. Prior to the enactment of the Nebraska Motor Carriers Act of 1937, this Commission exercised no jurisdiction over common carrier motor transportation companies of property, and this explains why the appli - cant herein has not previously applied for authority to issue stock. </seg>
