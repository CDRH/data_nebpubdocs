            <seg id="p030">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. Stati Department, 1904. : Pursuant to the provisioi &gt;f article 5 of the constitution, I have the honor to submit herewith the biennial report of the legal department of the state for the term ending November 30, It Appended hereto are schedules showing in detail the of the department together with such opinions rendered ite officers and county attorneys as are deemed of suffi - cient importance to be preserved for future refere 1 Referring to the case o! 'e against Paxton and ot mention of which is made in the schedule of civil cab • to call your attention to the following communication, which, upon request, I had the honor to ad' your ex - cellency some time since: ■//on. John H. M, •Sir: Referring linst Pax - ton and others, rror from A. H. I 7" //' </seg>
            <seg id="p031">XXVIII udgment rendered thereon. This judgment was taken to the lpreme court on error and reversed, the case being remanded to the Istrict court, where it was again tried to a jury and a verdict was irected by the court for the state in the sum of $642,000. This udgment was afterward reversed by the supreme court. A plea of nsanity was interposed by the defendant Mary Fitzgerald, which lea was sustained by the supreme court and the cause was dismissed s to her, and remanded to the district court for a new trial as to he other defendants, except Bartley and Ed. J. Fitzgerald, who did ot prosecute error proceedings from the judgment of the district ourt. The case was again tried in the district court where a ver - ict was found by the jury in favor of the state against defend - nts Ames, Brown and McNish in the sum of $545,947.16 and in favor f the defendants, Paxton, Swobe and Taylor (the defendant Har - ood prior to this last trial, died and the court refused to order a evivor against the administrator of his estate), upon which verdict udgment was rendered. The case was again brought to the supreme mrt by the state as to the judgment releasing Paxton, Swobe and 'aylor, and by the defendants against whom judgment had been ren - ered. The case was argued to the snpreme court and both judg - ments were reversed and the cause again remanded to the dis - rict court for trial. This trial was had to a jury who returned a erdict for all of the defendants. The court overruled a motion for new trial and rendered judgment on the verdict dismissing the action of the state with judgment against it for costs of suit, which ow amounts, as I am informed, to upwards of $3,500. The state jain brought the case to the supreme court where it is now pending. The question which now presents itself is: Is it advisable on the part of the state to continue this litigation? I am firmly of the pinion that the court will reverse the judgment of the court below nd send it back to Douglas county for another trial. I am also as rmly convinced that surh a trial would result in a judgment against le state and in favor of the defendants; but even if the state lould finally recover a judgment, would it be of any virtue? The efendants are all comparatively old men and while they qualified n the bond of Bartley for a goodly sum, they are all at the present me insolvent, one oi the defendants, Taylor having been declared a bankrupt by the United States district court, while the others are ndoubtedly subject to bankruptcy proceedings. Soon after the com - mencement of the action Mr. Smyth, former attorney general, had search of real estate records made for transfers of property of the de - endant Paxton and to learn what property he was then possessed of, hich Search showed practically no property the record title of which as in said Paxton. I have since made investigation for the same urpose and am fully convinced that even though the state had judg - ment, not a dollar could be collected on execution from any of the efendants now remaining in the case, while the state will eventu - lly have its costs to pay; for even though the state on a creditor's &gt;ill were able to show that property of the defendants had been raudulently transferred to avoid the claim of the state, still under he holding of the supreme court the statute of limitations could be uccessfully pleaded. "If the state were a private individual and my client, I would deem It my duty as an attorney to advise the dismissal of the action on the best terms obtainable; and, believing as I do, that it is my duty as the law officer of the state to look after the Interests of the state as carefully at least as I would that of a private client my judgment that this case should be dismissed and thus stop the </seg>
            <seg id="p032">XXIX increasing bill of costs which the state will eventually have to pay. "I, therefore, respectfully advise that this case, which was com- menced under the instruction of the governor, be now dismissed on the best terms that can be arranged with the defendants. 'Respectfully your obedient servant, W. N. PBODT, Attorney General. I am still of the opinion above expressed and would respect - fully recommend the dismissal of said action, upon the pay - ment of costs bv the defendants. The passage of the new revenue law has caused considerable additional work for this department in the way of interpreting the law for county attorneys. In addition to the case of Howe against Hacker and others, an injunction case brought by plaintiff to restrain the county clerk of Nemaha county from extending a per cent, increase made by the state board of equalization and assessment, and which is treated in the sched - ule of cases, this department learned that the authorities of Gage county were ignoring the order of the state board raising the assessment of that county 5 per cent, and were extending such increase to apply to state taxes only. la view of this fact I made demand on the county clerk to extend the increase over all of the taxable property of the county and for all pur - poses as the law directs. The clerk promised to comply with this demand, when an injunction was issued out of the district court temporarily restraining such extension. Temporary in - junction was also issued in Richardson county for the same purpose. Both of these cases were afterward dismissed, fol - lowing the ruling of the court in the Howe-Hacker Case. In this connection I desire to call attention to what appears to me to be a serious defect in the revenue law. The law pro - vides that '-ou the last day of sitting as a board of equaliza - tion the county board shall levy the necessary taxes for the current year including all county, township, city, school dis - trict and other taxes required by law to be certified to the county clerk and levied by the county board." (Cobbey's Annotated Statutes, sec. 10535.) By section 10524 the county assessor is required immediately after the adjournment of the board of equalization, to prepare and transmit to the state board an abstract of the assessment rolls of the county. Sec - tion 10529 requires the state board to equalize the assessment between the several counties so that each shall bear its just proportion of the burden of the support of the government </seg>
            <seg id="p033">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GEKI XXX nd in accomplishing this purpose ma or lower tin atiuii of the several counties. When completed, certificates f their action must be certified to the several county clerks; nd by section 10531 it is provided that n&lt; ent shall te deemed final until the action of the state board shall have had and certified to county clerks and by them extended n the tax 10II, and tl at so made and corrected by ate board is the final . ent of property for that ■ear. Thus it will be seen that the county board must make 8 levy before the completion of the lent and before it known how much money a given per cent, of levy will aise; and upon the completion of the i nt, it may be ound that the levy will raise too much or too little, according a the state board may have increased or decreased the ;i ment. II would respectfully suggest, therefore, that you call th&lt; ntion of the legislature to this matter and recommend e law be so amended that county boards of equalization shall adjourn, after they have completed the work of equalization, until such time as the state board shall have certified the final intent of the counties, when such county board shall re - assemble and make the levies now provided for by section 1053.).

Such deputy should be a lawyer ability and of not less than seven year's experience, and ould be paid a salary commensurate with the labor he would ive to perform and the responsibility he would assume. This an would result not only in bringing wider experience and eater ability to the aid of the state, but it would also insure uniformity of prosecution throughout the several counties, nder the present system the enforcement of law is much more ijid and vigorous in some communities than in others. The iminal statute should be enforced faithfully and with equal gor in all communities. With the law enforcement officers ider the formal direction and control of a single head, it is parent that prosecutions would be more effective and more liforin and less influenced by local sentiment and prejudice, would respectfully recommend that such amendment be made existing laws as to carry into effect these suggestions. In laying aside the duties and responsibilities of this depart - ment, which were first entrusted to me by the electors of the state four years ago, and again two years ago, I do so with no feeling of regret. I have done my duty to the best of my ability. Whether it has been well done or ill, the record left must speak. Whatever of good there is in that record, the credit thereof is to be equally shared by my able corps of as - sistants, one of whom has been chosen b,y the people to succeed me. In this selection the people of the state have made no mistake, and in turning over the affairs of the legal depart - ment of the state to my present deputy, Hon. Norris Brown, I do so with the full assurance that every interest of the state will be carefully guarded and fully protected. In closing this report I desire to express my high apprecia - tion of the nniform courtesy with which I have been treated by the department of the chief executive and to express the hope and belief that your coming term of office will be as suc - cessful and satisfactory to the people as has been the term just closing.

In s criminal prosecution imprisonment for non-payment of costs is a means for collecting them, hut is no part of tbe punishment for tbe offense committed. The governor's unconditional pardon of a convict does not release the costs nor destroy tbe means for collecting them. I&gt;kar Sik: I am in receipt of your favor of recent da: which job state that two parties who were convicted in county of crime and sentenced to ;i term in the county jail, and to pay a fine and stand committed until fine and paid, have since by the governor beeu granted an uncon - ditional pardon. You ask whether or not such pardon re - leases the defendants from the costs of prosecution. In reply I beg to state tbe general rule is that a pardon applies only to the penalty which attaches to tbe crime of which the person is convicted, and does not discbarge the con - vict from paying the costs of prosecution, such costs being I of court officers and witnesses imposed on him as an incident to tbe sentence. Indeed, the proposition that a general par - don granted by the governor cannot release the convicted per - son from the costs adjudged against him, is sustained bv an almost unbroken line of authorities.

In reply to your inquiry my opin as follows: I The power of 01.' to amend a bit' originating in ler is granted in express terms by the constitution, iguage of that instrument is that "all bills passed by may be amended by the other." (Constitution, an j. 9.) It is perfectly clear that if one house cannot am 3 title of a bill originating in the other house, there is a litation upon the power of the senate to amend the title of a use roll, because a proper amendment by one bodv might t be proper under the title adopted by the body in which 1 originated. This right of one house to amend a bill opted by the other, necessarily includes the power to enlarge e title so as to make it cover the amendment. Thisconclu - &gt;n is strengthened by a recent decision of the supreme court which it was said: "The title of ao act Is an essential part of it. "(*'.-'. t. tfuriiny - ton A M. R.

The supreme court's recent ruling that "the title of an act is an essential part of it," appears to be at variance with the earlier intimation in Ba 11 Neb.

The provisions of the act, therefore, authorize the organization of companies to transact business "em t fie plan of mutual insurance" and "to become surety on bonds and obligation:- I You ex press a doubt, however, that this power of mutual com inies extends to suretyship on bonds and obligations, i ich companies are authorized to take premium notes which •e limited by section S to payment of "losses by fire or inland ivigation." The language of the statute is that "each of lid notes shall be payable, in whole or in part, at any time hen the directors shall deem the same requisite for the par - ent of losses by tire or inland navigation."

The statute does not contemplate that the person or state to whom in runs, when other than obligee, insured or guar - anty, shall become a member of the company. Section 17 of - that every person effecting insurance in any mutual company shall become a member of the company, but ■« is no intimation in the statute that beneficiaries not effecting insurance shall become members.

You ask whether the board in acting on the petition has power to investigate and decide whether the eighty ;. for the purpose of incorporation, maj be considered a part o the village; or whether the boundary as described in the po tition corresponds to the actual limits of the "village," as tha word is used in the statute authorizing the incorporation o villaj.' I The statute authorizes the incorporation of "any town o lage. " If the "village" does not contain two hundre&lt; udents, there is no authority for incorporating it. Th preme court lias passed upon the meaning of the word • as used in this statute, and has held that it is ther iployed in itn popular sense. The lan^r at it "applies to vili the on; -ense the term, and was not intended to clothe large rurai tended municipal powers, or snbj&lt; ■ecial taxation for purposes to which they art wise lapted." 14 Neb. the rule was stated as foll&lt; "The law authorizing the incorporation &lt;f villages does n&gt; template iDc'uding in tbe corporate liu.lts remote territory or purely agdcultural lands not actually coanected witn tbe village and not adapted to municipal purposes." In the cases cited it was held that the villages which in - cluded remote territory not adapted to municipal purpotiei - not legally incorporated.

I.) If this provision is now in full force and effect, personal axes for 1903 will become delinquent December 1. It has &gt;een suggested, however, that the personal taxes for 1903 were evied under the old revenue law, according to section loo hereof, and will not become delinquent until February 1. 904. This suggestion seems to be based on the saving clause n section '2-l'2 of the new act, which is as follow ithing iii ny manner all assessed and levied und&gt; I force prior t rig- ell ' his act, nor shall I ounded thereon oi on whi&lt;- ; - in relation I ler the : It is clear to my mind that this saving clai not keep u force the old statutory enactment that unpaid taxt onaltv shall become delinquent on the first day of February of the year after the taxi's are lause ite and was never intended to serve any soefa purpose.

An examination of the Having clause will disclose that it was not intended to release taxpayers from any burden imposed by the new law, or to de lay the time for enforcing the payment of taxes. The saving clause was for the benefit of the state and persons who acquir ed vested rights under the old law. It wae the intention of the legislature in enacting the saving clause to prevent evasion of payment of taxes already levied, and it was not the intention to suspend for several months the operation of that part of the new act declaring that unpaid personal taxes shall become de linquent December 1. This is the only law in existence fixing the time of such delinquency, the similar provision in tl act having been repealed. Any other intention would be in -tent with the new act, if not absurd. No remedy for enforcing payment of taxes exists except that contained in the new law, and I can see no sense or reason in the assertion that part of the repealed revenue law is kept in force for the sole purpose of defeating for a time the enforcement of the new provision that personal taxes shall become delinquent I&gt; As already intimated there is another reason wh □ 150 of the new statute goes into effect before February 1, l'JU.i. and that is, the statute says so.

In reply I beg say that the duty of collecting the funds arising from the le of school lands of the state is imposed upon county treas - ers by section 5, chapter 80, Compiled Statutes. The au - ority of a county treasurer to retain for his services one per nt. of the money arising from the sale of school lands is de - red from the following provisions of statute: •Kick county treasurer shall receive J or his services the following fees: Oo all moneys collected by nim, and on poll tax and road re - ccpts received by nim in lieu of cash, for eacb fiscal year, under 10,000, (en per cent; for all sums over $6,000, and under $10,000 four percent.; on all sums over &lt;10,000, two percent. On all gums collected percentage shall be allowed but once, and in com - puting tbe amount collected for the purpose of cbarglrjg percent - age, all turns, from whatever fund derived, shall be included tot: except the school fuod. The treasurer shall be paid in the same pro rata from the respective funds of the state collected by him, whether tbe same be In money or state warrants. All fees on C"i - lectlotis of county funds shall be deducted fiom tbe county Rflaeni fund. On school moneys by him collected he shall receive a commis - sion »f but one per cent." (Compiled Statutes, cb. 28. sec. 20. ) I By this enactment I understand the legislature intended to low a county treasurer to retain for his services one per cent, i money collected from the purchasers of school lauds. If is is not the correct interpretation of the statute quoted, no •ovision is made for paying the county treasurers for collect - g money arising from the sale of school lands. I know of i other statute authorizing payment for such services and the gislature has not appropiiated money out of the general fund the state for that purpose. The legislature having by atute authorized county treasurers to retain for their ser\ ie per cent, of the money aiising from the sale of school nds, had the legislature power to enact such a law? The w makers had such power unless some provision of the con - itution deprived them of it. The constitution contains the llowing provisions in relation to the permanent school fund: "Tbe following are hereby declared to be perpetual funds for com- </seg>

(Constitution, art. 8, sec. 3.) "All funds belonging to tbe state for educational purposes, tbe interest and income whereof only are to be used, shall be deemed trust funds held by tbe state, and tbe state shall supply all losses tbereof, that may in any manner accrue so that tbe same sball re - malo forever inviolate and undiminisbed." (Constitution art. 8, sec. 9.) By section 1, article 8 of the constitution, management of t educational lands is committed to the board of educational ds and funds, ' I do not find any enactment of the legislature or provision of the constitution which says that the expenses of managing the school lands and collecting the funds arising therefrom shall be paid ont of the general funds of the state. Section 9, ar - ticle 8, of the constitution declares that the permanent school funds are trust funds. The general rule is that trust funds mnst bear the burden and expenses of the management there - of. Since neither the constitution nor statutes require the state, ont of its general fund, to bear the burden of collecting the purchase money arising from the sale of school land, and since the legislature has allowed the county treasurers one per cent, of such funds for their services, I am of the opinion that the expenses of collecting such permanent school funds may be taken oat of the funds themselves.

You inform me that under these acts the state leased a rge amount of school land for a period of twenty-five years, e rental being eight per cent, upon the appraised value of e land demised. The leases contained this provision: f whom shall be appointed by the county clerk. and the third by the other two. and that the valuation made by such api -hall (provided it l)e not less than the former api asis for the rental for the iva succeeding the ne : Januan IThie provision was part of the act of 1877, was included in e amendment thereof ii ind was therefore properly serted in the leases issued under both statutes.

The state, therefore, in such instances, is only receiving the rental ! on the appraised value more than twenty years ago, though the lands have increased in value in the meantime. Where hool land thus leased has never been reappraised, can an appraisement be made at any time, without regard to whether the date thereof is five, ten, fifteen, twenty, or twenty-rive vears from the date of the lea The acts of 1877 and 1879 have been repealed and a differ ent method of appraisement substituted, but the method con - tained in the leases executed under those statutes wa - affected by the repeal thereof. {State v. McPeak, 31 Neb. 140.) The terms of the contracts were not altered by the sub - sequent legislation, and the answer to your question m based on the lease itself and the laws in force when the lease was executed. The lease is imperative on the subject of appraisement. The language the expiration of five years from the date of K lease, and every five years thereafter, the la istd." If the officers representing the state and the to obey the mandate of the law and neglect to app&gt; the land at the end of five years, can th&lt; say that neglect of duty and violation of the terms of the at shall be extended over a period of five years more, and that in the meantime the state is powerless to act! 1 What if pose of the requirement that there shall be an appraisement at the end of five years? It was to secure to the state a rental which would increase in proportion to the increase in the value of the land. Of this provision Jndge Maxwell said: t'lt was assumed apparently, that the rental value w uld continue Increase, hence tbe lanis must be reappraised ever; five years." ate r. M,Pmk, 3; Neb. 143.) This was the intention of the legislature and the agreement </seg>
            <seg id="p249">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 168 of the parties to the lease. The state having failed to enforce this agreement at the exact time specified in the lease, can lessee by resisting an appraisement at a later date defeat for fire years more the purpose of his own bargain and deprive the state of an increased rental demanded by the contract and statute* I do not think the lease conferred any such power upon lessee. The duty of appointing appraisers was by the contract and lease imposed jointly upon the county clerk and lessee. The contract says "the land shall be appraised by three persons, one of whom shall be appointed by tk clerk, one by lessee, and the third by the other two." Under the contract therefore the responsibility and duty of appointing appraisors is equally divided between an officer representing the state and lessee, and it does not seem reasonable or just to permit lessee to evade his part of this duty at the eud of five years, and thus prevent performance thereof for five years All leases of school land are made with reference to the upervisory power conferred by the constitution upon the board '. educational lands and funds. % 'It is the duty of the board,' 1 ays the supreme court, "to sell or lease the educational lands : the state for the highest price possible to be obtained, and • y all konoi funds for the The board of educa - onal lands and funds is a trustee for the sale and leasing of le land set apart for the support of educational institutions." Stat- 7, 18 Neb. 600.) This trust relation is created &gt;y the constitution, and the duties of the board are derived rora the same source. It follows that all statutes and con - acts must be construed with reference to such duties and net relation. All persons contracting for school-land leases re bound to know the constitutional provisions and abide by lem. It is not consistent with the requirements of the con - titution and the duties of the board of educational lands and unds to hold that a failure to make an appraisement at the. xpiration of five years as required by a lease, prevents the </seg>
            <seg id="p250">169 performance of that duty at a later date. The first appraise - ment under the lease has never been made, and I know of no reason why it may not be made at any time. Failure to make the first appraisement at the time designated by statute and lease does not prevent the legal performance of that duty at a later date. Courts frequently coerce the performance of official duties after the statutory time for performance thereof has elapsed. (8t 46 Neb. 674; Cat-rot/" ■I, 16 W. Va. 527.) Since the board of educational lands and funds failed to require an appraisement at the expiration of five years from the date of the lease, it may now insist on the performance of that duty. In the case of 31 Neb. 141, the court said "there has been no appraisement at the end of the first five yea if provided by above, and the state authorities refuse to permit the appraisers to be chosen as prescribed in the lease and statute above set forth,' and mandamused ihe county clerk to proceed with the ap praisement in 1891, which did not end a five-year period from the date of the lease. II am therefore of the opinion that in cases where there has en no appraisement under the acts of 1877 and 1879 at the piration of five years from the date of the leaee, the board 01 ucational lands and funds may now insist on the perform ce of that duty, without waiting for a five-year period to Very respectfully, F.

            <seg id="p252">171 1. Must the report of the drainage board be affirmed by the county board? The drainage act was passed in Com - piled Statutes, ch. 89, art. 8. | The county commissioners are drainage supervisors, (sec. 3. | When the county board re - i a proper petition, a drainage board is appointed coi ing of one member of the county board, selected by that body, one person selected by petitioners, and a third person selected by the two already chosen, (sec. H.) The statute seems to au - thorize this drainage board to locate the ditch, obtain right oi way, assess damages and assess the property benefited with the cost of construction, (sees. 7-15.) The duties of the county board are imposed by statute. The county board has only such powers as are conferred by statute or necessarily im - plied therefrom. I do not observe in the drainage act any provision, expressed or implied, requiring the county board to formally affirm the report of the drainage board, and I con - clude, therefore, that a formal order of affirmance is unnec - essary, where no part of the proceedings of the drainage board has been questioned or assailed by appeal to the county board as authorized by sections 11 and 12 of the act. Where the county board doubts the advisability of the drain, is it its duty to place the draiaage boaid's assessment upon the tax books of the county?

If the t-. unity board authorized the appointment of a drainage board, and permitted it to locate a ditch and to employ men to construct the same, I know of no reason why the claims of laborers should not be audited, there having been no appeal on the part of the property owners who must bear the burden. 4. Has the drainage board the legal right to employ con. rat-tors to construct a drain before the funds for the construe - on thereof have been raised? Under the drainage act the ands benefited by the improvement must bear the burden lereof. The drainage board is authorized to assess against uch land the expense of constructing the ditch, and the coun - y board is empowered to place the assessment on the tax KK)ks. Taxes levied by counties, by municipalities, or by school istricts constitute a fund on the faith of which debts may be ncurred. (Zim?, v. State, 60 Neb. 633; Staf - 3 Neb. 35.) After a ditch has been located in the manner &gt;rescribed by statute and taxes legally levied for the purpose f making the improvement, the work may proceed without waiting until the taxes are actually collected. 5. Is the county treasurer the custodian of the drainage und? I think this question should be answered in the am'rma - ive. Section 14 of the act says that "any person may pay iis assessment to the county treasurer, if he so desires, before &gt;eing placed on the tax books." Section 17 authorizes the reasurer to accept as payment on an assessment receipts for he value of work performed. Has the drainage board authority to construct a drain within a public highway? Improvement of highways seems o have been within the contemplation of the legislature when he statute was passed. Section 11 of the act provides that if mblic highways are benefited the amount of the benefit may &gt;e presented to the town board or county board.

The proposition to issue bonds to fund the floating indebtedness was an original one. and the people had never before voted thereon. The floating debt and the unpaid bonds being included in a single proposition to issue bonds to tbe extent of $'20,000, the question was submitted to the voters under authority conferred upon the county board by section 132, article 1, chapter 18, Compiled Statutes. This statute empowers the county board of any county "to issue coupon bonds of any denomination, as they may deem !&gt;■ sufficient to pay tbe outstanding and unpaid bone s, warrants, and indebtedness of such county."

If the c nint y HssesBir In person should assess all assessable prop - ty in the county would be be entitled to compensation in addl - on to blssalarj? 1. The apparent import of the new revenue law is that the county; shall be the head and supervisory officer and that the field work shall be done by deputy assessors. Under section 113 of the revenue law (Compiled Statutes, ch. 77, art. the county assessor must supervise and direct the assess - ment of all property in his county; advise and instruct deputy assessors; require deputy assessors to make assessments uni - form; alter or change assessments so that they shall comply with the law; furnish deputies with blanks and schedules; examine and correct assessment rolls, lists, schedules and re - turns of deputies; examine county records for mortgages and other liens and see that they are properly listed, and examine the county judge's records for the purpose of assessing the property of estates, of minors and of insane persons. This special and supervisory work assigned by statute to the assess - or indicates that the field work is to be performed by deputy and revised by the assessor. If the assessor listed the proper - ty in the first instance he would be required to re-examine and revise his own work, and such a course does not seem to be in harmony with the language of the statute.

He is required by the revenue law to list his own propeity for taxation, and the banker is not obliged to disclose to the assessor the name of the depositor or the amount of the deposit, unless, as already stated, the banker is an agent, trustee or guardian of the depositor. The confiden - tial relation existing between depositor and banker should not be violated' by the banker unless he is required to do so by a valid statute or an order of a court. I am of the opinion that the new revenue law does not provide for the violation of such a relation by compelling bankers to divulge to taxing officers the names and balances of depositors. article 1, chapter 77, Compiled.

This statute requires physicians to report the 'acts, and the legislature in enacting it did not concern itself with making provision for the postage. If the state can require a physiciat. to abandon his practice long enough to report a case of -mall pox, it can certainly require him to pay pottage on the report to the state board of health. The value of postage would be insignificant when compared with the value ofti ;re&lt; by a busy physician iv making a report. The legislature in enacting the statute assumed that the state had power to exac from a pin- • much of his ti as may be ossary t. istenee of certain conta. in fectioue diseases.

The duties of a sheriff are not inconsis - tent with the duties of a special deputy appointed by a count \ treasurer to excute a distress warrant. In fact the nature of the official act of excuting such a writ is in harmony with the ordinary duties of a sheriff and the offices are compatible, uu less some provision of statute declares otherwise.

It will also be observed that in the language quoted the legislature did not use the word "game" but made it unlawful to sell "prairie-chickens" and "quail" during the close season. The legislature was the judge of the ueaus of protecting game from the depredations of private individuals and must have been of the opinion that it would be difficult for a game warden to distinguish between tame game birds "held by private ownership" and wild game birds un - lawfully captured or killed. When the legislature in the inter - est of the public absolutely prohibited the sale of prairie - chickens and quail during the close season, it did not go be - yond the limits of the police power of the state.

It is true, however, that the courts have some - times discussed the right of a public officer to withdraw a re« - ignation before it has been accepted, but the rulings in such cases are conflicting. In speaking of the effect of an officer's resignation and the right to withdraw it, the supreme court of Indiana said: "A prospective resignation may, in point cf law, amount bat to a notice of intention to resign at a future day, or a prop&lt; sition to so resign; and for the reason ilia' it is not accompanied by a giving up of tbe office— possession is still retained, aod may not necessarily be surrended till tbe expiration of tbe legal term of the office, be - cause the officer may recall hit r« ty withdraw his proponi - tion to resign. He certainly can do this at any time before it it ac - cepted. (Biddlev. Willard, 101 Ind. 66.) This case is in harmony with the rulings of some other courts, among them being the supreme court of Missouri and the supreme court of the United States. -, 56 Mo. 17: Edwards v. 103 U. S. 471.) The supreme court of this state however seems to be com - mitted to a different rule. In . Mayor, 4 Neb. 260, it was held that an officer's resignation became effective without having been accepted and that therefore a written withdrawal was unavailing. When your question was first presented I was of the impression that this rule would prevent a teacher from withdrawing his written resignation after it had been duly filed with the school board; but upon further reflection I am con - vinced that the rule is not applicable to a teacher for the follow - ing reasons: It has been held by the supreme court of this Eite that a teacher is not a public officer and that the relation isting between the teacher and the school board is that of lployer and employee. In other words The relation is con - tractual, and the contract is one of employment. (&lt;S&gt; h. 49 Neb. 755.) The school board and tbe teacher are </seg>
            <seg id="p291">210 bound by their contract rather than by the rule applicable to public officers whose duties are imposed by statute . It took both parties to make the contract employing ti e teacher, and it takes both parties to legally annul it by mutual consent. If the teacher withdraws his resignation before it is accepted and insists on teaching for the remainder of the term, there car. be no mutual consent or agreement to annul the contract at a sub - sequent meeting of the school board, because at that time the teacher does not Consent; and the board being only one party to the contract cannot thus arbitrarily terminate it on the theory that the teacher i8 permanently bound by his resig - nation and not so bound by his solemn contract of employment. Why should the teacher's resignation bind him more firm - ly than his contract? The following is a recognized rule of "A. notice of an Intention not tu perform a c intiact, If not ac - cepted by tbe otber party as a present brea.-b. remains only a mat - ter of intention and may be witndrwn at any time before tbe per - formance is in fact due." (Zuck r. McClure, 98 Pa. St. 541 ton v. Morse, 52 Wis. 240. ) Of course the school board would be jubtiticd in immediately appointing a new teacher, where the former one gave notice by resignation or otherwise of his repudiation of the contract and abandonment of the school; but this action on the part of the board would be justified on the ground that the teacher had broken his contract. Where, however, the teacher does not abandon his contract, but files his resignation, and continues to teach with the intention of completing his contract in case lie is not released by the school board, I am of the opinion that he may legally withdraw his resignation before it has been acted upon by the school board. While -there are reasons for a contrary rule, I think the one stated should be adopted. It is in harmony with the wise policy which requires the enforce - ment of contracts rather than the annulmen thereof. Very respectfully, March 5, 1904. F. N. Pbout. Attorney General. </seg>

In a case recently argued before the preme court the new revenue law was assailed as being un nstitational for the reason "it requires the listing for ta.xa &gt;n of all 'credits' due to the individual taxpayer or mercan - e and other corporations or partnerships, whereas by the ovisione of section 56 of the act the stockholders of a bank e taxed only upon the value of the shares thereof, thus ting the following provision of the constitution: "The legislature shall provide such revenue as may be needful by levying a tax by valuation, so that every person and corporation shall pay a tax in proportion to the value of his, her or its property and franchises." (Art. 9, sec. 1.) </seg>
            <seg id="p293">212 because it requires the listing and taxation of all credits, unissioner Duffii said in part: think, however, that the word 'credit,' as used in thi - may be fairly said to mean 'net credit. ' In section ~&gt;8 of the act the legislature speaks of the 'gross receipts' of insurance companies, and in section 77 of the gross receipts of express, telephone, and telegraph companies, and there are other indications that the legislatun the word 'gross' when intending to include the whole of any particu - lar item; and it is fair to presume that in speaking of credits, ally with the practice heretofore in vogue in this state of tax - ing only net credits, that the words 'gross credits* would have been used had it been intended by the legislature to require the taxpayer to pay on all of his credits without deducting therefrom his bona t'dness. But, even in the absence oi the language is not wanting in support of the view that the legislature, in providing for the taxation of credits, meant net credits. The constitution of Indiana authorizes the lawmaking power to 'provide by law for a uniform and equal rate of assessment and taxation, ' and that it 'shall prescribe such regulations as shall secure a just valua - tion for taxation of all property, both real and personal, excepting such only for municaipl, educational, literary, scientific, religious, or charitable purposes as may be especially exempted by law. ' The legislature of that state, in providing for the taxation of credits, provided, as did our former law, that the taxpayer might deduct from his gross credits all bona fide indebtedness due from him to r r. Sheridan (Ind. Sup.) 36 N. E. 365, 23 L. (K&gt;int was made that the act, so far as it allowed a de - debts from gross credits, was unconstitutiona 1 , in that credits were property, and the constitution required the taxation of all property. The supreme court said: 'Credits are, by the c tution, property, and as such are to be taxed. Their just vain. be ascertained by subtracting bona fide indebtedness from the gross amount of the notes, accounts, and other choses in action, and the balance is to be returned as belonging to the individual. Surely, the difference thus found is the precise amount and just value of the credits of the party in the legal and proper sense of the term. Sec - tion 1, art. 10, of the constitution, does not say the gross amount of all notes, accounts, and other choses inaction shall be taxed, and we cannot so construe it without perverting its language and obvious meaning. Consider for a moment its practical operation under such a construction.

No provision of statute authorizes them to make their compensation a part of the expenses of constructing a ditch; nor have they any statu - tory authority to take their compensation out of the ditch fund. The duties and compensation of the supervisors are regulated by statute, and authority for their official acts must be found therein. Section 22, chapter 28, Compiled Statutes, limits the compensation of a county commissioner to $3 a day and mileage to be paid out of the general county fund and further limits the annual compensation according to the population of the county. This compensation cannot be increased by resort - ing to a different fund for special services. The rule in this state is that an officer must perform every duty imposed upon him by statute for the compensation allowed by law, and if the statute provides no compensation for extra services, such services are gratuitous.

Mickey, and others, Members of the State Gentlemen: Through your secretary you have requested the opinion of this department in answer to the following question: Are greenbacks taxable! 1 Greenbacks are United States treasury notes. They are the obligations of the government and circulate as other money. They are convertible into gold coin and therefore constitute a high order of property. The new revenue law (Compiled Statutes, ch. 77) shows beyond question that it was the inten - tion of the legislature to require the taxation of this species of property. Section 4 declares that "the word 'money' includes all kinds of coin, all kinds of paper issued by or under author - ity of the United States, circulating as money, whether in pos - session or deposited in bank or elsewhere."' Section 12 pro - - that "'all property in this state not &lt;■ \empt therefrom, shall be subject to taxation." requires that every "person of full age and sound mind, being a resi - dent of this state, shall list all his moneys" for taxation.

The county of course is not le for such expenses unities made so by statute, and 1 kmw of no such statute. It was the duty of the sheriff, however, to obey the order* of the state veterinarian regardless of the question of compen - sation. This duty was imposed by statute and could not be evaded by the sheriff, even in absence of a provision for pay ing for services. The statute gives the veterinarian power to call upon the sheriff who is required to obey orders. piled Statutes, ch. 4, art. 2, sec. 13.) r'he rule in this state is that officers are required to perform the dutiec imposed by statute for the compensation allowed law, and that services are gratuitous unless compensation BuiwtU '. </seg>

Uuless the conditions described in the statute act - ually exist, the county board is- without power to make an annual contract for building bridges ( Tmllnek v. Webster 1 Neb. 218), but 8ucli conditions would be impracti - cable when applied to the rc]&gt;a!ri&gt;\g of bridges. How ca 1 it be known a year in advance what repairs may be required for a bricge? How can plans and specifications for repairing a bridge by the lineal foot be adopted a year before repairs are needed? It is apparent that there is no authority for making an annual contract for repairing bridges. This is evidently the view t ikeu by the supreme court in Clark v. Lancaster coun'y* 96 N. W. 5'.)9, wherein it was said that "it also seems plain that no authority exists for repairing by annual contract." K.

This rule, however, does not, in my judgment, apply to an merirency where a bridge requires immediate repair.

            <seg id="p335">254 in case of an emergency may be greater than the reason for ex pending only $|O(&gt; in another case of au emergency. Upon re - ceiving proper i otice that a bridge is dangerous the county board must begin to make suitable repairs thereon within twenty four hours. (I'om piled statutes, cl . 78, sec. lift.) In bucIi a case there h no time to advertise for bidt&gt;, though the necessary repairs should co*t more than $100. T e $100 limitation has no application therefore to an emergency for immediate repairs on • bridge. This is the plain import of an act passed at the last sessioi of the legislature. The act provides: "Pn vided further that if any bridg* or bridges may need imniediatt repair on account of the s me having broken down, or on ace unt of xtraordinary high water, or from fire, or other cause, an emergency shall exist, the county beard shall have the power to declare that the mnlic good requires immediate action to prevent inconvenience and amage and may proceed to buy material and hire labor and r pair y such bridg • or bridges. " (Cjmpiled Statutes, ch. Ii&lt;, s c. 85a. ) This section of the statute confers upon the county board power to repair a bridge in case of an emergency without waiting to let a contract Mid without fixing the limitation for repairs at $100. I am therefore of the opinion that when the expense of re - pairing several bridges under one contract exceeds $10«l, the county must adveitise for bids and let the contract to the low - est and bent bidder, but that this rule does not apply where an emergency fot immediate repairs exist*. 3. Your third inquiry is as follows: t'ln case of an emergency In what manner shall the county proceed repair bridges, when the expense of such repairs amounts to more ,n*100." t Since the emergency expenditure for repairing bridges witb - t advertising for bids and letting a contract is not limited to 00, section 85a, chapter 78, Compiled Statutes, provides a sthod of procedure. Under this tie board, after de - wing tbe existence of an emergency, "may proceed to buj iterials and Lire labor and repair auy such bridge or bridges." </seg>
            <seg id="p336">255 I have not considered the question as to whether this method in exclusive, but it certainly provides a speedy mam making repairs on a bridge in case of au emergency. Among other powers of the county board are the following: (l)"To make all contracts and to do all other acts in relation to ihe property and concerns of the county, necessary to the exercise of its proper powers." (Compiled Statutes, eh art 1, sei To lay out, alter, or discontinue any road running through their county (Compiled Stat - utes, ch. 18, art. 1, see. 23.) (3) "The county board has a general supervision over the public roads of the county, with power to establish and maintain them as herein provided, and to see that the laws in relation to them are carried into effect." (Compiled Statutes, ch. 78, sec. 1.) In addition to these powers and to other powers conferred in specific terms by the road law the county board has such implied powers as ait essary to carry into effect the powers granted. \Ltn&lt; County r.

At i to Meting in the year H04. an.l every four years </seg>
            <seg id="p342">261 thereafter, equalize the valuation of all property of raising the valuation of such tracts and ois as are assess?' and by lowering ihe valuation of such tracts and ra assessed too high." (Cobbey's Ann. S' 20.) It is iii my judgment the clear intent of the law that county boards shall, while sitting as a board of equalization in r (and every four years thereafter), examine Cirefally the as - sessed valuation of each tract of land in the county. If it finds one or more tracts of land valued higher than in the jntlgni&lt; of the board they should be, it is the duty of the board, un the section above quoted, to lower such assessed value to such a figure as will place it at its true value. If on the other hand it finds tracts of land or lots which are by the assessor falued too low, they should raise such assessed valuation co its ue value. The intention of the law undoubtedly is, an 1 it s) directs, that all lands and lots shall be assessed at their actual value. (Cobbey's Ann. Stats., sec. 10411.) And it is made the duty of the board of equalization to see that this provision of the law is carried out. Equalization of real estate values can only be had once in four years. It is important, therefore, that boards of equalization should do their work thoroughly. la performing this duty it is not necessary that complaint should be made to the board or that notice should be gives to owners of real estate, who will be affected by such raising or lowering of values. You are therefore advised that, in the opinion of this depart - ment, the county board sitting as a board of equalization not only has th-» power, Hnder the section of the statute referred to, but it is its duty, to raise or lower the value of snch tracts or lots of land as are assessed too high or too low, and this with - out complaint being filed or notice given.

She has no immediate heirs wh • would be ca able of taking care f f her, but the property is sufficient y aluable for others to undertake the «•&gt; n - tract i hat sh" desires to make with the county. Would it be legal for ihe county to under ake thi In reply I beg to say that it is by statute made the duty of counties to take care of the poor. For this purpose they are authorized to establish poorhoueep which are to be maintained by the county at public expense. It was never intended by the framers of the law that the county should distribute its bounty in proportion to the ability of the applicant to pay for the same, or indeed that remuneration should be in any way accepted by the connty for the benefits extended. Here it is proposed by the county to accept a deed to 160 acres of land belonging to this old lady in consideration of which the county is to assume the payment of a mortgage of $250, now a charge against the land, pay to the old lady in cash $1 per month, support her during the period of her natural life, and after death bury the body among friends in an adjoining county. It would seem that the statement of the proposition would carry with it its own answer. While the state is obliged by both the moral and the declared law to support and maintain </seg>

Since tbe Issuiug of aid bonds, new officers have been elected tor said district and are ualitted and aotlng. The new officers of tbe district are do* at - tempting to negotiate the sale of said bonds, and tbe point bas been raised by tbe prospective purchasers that tbe ntw officers •re do authority to sell and transfer tbe bonds, and tbat new bonds should be issued, signed by tbe new officers. I "I should like your opinion on tbe proposition of law as to betber tbe new officers have power to reexecute ths old bonds, ' the power to sell tbe bonds as they now stand." I Under the above statement the legality of the bonds men - ned is not questioned, the bonds having been duly author sd and issued in legal form by the proper officers at the time 2 bonds were authorized to be issued. The question then is, st, the effect of a delay in tbe sale of the bonds so executed, til a new board or set of officers succeeds the board who ecuted the bonds. This department has been unable to find y authority of law which requires or allows a re-exeeution of a bonds by the new officers. The vote of the electors at an iction held under the statute authorized the old board to ecute the bonds; and when they acted under such authoriza - n, tbe power of the officers of the district to issue bonds was haunted. Tbe rule which limits the power ol an officer to ue bonds, is well stated by Mr. Mechem, in his work on iblic Officers, at section 511, as follows: "Express grants of power to public officers are usually subjected </seg>
            <seg id="p357">276 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL to a strict Interpretation, and will be construed as coofenlug those powers onlr wbicn are expressly imposed or necessarily implied. Socb an officer, therefore, can create rlgbts agalost tbe state, or other public authority represented by him, only while bt Is keeping strictly within the limits of bis authority as so construed." I The above rule is supported by all the authorities, among lich may be cited the following: 6 31 Ind. M v. 1 ' Mass. 280; Mayor of Baltimore wKbach, 18 Md. 2h2; Clark r. It L9 la. 199; Mayor, 3 N. Y. 430. I The old board acted within the above rule and within their wer when they executed the bonds. By virtue of the same le the new officers would have no power to issue bonds or to ssue the bonds in question without a new authorization, — a w vote of the electors. t There is an absolute want of authority in the statutes to au arize a reexecntion of bond a once legally executed. The itute is also silent as to any requirement that bonds shall be Id by the individual officers executing them, or requiring th nds to be sold at any particular time. The authority or righ sell bonds is a power incident and attendant upon the powe issue them. (Griffith v. Burden, 35 la. 143; Simonton on noicipal Bonds, ch. 12.) Therefore the bonds, if legally executed in the first place remain legal and valid, and may be sold by the officers of th school district without regard to the persons who happen to be occupying the offices of such school district at the time of th transfer. The date of sale or the personnel of the officia board cannot affect the validity of the bonds once legall issued, in .the absence of a statutory provision to the contrary In this state there is no statute to the contrary. Again it is not the name of the officer, — the. person occupy - ing an office, — that gives his act foree and effect. It is rather the office, its power and function under the law, that fixes the legality of the act of the officer. The government is a con- </seg>

Section 24 of that article proviu "For tne purpose of defraying tbe expense of tbe organ Ization o tbe district, and tbe care, operation, management, repair, and mi provement of sucb portions of said canal and works as aie com pleted and in use, including salaries of office™ and employees, tbe board may either fix rates of tolls and cbarges, and collect tbe same from all persons using said canal for Irrigation and other purpose or may provide lor tbe payment of said expenditure by levy of, assessments therefor, or by both said tolls and assessments " This provision in connection with the other provisions of the act shows that an irrigation district, when organized, must bear the expense of organization, i am therefore of the opinion that a legally organized irrigation district is liable to the county for the necessary expenses incurred by the county in connection with the organization. I You also inquire whether the notice of a petition to organize district and the notice of election must be published in the icial paper of the county. No newspaper has the monopoly of publishing such notices and in my opinion tbe officer charged with the duty of mak - ing publication may insert such notice in any legal newspaper which comes within the terms of the statutes.

I observe from an examination of your papers that you have included in one proposition the question of issuing bonds to re fund a floating indebtedness of the county and also t tion of issuing bonds to take up the original bonded debt. In other words, bonds are to be issued for two purposes, viz., fo of funding the floating debt of the county and for the purpose of refunding the unpaid balance of th original bonds of the comrv. I As I understand the law the county commissioners hav thority, without a vote of the people, to issue bonds to ad the outstanding balance of the original bonded imi (Compiled Statntes, ch. 9, sees. 88-41.) As a . il rule a question should not be submitted to the voters of unty where the county board has been authorized by statut act independently of the voters. In the present instant erefore seems unnecessary to submit to the voters the q m of issuing bonds to refund the outstanding balance of th iginal bonded debt. I Another general rule is that two propositions should no: bmitted without giving the voter an opportunity to expres mself separately as to each. One of the reasons for ;ter rule is that the voter should have an opportunity to &lt; favor of or against each proposition. In the present in ince if a voter were in favor of issuing bonds to refund lance of the original bonded debt and opposed to issuin mds to pay the floating indebtedness of tbe county, he w&lt; &gt;t have an opportunity to so express himself. In the fon nich your proposition is to be submitted, a voter would be tliged to vote for or against the entire issue. 1 'jo/Mv, 34 Pac.

(Miller ». Tkompetm, 1 Bart. El. Cases, 118: Potter, 114 111. 628; Snowlxdl v. Pevph, 147 In the present instance the county board must designate the voting place. The duty to do so is imposed by statute. 8ection 60, article 1, chapter 18, Compiled Statutes, confers upon the county board jurisdiction to create and divide voting districts. In St&lt; /vinery, 20 Neb. 303, Judge "It is perhaps the duty of county boards in all cases, certainly when not under township organization, to create election districts to suit the convenience of the voters at a general election. ' ' If county boards in counties not under township organiza - tion may exercise such power, county boards in counties under township organization may do likewise, since the law confer* upon county supervisors, in absence of special provisions, the powers granted to county boards by general law. (Compiled Statutes, eh. 18, art. 4, sec. fi&amp;fc.) If power to designate the voting places is not conferred in direct terms upon the county boards, it is implied from provisions denning their duties and general powers. Section 12, chapter 26, Compiled Statutes, shows that places for voting should be designated by the county board. It requires the county clerk to give notice of the place of holding elections. He is required to do so for the reason he is clerk of the county board, and has control of the records which designate each places. It follows therefore that the electors most vote at thb place designated by the county board, and that the electors cannot fix a different place.

There is autl. r a contrary conclusion, however. The constitution of the ate of New York provides that an elector must vote "in the ection district of which he shall at the time be a resident, id not elsewhere. 1 " On this provision the court of appeals of ew York ruled: "All that the constitution requires is that the elector must vote at the polling place designated by law for casting the vote of the district where he r- id the validity of his vote is not Mfrwitwi by the circum at the place is located outside the tmundary line of the district. When he does that, he votes in the district of bis residence and not elsewhere, within the purview of the constitu - tion." (People v. Car*,*, 155 N. Y. 491.) The supreme court of this state has held that ballots oast at a polling place outside of the voting district were valid (Piettrd ,-. Bueriuff, 34 Neb. 372); and that ballots cast at a voting place on an Indian reservation should be counted. (State v. 37 Neb. 31&lt; I know of no statute which forbids the county board to locate a pulling place outside of the election district.

They cannot look beyond the returns." (Hagge v. tie, 10 Neb. 51, Stat, :56 Neb. 91; Stater. », 46 Neb. 668; J d, 63 Mich. 294; 16 Mich. 282; McCreary on Elections, 4th sec 528.) The canvassing board should therefore make due return of the facts as they appear literally from the returns of the judges and clerks of election in the several precincts of your county, giving to each candidate as named on the ballot, the number of votes certified to by said judges and clerks of election. For the board to do otherwise would be to determine judicially whether or d intended to vote for the game person, while to designate him. The canvassing board &gt;r to determine that Question. F. N.

Linderman, Esq., County Attorney of Dawson ( Dear Sib: I have received your favor asking whether county commissioners have power to refund or remit on delinquent taxes. In reply I beg to advise you that interest on deliq taxes is a penalty for failure to pay them at time required by statute. The county board has only such power as is conferred by statute. There is no statute author - izing the county board to remit penalties for failure to pay taxes. The board therefore has no such power, and in my opinion the members would be liable to the county for what - ever damage resulted from an attempt to remit interest on delinquent taxes. Very respectfully, F. N.Pbout, November 17, 1904. Attorney General. Dklihqcett Taxk9 — Publication of List — Pbintebs Fees.
