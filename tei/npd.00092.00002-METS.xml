The object is to gather together as nearly as possible all the material under subject-matter headings. This division is not based strictly on the various departments, al - though it does follow the departments fairly closely. Some work done on bind - weed eradication machinery is reported under "Agricultural but most of the work on bindweed eradication is reported under "Field Crops and A^eeds." Some overlapping is found in other places. The work of the three major substations is reported separately at the back. : The object has been to report progress briefly and to cite all publications in which more detailed information can be found. The report covers the calendar year 1940 so far as the experimental work is concerned. The financial report at the back covers the fiscal year that ended July 1,1940. ¦;•: ' \ :y^::-y:/Smk&#148; ;;¦¦ / '¦¦. ] . .:, . I Soil Erosion Control and Soil Moisture Conservation. :, . This project is designed to study methods of soil and moisture conservation in regions! of relatively.low rainfall.The work is in cooperation with the Office of Research, Soil Conservation Service, U. S. Department of Agriculture. Considerable progress has been made in using crop residues left on the surface of the soil] to protect it against excessive runoff and erosion by.wind or water, and also to reduce the rate of evaporation. ,'¦ ; .' In order to maintain these residues on the surface, it is necessary to till the soil with a machine which pulverizes the soil without turning it over or bury - ing the trash. This type of equipment is called a "subsurface tillage" machine and this process of cultivation is called "subsurface tillage." The project was extended considerably during 1940, particularly in the use of surface 'mulches in the production of row crops. Corn and sorghum were produced on land "subsurface tilled" instead of plowed. In the use of this method for row crops, combine wheat straw was left on the surface in some cases to protect the soil from erosion and.to increase its capacity to absorb water.. In other tests cornstalks cut with a stalk cutter were left on the surface to provide; this protection. ' , ' ¦. ' The planting of the corn and sorghum was done with a two-row corn planter equipped with disk furrow-openers. The cultivation of these row crops was accomplished by means of an ordinary corn cultivator on which the shovels were replaced with broad sweeps. By this means it was possible to cultivate beneath the mulch, kill weeds, and at the same time leave the residue on the surface. It has been found that handling row crops in this way permits but little surface runoff and reduces erosion to a small fraction of the amount lost from land plowed and cultivated. The yields of these crops to date have been maintained and in most tests increased over those of land farmed by ordinary methods. . .. ' : . Special attention has been given during the last year to the testing and perfection of machines with which to do subsurface tillage. Much progress has </seg>

The land was prepared with a subsurface tillage machine and the crop was cultivated with broad sweeps so that the residue remained on the surface throughout the season. Yield: 60 bushels per acre. been made and we now have several distinct types oi equipment that can be used for performing such operations. Some of these are designed as attach - ments for equipment which farmers already have. In the development of equipment several machinery companies as well as a few farmers have been active and have thus contributed much to the project. The amount of moisture stored in the soil during the summer has been much less during the relatively dry years of 1939 and 1940 than during the more normal season of 1938. However, the plots protected with straw mulch have been more effective in storing moisture during each year than has clean fallow on plowed ground. The runoff from clean-tilled land was 2.4 times as much as on land protected with two tons per acre of straw residue, and the erosion was 12.1 times as much. This would indicate that although residue on the surface is effective in the conservation of moisture, it is even more effective in the reduction of erosion. Studies of factors affecting intake of water have been continued by means of artificially sprinkled small plots. Although the results seem to bear out the idea that soil structure and texture are factors, the protection of the surface with </seg>

Plots wotected with straw mulch absorb water more rapidly than rain usually falls in Nebraska. ;:¦ ' ¦,'' ¦¦¦...- . ;. ' '. . Studies are also in progress on the rate of water losses through surface evaporation or through the growth of weeds. Weeds rapidly exhaust water from the subsoil, and subsurface tillage greatly reduces this loss. The I value of subsurface tillage with crop residues as a method of farming under different climatic conditions is being tested further by experiments con - ducted at the North Plane and Alliance substations and by the hydrologic project in Webster county.

Commercial Fertilizers FieH-plot tests of treble superphosphate on wheat, barley, and oats were conducted in 11 southeastern counties and two north-central counties in 1940, through the cooperation of county agents and farmers. More than 90 tests on wheat were harvested. In 48 per cent of the tests in the six south-eastern counties, the use of superphosphate on wheat increased the yield to a profitable extent (4 to 15 bushels per acre), : while the remaining tests showed smaller effects, 'considered to be unprofitable. In the other five counties the yields were reduced by drouth and very few tests indicated profitable increases from super - phosphate. ; . ; Increases in yield from the use of superphosphate on oats and barley were similar to those obtained on wheat, but were seldom profitable because of the lower price per bushel. .

Studies on Solubility o£.Soil Phosphorus : Soil samples were taken in the fields where phosphate tests were located, and analyzed for soluble phosphate by two methods. Neither method was sufficiently I dependable, however, to form the basis for definite recommenda - tions to farmers. The soil samples were also used for the determination of pH and degree of saturation of the base exchange complex with calcium. A rather narrow range of. these conditions was found in the upland soils; nearly all of them fell within the pH range of 55 to 63, and the percentage of calcium saturation varied from 50 to 66 per cent. No relationship was found between either of these chemical characteristics of the soil and the solubility of soil phosphate ior the increase in yield of wheat resulting from the application of superphosphate. : ' Soil Organic Matter The results of an investigation of methods for the determination of soil organic matter were presented in a paper before the Soil Science Society of </seg>

A modification of the Walkley-Black.' method, while not as accurate as the hydrogen-peroxide and wet-combustion^ methods, was found to be highly satisfactory for most purposes because of its i rapidity, low cost, and ease of manipulation. &gt;j Factors Affecting Permeability of Soils to Water !; Because of a shortage of water in the North Platte valley, it did not appear!; feasible to carry on the test comparing the yield of sugar beets cultivated with; a small subsoiler to the yield of beets cultivated and ditched by the standard' practice in this region. \ Sulfur and other treatments encourage the development of alfalfa roots in alkali clay pan soil: (1) calcium chloride 2 tons per acre, alfalfa 3 years old; (2) gypsum, 1 ton per acre, alfalfa 3 years old; (4) untreated, alfalfa 2 years old; (5) sulfur, 3 tons per acre, alfalfa 2 years old; (6) sulfur, 3 tons per acre, alfalfa 1 year old. Study of the rate of infiltration of irrigation water into the soil was con - tinued. The test this year was carried on near Alliance, where irrigation water and an uncropped area were available. Measuring boxes, set in ditches formed by a standard beet ditcher, were located at distances of 100 and 200 feet from the calibrated header box so that the flow of water past these points could be measured. The soil in the test area, Tripp very fine sandy loam, was carefully leveled and floated before the test. The data taken so far give the following general indications: (1) Time is the most important factor affecting the amount of water entering the soil. (2) Surface irregularities affect the uniformity of water distribution more with small heads of water than with large heads. (3) Slight increases in the infiltra - tion rate were noted as the rates of application were increased by small steps </seg>

(4) The initial infiltration rate is in - creased slightly by using a small subsoiler to channel the space between the rows to a depth of 6 inches. After three years of study on water infiltration in slick spots, trenches were dug through the series of 4x4-foot plots at Bridgeport and Scpttsbluff. A study was made of the root development of alfalfa growing on the variously treated plots in relation to the layers in the soil profile. Roots of alfalfa growing in the sulfur-treated plots (both 1 and 3 tons per acre) were able to penetrate the tough, cheeselike claypan and reach river sand at a depth of 3.5 feet. Roots of alfalfa growing in the plots treated with calcium chloride or gypsum were un - able to penetrate the claypan. The tap roots were pinched off at a depth o£ 7 to 11 inches and a large network o£ lateral roots developed. Only a sparse stand and meager growth were obtained in the untreated plots. The soil of the various layers and the alfalfa were sampled in each plot for laboratory studiesl i . : '¦ :¦' .. ¦- ' I '.. ' .¦' .¦'•¦•.-¦¦¦ Soil Profile.Studies ¦""¦'. . Research is in progress concerning the physical and chemical characteristics of a developmental group of locssial soils in Nebraska. Thirteen profiles were sampled, eleven of them at type locations of these series: Scott, Fillmore, Butler, Crete, (Hastings, and Holdrege. From this study it is expected that conclusions can be drawn which will be of service to those interested in the development and classification of these soils. | Field Crops and Weeds Corn Improvement '¦'.' ¦.-.,-. The performance tests of corn hybrids and varieties continued to hold the spotlight in the corn improvement program. It has been estimated by the U. S. (Department of Agriculture thai: 1,537,000 acres or 23 per cent of the Nebraska corn acreage was planted to corn hybrids in 1940. Of the 15 tests planted, three succumbed to drouth while 12 materialized. Of these, 9 were un - irrigated and 3 were irrigated. The tests included 30 to 60 entries each. Averaging the three irrigated tests of central and western Nebraska, the hybrids yielded 88.2 bushels per acre, compared with 80.5 for the opeh-polli - nated varieties. In a similar comparison of the unirrigated tests in eastern Ne - braskathej hybrids yielded 44.0 and the varieties 34.9 bushels. Seasonal adaptation proved to be a very important factor in 1940. Late tasseling, whether due to heritable lateness or to delayed planting, proved advantageous. This may be illustrated by a comparison o£ five medium-early with five late-maturing hybrids tested in Cass county in 1940 compared with 1939. [in 1939, the more representative year, the early group averaged 41.5 bushels per acre as against 37.6 for the late group, making a difference of 3.9 in favor of the early hybrids. In 1940, the early hybrids averaged 52.4 bushels compared with 57.8 for the late group, which gives a difference of 5.4 in favor of the jlate hybrids. The. results of a single year such as 1940 should be accepted with caution. ;.-..;.¦¦ , The hybrids proved superior to the open-pollinated varieties in all tests. As averages for the individual tests, the mean yields of the varieties ranged from </seg>
         <seg id="p010">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station 54 to °-5 per cent of the hybrids. The ten highest-yielding hybrids in each of the tests averaged from 5 to 17 per cent more than the average of all hybrid entries. The superiority of hybrids was first established for east-central and north - east Nebraska. Southeast-Nebraska farmers were slower in adopting hybrids because hybrids suitable for that section were not available at so early a date. Well suited productive hybrids are now available, however, for the more extreme southeastern counties as demonstrated in the Richardson county test of the last three years. As a three-year average, 1938 to 1940, the standard \.irictics have averaged only 71 per cent as much grain per acre as the mean of .ill hybrids. The large, late hybrid U. S. 13, having the pedigree (WF9 x 38-11) x ( L-317 x Hy). was released this year for certified seed production in Nebraska Vxjcause of its splendid performance in southeastern counties. With this addi - tion, there are six open-pedigree hybrids subject to official state certified seed production. The certified hybrids range in type from so-called 114-day to 124 - -day corn under average eastern-Nebraska conditions. In order of earliness of maturity, these may be listed as follows: lowa 939, Nebr. 238, Nebr. 463, N'cbr. 110. U. S. 44, and U. S. 13. As an illustration of the longtime superiority of a good hybrid, lowa 939 has averaged 20 per cent superior to the open-pollinated varieties for all tests during the last eight years. Satisfactory progress was made with corn breeding, although technical phases have been curtailed because of shortage of funds. The testing of num - erous new experimental single and double crosses in comparison with estab - lished hybrids and varieties was carried on in Cass county, where climatic conditions are less hazardous than at Lincoln. A very satisfactory comparison of various commercial size-and-shape grades of three different corn hybrids materialized in 1939. Three flat grades ranging from 15.0 to 29.1 grams per 100 seeds and four round grades ranging from 15.6 to 34.5 grams per 100 seeds, were tested for grain yield (14 per cent moisture) in well replicated plots in Burt county. There proved to be no significant yield advantage in favor of either the large or medium-large seed over the small seed, nor of the flat over the round seed. Small, medium, and large flat seed of two hybrids gave about equal field stands on any one of four planting dates as an average for 1938 and 1939, except that the stand was slightly deficient from small seed planted at an unusually early date. If planted during the normal planting season equally satisfactory stands and performance may be expected from all reasonable size-and-shape grades. Addi - tional information concerning seed grades has been summarized in the first publication listed below. Publications during 1940: "The Farm Significance of Cleaning and Grading Seed," by T. A. Kiesselbach, Nebr. Crop Growers' Assn. 32nd Ann. Rpt; Report of the Nebraska 1940 Corn Variety and Hybrid Tests, by T. A. Kiessel - bach, L. M. Camp, and D. L. Gross, Nebr. Agr. Ext. Circ.

Fairly good stands were obtained </seg>

The \yeather was mild until Christmas when a blanket of snow covered the ground before it was frozen. This snow protected the plants during January when the !weather was unusually cold. No winterkilling occurred; in fact ¦ volunteer oat and barley plants survived under the snow. Spring growth was slow :nd lack of moisture became noticeable early. Plant heights and yields were lighly variable and in spite of the five replications it was difficult, to prove differences in yield between varieties. No disease or insect pests caused serious damage although chinch bugs were present in large numbers. Nebred winter wheat at right, showing its ability to survive the winter. Early varieties again gave relatively good yields although no variety sig - nificantly outyielded Cheyenne, which produced 19.4 bushels per acre. Kaw - vale x [Tenmarq (Nebr. No. 1086, C. I. No. 11669). had the highest average at Lincoln. This variety is early, resistant to leaf rust and Hessian fly, but is in - clined to shatter and is not especially winterhardy. In cooperative tests with farmers it made a very good record and it may have promise for southeastern Nebraska where rust resistance is desired. The named varieties yielded in the following order: Blackhull, Cheyenne, Chiefkan, Turkey, Tenmarq, Kawvale, Nebred, lobred, and Kanred. For the 11-year period 1930-40, Cheyenne has . the highest average yield at Lincoln, followed by Tenmarq, Kawvale, and Nebred. For the last six years the new variety mentioned above, has had an average yield of 22.6 bushels compared with 20.3 bushels for Cheyenne. Ne - bred did not yield well at Lincoln because of dry weather, but on farms in southeastern Nebraska it produced some very good crops, and as a result there was a good demand for certified seed in the fall of 1940. The winter-wheat breeding nursery was seeded on fallow and as a result a better cropj was obtained than from the field plots. Fall growth was fairly good, no winterkilling was noted, and no rust developed. As. would be ex - pected, early, tender varieties gave the best yields. Selections of Kawvale x Tenmarq, Orox Tenmarq, Tenmarq x Cheyenne,and Early Blackhull x Ten - marq were high yielding in most tests. Hope x Cheyenne and Hope x Turkey 1069. selections performed a little better than in the previous year but it is </seg>
         <seg id="p012">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station evident that although they carry stem rust resistance they must be recrossed with Nebred and Cheyenne in order to get a desirable variety for the State. This has been done and the material is being advanced through the selection nursery. The improvement work with winter wheat and other small grains is co - operative with the Division of Cereal Crops and Diseases, U. S. Department of Agriculture. Publications during the year 1940: K. S. Quisenberry, O. J. Webster, and T. A. Kicsselbach, Varieties of Winter Wheat in Nebraska, Nebr. Agr. Exp. Sta. Bui. 326 (28 pages); K. S. Quisenberry, "What's New in Small Grain Varieties," Nebr.

Al2 (mimeo - graphed). Possibilities of Winter Wheat That Fails To Germinate in the Fall Failure of the winter wheat in about half of the seeded acreage of the state to germinate and emerge in the (all ol 1939, because of drouth, caused great anxiety for the 1940 wheat crop. It was pointed out in the Fifty-Third Annual Report of this Station, February 1, 1940, that such wheat might undergo germination in late winter followed by natural vernalization for several weeks before emergence in the spring and make a fair yield of grain. The season proved exceptionally favorable for just this condition and almost fabulous yields were reported by many growers who left such wheat for harvest. Many fields without a spear of wheat up in the fall yielded 25 or more bushels per acre and yields of 10 to 20 bushels were very common. The seed germinated during late January and February in the unfrozen and moistened soil under a deep and prolonged snow covering. The seedlings emerged during the first half of March, one to three weeks prior to the normal date for planting spring grains. The wheat stooled, jointed, headed, and matured grain where there was sufficient moisture, even though the soil was never frozen. This field experience confirms results previously reported, in which it was found unnecessary that the seed be subjected to freezing in order that jointing might ensue. As an average for 13 years, Turkey wheat seeded in the field February 13 yielded 38 per cent as much as October 1 seeding, March 6 seeding yielded 21 per cent as much, while March 25 seeding was a complete failure every year. Results were variable from year to year. In case of February 13 seeding, the annual yields varied from 11 to 98 per cent as much as October 1 seeding, while seeding on March 6 varied from 0 to 71 per cent as much. These data proved of much aid in the adjustments involved in the 1940 federal wheat insurance program. Oat Improvement In 1940 Burt 518 continued to yield in a very satisfactory manner and this new Nebraska variety was named Otoe. About 300 bushels of pure seed pro - duced in 1940 will be distributed to experienced certified seed growers for further increase in 1941. Otoe is early, has some resistance to smut and stem </seg>

It has stronger straw than Brunker and should be well adapted to eastern Nebraska. It is doubtful if it will outyield Brunker in ithe western part of the state. In |he field plot tests at Lincoln the straw was short in 1940 and yields were low as a result of the dry spring, ranging between 17 and 27 bushels per acre. The Highest-yielding varieties were Brunker, Fulton, Trojan, Tama, and Otoe. ,On a long-time average Otoe and Trojan have the highest average yields, while for the last five years Brunker ranks first. Several Victoria x Richland selections from lowa, tested for three years, have shown! some promise. These selections are resistant to both rust and smut but are possibly a little too late for Nebraska. Nursery work with bats was nearly a failure. again because of drouth. Yields, were so low that harvesting was hardly .worth while. Some valuable data were obtained in the smut and rust nurseries. . ; ' . . Publication during 1940: T. A. Kiesselbach, O. J. Webster, and K. S. Quisenberry, Varieties of Oats, Barley, and Spring Wheat in Nebraska, Nebr. ' Agr. Fjxp. Sta. Bui. 328 (28 pages). Barley Improvement The barley crop was only slightly better than in 1939, with yields ranging from 9^7 toj 23.5 bushels per acre. The highest-yielding varieties at Lincoln were Atlas x Vaughn (Moscow l),.Flynh, Club Mariout, and Beecher. Lico did not yield as well as it did in 1939, while the malting types, Wisconsin Pedigree Nos. 37 and 38, were again near the bottom of the list. Based on long-time records Flynn and Spartan are the best-yielding varieties for Lincoln, closely followed by North.Platte No. 1^ Ezohd, and Trebi. During the long succession of drouth years the yield record of Flynn has been such that this variety must be considered as a possible addition to the recommended list. Difficulty was encountered in getting uniform stands in the nursery, and before (harvest chinch bugs did some damage to late varieties. Some of the best-yielding' strains were lowa selections from Atlasx Vaughn, Spartan x Flynn, and jFlynn x Glabron. A uniform yield nursery planned by the Bureau ¦ of Plaiit Industry, U.S. Department of Agriculture, was grown at Lincoln, North fPlatte, and Alliance.

Farming-Mill Grading of Small-Grain Seed From tests with small-grain crops during the 40-year period 1900-39, the conclusion is reached that the farming-mill grading of seed does not increase its productivity under farm planting conditions. The chief value of the fanning mill lies in the removal of weed seeds, broken grain, and trash which may interfere with drilling. Extremely small seeds tend to be at a slight dis - advantage, but their percentage is so small in bin-run grain that they have a negligible effect upon the yield. Various tests may be reported as follows: (1) In a 21-year test ending in 1939, screened large Turkey winter wheat seed yielded 2 per cent more than ungraded seed. (2) In a 25-year test the heaviest one-fourth of the wheat seed surpassed the ungraded by 1 per cent. (3) As an average for 17 years rust-shriveled or immature, shrunken wheat seed yielded 2 per cent more than the ordinary seed even though its test weight was 5 pounds less. (4) During 24 years the heaviest one-fourth o£ Kherson oats seed surpassed the ungraded seed by x/i per cent. (5) Screened large oats seed yielded 3 per cent less than the ungraded seed during 12 years. </seg>

Sweet Clover The sweet clover studies at this Station are primarily comparisons of varieties and production practices, and improvement through selection and breeding. The work is cooperative with the U. S. Department of Agriculture. The twelve varieties under test included an extreme range of vegetative types, differing as to earliness of maturity, coarseness, height, and annual or biennial habit. The varieties are compared under three types of harvesting conditions: (1) hay, (2) simulated pasture by clipping with a mower several rimes during the season, and (3) actual grazing by cattle. Varietal yields of first-year growth only were obtained in 1940. The average hay yield of all varieties was 0.88 ton per acre, as compared with 0.37 ton when harvested for pasture. The pasture yields do not include the six inches of stubble left after harvest. All varieties were eaten by cattle, with preference shown for the finer - stemmed varieties M. officinalis and M. suaveolens, including common b. yellow, Madrid, and Redfield Yellow. In general the second-yeai grazing preferences corresponded with those of previous seasons. Common b. white, Madrid, and Redfield Yellow were grazed to a height of three to four inches, while large, coarse-stemmed varieties of M. alba including Spanish, lowa Late White, and Ohio Evergreen, were permitted to attain heights of 16 to 18 inches by the grazing cattle. Perhaps because of later maturity the Ohio Evergreen and lowa Late White seemed to be preferred to Spanish. The end of the grazing season varied for different varieties from July 15 to August 20. Satisfactory stands of sweet clover were established under the more favora - ble methods of planting in 1939 and 1940. In sowings with companion crops, the best stands were obtained with the use of early-maturing varieties of oats and barley, seeded at half the usual rate of two bushels per acre, and harvested tor hay. The averages of stand survival in plantings made with companion crops harvested for hay and sown at rates of 2, 1, and % bushels to the acre, were 58, 77, and 81 per cent respectively. Seeding the companion crop at less than half the usual rate resulted in greater field weediness, with no material increase in legume survival. Barley has proved a slightly better companion crop than oats, from the standpoint of legume survival. Average sweet-clover survivals with the companion crop harvested for hay and grain were 72 and 63 per cent, respectively. In sowing without a companion crop, and in plant - ings clipped for the control of weeds, the average survival of sweet clover was 72 per cent. Better stands were maintained when the plantings were clipped </seg>

         <seg id="p018">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station preparation, previous crops, and methods of seeding, including the use of mulches, are being studied. Grasses may be divided into two groups with respect to optimum time of seeding in Nebraska, i.e., the cool-season grasses and the warm-season grasses. The cool-season grasses are those which begin growth early in the spring, making their principal growth during the cool months of the growing season. The warm-season grasses begin growth later in the spring than the cool-season grasses. Growth is usually confined to the frost free period of the growing season, with maximum production during the warm months if moisture is available. The results during the past three years indicate that the cool-season grasses should be seeded in late summer or very early spring. Best results with the warm-season grasses have been obtained when they were seeded during mid-spring. Grazing studies to evaluate several of the adapted grasses and to determine the best management practices have been initiated. A study of deferred and rotation grazing of bromegrass-alfalfa pastures with sheep is being conducted. The pastures, seeded in the fall of 1938, were grazed to capacity for the first time in 1940. Total forage yields, utilization of the forage by the sheep, and sheep hours of grazing provided by the pastures are being used to determine the best management practices. A test comparing several of the native grasses and bromegrass as to palata - bility for sheep was started in 1939. Duplicate pastures planted to small plots of nine adapted grasses were first grazed during the summer months o£ 1940. The pastures are being used to study the grazing habits of the sheep, their utilization of a grass when choice is given, and the consequent productivity and longevity of the grass. The results of this study and of a similar test with cattle at the North Platte Substation are important in formulating recommenda - tions for the seeding of mixtures and for determining improved grazing prac - tices. Forage production of seven grasses was measured by mowing pure stands in their third year of establishment. Comparative yields from replicated plots were obtained by mowing once during the season as hay, at the approximate time of maximum production for each grass. On other replicated plots, com - parative yields were obtained by clipping to simulate grazing conditions. The periods of growth and the harvesting dates differed for the native and intro - duced grasses. As a result of low rainfall during May, June, and July, the native short grasses were favored in comparison with the native tall grasses. Blue grama and buffalo grass gave higher yields when mowed for hay or dipped twice as pasture than did big bluestem, side-oats grama, and switch - grass harvested on the same dates. Bromegrass and Kentucky bluegrass were harvested once for hay and four times for pasture on the same dates. Brome - grass outyielded bluegrass and the native tall grasses. Under these conditions bromegrass was exceeded in yield by blue grama and buffalo grass when cut for hay and by buffalo grass alone when clipped as pasture. The range studies of typical sandhill and "hardland" grazing areas in Cherry county were continued. The chief emphasis was placed upon deter - mining the productivity and palatability ratings of the more important forage species. Supplementary to these determinations, studies were made of plant development by growth stages, range recovery after extreme abuse, and the grazing habits of cattle.

Grain and Forage Sorghums t Thirty varieties of grain and forage sorghums were tested in comparison I with a hybrid and an open-pollinated variety of corn in the main yield test at j Lincoln, j Lack of moisture in May, June, and July along with hot winds in f July paused considerable reduction in yield of the early grain sorghums. ! Abundant rain in late July and early August, however, resulted in increased ; grain yield for the late grain and forage varieties. Yield data were also obtained from 25 [outlying tests conducted in cooperation with the Agricultural Ex - tension Service, county farm bureaus, and farmers. For the second year a comprehensive date-of-seeding experiment was con - ducted. The four varieties, Sooner, Highland, Kalo, and Atlas, were planted 1 at lOJday intervals beginning April 15 and ending July 14. Average yields increased'gradually to the June 4 date. With later planting chinch-bug in - festation and damage increased rapidly and yields dropped in proportion to the increase of that damage. Chinch-bug-susceptible varieties were badly in - juredj even before the June 4 date. It.is recommended that, such varieties be planted by May 25 in areas where chinch bugs are likely to be numerous. The data of previous years have indicated that considerable stand variation does not greatly affect grain yield. This year no appreciable difference in yield (existed between the different spacings of Sooner. The average yields for spacihgs of 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, and 24 inches were 13.7, 115, 12.6, 12.8, 13.1, 13.4, 'and 13.4 bushels per acre, respectively. Forage yields of Atlas also show no appreciable differences between spacings. One hundred eighty-four introduced varieties and strains were grown in nursery rows for observation. Several of these will be included in the yield test next year. Thirty-two varieties from farmers and county agricultural agenrs.werc grown for observation and identification. In the breeding program, a large number of head selections were made from second-generation hybrid plants. These will be continued in the third genera - tion in 1941. Sixty head selections from the fourth and 160 from the sixth generation will also be advanced next year. A varietal purification nursery included i selections of Early Kalo, Day, Sooner, Wheauand, Colby, Club, Western JBlackhull, and Leoti. Heads of these varieties were selfed arid the most Ihorhozygous head rows selected for continuation. Foundation seed was harvested from isolated fields of Improved Coes and A. C..1, two new early grain varieties that are adapted to the panhandle region of the state. Two j comparatively new diseases of : sorghum, charcoal rot (Sclerotium bataticold) and "weakncck" (cause unknown), resulted in considerable dam - age to the early grain sorghums in 1940. The charcoal rot causes lodging of plants left in the field to dry out for combining. "Weakneck" causes the decay of nodal tissue at.the upper node and the consequent breaking over of the head'and peduncle. </seg>

Soybeans With two soybean processing plants located in this state, interest in this crop continues among Nebraska farmers. The acreage, however, remains small and the processing plants are dependent almost entirely upon territory farther east for their supply of soybeans. Because of the relatively high labor cost of growing soybeans in the average year and their uncertain performance here, farmers have preferred other crops. Production practices are being studied through Experiment Station tests in an effort to simplify and cheapen the growing of this crop. Of all available field crops that are relatively new here and not now considered among the standard crops of the state, the soybean is the only one that offers some promise. Since the farmers of Nebraska must still make the choice of growing soy - beans for grain rather than some other crops, a comparison of yields of various crops is of special interest. In the drouthy year 1940 yields on the Experiment Station farm at Lincoln were as follows (bushels per acre): Aksarben soy - beans. 12; Krug corn, 18; Kherson oats, 20; Turkey winter wheat, 18; Java spring wheat, 7; Trebi barley, 19; and Kalo sorghum, 21. Averaging the last 17 years during which all of these crops were grown, the following yields may be reported: Habaro or Aksarben soybeans, 13; Hogue or Krug corn, 24; Kherson oats, 3fi; Turkey winter wheat, 25; Java spring wheat, 12; Trebi barley, 26; and Pink kafir or Kalo sorghum, 29. In considering these average yields, it should be borne in mind that of the 17 years only three had "normal" rainfall during the year beginning October 1, and nine years were 5 to 12 inches below normal. Corn has been most adversely affected by the prevailing drouth. Eleven standard varieties that have gained importance in this or neighbor - ing states averaged a yield of 10.2 bushels per acre in 1940. The extreme varia - tion in yield was from 6.6 bushels per acre for Minsoy to 12.4 for Dunfield. The yield of lllini. which has been the high yielding variety over a period of years, was 10.8 bushels or 1.6 below Dunfield. The Dunfield ripened Septem - ber 24, compared with October 8 for the lllini. Two seed-inoculation tests with the lllini variety and commercial bacterial culture were made in 1940 under two distinct soil conditions. There were 12 replications of alternating treated and untreated field plots on upland, and a similar test on low bottom land. On upland the uninoculated and the in - oculated seed yielded 14.1 and 14.7 bushels per acre, and on the bottom land the corresponding yields were 19.5 and 20.1 bushels. Root nodules were far more abundant following inoculation. Inoculation by some recognized pro - cedure is recommended on farms throughout the state until local experience has demonstrated this to be unnecessary.

Results of a flax variety test, including the best commer - cial varieties, at the Nebraska Experiment Station have given the following averages during the 7-year period, 1933 to 1939 (bushels per acre): Bison, 12; Linota, 2.6; Rio, 2.1; and Red Wing, 3.5. Although attractive results are oc - casionally reported by individual growers, it is evident that flax may be ex - pected to give very unsatisfactory yields and prove unprofitable in this state except perhaps on newly broken sod. This crop does relatively better in north - central Nebraska. Inability to compete with weeds is one of its greatest short - comings.: The Red Wing variety yielded 3.5 bushels per acre in 1940. Early April! seeding has given best results. ¦ The work with artichokes in 1940 consisted of varietal and time-of - harvesting tests. Weather and soil conditions permitted the harvesting of only an early fall stage. The average yield for the previous four years has been 2 tons per acre. ; Six varieties of castor beans under test failed to mature seed previous to the freezing weather of early November. Preliminary estimates indicate a yield of 450 pounds of seed per acre. A planting of the oil-bearing safflWer was destroyed by grasshoppers.

"¦; ¦' .. ; ' In undisturbed bindweed, new growth in the spring, depleted carbohydrate root reseryes until a seasonal low point was reached about May 15 at the time when theifirst flower buds appeared. Systematic clean cultivation at two-week intervals, | cutting all plants underground, has caused a further, reduction in reserves until a lethal minimum was reached and regrowth of plants ceased. Complete; exhaustion of reserves is usually accomplished within a two-year period by such tillage. I. : A time-of-beginning-cultivation experiment failed to demonstrate that be - ginning cultivation at the seasonal low point in reserves is any more efficient than beginning at any other time during the season. The dry condition of the soil after'small-grain harvest causes sporadic emergence of bindweed in treat - ments started at that time but this has not materially affected the number of cultivations required for eradication! A j fermentation method for estimation of fermentable carbohydrates in bindweed roots has been developed and has given results closely correlated with those ( obtained from standard chemical analysis. The efficiency of delayed cultivation has been further demonstrated in experiments involving several different frequencies. Cultivation intervals which permitted from 8 to 12 days of top growth have proved most effective from the standpoint of number of cultivations necessary for eradication and the total period of treatment. Root analyses reveal that reserve foods, chiefly sugars and starch, are used in the production of new top growth. As a result, the plants' are in a more weakened condition after 8 to 12 days of growth than at .the time of emergence. ¦ . : A system of growing a crop of wheat (or rye) in alternate years and culti - vating the land at two-week intervals when not in a crop has resulted in </seg>
         <seg id="p022">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station eradication of the bindweed in a four-year period. Although the period of treatment is nearly doubled only a few more cultivations are necessary under such a plan than when the regular cultivation method is employed. Growing a crop of wheat each year and cultivating only between harvest and seeding time has kept the bindweed under control but has not eliminated it Periodic burning has given some promise as an effective substitute for clean cultivation in controlling bindweed on areas where cultivation is im - possible. A thorough searing of the foliage has as much effect on the bind - weed ns a single cultivation but the cost of eradication by burning with equip - ment now available greatly exceeds that of clean cultivation. Spray applications of sodium chlorate have been slightly less effective than dry applications. Some seasonal variation has been encountered with respect to the most effective date of application but treatments made during the period from August 1 to October 15 have been superior to spring or early-summer application. Cultivation of an area treated with sodium chlorate has materially reduced the effectiveness of the chemical treatment. Eradication with sodium chlorate was accomplished most economically with an initial application of from 3 to 4 pounds per square rod, followed by retreatment of surviving plants the following fall. Several new chemicals were tested for the first time in 1940 but final data on their effectiveness are not available. Work has been started on cropping systems that will control bindweed seedlings which continue to appear after the old stand has been destroyed by cultivation. Field and green house tests are in progress to determine the reason for the harmful effect of two years' cultivation on the following crop of corn. The work on bindweed control is cooperative with the U. S. Department of Agriculture. Publication during 1940: L. S. Evans, Bindweed Control Methods, Nebr. Agr. Ext. Circ. 145 (mimeographed). Horticultural Crops Fruit Breeding Variety plantings of grapes, cherries, apricots, peaches, and apples have been extended generally with satisfactory results so far as seasonal growth is concerned. The year 1940 was generally favorable for fruit production. Work is being continued on the production of a homozygous strain of Dunlap straw - berry. Supplemental Water for Orchards in Eastern Nebraska Yield data were secured for comparable dry-land and irrigated trees of several varieties at Union. Results varied somewhat with different varieties but in general the addition of water materially increased the proportion of apples developing into the larger sized fruits. The figures for Grimes were especially striking since over 75 per cent of the irrigated fruits were over 2 IA inches in diameter while more than 95 per cent of the dry land fruits were less than 2/2 inches.

';. . ¦'&#132;.'¦ Orchard Culture Soil moisture studies have been continued in the vineyard cultural experi - ment | with results comparable to those reported earlier; the cultivated area continues; to show greater depletion of subsoil moisture reserve than the mulched area. Again as in previous years mulched apple trees showed an appreciably greater tendency to drop their fruit prematurely and also to pro - duce poorer colored fruit than in the unmulched blocks. In! the Winesap block in the west half of the orchard at Union four sets of plots were maintained in triplicate throughout the past season: volunteer cover^ volunteer cover mowed, mulch, and cultivated. These types of soil management were selected because they represent methods which are prac - tical under orchard conditions throughout the state. The soil moisture usage was traced throughout the season on all of these plots. The results indicate least oss with the mulch and the mowed volunteer coyer.

The infestation of codling moth was too light for a good test of. any of the materials. Several sprays to control dropping; are now known, to be practical and in the tests reduced dropping, but they are still rather expensive. None of the stickers tested seemed to have mechanical sticking properties to any very great degree during the 1940 season. Jonathan showed a definite response to the color spray. Color, on sprayed samples was 25 per cent darker than on unsprayed fruits. Red Delicious also showed a response but not so uniform as on the Jonathan apples. Winesap and Wealthy varieties did not show a definite response. Sodium thiocyanate at 0.1 l per cent or 127 grams per 300 gallons of water was used. Two and four sprays were applied at ten^tey intervals preceding harvest. This material promises to be of value for Jonathan and Red Delicious apples in eastern Ne - braska. At. the present time it is also very inexpensive. \-v; i ; &gt;• Potato Storage The'effect of different humidity and temperature at various periods of the year are being studied to determine their relation to water loss, rotting, and initiation of sprouting. In order to determine the method of holding potatoes that will be most effective to accomplish prompt and uniform sprouting where potatoes are planted in January (in the South) a comprehensive project has been set up. Different degrees of maturity, different strains, different combina - tions jof [humidity and temperature in storage, and treatment with ethylene . to break the rest period are being tested as follows: Samples are brought to higher temperatures (50° and 75 °F.) at ten-day intervals to determine the rest period, while others similarly treated are planted in large field plats in south!

' ¦'¦-: The cooperative storage-structure investigations carried on in conjunction with the U. S. Department of Agriculture include methods of providing low temperatures to keep seed potatoes dormant until June, methods of construc - tion so as to regulate temperature without excessive ventilation, methods of ventilating bins, and methods of protecting the insulation of dirt-covered cellars against moisture from the potatoes below and water from above. Light Duration and Intensity in the Production of Potato Seed During the winter of 1939-40 results from an experiment involving differ - ent light intensities for the supplemental light portion of long photoperiods showed that gains in production of blossoms, berries, and seed were secured by increasing the day length from 18 to 24 hours. High light intensity was also necessary to induce flowering in varieties that do not bloom readily. In - creasing the light from 40-50 to 200-250 foot candles quadrupled berry pro - duction but where the latter light was doubled to 450-500 foot candles the berry production was again doubled. Temperatures used were low; the maxi - mum day temperature was 75° F., and the night temperature was 50°-55° F. Varieties that bloom in only the most favored localities in the United States were made to bloom profusely. Potato Breeding The customary plantings of seedlings in plots were made at Scottsbluff, Alliance, North Platte, and Lincoln. In February and March, six plants from each of 300 seedling lines were tested in the heat machine. Several families appeared to have a high percentage of resistant lines. Certain inbred lines ap - pear to contain a high percentage of resistant seedling plants. Some promising early lines have been isolated. Special attention has been given to selecting tubers with very dark red skin yet having a white interior and good cooking quality. A number of promising lines are being increased. Two lines that appear resistant to fusarium wilt are being increased and dis - tributed for preliminary trials. Cooking tests were conducted with more than 100 seedlings. These tests are used as a basis for selecting lines for further propagation. Since it has been established that there is a close correlation between cooking quality and high specific gravity, cooking tests with many lots have been supplanted by termin - ations of specific gravity of ail tubers from lines increased, in 10-hiH plots.'A series of brine solutions has been used for this purpose.

Prevention of Cracking of Triumph Potatoes In order to determine the basic facts associated with the serious cracking of Triumph'potatoes at harvest time and the prevention thereof, an intensive study [was conducted in September and October, 1940, in Scottsbluff county. In two fields of Triumph potatoes in which tubers were cracking badly and the soil was well supplied with moisture, vines were killed by sulfuric acid and Elgetql sprays and roots were cut with a converted potato digger and a specially built device attached to a tractor. Samples of 50 tubers i were dug at intervals during the first few days and almost daily for four weeks and subjected to a standard cracking test. . | Data show that cracking increases when transpiration decreases rapidly or is kept at a very low level; the tubers then become more turgid than formerly. This occurs during cool mornings or on foggy, rainy days. Cracking decreases whenjthe days are warm, bright, or windy. When vines) are practically mature, cracking increases as a result of direct absorption of moisture by the tubers from a very moist soil. .-¦•¦: :¦]"¦', .', Killing vines with a spray reduced cracking somewhat but was not so effective as cutting the roots several days ahead of digging. The latter method is very promising, but more experience is needed in developing tools for doing the work and in determining just how the tools must be used. A new variety, Pontlac, cracked worse than the Triumph. A promising seedling, 85, cracked somewhat less. Warba and Messaba cracked to some extent, and Chippewa, Katahdin, and Irish Cobbler cracked practically not at all. i Heat and Drouth Endurance of Potatoes Studies on water usage and resistance to drouth and heat are being con - tinued. Cobalt chloride paper readings reveal significant differences in rate of water loss between Irish Cobbler (the most drouth enduring) and Triumph (the most drouth susceptible) of die common varieties. In the heat machine Irish Cobbler and Messaba withstood higher temperature than Katahdin and Warba, and Triumph was most susceptible to high temperatures. Potato plants! were, killed by heat more quickly in a humid than in a dry atmosphere. Three hundred straihs of potatoes were tested at 118°-119°:F. for six hours and showed a great difference in survival. Those surviving well in this test also survived well under the drouth conditions prevailing at Alliance in 1940. Further studies are being conducted to determine the physiological and morphological basis of drouth endurance in potatoes. i ¦;.'•' Tomato Breeding ; . ¦ Sixty-five varieties were grown under six conditions in the state from the Missouri river flats (900 feet altitude) to the western high plains (4200 feet altitude) to survey die field of promising varieties.

Plant Diseases : , Potato Diseases Fusarium wilt.— The search for resistant parent stocks to be used for hybridization has been continued. Tests of 213 line,s were made in the green - house last winter and 91 of these were selected for retesting in the field at the Scottsbluff Substation oh a larger scale. A satisfactory procedure for testing first-year seedlings has been developed and a description of the method has been prepared for publication. This per - mits the use of larger numbers of plants than is possible when seed tubers are used and also saves a year's time. About 6,000 first-year seedlings were tested last winter, 621 of which survived and are being retested this year. An addi - tional 8,000 first-year seedlings are now under test.: Tjliis method has also been used in testing a number of other tuber-bearing species of Solarium in the hope of finding resistance in wild species that could be used for interspecies crosses.

Bean Diseases Bacterial blights. —Artificial epidemics of halo and common blight of beans have Ik-cii produced in the greenhouse and field to determine the resistance of varieties and hybrids. About 15,000 plants were tested in the greenhouse. Common blight tests were made with 28 lines in the F-, selected from 10 crosses. Halo blight tests were made with 63 selections in the F a from 7 crosses and 17 selections in the Fj from 11 crosses. In addition about 33 commercial varieties were tested. In the field tests at the ScottsblufT Substation 18 selections or varieties of dry beans and 38 of garden beans were tested and 27 varieties were tested in the field at Lincoln. About 12,000 plants were grown in the hybrid test plot comprising selections in the F. to F T generations. Physiological resistance to halo blight has been found to occur in several varieties. This varietal resistance has been studied in considerable detail in the Sucrt and Red Mexican varieties and the results have been prepared for publication. Varities showing this type of resistance have been used in addi - tional crosses which are being increased preparatory to testing for resistance. Strains of the halo blight organism have been obtained from different sources, and inoculation studies with these have revealed a wide difference in virulence and type of disease produced. The results are being prepared for publication. Field Crop Diseases Preliminary studies have been started to determine the cause of the "weak - neck" disease of sorghum. A number of isolates are being tested in the green - house and varietal susceptibility is being noted in the field. The charcoal rot of sorghum is being studied to determine the effect of temperature and age of plant upon infection. Inoculation methods are being tested for the study of the relation of bunt infection to winterhardiness of wheat, discussed elsewhere in this report.

I Chemical Studies With Plant Materials Baking Quality in Flour Samples of flours were baked at naturally occurring protein levels, and the same flours were also baked after dilution with starch to a 10 per cent protein level!, in a study of protein quality. In these studies loaf volume (size of loaf) is used as the measure of baking strength—baking strength being determined by both protein quantity and protein quality. The greater the volume for any certain quantity of protein, the higher the quality. There was an exceedingly wide spread in loaf volumes between varieties at any given protein level, and the difference increased with increasing protein content. This indicates that there are greater differences in protein quality at the higher levels than at the lower. [; ¦'. ¦ ¦¦¦¦•- •: •¦ '¦' ¦' ; '. .'.¦¦¦:. ¦'¦ :..'¦'¦¦¦ , ¦ . , yVhen the flours were diluted with starch to a uniform level and baked, ther^ was a marked difference between varieties in loaf volumes obtained. The curvp for all varieties had a strong tendency to be similar in shape; the shape indicates that the highest quality of protein in any one variety was found in flour which had a naturally occurring protein content of 12 to 13 per cent. Perhaps in this particular series the climatic conditions which produced this protein level happen to be the conditions favorable for the production of high baking .quality. The protein decreased in quality in some varieties as the percentage increased above approximately 13 per cent. The quality of the Turkey flours tested was intermediate between the Blackhull and Nebred flours, and quite uniform at all levels. The Blackhull samples had rather poor quality over the entire protein range, while the Ne - bred samples had exceedingly high quality even in the high protein ranges. It should be emphasized that the quality indicated in some of the samples with high protein.content may be environmental rather than varietal.: </seg>

The mixing characteristics of flours are studied by means of curves obtained from a dough mixer that automatically makes a record. The investigation of protein quality suggested that the mixing characteristics of flours also should be compared on a common protein basis. An investigation was made of the effects of dilution, by the addition of wheat starch, on the recording dough-mixer curves of this same series of flours. The curves on the diluted flours were similar to curves ob - taineci from flours with the same naturally occurring protein content and show that he mixing requirement is not dependent on protein content but is largely a varietal characteristic.

It'was noticed in baking a series of flours with varying protein content that the rate of fermentation was directly related to the quantity of protein in the flour.

There is a group of enzymes in flour which by their action produce sugar from starch; these enzymes are called amylases. A knowledge of their action is essential to an understanding of the baking properties of flour. One of the chief [difficulties in the study of the amylases has been the lack of methods for the determination of the activity of the individual amylases in mixtures. The methods in use at the present time depend on the differential destruc - tion of the enzymes; /.&lt;?., one enzyme is more susceptible to destruction by heat or acidity than the other and thus one enzyme may be more or less completely destroyed and.the activity of the remaining enzyme measured. The amount of damage to the remaining enzymes is, however, questionable. Accordingly methods for the identification and measurement of the alpha - and beta-amylases in mixtures have been studied. A paper by Eric Kneen &#132;'. and R. M. Sandstedt on the determination, of beta-amylase is now in press.

         <seg id="p032">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station A paper titled, "Carbohydrate Metabolism and Winterhardiness of Wheat." by Eric Kneen and M. J. Blish, is in press in the Journal of Agricultural Research. This manuscript reports extensive "con - trolled hardening" and "dehardening" studies. It was shown that the response of plants to controlled low-temperature hardening was very similar to field response. Growth stage preceding and light intensity during hardening were demonstrated as important factors, whereas minor variations in photoperiod had little influence on the hardening plants. Response of winter wheat to low - temperature hardening and high-temperature dehardening closely paralleled usual field behavior and, as in the field, this response was varietal in nature. h may be concluded from the results that sugar and dry-matter content of the crowns of hardening winter wheat plants may be used as an index of relative cold resistance and as such should prove of value in varietal characterization. These principles have been put into practice and sugar and dry-matter analyses are being used in conjunction with controlled freezing for classifi - cation of winter wheat varieties as regards cold resistance. During the past year investigations on seedling transplant stock of broad - leaf trees were expanded to include six species. Wide differences in cold resistance and in depth of dormancy were found. By controlled greenhouse studies it proved possible to orient the species in the order of their known field-exhibited winterhardiness. Such studies should prove of value in deter - mining the suitability of new species for introduction into regions where winterhardiness is a problem. Previous results on the effect of time of fall "topping" were confirmed. In all cases the early topped material was more resistant to freezing temperatures than the late topped. Extensive chemical analyses on the roots of the seedlings showed significant relationships between winterhardiness and the relative contents of various carbohydrate fractions. This work is cooperative with the U. S. Department of Agriculture. The varieties of winter barley grown in uniform hardiness nurseries throughout the United States were subjected to low temperatures for the second year. The data obtained agree very well with those from the previous study and with information from the field, thus making it possible to divide the material into hardy and nonhardy varieties. A study of the effect of de - foliation on winierhardiness was continued for the fourth year and again there was a direct relation between the amount of defoliation and killing. Sufficient data are now available to justify discontinuing the study. Studies dealing with the effect of bunt infection on winterhardiness are progressing favorably and are being continued. Thirty varieties of winter wheat were studied as to the rate of loss of hardiness, using two and four days of dehardening. It was found that winter - wheat varieties differ in their ability to hold their cold resistance when ex - posed to growing temperatures. The study dealing with the effect of seed source on winterhardiness of resulting winter-wheat plants was continued for the second year. As yet sufficient data have not been obtained to permit conclusions and the study will be continued. The effect of time of seeding on winterhardiness of wheat was studied by controlled freezing of four varieties planted at four different dates in the fall. Winterhardiness was found to be related to time of seeding. A number of varieties of winter rye were sub - jected to low temperatures. As with barley and wheat, a wide variation in </seg>

"insects and Rodents , '/-¦.• Grasshopper Control In 1940 grasshoppers continued to be the most destructive type of insect pest in Nebraska. ; A grasshopper egg infestation survey made in the fall of 1939 | showed infestations rated as severe in 21 counties, moderate or threaten - ing in 43 counties and light but potentially dangerous in 23 counties. The hatching of the overwintered eggs was somewhat delayed in the spring of 1940jbecause of cool and damp weather during late April and through most of May, although the actual precipitation was much below normal during this period. Because of the delayed hatching, poisoning operations were begun in most counties at a considerably later date than usual, and the hatching period was protracted, necessitating the application of the poisoned baits through an unusually long period. But on the whole a rather extensive and successful poisoning campaign was carried out, involving 84 counties or dis - tricts] ¦ .'¦•:•. ;¦;. . .'..'¦. "•¦.¦ ¦'¦. Both Melahoplus mexicanus and M.bivittatus started hatching in 1940 on May 11 and the first adults were found on June 22, while M. differential!* started hatching on June 1 and produced the first adults on July 15. Crop dam - age for these three species was first observed on June 1, June 15, and August 3, respectively, and egg-laying started on August 5, 11, and 23, respectively. The first flights of M. mexicanus were noted on June 29. Experiments on control were largely a continuation of those of 1939, which werejtests of 45 materials that it was thought might add to the killing ability of poisoned baits by imparting to them an odor attractive to grasshoppers. In ,1939 the materials added to the poisoned baits were used at approxi - mately a maximum strength. In 1940, variations in concentration of some of the more promising materials were tested. One new material, oil of nutmeg, was also tested. , : Research oh the species of Nebraska grasshoppers and cause of outbreaks and invasions in Nebraska was continued during 1940. Chinch Bugs ¦ ¦'•¦; : Next to grasshoppers, chinch bugs constituted the most important insect problem in Nebraska in 1940. The present chinch-bug infestation began to develop in southeastern Nebraska in 1938, and, because the winter of 1938-39 was favorable for survival and the weather early in 1939 ideal for prolonging egg-laying and extending the hatching period, there was a tremendous in - crease in population in 1939. A survey made in November and December of 1939. (indicated serious chinch-bug damage to susceptible crops over a large area lin : southeastern Nebraska. Circular 61 of the Nebraska, Station, Control of the Chinch Bug in Nebraska (20 pages) by Myron H. Swenk and H. Douglas Tate, was issued in February. ' </seg>
         <seg id="p034">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station During these control operations in 19-10, as in 1939, careful studies were made of the relative efficiency of various types of barriers. The paper-creosote barrier, which was developed and used in both lowa and Illinois in 1934, and lust used in Nebraska in 1939, again proved to be highly satisfactory. A well constructed chinch-bug barrier oj the treated-paper type. Hessian Fly In the (all of 1938 the Hessian fly showed a marked increase in population, following five winter-wheat crops (1933-34 to 1937-38) in which there had been practically no damage. This increase continued moderately in the spring of 1939, so that in the lowlands along the Missouri River and elsewhere in southeast Nebraska this pest seemed to be approaching the danger point; but dry weather in the early fall of 1939 gave it a marked setback. However, the late fall of 1939 and the spring of 1940 were again favorable to Hessian fly in - crease, and while no serious damage was done to the 1939-40 winter-wheat crop, by the fall of 1940 it had again attained a population of menacing pro - portions. This was due to copious rains during late July and the first half of August over much of the Nebraska area susceptible to Hessian fly damage, which prompted an early emergence of the adult flies from the infested stubble fields and an early and general growth of volunteer wheat to receive their eggs. A survey of the infested area made during the first week in September, and repeated during the third week in September, showed that the volunteer wheat carried a light to very heavy infestation. A large majority of the farm - ers delayed sowing until the safe date, and consequently little infestation developed in the sown wheat, but a late November survey showed that a considerable amount of volunteer wheat carried an infestation that was likely to be a serious menace to the 1940-41 crop. </seg>
         <seg id="p035">¦¦'¦'¦¦ Fifty-fourth Annual Report Stored Grain Pests At the close of 1939 about twice the amount of wheat was in storage in Nebraska as compared to the close of 1938. Frequently a new crop of grain was put into storage before the preceding older grain left the farm, and because of inadequate storage space, the crops were not kept separated. Under these conditions an early infestation of the new grain was promoted and the potential damage by stored grain pests became a matter of unusual importance. Circular 62 of the. Nebraska Station, Control of Stored Grain Pests in Nebraska (12 pages), by Myron H. Swenk and Don B. Whelan, was issued in April, and during the year additional data were secured on the use and effectiveness of the fumigants used in stored-grain pest control. |; .'";. ¦ Pocket Gophers : \ ; Pocket gophers are the most widespread of Nebraska's destructive rodents, beingj found in every county and constituting an important economic pest everywhere in the state. They are especially obnoxious in the irrigated sections of the state and in the alfalfa-producing central-Nebraska counties and the fruit-growing counties of southeastern Nebraska. ¦• During late 1939 and through 1940 considerable time was given to a de - tailedj study of the relation of the distribution of the various types of Nebraska pocket gophers to the varying conditions of soil and vegetative covering within the state. . '. .'. . ¦; :-.-¦ :¦ ¦'"&gt;'¦¦ ;.: ' . ;-....¦ ¦¦ Potato Insect Control in 'Western Nebraska In the spring of 1940. a revised series of experiments was.started with the objectives of developing more effective field methods of controlling the potato flea beetle and more practical procedures in controlling die potato psyllid. Field records and observations and laboratory studies show that the emergence of hibernating adult potato flea beetles began about May 20 and continued until about June 15. Adults of the first generation of beetles began emerging during the early part of July and continued to emerge until well beyond the middle of August. Second-generation adults first appeared in the early part of August and continued to emerge until temperatures prevented further activity in the fall. Although a small proportion of the individuals of the second generation did not complete development, from a practical stand - point it was evident that two generations of beetles developed in the field dur - ing the 1940 season. " ¦ . Field control experiments in two different localities were conducted with six different insecticides which previously had shown promise in flea-beetle control. These.materials included zinc arsenite, barium fluosilicate (both dust and spray), cryolite, calcium arsenate-Bordeaux mixture, and basic copper arsenate. Results were measured oh the basis of foliage injury, adult beetle population, and quality of tubers at harvest. An analysis of the data shows a highly significant effect of all the treatments mentioned. Although differences between treatments were not significant in most instances, the results indicate that zinc arsenite spray and barium fluosilicate dust were superior to the other materials; tested. The belief held by many growers that potatoes harvested from fields planted early are more likely to be injured-by flea beetles than later plantings was sub- </seg>
         <seg id="p036">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station itantiatcd by experimental data. Tubers from potatoes planted on April 24 showed approximately 17 times as many "worm tracks" as did tubers from plantings on June 25. It seems evident that the most serious injury occurs in localities that more or less consistently plant potatoes early from year to year. Also, an increasing degree of injury was observed in late plantings located adjacent to or within a short distance of an early-planted field. Experimental results and field observations lead to the conclusion that flea-beetle injury can be greatly minimized in the irrigated sections of western Nebraska if the plant - ing of early potatoes is avoided and if timely insecticide applications are made. A number of large cages were set up in the Scottsbluff area to determine where the potato flea beetles overwinter and the conditions that are conducive to their survival. Results of these tests will be obtained during the early spring of 1941. Throughout the growing season surveys were conducted at regular intervals to determine the st.itus of the psyllid population, the purpose being to supply growers with information relative to the timely application of control measures. These studies were conducted in consultation with the U. S. Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine. At no time during the season were psyllids abundant enough to cause commercial damage, with the exception of minor miury in a few isolated fields. In addition, extensive collections of other insects of possible economic importance on potatoes were made throughout the season. Data on this activity have not yet been completely assembled. Bulletin 327 of the Nebraska Station, The Potato Flea Beetle and the Potato Psyllid in Nebraska (20 pages), by Myron H. Swenk and H. Douglas Tate, was published. Feeding Hogs, Cattle, and Sheep The Use of Oil Meals in Rations for Pigs in Dry Lot A 65-day test was conducted in dry lot to compare expeller-process soybean oil meal with that manufactured by the solvent method and also with tankage and cottonseed meal. Ten growthy 130-pound pigs were fed in each lot. Yellow shelled corn comprised the grain ration, being self-fed in all lots. The same mineral mixture was fed in all cases (steamed bone meal 2 parts, ground limestone 2 parts, and salt 1 part). The variable was the protein supplement which was also self-fed as follows: Lot I—Tankage Lot 2—Expeller-process soybean oil meal Lot 3—Solvent-process soybean oil meal Lot 4—Trio mixture, composed of tankage 2 parts, expeller - process soybean meal ) part, and alfalfa meal 1 part Lot s—Trio mixture, composed of tankage 2 parts, solvent-pro - cess soybean oil meal 1 part, and alfalfa meal 1 part Lot 6—Trio mixture, composed of tankage 2 parts, cottonseed meal 1 part, and alfalfa meal 1 part The lowest total feed requirement per unit of gain was made by Lot 1. Very satisfactory gains were made in Lots 2 and 3 where soybean oil meal was substituted for the tankage. Based upon the average daily consumption of the supplements, the solvent meal was more palatable than the expeller process. </seg>

'As- the consumption of supplement increased, the consumption of corn correspondingly decreased. °~'¦'.',..". The introduction of alfalfa meal into the supplementary mixture in Lots 5 and 6 proved an effective way of reducing the consumption of supplement. The trio mixture made with solvent-process soybean oil meal (Lot 5) proved to be slightly more efficient than that made with cottonseed meal, which was fed toLot6. :'¦'¦ ;:.¦¦¦"¦¦-.•¦¦ Protein Supplements for Fattening Pigs on Sudan Grass Pasture Eight lots of ten pigs each were fed on sudan grass pasture for 90 days dur - ing the summer of 1940.

Yellow shelled corn was self-fed to all lots as was also a mineral mixture of ground limestone 2 parts, steamed bone meal 2 parts, and salt 1 part.

The tankage-fed pigs gained .1.52 pounds per day and required 313 pounds of corn (5.6 bushels) and 39 pounds of tankage for each hundred pounds of gain. The pigs, fed fish meal (Lot 2) gained a little more rapidly, averaging 1.65 pounds daily, and required.s!4 bushels of corn and 51 pounds of fish meal for each 100.pounds of gain. The solvent-process soybean meal appeared to be more palatable than that made by the expeller method as judged by the amount consumed daily (Lots 3 and 4). The pigs fed expeller-process meal gained 151 pounds per day as against 1.43 pounds for the'pigs fed solvent-process meal. A trifle more coin, but distinctly less supplement, was needed to produce 100 pounds of gain with the expeller-process meal than with the solvent. The pigs in Lot 5, which wete fed cottonseed meal gained 1.35 pounds per day. The cottonseed-meal-fed pigs made a little more economical gains than those in Lots 3 and 4, which received soybean meal. Judging by the consumption of feed, old-process linseed meal such as was fed to Lot 6 was the least palatable of all the supplements used, for only 0.52 pound was consumed daily. The pigs in this lot averaged only 180 pounds at the close of the test and were not finished, while the other lots averaged as high as 215 pounds. '¦¦--. The mixing of equal parts of tankage with the soybean meals as was done in Lots 7 and 8 increased the: consumption of corn and decreased the con- </seg>
         <seg id="p038">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station sumption of supplement. The daily gains with the tankage mixtures were greater ,n both cases than where soybean oil meals made up the entire supple - ment. Slightly more corn was needed to produce 100 pounds of gain in Lots 7 and 8 where the mixtures were fed. However, only 60 per cent as much supple - ment and less mmeral were needed with the tankage mixtures. From the standpoint of rate and economy of gain, the expeller-process meal again proved sl.ghtly supenor to the solvent meal, although here again the solvent meal proved a little more palatable. Soybean OiJ Meal as a Substitute for Tankage for Pigs in Dry Lot Five lots of ten pigs each were fed for 71 days to compare expeller-process soybean oil meal with solvent-process meal both when fed alone and as com - ponents of trio m.xtures with corn. The pigs weighed 107 pounds at the be - ginning of the test. Yellow shelled corn was self-fed to all lots as was also a mineral mixture ot 2 parts ground Irmestone, 2 parts steamed bone meal, and 1 part of salt Ihe vanable in each case was the protein supplement. The supplements used were as follows: Lot I—Tankage Lot 2—Expeller-process soybean oil meal Lot 3—Solvent-process soybean oil meal Lot 4—Trio mixture containing expeller-process soybean oil meal Lot s—Trio mixture containing solvent-process soybean oil meal The pigs in Lot 1 gained 1.63 pounds a day and required 315 pounds of com (5.6 bushels) and 42 pounds of tankage for each 100 pounds of gain 1 hose fed soybean oil meal gained a trifle more rapidly (1.64 pounds in Lot 2 and 1.6 i pounds in Lot 3). Less corn was required to produce 100 pounds of gain with soybean oil meal, although from 50 to 100 per cent more supple - ment was needed than when tankage was fed. The pigs fed solvent-process oil meal gained a shade more rapidly and required a little more corn but less supplement to make 100 pounds of gain than the pigs fed expeller-process meal ihe mo mixtures fed to Lots 4 and 5 produced slightly larger gains than were secured from either the tankage or the soybean oil meal fed alone. The inclusion of the alfalfa meal m the trio mixtures was effective in reducing the consumption of supplement and increasing the corn consumption. The two trio mixtures were almost as efficient as tankage. Growing Pigs on Limited Grain Rations Three lots of 20 pigs each were used to compare a daily ration of 2 pounds of corn w,th one of 2/2 pounds of corn and with 2/2 pounds of ground oats Ihe pigs averaged 78 pounds at the beginning of the test and were fed for 65 days from July 12 to September 15, 1940. Each lot was given a tract of sudan - grass pasture which, because of drouth and chinch-bug damage, did not prove entirely adequate. Roughly 2/2 acres were furnished each lot. The same mineral mixture of steamed bone meal 2 parts, ground limestone 2 parts, and salt 1 part was kept before all lots. It soon became apparent that 2&gt;/ 2 pounds ot ground oats was inadequate in view of the shortage of pasture. Accordingly this was mcreased to 3 pounds per head daily which accounts for the average daily ration of oats being 2.89 pounds during the experimental period. </seg>
         <seg id="p039">Fifty-fourth Annual Report The pigs fed 2 pounds of corn daily gained 0.49 pound a day and required 405 pounds (7.2 bushels) to produce 100 pounds o£ gain. The pigs in this lot weighed 110 pounds at the close. Increasing the corn allowance to 2.50 pounds daily increased the daily gain to 0.62 pound. Approximately the same quantity of grajn was needed to pro - duce] 100 pounds of gain as in the preceding lot. It was noticeable, however, that this lot with the more liberal grain ration consumed less pasture and that their pasture remained in better condition than that used by Lot 1. The pigs in Lot 2 averaged 119 pounds at the close of the test. They were more at - tractive and showed more bloom than those in Lot 1. The pigs in Lot 3 which received 2.89 pounds of ground oats a day gained 0.641 pound a day and required 454 pounds or 14 bushels of ground oats to make 100 pounds of gain. In this case the ground oats proved to be 88 per cent as valuable as corn, although some question might be raised as to the validity of ttus computation since the oats and the corn were not fed at the same level. The oat-fed pigs averaged 120 pounds at the close of the test. They consumed less pasture than either of the preceding groups due probably to the bulkincss of the oats ration. . '. ": -.:'. Hogging Off Corn and Sorphtim Grains : Six lots of ten pigs each were used in this test. The corn and the sorghums were grown on some land which had produced grain sorghums and corn for two I previous years. A very hot, dry summer again cut yields sharply and chinch-bug damage was very serious, particularly to the Sooner and Day varieties. . '-... • From the standpoint of acre gains, Early Kalo in this year's test proved distinctly superior to the Sooner and Day varieties. The value of adding pro - tein! to the ration was again strikingly shown. This trial again shows hogging off to be a practical means of harvesting a grain sorghum crop. ¦ Hard Hybrid Corn vs. Open-Pollinated Com for Fattening Cattle In a large part of the corn-growing area, hybrids and especially the hard varieties have been discounted as much as 5 cents per bushel by feeders. Since hardness of kernel seemed to be the first objection of feeders it was decided that'as a preliminary test, one of the hardest varieties would be used in the experiment. U. S. No. 44 was selected for two reasons: first, it is a hard variety, and, second, both the hard hybrid and the open-pollinated could be secured from the same farm. In this test three lots of cattle were fed. One received cracked open - pollinated (check lot) and one received cracked hard hybrid. Since grinding may have some effect upon the palatability of hard corn, a third lot was fed whole hard hybrid corn. Corn silage was used in all lots as the roughage and pebble-size cottonseed cake with a guaranteed protein content of 43 per cent was used as the protein supplement. A mineral mixture composed of bone meal, limestone, and salt was fed to all lots. In addition, block salt was avail - able at all times. Hereford heifer calves of good quality were used. The re - sults may be summarized as follows: .Cracked open-pollinated corn proved to be more palatable than the hard </seg>
         <seg id="p040">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station hybrid, cither whole or ground. The difference in payability was not a serious factor, however, in getting the cattle to eat grain. Whole hybrid proved more palatable than cracked hybrid corn. The daily gains made by the cattle were as follows: 2.09 pounds for open - pollinated corn, 2.04 for whole hard hybrid corn, and 1.92 pounds for cracked hard hybrid corn. Upon the basis of replacement value, whole hybrid and cracked open - pollmated corn were of equal value, both rating 100 per cent. Cracking the hard hybrid resulted in a lower feed value, giving cracked hybrid a figure of % per cent of whole hybrid or open-pollinated corn. Upon the market the open-pollinated-fed cattle sold for $9.90 per cwt as against $9.50 per cwt. for whole hard hybrid and $9.40 per cwt. for cracked hard hybrid. The dressing yields and carcass grades were for the most part in agreement with the prices paid by the packers and the results secured in the feed lot. Based upon the test, the first of its kind at this Station, U. S. 44, a hard hybrid corn, was not quite as satisfactory as open-pollinated corn for fattening cattle. These results are in agreement with those of the lowa Station at Ames lowa, upon the comparative feeding value of Reid's Yellow Dent, an open - pollinated variety, and U. S. 44, a hard hybrid. However, the results secured at the lowa Station with softer hybrids were more favorable to the hybrids but not superior to the open-pollinated corn. Soybean Meals vs. Cottonseed Cake as Protein Supplements for Fattening Cattle Hecause soybean meal is relatively new in this area and because of the new processing methods it is but natural that many questions regarding its value would be raised by feeders contemplating its use. The two principal types of soybean meal, the old-process or expeller-type meal and the new - process or solvent meal, were tested in this experiment. Cottonseed cake was used as the standard of comparison. Open-pollinated No. 2 yellow corn was fed to all lots. The corn was coarsely cracked and it was fed according to appetite of the cattle. Silage was fed as the roughage in each lot and it, too, was fed according to appetite. A mineral mixture or limestone, bone meal, and salt was available to the cattle at all times as was additional block salt. The cottonseed cake was pebble size and carried a guaranteed crude protein content of 43 per cent. The soybean meal fed to one of the lots was expeller-type meal with a guaranteed protein content of 41 per cent. The soybean meal fed to another lot was the new - process solvent meal. It had been toasted and pressed into small pellets and carried a guaranteed protein content of 44 per cent. The results may be sum - marized as follows: In this test three lots of 12 heifer calves each were fed 193 days. The average daily gains made by each of the three groups of cattle were as follows: Cottonseed meal 2.09 pounds Expeller soybean meal 2.06 pounds Solvent soybean pellets 2.01 pounds </seg>
         <seg id="p041">Fifty-fourth Annual Report Neither of the soybean meals proved quite as palatable to the cattle as cot - tonseed and the solvent proved less palatable than the expeller-type meal. Differences were not significant. • Though the cottpnseed-meal-fed cattle gained slightly more than the soy - bean-fed cattle, the latter ate less and produced 100 pounds of gain more economically. At the same price for all supplements, the cost of 100 pounds of gain in Lot 1 (cottonseed meal) was $7.75; in Lot 2 (expeller soybean meal) {7.42; jand in Lot 3 (solvent soybean pellets) $7.35. Because of the higher finish shown by the cottonseed-fed lot, this group sold for $9.90 per cwt. as against {9.65 per cwt. for each of the two lots fed soybean meal or pellets. This difference in sale price about offset the difference in economy of gain, leaving all lots with approximately the same profit per head. ;. .¦¦ j. ¦¦' .'. .' : ¦¦;¦ ' -.- •"¦,.¦ - '. ¦ ' .¦ ¦ '. ; ': Carcass grades and dressing yields were in close agreement with the gains made and sales value. The cottonseed-cake-fed lot showed slightly more finish and therefore graded and yielded slightly higher. Studies made of the internal organs at the time of slaughter yielded no indication that any one ration kept the animals in better health than any other. The supplements fed produced carcasses of equal value other than for total finish.j Quality of the fat appeared to be the same in all lots and no different effect due to feed could be detected upon the lean. Grain Sorghums for Fattening Cattle In i he experiment reported last year the following feeds were compared to cracked corn in the cattle-fattening ration: cracked Early Kalo, cracked Sooner milo, cracked Atlas sorgo grain, and ground. Early Kalo and Sooner milo heads, j The latter two were fed during a part of the feeding period and then each was replaced with the grain of the species. During the past year, cracked corn, cracked Early Kalo grain, ground Early Kalo heads, cracked Sooner milo grain, arid cracked Day milo grain were compared as feeds for fattening cattle. The test upon cracked Early Kalo and cracked Sooner milo was the second of its kind conducted at this Station. None of the sorghum grains were at all.difficult to feed. The cattle went on feed rapidly, ate the grains at least as well as corn, and stayed on a full feed without undue fluctuations. Scouring seemed especially infrequent among the cattle getting the sorghum grains. : Crafcked Early Kalo produced practically as much total gain as cracked corn but was less efficient in its production of beef. It showed a replacement value of 89 per cent of corn in this test and 94 per cent in the 1938-39 test. The Kalo.used in this experiment tested from 56 to 58 pounds per bushel. In the previous test, cracked Kalo- and corn-fed cattle sold at the same price but in this test the corn-fed cattle sold at 5 cents per hundredweight higher. Dressing yields and carcass grades bear out this price differential. Premiums for thej corn-fed cattle were justified only by total finish, not by any better fat or brighter lean. ' . •":: Feeding unground Early Kalo grain did not prove economical in this test. The Kalo seemed to go through the cattle in large amounts undigested. </seg>
         <seg id="p042">.Vlbraska Agricultural Experiment Station Whole Early Kalo showed a feeding value 78 per cent of cracked Early K.alo and 69 per cent of cracked corn. Cracking the Kalo increased its value for fattening cattle in this experiment by 22 per cent. While ground Early Kalo heads produced very satisfactory gains, 0.08 pound less per head daily than cracked Early Kalo, the ration was too bulky to produce a high degree of finish. The gains made upon ground heads cost 79 cents per 100 pounds less than upon cracked Kalo grain but the cattle so fed also sold at 35 cents per hundred lower, making a greater net return for the cracked grain. From an earlier experiment where heads were fed slightly over one-fourth of the period and from this test, it would seem that ground heads could be fed to advantage approximately one-half of the feeding period, after which they should be replaced with cracked grain. Cracked Sooner milo produced very slightly greater gains than cracked corn in each of the two trials. Efficiency of gain, however, favored cracked torn by a slight margin. Cracked Sooner milo showed a replacement value of 96.5 per cent (96 in Trial I and 97 in Trial II) of corn. Cracked Sooner milo produced unusually attractive carcasses in that the fat was of excellent color and quite plentiful. In each of the two trials the carcasses produced upon cracked Sooner milo graded as good as or better than carcasses produced upon cracked corn, but the corn-fed cattle outyielded the Sooner-milo-fed cattle by a small margin. Cracked Day milo produced the same gain as cracked Early Kalo and upon but slightly less feed. The replacement value in this test was 91 per cent of cracked corn. This is similar to the two-year average with cracked Early Kalo but 2 per cent greater than in this test with cracked Early Kalo. Quality of the carcasses in all lots was good. There was no discrimination against any lor due to color of fat, or lean, or firmness of either fat or lean. Examination of the livers and the digestive tract yielded no findings that would lead to the belief that any one lot was in any better state of health than any other lot at marketing time. Lamb-Feeding Tests with Sorghums and Soybean Meals South Dakota white-face feeder lambs sired by Corriedale rams and from ewes of Corriedale-fine-wool breeding, were used in the fall of 1939 to (1) compare Early Kalo, Sooner milo, and shelled corn for fattening lambs; (2) study the value of adding V 2 pound of alfalfa hay to a lamb-fattening ra - tion in which Atlas silage was the roughage; (3) compare cottonseed pea-size meal and soybean pellets as protein supplemental feeds for fattening lambs. After the lambs had been on feed from November 1 to about December 15, 1939. some of the wethers in the lot fed Sooner milo, cottonseed meal, bone meal, and Atlas silage began to show urinary calculi. The lots with no yellow corn nor alfalfa hay had very heavy losses from calculi. Forty-two and 58 per cent respectively of the wether lambs were lost in these two lots. The lots receiving either yellow corn or alfalfa hay or both had a much better protection from urinary calculi than those lots without the two feeds mentioned. The protection seemed to be the greatest when both yellow corn and alfalfa were used. </seg>
         <seg id="p043">-¦.!., Fifty-fourth Annual Report Adding Alfalfa Hay to a Ration of Shelled Corn, Cottonseed Cake, Bone Meal, and Atlas Silage for Lambs The addition of one-half pound of cue alfalfa hay daily per lamb to a ration of yellow corn, cottonseed cake, bone meal, and Atlas silage reduced the num - ber of days required to fatten lambs from 133 to 116, or a saving of 17 days. For tie feed required to produce 100 pounds of gain, 163 pounds of alfalfa saved or replaced 72 pounds of corn, 17 of cottonseed cake, 4 of bone meal, and 235 of Adas silage. With 56-cent corn, $40 cottonseed ; cake, $30 bone meal, and $3 Atlas silage, one could have paid as much as $18 a ton for alfalfa to add to the silage ration without increasing the feed cost per 100 pounds gain. Where soybean pellets replaced the cottonseed cake one could have paid $30 a ton for the alfalfa hay without increasing the cost of 100 pounds of gain. Three lambs were lost in Lot 1 (fed yellow corn but no alfalfa), two of them with iirinary calculi. No lambs were lost in Lot 2 (fed the same as Lot 1 with the addition of alfalfa). Apparently, the one-half pound of alfalfa hay was helpful in preventing the calculi trouble as is demonstrated more conclusively in the other lots fed. Adding Alfalfa Hay to a Ration of Early Kalo : or Sooner Milo, and Atlas Silage • When alfalfa hay was not added to a ration of Early Kalo, cottonseed cake, bone jmeal, and Atlas silage, results were so disastrous that the test could not be continued. The addition of one-half pound of alfalfa hay per lamb daily reduced the death loss from urinary calculi in the wethers from 42 per cent to no loss. The test was closed after 103 days of feeding. .-¦¦, Tnere is some indication that the Early Kalo may be better fortified to help ward off the calculi trouble than the Sooner milo if the death loss is used as an index. However, the loss was so heavy when either was used without alfalfa that the practice of feeding either in this test without a liberal supply of good alfalfa hay would be very poor economy. One-half pound of alfalfa per lamb daily may not be a safe amount in a ration of Early Kalo or Sooner milo and cottonseed cake, bone meal, arid Atlas silage. ( Early Kalo vs. Sooner Milo for Fattening Lambs The Kalo and milo lots were both fed; 131 days, producing a slightly heavier lamb than was necessary, but no heavier than was expected for the length of the feeding period. The Kalo lambs gained 0.30 pound daily while the milo lambs produced 0.31 pound daily. To produce 100 pounds of gain the Sooner, milo lambs required. 14 pounds milo, 5 pounds cottonseed cake, 1 pound bone meal, 37 pounds of Atlas silage^ and 8 pounds alfalfa hay less than the Early 1 Kalo lambs. These differences are small but they cannot be over - looked/: ;!;-';M:,'.;-: ¦¦¦¦:: -'- "... ]¦- ; .. ¦¦ ¦¦' ¦ ": ¦1 Cottonseed Cake (Pea-Size) vs. Soybean Pellets , . • ' in a Lamb Fattening Ration &#132;'.¦¦ Wjhen fed with yellow corn, bone meal, Atlas silage, and alfalfa hay, cot - tonseed meal was slightly more efficient as a protein supplement than soybean pellets.

         <seg id="p044">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station 100 pounds ot gain the cottonseed cake saved 46 pounds of corn, 12 pounds of protein supplement, and 51 pounds of Atlas silage. The results were reversed when alfalfa hay was added to shelled corn, bone meal, and Atlas silage. The lambs receiving soybean pellets were slightly more efficient than the cottonseed cake lambs. The daily gains were 0.308 and 0.314 pound respectively. The soybean pellets saved 5 pounds of corn, 1 pound of protein supplement, 29 pounds of Atlas silage, and 4 pounds of alfalfa hay in producing 100 pounds of gain. The results of this test indicate there is little difference between cottonseed cake and soybean pellets as supplements to lamb fattening rations compared in this test. Dairy Production and Manufacture Characteristics of Ice Cream and the Ice Cream Mix Plain condensed milk has been stored frozen for use in ice cream mixes with success. While the procedure of manufacture has been the same, various batches of frozen condensed milk have shown markedly different characteris - tics when used in ice cream mixes. Studies were therefore instituted to deter - mine if these differences were caused by variations in the milk supply from which the condensed milk was made. Common chemical methods of milk analysis were used, including determinations of butterfat, total solids, totaj protein, casein, lactose, ash, and titratable acidity, supplemented with pH determination and the measurement of the stability of the protein to alcohol and heat coagulation. The results obtained by these methods did not differenti - ate a milk supply which would not withstand condensing and storage at O°F. for thirty days, from one which would withstand this treatment. The con - densed skimmilk after storage was entirely suitable as a source of serum solids in ice cream in each of the nine comparisons made. The results have been published as "A Study of the Characteristics of a Milk Supply as Re - lated to the Manufacture of Plain Condensed Skimmilk for Ice Cream Making," by L. K. Crowe and D. D. Deane, Jour. Dairy Sci. 23: 919-29. Obtaining an economical source of milk solids-not-fat for ice cream manu - facture is one of the problems of the industry. Information pertaining to sat - isfactory methods of storage of skimmilk would help solve the problem. Plain skimmilk was condensed in a stainless steel vacuum pan to 30 per cent solids and part of this was superheated to a desirable viscosity. Sweetened con - densed skimmilk was also prepared by adding one pound of sugar for each pound of milk solids and then condensing the product until it contained 60 per cent total solids. The three types of condensed skimmilk were stored at OT. Ice cream mixes were made using the fresh condensed skimmilk. This ice cream mix and the ice cream made from it were compared to ice cream mix and ice cream containing the condensed skimmilks which had been stored for one, two, and three months. The sweetened condensed skimmilk showed no protein precipitation after storage; plain condensed skimmilk showed some precipitation which increased progressively during storage, and superheated condensed skimmilk showed protein precipitation after one month's storage and increased rapidly thereafter. All three types oi condensed skimmilk were </seg>
         <seg id="p045">Fifty-fourth Annual Report suitable for use in ice cream but the sweetened and plain condensed skimmilks were most desirable. The use of superheated condensed skimmilk did not materially affect the viscosity of the ice cream mix. The flavor of the resulting ice cream was not affected by the condensed milk used, but body and texture scores were slightly lowered by all types of the frozen condensed skimmilk. The report of this work will appear as "A Study of Fresh and Frozen Plain, Superheated, and Sweetened Condensed Skimmilk for Ice Cream," by L. K. Crowe and H. H. Winn, in the Journal of Dairy Science. A study of the retail ice cream supply in a trade territory did not indicate the reason for the differences in price, and a comparison was made on the basis of the following:'net weight of ice cream obtained; calculated overrrun percentage; percentage composition including butterfat, total solids, protein, and calculated carbohydrate; bacteria count; and calorific value. The results of the study have been published as "A Comparative Evaluation of an Ice Cream Supply as It Reaches the Consumer," by L. K. Crowe and P. A. Downs, four. Dairy Sci. 23: 615-20. Tr c study of available modified Babcock methods for the determination of fat in ice cream is being continued. Results obtained do.not indicate that the methods studied will always give results within the desired limits of variation; however, ithe method known as the "Nebraska procedure" gives results which are in most cases satisfactory. Bacterial contamination of ice cream is a matter of great public interest and importance. This contamination may be from the ingredients, from the manufacturing utensils, or from the dishing utensils where ice cream is dis - pensed. Studies are being made of these sources with a view to determining minimal standards. : I | Growth in Dairy Cattle The skeletal and other measurements that have been taken at monthly inter - vals for a number of years are now being tabulated preparatory to analysis. It is expected that norms can be prepared for different skeletal measurements by ages and by breeds. The genetic analysis of measurement relationships will also be attempted. ..] Farm Methods of Cooling Milk and Cream In cooperation with the Department of Agricultural Engineering, a study has been conducted comparing the efficiency of various methods of cooling milk and cream. The results of this study have been published as Cooling, Storage, and Transportation of Mil\ and Cream, by P. A. Downs and F. D. Yung 1, Nebr.Agr. Exp. Sta.

These trials are being continued in order to standardize more completely the new procedures and to test them under varying conditions. </seg>
         <seg id="p046">Nebraska Agrio^tTral Experiment Station Milk Quality as Affected by the Individual Cow The studies of the bacteria] flora as related to milk quality and flavors have been continued. The conditions followed in handling the herd and in the production of milk have continued to keep down mastitis. The relation of the leucocyte count and the test for chlorides to "off" flavors in milk is being studied. The effect of feeding cows on certain weeds such as bindweed, pepper - grass, and pennycress was studied. Repeated trials with the first two weeds yielded negative results while the feeding of pennycress always produced ob - jectionable flavors. A survey by questionnaire as to the occurrence of objection - able feed and weed flavors in milk was made and a progress report appears as '.'A Survey of the Objectionable Feed Flavors in Milk throughout the North .American Continent," by P.

Nine different periods of the estrus cycle arc being compared and results should be available next year for about 300 cows. In this same study, observations have been made as to length of estrus and the occurrence of menstruation after estrus for both bred and unbred animals. To determine the effect of subcutaneous treatment of wheat germ oil upon the number of services required for conception, 42 virgin dairy heifers were divided into two lots balanced as to breed, age, and weight. One lot was treated as follows: Beginning one month before the first service or insemina - tion, a dose of 20 cc. of cold pressed wheat germ oil was injected into the gluteal muscle at weekly intervals so that each animal had received 80 cc. before breeding. At the time of breeding, a 20-cc. dose of wheat germ oil was administered and if subsequent services were needed, additional doses of 20 cc. were given at each service. If conception took place at first service, addi - tional doses of 20 cc. were administered at three weeks and again at six weeks. The other lot of heifers was untreated. Matched heifers in each lot were bred to the same bull. No significant differences were found. Since June, 1938, the spermatozoa from each herd sire have been examined at monthly intervals. Slides are made from these counts of numbers and the number and type of abnormal spermatozoa are noted. Nutritional Value of Grain and Forage Sorghums Two trials have been completed on the feed value of Sooner milo (a typical sorghum grain) compared with yellow corn as a part of the grain ration. With corn silage fed at the rate of 25 lbs. per cow daily, and alfalfa hay (U. S. No. 1) ted at the rate of 2 lbs. for each 100 lbs. of live weight, two grain mixtures were compared to balanced groups of cows. The grain mixtures were 52 per cent ground yellow corn (replaced by ground Sooner milo in the comparable grain), 25 per cent wheat bran, 20 per cent (43 per cent protein) cottonseed meal, 2 per cent steamed bone meal, and 1 per cent iodized salt. The grain mixture was fed in the proportion of one pound to each three pounds of milk. Only slight differences in value were found. </seg>

Curing Cheddar Cheese \-. . : ¦.- "He curing of cheddar cheese is of considerable economic significance to the dairy industry. Studies include the influence of various types of coverings (paraffin, parafilm, and wax) on the flavor and body characteristics of the cheese and the moisture loss during storage. Normal variations in the milk, and tlie procedure of making were allowed to exist, so that the different types of cheese were exposed to the influence of various types of covering. This cheese! was then weighed and scored at periodic intervals to observe changes taking place during ripening. .. '?''* Paraffin-covered cheese aged consistently better than the cheese with more air-tight covering. Most parafilm-covered cheese eventually developed fruity and fermented flavor defects and also showed considerable moisture accumula - tion immediately beneath the outer covering, which, of course, produced sur - face spoilage as aging progressed. Defects in body, such as Swiss-eye forma - tion, pastiness, and weakness were much more noticeable in the cheese with parafilm covering than those either paraffined or waxed. Weight losses were very much reduced by the use of parafilm, being only one-tenth as great as those covered with paraffin.

In connection with the studies of cheese, a new variety has been developed called "Husker," which has some of the characteristics of cheddar, some of brick] arid some of the qualities of processed cheese. "Husker" has a mild brick I cheese flavor, ripens quickly, and appears to be well received by the public. The experiments are being continued to improve the quality and to standardize the procedure. . . Artificial Insemination with Dairy Cattle Elorts have been directed toward making the procedure of artificial in - semination more practical:and to perfect procedures for storing semen for a considerable time.

Hormones of the Pituitary Gland and Their Relation to Milk Secretion This is cooperative with the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station. The study of the effect ot Antuitnn-S (anterior pituitary-like sex hormone) upon lactation in the rat, was extended to determine whether or not this hormone would inhibit lactation if the diet was somewhat deficient. The re - sults of five experiments indicate that, while the injection of Antuitrin-S caused some inhibition of lactation, it did not cause complete inhibition even when the diets of the rats were somewhat deficient. A study was also made of the effect of inanition upon the lacogen content of the- pituitary gland. The results of this study are not yet complete. It was shown in this laboratory that the effectiveness of the estrogen ( Progynon-B) in inhibiting lactation in the rat could be increased through the simultaneous administration of the gonado-tropic principle Antuitrin-S pregnant women's urine. This study was published as "Hormonal Inhibition of Lactation," by R. P. Recce, J. W. Bartlett, I. L. Hathaway, and H. P. Davis, Proc. Soc' F.xp. Biol. Med. 43: 183-86. Vitamin Content of Various Grasses at Different Stages of Growth and Cured under Varying Conditions The carotene content of eight native Nebraska grasses was determined at approximately monthly intervals from June to November. The grasses studied were: side-oats grama, blue grama, Indian grass, big bluestem, switch grass, western wheat grass, buffalo grass, and sand dropseed. In general there was a steady drop in the carotene content of all grasses from |une to November, with the exception of western wheat grass, which had some green material throughout this period. The carotene content of these grasses had reached a very low level by November (0.21-1.08 mg. per 100 gm. dry material). During November the western wheat grass contained 5.15 mg. of carotene per 100 gm. of dry material. During June the carotene values ranged from 18.02 (buffalo grass) to 39.12 mg. (Indian grass) of caro - tene per 100 gm. of dry material. Throughout the entire period, the buffalo grass had a lower carotene value than any of the other grasses. The highest carotene value of all samples occurred during June in Indian grass. Poultry Management and Nutrition The Utilization of Food Elements by Growing Chicks The series of studies with growing chicks was continued with a com - parison of open-pollinated and hybrid corn. In one lot 24 chicks were fed </seg>

The.other lot of 24 was fed the 8-S with lowa 939 hybrid corn supplying 31 per cent on an equivalent nitrogen basis. Vitamin A was provided so that the rations were'not deficient. At the end of the six weeks' feeding trial the chicks fed the open-pollinated-corn ration were slightly heavier (3 per cent) than the lot fed the hybrid-corn ration. The retentions of nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus were not significantly different on the two rations. It was con - cluded that lowa 939 can be substituted for open-pollinated corn without appreciably affecting the growth rate of chicks up to six weeks. A study was also made of the effect on' the utilization of food elements cause 1 by variations in the time required by White Leghorn chicks to con- Equipment (with top removed) that is used jor controlled nutritional experi - ments with chiefs.

By allowing free individual consumption of feed the time varied from 39 to 50 days in a lot of 24 chicks. Variations in the net weights of chicks at the end of the experiments were not greater than in previous work. This! indicated that feeding may be controlled to equal feed intake over a short time interval without affecting utilization of food elements to an appreciable extent.

The protein levels of the two rations were identical. The utilization of nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus will be determined when the analytical work is completed. It was noted that the sub - stitution of ground wheat or rye for the 20 parts of shorts and 10 parts of bran resulted in several cases of curled-toe paralysis. This indicates that provision tor additional riborlavin is required in the ration where the above sub - stitutions are made in the 8-S ration. Work under way at the present includes the individual feeding of chicks according to our established procedures and the examination of the intestinal microllora of several individuals by bacteriologists. This work was made pos - sible by the designing of an experimental brooder holding chicks in individual cells. Ihe cells are divided so as to exclude the chick from the feeding com - partments except during the feeding periods, to avoid loss of food.

Antirachitic Value of Lamp Radiation for Laying Hens A comparison of the egg production and of fertility and hatchability of eggs produced by two lots of Single Comb White Leghorn pullets with similar conditions except as to source of the antirachitic factor indicates that Leghorn hens can be maintained in good condition when no fish oil is included in the ration, provided S, lump radiation is supplied from 5:00 to 7:00 A. M. from October 15th to March 15th. Practical application of these experiments will be made as the cost of special lamp equipment is reduced. Increased demand tor the lamps has already resulted in lowered prices. Rickets-Preventing Value of S-2 Lamp Radiation Several types of lamps for the production of ultraviolet energy have been developed in recent years. The rickets-preventing value of S-l lamp radiation was established by earlier experiments. A new lamp designated as S-2, having a power requirement of 175 instead of the 500 watts required by the S-l lamp, was used in further experiments with growing chicks. The lamp was placed 2-i inches above feeders and waterers, and was operated for two hours daily with a total energy requirement of 19.6 kilowatt-hours for the 200 chicks for eight weeks. The control group received one per cent fish oil in the mash and direct sunshine exposure in favorable weather. Ash determinations were made of tibia bones of 10 representative cockerels in each lot. With the ration used in this experiment, two hours' daily irradiation with the S-2 lamp provides adequate antirachitic factor for normal calcification of Single Comb White Leghorn chicks. Sudan Grass Meal in Rations for Laying Hens Previous experiments indicated that sudan-grass meal is an acceptable source of vitamins tor growing chicks. A comparison of sudan-grass meal with </seg>
         <seg id="p051">Fifty-fourth Annual Report ; No. 1 quality alfalfa meal, showsthat the sudan-grass meal is satisfactory as a source jof the essential plant-leaf vitamin essentials. Sudan-grass meal for the experiment was prepared by cutting hay when 24 inches high and dehydrating it in a drum-type drier. The resulting pro - duct was high in carotene and protein. Values for the sample used were as follows: carotene 26.30 mg. per 100 gm. material; protein 19.38 per cent. This was compared with alfalfa meal made from fourth-cutting hay which contained 18.8 per cent protein and 17.8 mg. carotene per 100 gm. material. Balance of the ration in each case was the same (base mash formula 8-S plus grain on equal-parts basis). V : Growth Promoting Value of Sudan Grass i Influenced by Curing Methods i ' ¦ ; ' " ¦ ' ' ¦ ¦ ' *' ¦I ' '"¦"¦' The growth-promoting value o£ four samples o£ sudan-grass meal, similar except as to curing methods, was compared. Condensed description of the samples is as follows: (1) artificially dehydrated; (2) dried at 210° F. (4 hours required); (3) field cured (5 days required, 1 heavy shower); and (4) cured in colony house (17 days required). Five per cent of the sudan-grass meal samples, as described, were used to supplement a basal ration low in vitamin A, but adequate in other respects. Seventy chicks were used in each lot. Seven chicks in one lot fed the field-cured sample presented evidence of vitamin-A deficiency at the end of the experiment. This ration was apparently marginal for vitamin-A requirements. The conclusions reached were as follows: vitamin A values of sudanrgrass meals are significantly affected by methods of curing. Five per cent of good-quality sudan grass meal will provide an adequate amount of vitamin A, but the optimum level may be somewhat higher. ¦ ]¦ Comparison of Sunflower Seed and Yellow Corn in - :: ;' . " / ¦ . Rations for Turkeys i \ : The relatively high fat and protein content of sunflower seeds suggests their use in rations for turkeys for the last six weeks of the feeding period. Since whole yellow corn is the basic feedstuff for the finishing period, a com - parison was made with this feedstuff/ A complete dry mash mixture and a moist mash mixture were also fed twice daily to both experimental lots of 50 Bourbon Red toms of equal weight and quality. Difficulty was experienced at first in getting the turkeys to eat the sun - flower) seed. For the second half of the feeding period^ however, the sunflower - seed lot made excellent gains. More economical gains and more prime-quality turkeys were obtained in the corn-fed lot. There were no mortalities in either lot. :,.i;: ".;,-¦ ..¦ ¦/.'¦ '::" ¦:,¦ ¦ ¦¦' y}'/ /.; ... . ¦ ;¦..¦'•• ,; .

         <seg id="p052">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Protein Utilization by Poults During the year, 974 poults were used in three series of experiments. The same basal ration was used in all experiments, the protein concentrate combina - tions being the only variable. All concentrate combinations for each series were adjusted to the same protein level with dextrin, and were then fed at 24 per cent levels. In the first experiment a comparison was made of expeller- and solvent - process soybean oil meals. The results were definitely in favor of the expeller - process meal. For the next two experiments, protein concentrate combinations of meat scraps, fish meal, dried buttermilk, soybean oil meal (solvent), corn gluten meal, linseed oil meal, and cottonseed meal were used. Conclusions drawn from the experiments are that all the combinations as used were quite satisfactory. It appears, however, that linseed-oil-meal proteins supplement fish-meal proteins less effectively than do proteins of either soy - bean oil meal, corn gluten meal, or cottonseed meal. There appears to be no significant advantage from the use of equal parts of six different concentrates (three animal, three vegetable) as compared with the other less complex com - binations. Growth-Promotion Value of Alfalfa Meals A comparison of three grades of alfalfa meal used in chick-feeding experi - ments indicates that meals made from high-quality hay may be better for chicks than very finely ground leaf meal. When dehydrated alfalfa leaf meal was used, 5 per cent promoted a better growth rate than 10 per cent. Sixty chicks were used in each of four lots for these experiments with no mortality in any of the lots, indicating that environmental conditions were under good control. Base ration was No. 8 minus the alfalfa meal. Growth-Promoting Value of Fish-Extract Powder A by-product of the fish-canning industry made by dehydrating soluble by - products has been offered as a rich source of the vitamin G complex factors. The use of this product in an experiment with 200 Leghorn chicks in each lot indicated that it must be used very cautiously because of its severe purging action. Difficulty was also encountered in getting the caked mass of material blended with other feed ingredients. The protein level of the fish extract powder was 65.6 per cent, and both rations were adjusted to the same protein level. It is doubtful that fish extract powder will be practical as a source of proteins and vitamins for chicks. Animal Diseases Certain Phases of Swine Erysipelas These investigations have pertained almost exclusively to the character of the specific antiserum and to an analysis of data accumulated during the period 1937-40. Special attention has been given to the following details: (1) the influence of processing on serum potency, (2) an attempt to devise a less arbitrary method of grading antiserum quality, (3) the influence of serum dosage and potency on the immunity engendered after simultaneous serum- </seg>
         <seg id="p053">i ';¦•.' r Fifty-fourth Annual Report j' culture vaccination, and (4) the potency trends of sera used in vaccination . practice. . *** '. . y 1. In order to determine the influences on serum potency by the regulatory . provisions of pasteurization,: filtration, and phenolization, two young horses ; were hyperimmunized by weekly injections of broth cultures of'the swine erysipelas bacillus. After this process was completed and preliminary tests of their serum revealed a satisfactory degree of potency, monthly bleedings were made and the serum collected. Five different samples of the latter were pre - , pared for the test. These samples represented serum untreated, pasteurized, filtered, and phenolized, the fifth sample being treated by'the combination of the last three steps in the processing. A sixth sample was also tested after the addition of merthiolate as a preservative in order to determine its value as such. One of the two horses succumbed to a valvular endocarditis after the sixth bleeding, and the second one has continued in apparently good health. This part of the investigation is not yet completed and will be continued until after the 12th bleeding, when the average potency of all bleedings will be calculated. 2. The potency grading of anti-swine-erysipelas serum has thus.far de - pended on the number of test pigeons surviving in a given test series. Owing to the fact that test pigeons do not always survive or die in a regular man - ner, the determination of potency of a given serum sample had to be more or less based on arbitrary judgment. Although.this method of grading served a practical purpose well enough, it could not be accepted as scientifically ac - curate. With a view to exigencies of the experiments related above, potency averages of the different bleedings had to be determined; therefore another method.of potency grading, was devised.' This method made it possible to express antiserum potency numerically. By this method each ¦ pigeon sur - viving in a test series is accredited with a number of points in accordance with the serum dosage to which it happens to belong, as follows: :-¦-::. Serum ¦;¦;'.•;¦':¦¦ '.;' ': '¦' Number ' / .., ; dose groups ¦•/.;,: . .. ¦.-." of points !: 050 cc..:.,...:,:V.V.;.!",'. .....:.:...:.... .10 :¦¦.•¦•¦!¦.. 0.25 cc... ....-.: ;.......... -5 ¦ ,:- : -! .¦ o.io cc..............,&gt;..........::......; 2 ' \ [ OJOS cc..., ....:./..;. 1 The sum of all credits obtained in a given test series constitutes the numerical potency of the serum sample concerned. • 3. In connection with the field trials, it was found that in a number of the vaccinated; pigs the immunity thus acquired had prematurely expired. European experience in vaccination practice indicates that in simultaneous vaccination against swine erysipelas, a more lasting immunity is established when just enough serum is injected to make the procedure safe. The domestic antiserum shows a considerable degree of variance in potency, and it was deemed possible that the lapse of immunity may have been due, at least, in part, to the injection of potent serum in excessive amounts. That this may be the case seems to derive support from results obtained in connection with surviving test pigeons of which the immunity was challenged by a subsequent injection of culture. This procedure was prompted by a partially true state - ment alleging that pigeons which had survived in potency test had-failed to </seg>
         <seg id="p054">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station acquire immunity. As these attempts progressed, it became apparent that the birds which had received the smaller serum dose in the original potency tests proved to be the most resistant to a subsequent injection of culture. In order to determine whether or not this apparent phenomenon had stability or constancy the available records were subjected to analysis when data pertaining to 2,309 test pigeons had accumulated. A brief summary of these results in - dicates that: (1) The acquisition of immunity by test pigeons declines from the lower potency groups of serum to the ones of a higher numerical potency. (2) The number of pigeons surviving the immunity test declined in accordance with the volume of the serum doses injected in connection with the potency tests, the lower-dose groups showing a higher degree of immunity than the ones receiving the higher doses. (3) When in the calculations the potency groups are split in groups of 1-39 and of 40-72 numerical potency, and their influence is combined with that of serum dosage, the decline of the acquisition of immunity by test pigeons from the higher-dose groups and the more potent sera becomes conspicuously manifest. In connection with the above it should be mentioned that the division of the two potency groups is made near the line of demarcation between accept - able and nonacceptablc sera. 4. Toward the close of 1940 a sufficient amount of data had accumulated from which serum potency trends during the period 1937-40 could be deter - mined. Nearly 400 serum samples had been subjected to potency tests in the course of these years and 525 test protocols were available for analysis. This assortment of serum samples included sera of domestic and foreign origin, sera experimentally produced, as well as a number of samples from hyper - immunized swine. Referring only to serum samples of domestic origin, repre - senting such sera as were being used in Nebraska, our test showed by the more or less arbitrary method of grading that many samples not only lacked potency but there also was a conspicuous variance in potency among- the samples tested. This situation persisted during 1938 and the first six months of 1939. After that time serum potency began to improve, owing to the com - bined efforts of the Virus-Serum Control Division or the B. A. I. and of the serum-producing concerns themselves. When the numerical potencies of these sera were calculated it became pos - sible to determine in a more or less acceptable manner the general trend of serum potency as well as the degree of potency variance exhibited by our domestic products. The calculations pertaining to serum samples tested in the course of the first six months of 1939 revealed that 69.5 per cent showed numerical potencies ranging between 0 and 39, and that 305 per cent ranged between 40 and 59. A marked improvement was shown by serum samples tested in the course of the last six months of 1939 and during 1940 to date. It could be established that of these samples 20 per cent showed potencies fluctuating between 25 and 39 and that 80 per cent revealed potencies ranging between 40 and 67. The results of these calculations indicate that since the middle of 1939 entirely worthless samples were no longer encountered and that the more acceptable sera attained a higher numerical potency. </seg>

Adaptation of Small Electric Motors to Farm Use Studies of the use of electric motors up to five horsepower for various farm jobs such as feed grinding, grain elevating, and wood sawing have been con - tinued. The usual records of fineness modulus, electric energy costs, and rates ot grinding have been kept in connection with experimental livestock feeding. Automatic Water Systems As a part of cooperative studies in rural electrification with the U. S. Department of Agriculture, water meters and watt-hour meters have been installed on ten deep-well, five shallow-well, and five soft-water systems. Records are being kept of monthly meter readings from which water and electric energy consumption are computed. Cost of pumping water during periods ranging from 2 to 14 months have averaged 1.73 kilowatt-hours per 1,000 gallons per 100 feet of lift for deep-well systems; 1.44 kilowatt-hours per 1,000 gallons pumped for shallow-well systems; and 1.64 kilowatt-hours per \,OOO gaHons for soft water systems. Five automatic domestic water heaters have been metered for periods of 6 to 17 months. Quantities of water heated per month averaged 864 gallons per family. The average monthly electric energy consumption was 189.6 kilo - watt-hours. A number of the heaters are separately metered and are served at a rate of one cent per kilowatt-hour. Based on the above data the average monthly bill for domestic water heating was less than two dollars and the cost of heating the water to approximately 160° F. was less than J4 cent per gallon. Electrically Operated Refrigerators for Farm Use Watt-hour meters have been set on a total of 21 household refrigerators in use on farms, as a part of cooperative studies in rural electrification with the U. S. Department of Agriculture. These refrigerators range in size from 5.5 to 9 cubic feet. The average monthly electric-energy consumption varied from 22.2 kilowatt-hours in January, 1940, to 64.1 kilowatt-hours in July. Most of the watt-hour meter records will be continued through the summer of 1941.

         <seg id="p057">. Fifty-fourth Annual Report February, and March,. 1940, and the same number were in .operation .during the .1940-41 season. These tank-heating studies are also being carried on in cooperation with the U. S. Department of Agriculture. Average energy consumption during the 1939-40 season varied from 1.2 to 3.0 kilowatt-hours per day. All four healers were found to be generally satisfactory and a number pf requests have been received for additional information about them. , . As 1 a result of increasing interest in lead-sheathed cable for heating live - stock drinking water a question has arisen regarding the possibility of lead poisoning in livestock using the water so heated. This question has been studied in cooperation with the Bureau of Agricultural Chemistry and Engi - neering, U. S. D. A. From this study it has been learned that when soil-heating cable is operated in so-called "hard" water a protective coating is formed on the lead surface which tends to prevent the lead from going into solution. Only small [traces of lead were given off when the cable was used in water having a total hardness equal to 80 or more parts per million of calcium carbonate. Experimental data indicated that most of the lead given oil by newly installed cable.goes into solution during the first 24 hours of operation, during which time the protective coating begins to form. Rain water or soft water would be unsafe for use with a lead-covered heating element because of the absence of the salts which constitute hardness arid form the protective coating.: Agricultural Engineering Progress Report No. 7, "Tank Heater Studies," was issued in | November, 1940.

One field of 32 acres was cleaned by means of the customary clean - tillage method jusing a duck-foot cultivator. A second field of. 17.44 acres was included in the project in 1937 and this field had the bindweed eradicated in three'seasons by checking corn on the field, cultivating with a regular two-row tractolr cultivator equipped with duck-foot shovels as long as possible, following with a one-horse cultivator until frost, and supplementing the cultivation with enough '.hoeing! to keep the weeds out of the hills of corn. This field was con r sidered clean in the fall of .1939 and it was farmed in the usual manner during the 1940se'ason. A second field of 15.78 acres was included in 1938. Corn was checked oh it and tended in the same manner as described above for three seasons, 1938, 1939, and 1940. The few remaining bindweed plants at the close jof the 1940 season were chlorated and the field will be farmed in 1941. The experience on these two fields with checked corn has shown that the hand work is considerable and the greatest' drawback to the method. Where labor is available bindweed can be as effectively]eradicated with a crop of corn on theland. as by any other method of cultivation, It holds out promise to farm - ers'who have ample help; '; . ;¦'•'¦; ¦ 1 . A new field was included in the project in 1940. This field of 1655 acres was checked to corn, but every other pair of rows was left blank.

Adaptation of Insulated Electric Brooders in Uninsulated Poultry Houses Agricultural Engineering Progress Report No. 6, "Studies of Insulated Electric Brooders," was issued in January, 1940. It summarizes experimental brooding for the 1937, 1938, and 1939 seasons and includes a sketch of an insulated brooder designed to be built on the farm. This brooder has been giving excellent results and is being used on an increasing number of farms. It covers a rectangular floor area and is heated with soil-heating cable. Temperature control is by means of a wafer and snap-switch thermostat. Studies during the 1939 and 1940 seasons indicated that an 8-inch vestibule with a double canvas curtain covering the full front of the brooder tends to relieve the crowded condition within the brooder as the chicks grow larger and also oilers the chicks a choice of temperature zones for comfort. Excellent growth of chicks and good economy of operation resulted from the use of the vestibule. Studies during the 1938 and 1940 seasons indicated that ventilators of both the fan type and the flue type failed to produce observable benefits in the rectangular brooders which have a depth of two feet from cur - tain to rear wall. Cost of operation was increased by both types of ventilators. During the 1940 season a comparison was made between insulated and un - insulated brooder houses for early-season brooding. For the six-weeks period beginning February 21, two brooders operated in uninsulated houses used 30 - -40 kilowatt-hours more than similar brooders operated under similar conditions in insulated houses. Strip heaters were used with satisfactory results in one insulated brooder during the 1940 season. The use of infra-red drying lamps for brooding chicks was given a pre - liminary trial during November and December in insulated brooder houses. Indications from this preliminary work seemed to show disadvantages out - weighing advantages. When compared with the rectangular insulated brooder the use of infra-red lamps suspended from the ceiling of the brooder house seems to offer the following advantages: (1) Floor more easily cleaned. (2) Be - havior of chicks more readily observed. (3) Heating units more easily serviced. The disadvantages noted are as follows: (1) Higher operating cost. (2) Greater wattage needed per chick. (3) Chicks less comfortable in severe weatVier. The L". S. Department of Agriculture is cooperating in brooder studies. Oil Filters for Internal Combustion Engines Equipment has been built which makes it possible to compare six oil filters at the same time in their ability to remove contaminants from engine lubri - cating oil. Twenty-three different filters have been tested to date and data from the same compiled. While there is much left to be done on this project, enough has been done to indicate a wide variation in the efficiency of filters. Plotted data indicate that dirt acts as a catalyst in oil and hastens its oxidation, and that clean oil will function much' longer than dirty oil.

Rural Economics Cost of Producing Farm Crops The Experiment Station has continued to collect information from farmers upon (he "cost of performing various farm operations. During the summer of 1940 data were obtained from 112 farmers upon the cost of operating various kinds lof farm! machinery. The data obtained included cost, depreciation, shelter, repairs,! lubricants, time spent on repairs, and estimated annual use. Since some types of equipment were found on only a few farms, publication will bt postponed until additional records are secured. Some work] has been done upon the labor expense of producing sugar beets, land it is-planned to secure complete records during the coming year on sugar peet production costs. The corn production records show very clearly the relationship between the drouth and the cost per bushel of producing crops. Yield per acre is the dominant factor in the cost per bushel. Cost of Marketing Corn and Wheat by Various Methods Ai dits were obtained from 69 elevators for the year 1939. Nebraska grain elevators have 1 faced a difficult situation .in recent years. There are three principal causes for this situation: .. : 1. The acreage of grain has declined. 2. Yields per acre have averaged low as a result of the prolonged drouth. . ¦/..:. 3. The increase in freight rates in 1920 accelerated the tendency to feed grain to stock instead of selling it on the market. Ai a result of the low price of wheat, in part caused by the freight rate in - crease!, the average annual acreage sown to wheat for the ten years 1923-32 was 649,000 acres less than the acreage harvested in 1914. The acreage of corn and barley increased during these years, but the major part of these grains were fed oil the farms or purchased by a neighbor and did not pass through an elevator.

The Ex - tension Service returns to.each fanner his account book, a summary of his record and a comparison of his results with average results of other farmers in the same area.

A. E. Anderson, State and Federal Statistician, and the Omaha Livestock Exchange have given valuable cooperation on the project. The data give the various marketing expenses from the time the hogs left the local shipping point until they were sold to the packer or other buyer. Shipments by rail have decreased and shipments by truck have increased rapidly since 1930. Farm Real Estate Tax Delinquencies and Public Expenditures in Nebraska Research Bulletin 105, published in 1938, gives data for twelve counties — C.iss, Cuming, Dakota, Dawes, Frontier, Gage, Hamilton, Harlan, Lancaster, Thomas and Valley. Two other counties, Hall and Adams have been added to the list because land-use maps are available for these counties. During 1939 and 1940 tax delinquency maps have been prepared for Adams. Cass, Hall, Hamilton, and Lancaster counties for the years 1933-37. This provides tax delinquency information for these five counties for the ten consecutive years 1928-37. Farm Mortgage Foreclosures in Nebraska This project has been nearly dormant since the publication of Research Bulletin 107 in November, 1938. The project will be continued during 1941 by showing relationships between land-use classification and real estate mortgage foreclosures. Economic and Social Effects on Farms of a Definitely Designed Program of Soil Conservation Data for the four years 1935-38 were obtained from farmers in three areas of the state. The areas lie largely in Boone, Otoe, and Gage counties. The data have been tabulated and a report prepared for each area. These reports will be combined during 1941 into a manuscript suitable for publication. The financial returns on farms in each area which follow a definitely de - signed program of soil conservation arc compared with the returns from farms which do not follow a definite soil conservation program. Agricultural Credit Credit information was secured from 211 farms in Johnson county in 1939. The data have been tabulated. It is anticipated that a manuscript setting forth the information secured will be prepared during the year. Land Tenure Surveys were made during 1939 and 1940 in Clay, Hall, and Box Butte counties to obtain information upon farm tenure.

X-rays of the wrists have been taken of many of the girls in order to study the stage of maturation of the bones. A more detailed study of iron metabolism in girls of this age has been undertaken. A portion of this study dealing with the iron exchanges of four girls living on a diet containing less than 4 mg. of iron daily has been sub - mitted for publication. Another portion dealing with the iron absorption and hemoglobin response of girts who were receiving 120 mg. of iron daily from ferrous sulfate is being continued and expanded to include a study of factors other than inorganic iron which may affect hemoglobin regeneration.

Studies in Family Life A study of patterns of family life in rural Nebraska in relation to the at - titudes and personality adjustments of children is now underway. So far, 65 homes have been visited and the mothers interviewed. These families were selected on the basis of information previously obtained from the children in high school. According to this information, they had succeeded in achieving a highly desirable sort of home life, or they had definitely failed in that regard. During the interviews, information is sought regarding family customs, family group activities, attitudes and person-to-person adjustments. These data will be supplemented, wherever possible, with data from attitude scales and personality tests filled in by the parents. Scores indicating certain attitude and personality adjustments in the young people were obtained in a previous study. Plans are being worked out and materials developed for the second ap - proach to the problem in which all the families of a particular area will be studied. For many of these families, "levels of living" information and land classification and tenure history data will be available. A study of the attitudes of rural parents toward the problem of discipline and control of adolescent-age children in comparison with the attitudes of people trained in the fields of child psychology, child development and family relationships has been published in nontechnical form in Extension Circular 5-77, "Discipline or Guidance?— The Problem of Parental Control," by L.

":¦'... ..¦ . ¦ ¦ '• - : Dry-Land Crops and Tillage Al crop yields were severely requced or complete failures as a result of in - adequate and poorly distributed moisture. Subnormal precipitation the pre - vious year left cropped land with no subsoil moisture reserves. Rainfall for the April-September season of the current year was 9.81 inches, which is 33.5 per cent below the long-time average. Although good stands of winter wheat were secured, there was not sufficient moisture during April and May to sup - port growth, and injury had progressed beyond recovery before rains occurred in early June. Cropped-land small grains did not head except on plot borders and in favored locations. Some hail as well as drouth injury occurred, and no spring small-grain yields were secured even-on fallowed land. Winter wheat yields after fallow were highly variable ranging from complete failure to 27.3 bushels per acre. The average of 11.3 bushels for all plots is 43 per cent of the average winter wheat yield after fallow for the previous 29 years. Corn made satisfactory early growth; but was severely in - jured by insufficient moisture in August and September. No grain yields were secured except on fallow and in favored spots receiving flood water. Stover yields I averaged only % toil per acre. Drilled forage sorghum produced 23 tons per acre after fallow and 0.7 ton on cropped land. Early Kalo produced 5.9 bushels per,acre on cropped land and 46.4 bushels after fallow. Potatoes were a complete failure on cropped land and produced only 50 bushels per acre of culls after fallow. . M i Grass mixtures seeded in 1936, 1937, and 1938 have formed fair sod and how predominate over weed growth. In plantings made in 1939 and 1940 weeds! make the chief cover and the grasses are difficult to find. , . Severe reductions of bromegrass stands apparently caused by the 1939 drouth and winter injury, were evident in the spring of 1940. Losses were heavier in good; than in poor stands and heavier in pure stands than in mixtures with other grasses. Survival of crested wheat and western wheat grasses in pure stands and mixtures was better than of bromegrass. : </seg>
         <seg id="p066">\kBR\SKA AfiRICtXTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION Crop Varieties The stand of the winter wheat varieties planted on corn land was poor be - cause of unfavorable soil moisture at seeding time. This part of the winter wheat variety test was abandoned in the spring. The average yield of the 22 varieties grown on fallowed land was 10.9 bushels per acre. The high-yielding variety was an early Turkey selection grown for the first time.' Its yield was 14.7 bushels. The yields of Cheyenne and Nebred were 10.7 and 12.6 bushels respectively. Cheyenne has been the leading variety for the past nine years that varieties have been harvested. The average yield of Nebred is I.4.bushels less than Cheyenne for the past live years. The spring small grains emerged with good stands. A heavy freeze.(mini - mum temperature of 12°) on April 12 caused considerable killing in the oat varieties. A heavy rain and hail storm on [une 12 ruined these variety tests. 1 Ceres, the leading variety of spring wheat, has been grown since 1925 and his" Test plots at the North Platte Substation: on the left, winter wheat after fallow; on the right, continuously crapped. ¦&#132;..,.., } ... averaged 14.9 bushels for the 13 years harvested.

An Atlas x Vaughn selection has been a leading barley variety in several station tests over the Western Great Plains and this year was named Beecher. This new variety will be best adapted in areas where Club Mariout is now grown. Beecher was the leading barley variety in the field plots and nursery in 1939 arid ranked in second' place in the nursery in 1940. For an eight-year period, Spartan, Club Mariout, arid North Platte No. 1 have been the leading barley varieties. Brunker has been thcTlead - ing variety of oats grown since 1924.

Two new oat varieties, a Trojan x Victoria selection and a Richland x Fulghum selection, have been grown in the nursery for the past two years and look quite promising as early, drouth-resistant, and rust-resistant varieties. Twelve varieties of grain sorghums grown on fallowed land averaged 28.8 bushels, and 3.8 bushels on land previously cropped to oats. The high-yielding variety after fallow was Day with a yield of 32.9 bushels, and Early Kalo and Improved Goes yielded 25.7 and 313 bushels respectively. For a four-year period, the average yield of Day is 33.3 bushels as compared with 26.8 bushels for Early Kalo. Special attention is being given to the production of pure seed of some of the commercial sorghum varieties grown now in the state. Leoti, Early jSumac, and Black Amber have been the leading forage sorghums grown under dry land conditions. . • Two irrigated corn hybrid tests were conducted. One test was planted on a farm near Sutherland. The high-yielding hybrid averaged 99.1 bushels and the low one averaged 63.4 bushels. Four open-pollinated varieties aver - aged 76.4 bushels, or 10.5' bushels and 14 per cent less than the average of the 24 commercial hybrids. The leading hybrid in the test at North Platte yielded 93.9 bushels and the low one 59.6 bushels. The four varieties averaged 76.4 bushels, the same as in the Sutherland test. . The comrhercial^hybrids averaged 81.7 bushels, or 7 per cent more than the average of the varieties. A late fall favored late maturing hybrids and for this reason results of the current year may be misleading as a guide in deter - mining those best suited to the region..

Seepage from the Sutherland Project canals and reservoir has caused a progressive rise; in bench-land wells during the past two years. By December, 1940, water in the Substation irrigation well was 3 feet 8 inches above the highest level recorded previous to the beginning of this rise. To meet the changed condition, the. direct-connected motor-driven centrifugal pump was replaced, by a single-stage turbine with motor above ground. On account of delays due to this change, irrigation was not begun until June 13. To October 28, the pump.was operated on 110 days for 1404 hours. A total of 3,017 acre inches of water was applied to 139.2 acres of land. Operating costs, including $39756 for 17,; 380 kw.-hr. of electric current and J146.64 for labor, totaled $544.60, making the operating cost per acre inch of water 18.05 cents. The addition o£ $300 for fixed costs brings the total cost per acre inch of water to </seg>
         <seg id="p068">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station approximately 28 cents and the average per acre cost of the land irrigated to $6.06. The amount of water used per acre, averaging 21% inches, is due to the unusually dry season and also to about one-third o£ the irrigated acreage being newly seeded alfalfa. Costs of increased production resulting from irrigation were: for potatoes, 5.25 cents per bushel; for Atlas sorgo ensilage, 36 cents per ton; for Leoti Red sorgo ensilage, 52 cents per ton. Fall irrigation at the average rate of 143 inches per acre was applied on 40 acres of pastures, alfalfa, and cropped land. A second pump was operated on land under lease. In this case, a turbine pump and 30 hp. fuel-oil power plant are in use. Operating costs including fuel, oil, and labor amounted to 15.3 cents per acre inch. This was the total irrigation cost, as the Substation has no capital investment in the plant. Costs of increased production in this case were: for Leoti Red sorgo ensilage, 30.6 cents per ton; for corn ensilage. 44.4 cents per ton; for grain sorghum with one irrigation before planting. 10.7 cents per bushel; for corn, 8 cents per bushel: tor alfalfa, 52.74 per ton. Beef Cattle Four lots of short-age yearling heifers with an average initial weight of approximately 530 pounds were fed for 175 days on a basal ration of grain. The heifers were started on ground ear corn. Ground rye and ground threshed Kalo were then added and the ear corn gradually dropped from the ration. Later ground shelled corn was substituted for the rye and Kalo. Six per cent of the total grain fed was ground ear corn, 21 per cent ground rye, 23 per cent ground Early Kalo, and 50 per cent ground shelled corn. For roughage, the four lots were fed alfalfa hay, silage made from Atlas and Leoti sorgo, sowed sorghum hay, and cut Leoti stover. The three lots of heifers fed carbonaceous roughage were fed an average of 1.18 pounds soy - bean pellets and 0.08 pound of mineral mixture per head daily, and the heifers fed alfalfa hay were fed an average of 0.20 pound of soybean pellets per head daily. The heifers fed alfalfa hay gained from 0.14 to 0.19 pound per head daily more than the other heifers and at the conclusion of the trial appeared fatter. They sold at the same price as the heifers fed sowed sorghum and 25 cents per hundred above the other two lots. Slaughter and carcass data indicated no clear advantage for any one of the lots above the others. All of the rations were satisfactory and produced acceptable market cattle. (North Platte Sub - station Progress Report No. 20 can be obtained by writing to the North Platte Substation.) Five lots of steer calves with an average initial weight of 444 pounds were wintered on a basal ration of silage, 1.0 pound of soybean pellets, and 0.08 pound of mineral mixture per head daily. In addition to the basal ration, four of these lots were fed an average of 5.86 pounds of grain per head daily. The grain was supplied in the form of ground shelled corn, ground threshed Early Kalo, ground Early Kalo heads which contained an average of 73 per cent grain, and ground Early Kalo fodder which contained 43.75 per cent grain. The fifth lot received only the basal ration. </seg>
         <seg id="p069">• Fifty-fourth Annual Report The addition of 5.86 pounds of grain to the basal ration increased the rate of gain by 0.56 to 0.68 pound with the corn producing somewhat more rapid gains than the Early Kalo. • ¦ . Ground Early Kalo heads and fodder as used in this trial were satisfactory in every way. As fed in this trial, ground threshed Early Kalo was worth 94 per cent as much as ground shelled corn, ground Early Kalo heads were worth 75 per cent as much as ground threshed Early Kalo, and 100 pounds of ground Early Kalo fodder were worth as much as 44 pounds of ground threshed Early Kalo and 145 pounds of silage. (North Platte Substation Progress Report No. 23 contains a report of this trial.) ':' : . Atj the conclusion of a 175-day wintering period, the four lots of calves referred to above were redivided into four lots. The lot wintered on the basal ration was continued intact. The five lots were gradually brought to a full feed of grain. They were started on ground threshed Early Kalo and ground rye, and gradually changed to corn. All lots were fed silage for 56 days and prairie hay thereafter. : . \ . ¦¦¦ .. &lt;•' ' The four well-wintered lots were fed protein supplements as follows: Lot 1, 1.46 pounds cottonseed meal; Lot 2, 4.86 pounds alfalfa; Lot 4, 1.46 pounds expeller-process soybean oil meal; and Lot 5, 1.46 pounds of 44 per cent toasted soybean oil meal per head daily. All lots were fed a mineral mixture at the rate of 0.08 pound per head daily. The lot of calves wintered on the basal ration) alone (Lot 3) was fed the same as Lot 2. Lot 3 was fed for 214 days and the other four lots for 165 days. Trie steers wintered on the basal ration and fed for 214 days made 100 pounds of gain; on about P/V bushels of grain less than the other steers and compared very well with them from a market standpoint. Handling them in this way involved keeping them 49 days longer than the well wintered calves. Ofj the four lots which were well wintered and then full-fed for 165 days, the two lots fed soybean oil meal gained slightly more than the other two lots and sold at $12.75 and $13.00 per hundred compared with $12.50 per hundred for the steers fed cottonseed meal and $12.60 for the steers fed alfalfa.

The other three were fed ground Atlas fodder instead of silage. The silage and fodder were not directly comparable. In addition to the basal ration, one lot in each series was fed an average of 2.62 pounds of ground rye, and one lot an average of 5.24 pounds of ground rye per head daily. • . ' . ¦ •"¦.. The addition of 2.62 pounds of ground rye to the basal ration raised the average daily gain from 1.19 pounds per head to 1.64 pounds, and the addition of 5.24 pounds of rye to the ration increased the average daily gain to 1.87 pounds. Using the calves fed the basal ration only as a standard for comparison, each bushel of ground rye fed the calves at the rate of 2.62 pounds per head daily saved 8 pounds of soybean pellets, 82 pounds of ground Atlas fodder, and </seg>

Each bushel of ground rye fed the calves at the rate of ¦5.24 pounds per head daily saved 6 pounds of soybean pellets, 74 pounds of ground Adas fodder, and 164 pounds of silage. At the conclusion of the wintering period, the six lots of calves were placed on native grass pasture without grain for 84 days. Grass was poorer and pas - lure gains lower than usual. By the close of the pasture period, a part of the advantage of feeding grain in the winter was lost. These steers were placed on feed in dry lot at the end of the grazing period. (Final results will be avail - able at the conclusion of the trial in North Platte Substation Progress Report Swine Work in cooperation with the Bureau of Animal Industry, U.S.D.A., through the Regional Swine Breeding Laboratory, was continued. Apparently progress in developing the six inbred lines of swine being carried at the Sub - station was continued without noticeable loss of desirable characteristics. Test litters from the 1939 fall crop of pigs required from 309 pounds to 429 pounds of teed per hundred pounds of gain from weaning to final weight of ap - proximately 225 pounds, with an average feed requirement of 362 pounds. For the 1940 spring pigs, the range in feed requirement per hundred pounds ot gain was 307 pounds to 439 pounds with an average of 367 pounds. Dairy Cattle The Holstein herd was continued on twice-a-day milking and produced an average of approximately 470 pounds of fat for each cow in the herd. Alfalfa pasture and pastures of native and cultivated grasses were used for summer pasture for the milking herd. North Platte Substation Progress Report No. 22, giving a brief summary of observations made at the Substation on pasturing alfalfa with both beef and dairy cattle, was issued during the year. Horses The purebred herd of Percheron horses was continued. In a 100-day trial comparing cracked corn and cracked Early Kalo for growing horses, horses fed corn made larger gains and carried more flesh at the close of the test than horses ted Early Kalo. The horses fed Early Kalo were in satisfactory condi - tion at the close of the trial. Poultry Participation in the Nebraska Flock Testing Project was continued. Breed - ing work with White Rocks and White Leghorns was also continued. Studies of results between breeding from pullets and old hens; and on the progeny testing of cockerels were initiated. Scottsbluff Substation The Scottsbluff Substation is conducted cooperatively by the Nebraska Agri - cultural Experiment Station and the Division of Western Irrigation Agricul - ture, U. S.

Other important work includes pasturing o£ sweet clover, tests of corn hybrids, and tests o£ sorghum varieties. Work conducted by the central Station at Lincoln is also included here on a cooperative basis. Cooperative work is also done by the Divisions of Forage Crops, kugar Plants, and Agricultural Engineering, of the U. S. Department of Agriculture. . Precipitation during 1940 amounted to 11.26 inches, compared with a 31 - -year mean of 13.57 inches. Growing-season precipitation amounted to 8.14 inches as compared with the 31-year mean of 11.05 inches. May and June were unusually dry. Farmers under government ditches received only 0.49 foot of water per acre. This limited supply supplemented.by fairly abundant early - spring and late-fall precipitation resulted in very satisfactory crops, particularly sugar beets and potatoes. The frost-free period during 1940 was the longest recorded in 30 years..- • ' '_--'' ;v: ;¦¦; - .-"; ;.; .;- ; :¦ Crop Rotations During the past year, 38 crop rotations were in operation at the Scottsbluff Substation, and |31 of these were started in 1912. In 1937, four rotations, in - cluding* applications of phosphate; were started. The rotation experiments have been planned to determine the influence of farm manure, alfalfa, pastured sweet clover, and applications of phosphate on the yields of irrigated crops. In the rotations where farm manure has been applied, or where alfalfa has been grown,! or where sweet clover has been pastured, the yields of crops have been significantly higher than in rotations where these practices have not been followed, both during 1940, and for the 23-year period. During the 23-year period, manure!has increased the yield of sugar beets 8.6 tons, the yield of potatoes 93.8 btishels, and the yield of oats 22.2 bushels. During the same period,) alfalfa has increased the yields of sugar beets 5.8 tons, potatoes 135.1 bushels', oats 28.8 bushels, and corn 22.4 bushels. And also during the 23-year period,) alfalfa and manure have increased the yield of sugar beets 9.4 tons per acre, pbtatoes 151.6 bushels, and oats 32.6 bushels. During a 21-year period pasturing sweet clover has increased the yield of sugar beets 7.8 tons and the yield of oats 13.7 bushels. Hybrid Corn The hybrid corn test has been carried on to determine the value of the commercial hybrids that are being sold in the Valley and also to determine the parent (strains, which, when crossed, will result in the most satisfactory hybrid, or hybrids, forjthis territory. ; During 1940 the work involved a replicated test including 16 experimental hybrids. 11 commercial hybrids, and 3 open-pollinated varieties, and an ob - servation test including 54 experimental hybrids, and as a check, two plots of the commercial hybrid, lowa 939. The mean yield of the experimental hybrids was ¦¦1GJ9.6 bushels per acre, from the commercial hybrids 104.8 bushels, and from t!le openrpoUinated varieties 85.1 bushels.' ...;.: . • I Sorghum Varieties The sorghum variety test conducted during 1940 included 4 forage - sorghuW varieties and 13 grain-sorghum varieties.

Leoti Red appears to be the out - standing variety of forage sorghum for the North Plane Valley. During 1940 it produced green forage at the rate of 15.4 tons per acre, and grain at the rate ot 64 bushels per acre. Leoti Red is somewhat later in maturing than Black Amber, but is superior in yield of both green forage and grain. Early Sumac produced forage at the rate of 16.4 tons per acre, and grain at the rate ot 43.. b.ishcls per acre. Atlas produced green forage at the rate of 20.3 tons per acre. This variety appears to be too late for conditions in the North Platte \ alley, and also appears to be highly vulnerable to damage by birds ¦i? f^n'u'Ti 1 K? in sor«hum varieties, Sooner Milo produced the highest yield of 60 bushels of grain per acre. This variety was followed by Day with 59 bushels, Kilo with 57.2 bushels, Colby with 56.2 bushels, and Early Kalo with 53./ bushels. These five varieties of grain sorghum appear to be very satisfactory for conditions in the North Platte Valley.

A major improvement was the filling in of yards and drive and the application of two cars of gravel under a W.P.A. project. Minor improvements consisted of painting, extending water pipes, and rebuilding fences. The only project conducted in cooperation with the U. S. Department of Agriculture is the work with dual-purpose cattle. 'Wintering Range Calves . , . Cor tinuing the project with winter rations for calves which are to be sold off grass as feeder yearlings, six lots of 430-pound heifer calves were placed on a 168-day winter and a 160-day summer trial. This completed a five-year comparison of soybean oil meal and cottonseed cake as supplements to prairie hay. In producirig a winter gain one pound of cottonseed cake per day showed a 26-poiind advantage. However, the calves which had been fed one pound of soybean oil meal per day during the winter gained a little faster on grass but at marketing time still lacked 14 pounds of making as much total gain as 1 did the jcottonseed-cake lot. The feeding' of steamed bone meal (ad libitum) with soybean oil meal produced gains {equal.to the cottonseed-cake lot. Calves wintered on soybean oil meal plus 0.1 pound daily of a mixture of steamed bone meal, ground lime - stone, and salt mixture (40-40-20) gained 4 pounds more than did the cotton - seed-cake lot. ¦ | '.-¦¦'. The benefit derived from feeding mineral with cottonseed cake was small, an average of 65 pounds for two feeding trials. Calves wintered on prairie hay and 1 pound of expeller-soybean oil meal made the same gain as those on solvent-process meal. : Milking Shorthorns Six een cows completed a lactation period during the past year averaging 5,084.5} pounds of milk and 201.8 pounds of fat in 294 days. The range in fat production was from 108.9.t0 337.6 pounds. Six of the 16 head were two - year-old heifers, that averaged 194.5 pounds of fat. The amount of feed re - quired per pound of fat was 7 pounds of grain, 19 pounds of hay, and 31 pounds of silage. . I !. ! </seg>
