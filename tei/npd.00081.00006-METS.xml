            <seg id="p003">DIVISION OF FIRE PREVENTION LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL ' ' !■ • ' ' ■• To His Exceller cy, Roy L. Cochran, Governor of th ; State of Nebraska. Lincoln, Nebraska. Honored Sir: I have the honor of presenting for your consideration the Twenty- Seventh Annua Report of the Department of Fire Prevention, in ac - cordance with the laws of the State of Nebraska relating to powers and duties of the State Fire Marshal. Your manifest interest in the work of the department and in the cause of fire prevention has been very encouraging to the personnel of the department, and I take this opportunity of expressing our ap - preciation of y&gt;ur interest and help. Permit m« to call your attention to the financial status of the department. V r hile the income from the insurance companies does not equal the expenses for the year, you will note there has been a mate - rial reduction in the operating expenses, and, we believe, without a " • material decres se in its activities and accomplishments. Respectfully submitted, Horace M. Davis, State Fire Marshal. February 15, 1936. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">STATE OP NEBRASKA THE DEPARTMENT'S FINANCIAL STATUS The sole income of the Department of;Fire Prevention is derived from an assessment of three-eighths of one per cent of the gross income of stock fire insurance companies and foreign companies doing business in the state, and one-eighth of one per cent of like income of domestic mutuals. The law provides that the state shall not be liable for any of the expenses of the department. The income of the department is about 'two-thirds of what it was at the peak in 1923. There has been a gradual increase in the last three years. The income for 1935 exceeded the income for 1934 by $780.54, while the operating expenses of the department were $5,063.71 less than those of 1934. There is a balance in the (funds of the de - partment as of Januray 1, 1936, of $5,270.22. A comparison of the financial statement of 1935 with that of 1934 reveals the following facts: 1934 1935 Income from Insurance Companies $15,072.20 $15,852.74 Increase $ 780.54 Salaries $13,100.00 $10,594.65 Decrease $2,505.35 Office Operating Expenses 1,787.11 1,324.02 Decrease 463.09 Field Expenses 6,805.82 4,960.55 Decrease 1,845.27 Fire Reports 1,115.00 865.00 Decrease 250.00 Total Decrease in Expenses $5,063.71 The expenses of the department for the year 1935 were $2,144.48 greater than the income. In 1934 the expenses exceeded the income by $7,625.73. - The state law provides that the department of fire prevention shall pay fire chiefs $1 for each satisfactory fire report, but specifically prohibits this payment if the fire chief is receiving a salary of more than $50 a year. Following this prohibition on the department, there were 19 fire chiefs that were not vouchered for payment for reports for 1935 that had been paid in previous years.

There were fifteen school fires reported by fire chiefs. Eight of these were public schools in cities and villages, five were rural schools and two parochial schools. The value of the school buildings and contents as given by the fire chiefs was $720,685, and they were insured for $502,500. The total loss to buildings and contents amounted to $99,160. There was complete loss in six of the school fires. Three school buildings at In - man burned in one fire and the loss was almost complete. The loss at Elgin on their school building was given as $63,750 ? which was almost a complete loss. Three rural school buildings were complete losses, and in two others the losses were almost complete. </seg>

UNKNOWN FIRES INVESTIGATED The decreased number of investigations requested, and made, during 1935 leads to the conclusion that there is a general improve - ment in law observance on the part of Nebraska citizens. Business conditions have been better, there has been less unemployment than during the peak of the depression. Insurance companies have done a better job of underwriting. Known convictions for arson and vigorous investigations geographically distributed have had a notable influence. About one-half of the requests for investigations have come from local officers and the remainder have been requested by fire insur - ance companies. Each request has been complied with. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">DIVISION OF FIRE PREVENTION Seventy-nine fires of unknown origin in forty-two counties have been investigated by the state fire marshal's office, not including Om - aha but in Douglas county outside of Omaha. Thirty-four have been rural fires and forty-five in cties and villages. Numter of Fires Investigated 79 Purely Accidental Origin 12 Inexcusable Carelessness 14 Unknown, insufficient evidence to warrant conclusions : 3 Presumed Arson, Evidence Intangible 17 Incenjdiary 33 por Insurance 22 For Malice 11 Thirteen :onfessions were obtained out of 20 accused. One sent by relatives to insane hospital. Eight sentenced to penitentiary or reformatory. Five Parolled by Courts. Three dismissed at preliminary hearing. Thre &gt; pending court action. One before the supreme court. Two awaiting district court sentence. Allowing for duplications in occupancies, stock and buildings, Stock fire companies carried insurance in 51 cases. Mutual fire insurance companies carried insurance in 30 cases. Stocic and mutual companies carried insurance in 11 cases. No insurance in 9 cases. ARSON NEVER OUTLAWS One case confirmed by the supreme court was a 1930 fire. One case! two confessions, was for a 1931 farm fire. Two cases, each parolled, involved low mentality. Three children in very poor family confessed a church fire. Blood hounds were used in three cases, one successfully. OMAHA ARSON SQUAD The state department has assumed no responsibility for Omaha fires of unquestionable origin since the organization by the fire de - partment of an arson squad. It consists of two full time men equipped with automobiles, radio and photographic appliances. About twenty suspected persons have been detained for questioning, with eight ar - rests and four held for district court for trials. Note: One convic - tion on 1935 fire. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">STATE OF NEBRASKA FIRE PREVENTION WEEK Fire Prevention Week is nationally on that week in October that commemorates the beginning of the great Chicago fire, October 8, 1871. j It is an especially appropriate time in Nebraska because it fol - lows the early autumn frosts which have dried the grass and weeds. Heating stoves and furnaces are about to be ured during the cool mornings and evenings. Schools have gotten nicely organized. During this particular week attention is given by firemen, by in - surance experts, by civic clubs and especially by schools and parent - teacher groups to forefending against accidental fires. All of the field men and office force of the state fire marshal's office devote all of Fire Prevention Week toward educational means for saving lives and property. During the past, year this office has dis - tributed literature to schools and firemen, who, in many cases, ar - ranged attractive and informative displays in their communities. The men of the office addressed more than 40 audiences by radio and other - wise, giving particular attention to schools and public buildings. The 150 members of the State Firo Prevention Association were active in inspection work and salaried and volunteer firemen used every legitimate means to attract public attention to the need of utilizing the open autumn weather to prevent the fire hazards that arc always apt to be in evidence in the winter time. . Fire Prevention Measures should, of course, be pursued intelli - gently every week of the year but immediate results are apparent when the public is made fire-conscious by the intensive work of Fire Prevention Week. LESSONS FOR FIRE DEPARTMENTS Mr. Criswell of the Ohio Fire Prevention Department has pre - pared a set of lessons for firemen to study at their meetings. This department has secured the privilege of using them in Nebraska. Let - ters were sent to the fire chiefs explaining how the lessons may be used and asking whether they cared to have them for their fire de - partment. Twenty-six fire chiefs replied asking for the lessons and 425 copies are being sent out monthly. These lessons are mimeo - graphed in this office. </seg>
            <seg id="p013">I DIVISION OF FIRE PREVENTION INSPECTION OF PUBLIC BUILDINGS Perhaps tie most effective work of the department is least ap - parent. Inspe;tions are made of public buildings in every town bi - ennially or of t :ner. Deputy State Fire MarsRals, usually accompanied by the fire chief or a member of the fire department, inspect public and commercial buildings, such as stores, schools, hotels, apartment houses, rooming houses, halls and theaters for possible fire hazards. Possibly 1he electric system is overloaded or out of repair; rub - bish or cobwebs collected in the basement or attic; combustibles or explosive liquids stored, in buildings in larger quantities than is al - lowed by law; doors to public buildings may swing inward instead of outward, and nay be devoid of panic bar locks; the projection booths in theaters miy be improperly constructed; perhaps an old building of use to nobody may be a fire hazard to life and neighboring property. When su ;h conditions are found, orders are issued to remove the hazard. Many objectionable conditions are removed while the inspector is 8 ill in town. For the changes that require more time, written orders are issued, and when the owner has complied, he sends the word to the office where it is checked with the copy of the order filed by the i ispector. Copies of the orders are left with local fire chiefs who ac . as follow-up men for the department and report com - pliances to th ! office. For convenience in inspection work, the state is divided into three districts, the northeast, the southeast and the west parts, under the respective chrrges of H. N. Downing, L. J. Henning and N. H. Mock - enhaupt. All state institutions are inspected annually. During 1935 the inspectors visited 329 towns as compared to 235 in 1934. There is nothing spectacular about the work of the inspector. He is fighting the fires before they start. PASSING ALONG THE FIRE ALARM Several village fires have run into heavy losses because fire sirens have been frjzen up, boll cords broken or other alarm apparatus out of order. Several farm properties could have been saved if telephones had been installed and in working condition. Telephones are highly important in calling the fire department. </seg>
            <seg id="p014">STATE OF NEBRASKA THE DANGERS IN VOLATILE FLUIDS The increasing amount of gasoline, kerosene, distillate and trac - tor fuels is being brought into the state by motor driven trucks. Some of the transport trucks are in poor condition and have been found to leak from one compartment to another, thus mixing different classes of the liquids. More than half of the volatile fuels used in the south - ern and central parts of the state is trucked in through ports of entry. State laws are inadequate to regulate the kind and condition of truck tanks, the ages and hours of drivers and the safe handling of the "liquid dynamite." The Federal Transport Act of 1935 has recently gone into effect and better conditions are hoped for. Early in the spring of 1935, there was an epidemic of firels in connection with chicken brooders that were heated with kerosene Stoves. Investigation proved that in many cases there was enough gasoline mixed into the kerosene to make the fuel unsafe for use in stoves or hand lamps. One fire chief tells of a farmer buying fifty gallons of kerosene and five gallons of gasoline and mixing them immediately for domestic use. Another chief was visiting at the home of a friend when the friend poured a cupful of gasoline into a gallon of kerosene which he put into the container of the kitchen stove. He explained that it "pepped up" the kerosene. An oil dealer who accdentally mixed kerosene and distillate un - loaded his "mistake" on a hospital on the theory that it was a high test fuel oil. A too-young driver unloaded two barrels of high test gasoline into an outside residence tank of distillate. The customer discovered the error before an explosion occurred. A young woman on a farm near Holdrege lost her life through using kerosene that later tested at 17 percent gasoline. Serious results continue to follow the careless use of unpainted containers for holding gasoline and of using red containers for kero - sene. Buyers and sellers are equally liable for fines for this practice. THE MOST SERIOUS MENACE TO LIFE AND PROPERTY IS CARELESSNESS IN USING AND HANDLING GASOLINE AND KEROSENE. </seg>
            <seg id="p015">DIVISION OP FIRE PREVENTION CHECKING ARCHITECTS' PLANS Because an architect and a school board failed to submit plans and blue prints for a new school building, a subsequent inspection for fire hazaids necessitated a $2,200 alteration program. Plans for nine new school houses have been submitted and checked at the office. Four remodelings have been examined and approved. We have been particularly careful about plans for theaters and pro - jection booths. Three theaters have been approved with necessary alterations. Danger from direct burning is not so serious a menace as a panic that is apt to result in the knowledge that the building is on fire. All doors to public buildings must open outward to give occu - pants free egress to the out of doors. Panic locks on school build - ings, theaters and hotels are essential. A false alarm in a dance hall hurried eight occupants to hospitals because of inadequate exits. The offi&lt; e will promptly examine blue prints sent in by mail and return to architects or property owners. Expert examination of dif - ficult plans is available for the assistance of the fire marshal's office. "SUSPECT" FILE Going b ick over the records of investigations made by the office since it was organized, there has been developed a card index contain - ing the names of all persons involved in questionable fires for some - thing over tventy years. A card index is kept of current fires. If John Jones seems to be having more fires than are easily accounted for, say three fires in two years, his name is also added to the "suspect 1 ' file for possible future convenience. These fi es are open to all inquirers and are frequently consulted, often by telephone, by underwriters before binding a fire risk. COMPRESSED GAS INSTALLATION The Na.ional Board of Fire Underwriters is admittedly the best" technical authority on safe practices to prevent fires. The fire engin - eers require that no compressed gas tanks used for fuel shall be in - stalled within a building or its basement. All recognized appliances bear the Underwriters' label. Certain appliances are being sold and installed in violation of the Underwriters' code. There is no Ne - braska law to govern. </seg>
            <seg id="p016">STATE OF NEBRASKA CITY INSPECTIONS BY NEBRASKA FIRE PREVENTION ASSOCIATION The Nebraska Fire Prevention Association is made up largely of the field men for the fire insurance companies doing business in the state. Upon invitation of local chambers' of commerce, the association members gather at a town and spend one or two days inspecting pub - lic and commercial properties. Especial emphasis is given to school buildings and talking to school children about fire prevention. The last evening is usually devoted to a dinner with business men when a report of the general condition is made and ways and means of better - ment are discussed. Early in the year such an inspection was made at Fremont. The Fire Marshal's office followed through with two inspectors spending several weeks on the worst hazards, and return - ing from time to time to assist the local firemen in cleaning up ob - jectionable properties. As a result Fremont's fire loss for 1935 was held down to $1.07 per capita, as against a five-years average per capita loss of $5.49. Similar inspections are planned for lt)3fi under the leadership of President Gordon Beals and Secretary Paul Barr, each of Omaha. SUTTON FIRE TRUCKS BURN December 3, 1935, the city of Sutton suffered a complete loss of its light and power plant. The city building housed the apparatus of the volunteer fire department and water pumping system. The loss is given as $23,500. The building was constructed about fifteen years ago of concrete blocks. The cause of the fire is unknown. At the time discovered the city council was meeting in one part of the build - ing. The city was without electric current for several days until a transmission line could be built in. The fire was discovered about 8:30 in the evening. By midnight the plant was a complete loss. The city council in session called the Iowa-Nebraska Power Company asking when it would be able to get a line into Sutton. The next day a contract was signed and work on the line from Grafton, ten miles away, was completed and current supplied ready for use Sunday night. A Sub-station was built on the edge of town and a half mile of line was constructed to the central point of the distribution system. Assistance in building was given by the Hastings municipal plant. Apparatus for fire defense is being restored and the morale of the volunteer fire department is unimpaired. </seg>
            <seg id="p017">DIVISION OF FIRE PREVENTION DEMONSTRATION OF FIRE HAZARDS A demon itvation of fire hazai'ds was given at the state fair grounds during the week of the fair and drew its share of attention. A lec - ture was given in connection with the exhibit calling the attention of the people to the different ways that fires might be started and sug - gesting preve itive measures. . Hazards in defective electric wiring, overloading the electric sys - tem, the efFei-t? of pennies behind fuses, gasoline and kerosene ex - plosions, vividly displaying the facts about causes and effects of such explosions, si arting fires with kerosene, dust explosions and many others were shown. _ j The exhibition has been made available to organizations that may wish to use it and it has been shown and the lecture given before twenty-four ilifTerent groups of people, such as civic clubs, firemen's meetings and schools in various parts of the state. ANALYSIS OF RURAL FIRES AS REPORTED BY FIRE CHIEFS. There were 300 rural fires reported by fire chiefs with a total valuation of 5(&gt;5G.G23. Of the 399 buildings, insurance was carried on 208 to the j.mount of $415,955, and there was a loss of $428,144. This is a loss of 65% of the value of the buildings. There v ere contents in .'558 of the buil.'ing.s that were involved in fires on which a value of §252,085 was given and on which insur - ance was carried to the amount of .$12-1,947, with a loss of $144,490. This is a loss of 57&lt;^f of the value of the contents. In fires where thei-e was a total oss of buildings, the contents were partly or entirely re - moved in lYuny cases. In 2(5!) of the 309 fires, there was a total loss of the buildi igs, and of the 358 fires in which contents were involved, there was a ■ otal loss in 175 of them. VENTING GASOLINE STORAGE TANKS Just as rapidly as it can be done filling stations must raise :the - vent pipes t&lt;* their storage tanks to eight or more feet in heighth. The tops shall open into free air currents. Gasoline fumes are three times as heavy as air, hence cling to the ground and are easily exploded by backfiring n otor cars. A new federal law sets out details for install - ing vent pi les. State inspectors may padlock stations refusing to comply. </seg>
            <seg id="p018">STATE OF NEBRASKA VOLUNTEER FIREMEN ORGANIZED During: 1935 there have been organized three district associations of volunteer fire departments. These districts include from one to several counties. This office has ready for distribution a suggested form of constitution for groups that may wish help in organizing such associations. It is also ready to meet with any group to give possible assistance. ANNUAL MEETING OF FIREMEN'S ASSOCIATION The Nebraska State Volunteer Firemen's Association will meet in annual session at Columbus on October 20, 21, and 22, 1936. A good program is in process of development. The following are the present officers of the Association : President, Cliff Galley, Columbus. 1st. Vice President, Fayette H. Wood, Seward. 2nd. Vice President, Carl E. Werner, Battle Creek. Sec'y-Treas., Louis A. Novak, Norfolk. Chaplain, Walter C. Rundin, Wahoo. All business of importance that comes before the convention of the State Association is first referred to the executive committee before final action is taken. The following compose the executive committee: Ed. Matthiesen, Chairman, Blair. John W. Guthrie, Alliance. Harry E. Sullivan, Omaha. Fred Coons, Bridgeport. Paul V. Swearingen, Milford. A. W. Frischholz, Columbus. J. F. Geesen, Seward. = . .' A survey of the reports from fire chiefs shows that 76% of the number of buildings involved in fires were insured at an average of 73 % of their value. The contents were insured in only half the cases but 70% of their values was covered by insurance. </seg>
            <seg id="p019">DIVISION OF FIRE PREVENTION AN EXPLANATION A differ&lt; nt plan has been used this year in reporting valueSj in - surance and losses. A record has been kept of the reports from fire insurance conpanies which has not, heretofore, been done. The final records show the combined data from fire chiefs and from insurance companies. n the table of losses in the 34 cities with a population of 2,500 and ov« r, the two groups are given separately and then combined in the last three columns. In the tible, "Fire Losses By Counties", the data from the two sources have been combined, and the "contents" and "buildings" have also been conbined, which have been given separately in previous re - ports. In the first four columns the data for all fires have been given and in the last four columns, the data regarding rural fires. This is the first time that rural fires have been reported separately. Because of the fact that fire losses reported by insurance com - panies, that fiavc not been reported by fire chiefs, are included, the number of fires reported this year is 5,048 compared to about 2,000 in previous years. It should be stated that the reports by insurance companies, tlat have not been reported by fire chiefs, are generally small and on ; nost of them the fire departments have not been called. REPORTS FROM FIRE INSURANCE COMPANIES The reports that have come from insurance companies during the year have bei;n checked and classified. One class contains all of the losses reported paid by insurance companies and another class, the losses paid on fires that have not been reported by fire, chiefs. The latter class consists mainly of small losses on most of which the fire departments were not called. It should be understood that all the losses for the year 1935 have not yet been paid so the reports given by insurance companies are in - complete. Some of the losses may not be adjusted for several months. The total losses paid in Nebraska for 1935 fires up to February 15, 1936, were $ :., 084,024. 18. The losses paid on fires that were not re - ported by firt: chiefs amounted to $180,269.10. A large majority of the claims paid that were not reported by fire chiefs were less than $5. The total number of claims paid was 5,048. </seg>

There were 232 such fires reported during the year. Nearly all of them were in cities and villages. Only 25 were reported from rural districts. It is possible hat all rural motor vehicle fires have not been reported. It is necessarj to depend upon the reports from fire chiefs in the cities and villages and it is often difficult for them to secure the information even if they 1 ear about them. The valu i of motor vehicles involved in fires was $98,956, in - surance carried, $57,632, with a gross loss of $40,118. This is 40 per - cent of the va ue of the motor vehicles. Of the 232 motor vehicle fires, there was a total loss in 50 cases. Of the 25 ruial motor vehicle fires, there was a total loss in 20 cases. The percental ;e of total loss in all cases of motor vehicle fires was 2\r/ c , but of ;he 25 rural fires, there was a total loss in 80% of the cases. Insurance was carried on 127 of the 232 motor vehicles involved in fires, or 54 % of the cars and trucks were insured. </seg>
