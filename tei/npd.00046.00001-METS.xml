Highways and Drainage: li in (lentlemen Dunns; the past Biennial the gaging of streams has been jnder the direct supervision of Water Superintendent District No. 1, and the result of gaging and river investigation are set forth in the report [iled b) Ml Willis. Wi:h reference to gaging ditches and the distribution of water, I would recommend that our laws be amended so as to compel all ditches using water to install recording meters in the rating flume of each head- 1 wouU: like to call your spec.al attention to the report filed by Dr. Condra on Road Material. This report shows considerable work and is une ol ilit- most valuable bulletins on road building. he 1917 Session of the Legislature appropriated $640,000.00 to meet tie first thiee years' appropriation of the Federal Road Fund, and au hoi ized the Staie Bond of Irrigation, Highways and Drainage to *ro- ceed with road construction. In co-operation with the County Officials Mi liive laid out a system of roads connecting all of the county seats. All of the counties in the state have requested State and Federal Funds lor the construction of these roads with the exception of Keith, Cheyenne. Ke&gt;a l.'lia .ind Thurston counties As provided by law we have divided tatr into nineteen project districts consisting of four or five coun- n each project district. We have surveyed 1,600 miles of road and awarded conn acts on 215 mile? at an aggregate cost of one-half million dollars We now have plans prepared for 752 miles to cost approximately $l.ti."&gt;7 mm The details of these projects are set forth in tabulated form in this report. Approximately 5.000 miles are designated in our State Road S&gt;stein. and at least ?."&gt;', of this mileage has not been maintained b\ the Count&gt; sinie the roads were designated. There are t;:', c , ol the people in the state living directly on the roac selected. -75', living on or within five miles of the State Highway Sy» lem. and with this large amount of traffic it is necessary that the 191St Session of Legislature provide some means for an adequate sum to main tain the entire State Road System. It is useless to expect the counties to maintain these roads out of the County Road Fund as the County High ways Commissioners are not able to properly maintain the other roads in the Countv with the small funds on hand.

            <seg id="p010">9 REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT WATER DIVISION NO. 1 To The Honorable State Board of Irrigation. Highways and Drainage State Engineer — Secretary. I have the honor of submitting a report of the work performed during the past two years as superintendent of Water Division No. 1. CO-OPERATION Early in the spring of 1917 managers of all irrigation projects were invited to co-operate with the State Board of Irrigation. Highways and Drainage in a plan to report gage heights, to take current meter measure - ments and keep discharge records, etc.. of the flow of their respective canals. It appeared possible under this plan that more satisfactory results could be obtained harmoniously than under the authority of Section 3441. 1913 Statutes of Nebraska. Postal cards and Record Books were mailed to all projects excepting a few very small canals. Not all projects however made reports, although more complied with our request in 1918 than in 1917, as is shown else - where in this report. Mitchell and Tri-State Headgate keepers tele - phoned gage heights to River Observer J. D. Fugate at Henry, who entered the same on postcards and mailed them daily to Superintendent. It was a part of the plan to credit all projects with water wasted back to the stream and regret very much that we are unable to publish daily discharge of wr.ste water. The Tri State Canal wasted- water back to riTer at three prints, Toohey, Mitchell and Red Willow. No daily gage height reports v.ere made for Toohey and Mitchell. Red Willow's dis - rharge is reported and the Tri State Canal given credit for water wasted to river. The Enterprise and Winters Creek Canals intercepts water from several seep streams, discharge records of which is lacking. It is not only intrestiag to know how much water is actually going on the land, but good business. In the future we hope closer cooperation can be had on this part of our plan, however greater cooperation was attained during the season of 1918 and the results as a whole was very attained during the season of 1918 and the results as a whole were very DISTRIBUTION The discharge of the North Platte and Platte rivers from Henry to Kearney in 1917 and 1918, shown elsewhere in this report, was much above the amount needed, consequently no canals on those streams were closed. The Lodge Pole Creek has practically no variation in its flow, except floods from storms which are of short duration. The distribution of the waters of this stream was satisfactorily handled by Clayton Radcliffe. WMt«hr PnmmiMRinnnr </seg>
            <seg id="p011">10 The Frenchman River in my opinion is slightly over appropriated The last two seasons the demand on this stream exceeded the supply which I believe has been the condition for a number of years. Water Commissioner F. F. Bailey was kept very busy dividing the water of those two rivers the past season. Blue Creek, a tributary of ilie North FMatte in Garden Counly. dis - charges about SO sec feet throughout the irrigation season. Water Com missioner Kd Hartnian lias given this stream considerable time the past two seasons dividing the waters among the appropriators Erery drop of Blue Creek is beneficially used by ihi water users The dis - charge of the five canals diverting water from this stream is shown elsewhere in this report. The primary object of measuring these particular strean ■the water superintendent with daily dala sufficiently accuratt le him to apportion intelligently the waters among the various ■ Is district, also to carry on a special investigation of the return in the North Platte River and seepage in the valley The current meter notes of over 130U stream gagings were first &lt;■&lt; puted by the gager and then checked in the superintendents office w mechanical computers. Gage heights were reported daily to the superintendent of Division No. 1 for the 1918 season by Water Commissioners on five canals, rep - resenting 7,560 acres and by ditch riders on twenty canals, representing 233,558 acres in accordance with Section 3441, Nebraska 1913 Statutes. Two hydrographers MM employed during the season m 1917 an&lt;: 1*18 between Kearney and Henry on t he I'latie, North and South Haiti [livers and tributaries, imludinn all canals and seep streams The follow ing number of Kagings were made: Season River Canals Seeps \- Tributaries 1917 197 144 ?:. 1918 188 197 Based on acreage reports filed, the following irrigable areas were irovided for in the water delivery schedules for the season of 1917 and •18: Diverted from River— 1917— Acres 1918— Acres East of Bridgeport 72,520 78,796 Wett of Bridgeport 180,530 221.400 Diverted from Tributaries — Bast of Bridgeport 43,400 35.199 West of Bridgeport _ 4,690 5,054 Total _ 2»6,690 344.840 </seg>
            <seg id="p012">11 A few projects of considerable size failed to file acreage reports that received water. Had there been a shortage of water those canals would have been among the first to be closed as no account had been taken to provide them with water. Project managers should protect the water us. ts under his project by sending the acreage reports to the State Kii^ineer's office each spring. The Platte River will get low again a* it has in the past during the months of July and August. If water delivery was based on appropriations as originally granted it would require 2.7&lt;&gt;o second feet more water than when delivery is based on acreage reports on the North Platte River alone. Three of the earliest appropriators have grants totaling 47,250 acres who have irri - gated for the last few seasons 25, 340 acres, based on their alreage reports. The following is the delivery schedules in Division 1-A used for the seasons of 1917 and 1918: WATER DELIVERY SCHEDULE— DIVISION NO. 1-A This schedule will govern the distribution of the natural How of the I'latte. .Vorth and South Platte Rivers and the tributaries during period! •it y. by the water commissioners Natural flow includes all waters flowing in this water shed except storage water, under control and released for use under contracts filed in tlie office of the State Board of Irrigation.

HIGHWAYS AND DBA1NAGK 15 BO \i:n &lt;&gt;k When tht supply of water begins to fall below the total amount re - quired by this schedule, canals will be closed by water commissioners beginning with the top of this list. The following is the delivery schedule of storage water under con - racts with the I'nited States Government: Bulletins were prepared three times, a week during tho season of 1917 and twice a week throughout the season of 1918 giving tho discharge of the North Platte. South Platte and Platte Rivers at fifteen stations, in - cluding the Pathfinder Reservoir. These wer» sent to a mailing list of fifty, including newspapers, county commissioners, secretaries of irri~a- nn projects, commercial clubs and many others. On the 15th and 30th of each month during the irrigation season of 191V a bulletin was mailed to the secretaries of Paisley, I'nion. B'ue Creek District. Graf and Hooper ditches, showing the daily discharge ol &gt; aeh Canal and the amount flowing to the river at the mouth of Blue Creek. Each project received this bulletin showing the daily discharge oi all the ditches on Blue Creek. This could be done weekly for all the ir rigation projects if the managers would cause gage heights to be sent in daily to the superintendent. Many managers of small projects claim that it is not practical to report daily gage heights. They do not employ ditch riders and do not visit their headgates more than three or four times a month. Many ditch riders cannot record correctly the gage heights. Now and then we find ditches who report incorrect gage heights, evidently for a purpose. There are ditch riders who will report gage heights without going to the gage .-.imply make a guess. To overcome these conditions, automatic gages should be Installed at the rating flume of every canal and in some cases at several places along the canal. Reliable records of the amount of water used cannot be had unless this is done. The time is near when every second foot of water will have to be accounted for. No project should be permitted to have excess water when crops elsewhere are burning and this excess will save tbem. Name July August September nate Interstate Farmers Irr. Hist.

            <seg id="p019">BOARP OF IRRIGATION. HIGHWAYS ANP DRAINAGE 17 ANNUAL REPORT OF OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE NORTH PLATTE (INTERSTATE) PROJECT SEASON OF 1917 1. The Operation and Maintenance and the system operated for the ye.nr wan practically the same as that for last year. 1 The climatic conditions for the season were abnormal. The wniter of 1916 and 1917 was cold and long, and the range stock brought in on the project for wintering had to be fed so much longer than usual that a general shortage of feed for the Spring and Summer work resulted over the entire valley. The Spring opened about the first of April and the weather was fairly favorable for work up to about the 19th of May when a series of hard and driving rains with occasional streaks of hall set in and lasted for about two weeks. During that time approximately 5 inches of rain fell over the project. This series of rains delayed the Spring work for about three weeks, and it also packed the ground so hard that it became necessary to work a good deal of the ground over again and what could not be worked over was left in a condition con - ducive to heavy evaporation. This rainy spell which ended about June 4th was followed with a severe drouth for the balance of the year. The total precipitation for the year was 11.75 and almost one-half of this fell during the two weeks from May 19th to June 4th The last killing frost in the Spring was on May 11th with a minimum temperature of 25° and the first in the Fall was on October 18th with a minimum of 19* which made a total of 1R0 days between the killing frosts, as compared with 121 days for 1916 and 137 days for 1915. The minimum temperature for the year was -22" and the maximum 100°. The wind movement was about normal, and did but very little damage to the canal banks, but it did considerable damage to the laterals along plowed fields by completely filling them in places with tumble weeds and drift sand. Also the rainy weather in May together with the lalte start of water Into the small laterals seemed to be the cause of an unusually heavy and rapid growth of weeds which had to be cut or cleaned out during the Summer. 3. Water Delivery. Water was first turned into the Main Canal on April 23. for the filling of the reservoirs. Lake Alice and Lake Minatare. before the opening of the irrigation season. The canal discharge varied from 600 to 800 second feet from the beginning up to the middle of June and practically all of this was run into the reservoirs. There was no demand for water into the laterals before May 25 and but very little before June 15. Then the orders for water commenced coming in fast and the canal discharge was increased accordingly up to 1200 second ft. by June 17 when the break in the canal occurred at mile 79.2 near Dry Spotted Tall. -•▼ This break was caused by the negligence of one ditch rider who failed to adjust one of the check gates to take care of the raise in the </seg>
            <seg id="p020">18 canal as he had been instructed to do. At the time of the break, tic water in the canal at that point was 0.3 ft. higher than the previous high water mark, so it is believed that a gopher hole at or rear the lii*h water line of the canal started the break. By the 20th, this break was repaired and the canal again filled up to 1200 second feet and the dis - charge gradually increased to 1400 by Juno 23, to 1500 by June 27. to &gt;y Jul ylO. to 160(1 by July 20, and to a maximum of 16300 second feet by the end of July. This maximum of 1S30 second feet was carritd all through August, and then the discharge was gradually decreased to 950 second feet hy the end of September which was tin close of Ikt irrigation season. After that about Si&gt;0 second feet was run into the reservoirs from October 1st to the 15th when the canal gates wen closed for the season. The Low Line (iinal was operated from June 11th to September 30th. The canal discharge commenced with 25 second feet on June 11 and increased to 100 by the ISth. to 300 by the 26th and to a maximum of 325 by July 14 and maintained at that to August l.~. From then there was a gradual decrease in the canal discharge from 325 to 70 second feet by the end of September when the gates were clos&lt; for the season. 4. Distribution. The total amount of water diverted fron into the Interstate Canal for the season was 425. "7^ acre feet of v. 44,534 acre feet were delivered to the North I'latte Canal &amp; Colonizat Company for the irrigation of 105 farms containing approximately acres of crop and 177,472 acre feet to the Interstate Init f n tion of 1,274 farms containing approximately HJM acres in crop Thi total of 177.472 acre feet was delivered as follows: TIL' acre leet in Mav 26,630 in June; 53.523 in July; 57.13" in August; and ::&lt;M77 in September Of the September delivery. 2,460 acre feet were delivered for irrigati of Winter wheat and rye. and for which only He par acre toot or of the regular charge was made in accordance with the petition for same by some of the water users and granted by the Department on August 29th. The average amount of water was 2.13 acre feet per acre as com- pared with 2.17 for 1916 and 1.38 for 191E 6. Method of Delivery. The method of water delivery for the season was the same as for the past four years, namely, to deliver on demand early and late in the season when the supply exceeded the demand, and on rotation the balance of the time. For this season the schedule de - livery was as follows: MAIN CANAL SYSTEM. Supply on demand up to June 17th. (Break June 17 to 20). Rotation 4 on -4 off June 20th to July 2nd 1.75 S. F. per 80 acres. Rotation 3 on -4 off July 2nd to July 9th 1.75 S. F. per 80 acres. Rotation 3 on -4 off July 9th to August 7, 1.50 S. F. per 80 acres.

There was no special work done by the O.

Feet 12s4 7. Losses. The per cent of Seepage and evaporation losses in the canal system was a little less this year than tor the past two years as may be seen from the following table: I Seepage. There was a general raise in the water table all over the project during the summer and a corresponding increase in the seeped areas. There were 886 acres relieved from water charges for 1917 on account of seepage as compared with 811 for 1916. 9. Drainage. The drainage work for the reclamation of seeped areas on the project was continued throughout the working season with two draglines and one trench-machine. One dragline was used in the first part of the year in the Winters Creek, and later in the Nine Mile Draw the other dragline was used in the Upper Sheep Creek; and the trench-machine was used in the spring at Winters Creek and later in Sheep Creek. A total of 1.52 miles of tile drain and 4. 48 of open drain were constructed during the year, making a total to dale of 12.6 miles of tile and 23.4 of open drain. 10. FARM OPERATIONS. Crops. The cropped area for the season of 1917 including the area seeded to alfalfa without a nurse crop was 83.203 acres.

            <seg id="p022">20 Average value of crops Year No. of Farms Area in crop Per Acre Per Farm The table at the end of this report gives the acreage, yields, and value of each crop on the project for the season. The alfalfa hay yield of 1.7 tons per acre is less than the average for the past few years. This was due partly to the late start in irriga - tion and the severe drouth thruout the summer; partly due to two or three hail storms that took the first crop on a portion of the Second and on about one-half of the Third Lateral Districts; and also partly due to the grasshoppers which took a big percentage of the third crop. The quality of the hay was very good, and the prices have averaged from $15 to $20 per ton which is higher than ever before in this valley. Practically all the hay was either used on the farm or sold to local stock feeders. The cereal crops were fair. The corn crop was fair. There were many yields reported at from 40 to 45 bushels, and most of the cum matured fairly well. The potato crop was the best that has been had on this project. The maximum yield reported was 700 bushels and the average 232 M compared with a maximum of 400 and an average of 158 bushels for 1916. The market for potatoes has been good and the price has varied between 75c and $1.00 per bushel. About the only new crop of importance this year was that of beans. There were 2304 acres of this crop as compared with 229 acres for 1916. The maximum yield was 22 and the average 6.2 bushels. This year, on account of the demand made last spring for increased food production, some farming was done by the government forces on all the government camp reserves where there was any irrigable land available for farming.

There seems to have been a falling off in the hog in - dustry during the year. The above shows only 16,550 hogs on the Pro - ject in 1917 as compared with 25.123 for 1916 and 24,928 for 1915. Thi- shipments for the year were also less, for the average monthly shipments up to the first of October was 41.0 cars as compared with 42.6 for 1916. The cash returns per month were, however, much great - er the average being $105,014 per month as compared with $69,674 for 1916 and $41,399 for 1915. There were 25 hog cholera outbreaks dur - ing the year and approximately one hundred pigs lost from same as compared with 66 otubreaks and two hundred and fifty pigs lost in 1916. This hog report of shipments and also of losses was obtained from Mr. ('. S. Jones, animal husbandryman. and covers the entire valley, hut it is estimated that about 55 per cent of it belongs to the Interstate Project. 14. Crop Report Cards. At the last annual meeting it was sug Bested to get the crop reports by mailing out cards, and in accordance suggestion about 200 cards were mailed out, but only 26 or wit 13 per cent came back filled out. In 1916 and 1915 about the same number of cards were mailed out. and although no accurate count was made of the ones returned, it is estimated that only about 10 or 12 per cent of the cards were returned. 15. Maintenance. The maintenance work this year consisted in re - pairing the paving on the Lake Minatare Dam, cleaning the canals and laterals, renewing lateral wooden structures, repairing breaks, and miscellaneous repairs to canals, laterals, structures and rip-rap. Also in guarding the most vital points on the project. In the repair of breaks, that of June 17th was the most serious one. It took a grading outfit with one grader and twelve wagons two days time to repair it and cost $1,416. The following is an itemized list of the breaks on the whole canal system for the season that cost over $25 in repairs: </seg>

C. at Rawhide that seriously threatened to result in breaks but which were headed off by building brush mattresses over them. The first one occurred at Mile 30 on August 19th and cost $100.00 the second one occurred on the same day at Mile 29.3 and cost $154 and the third was a continuation of the one at Mile 29.3 on MM 7th day of September and cost approximately $600. The lateral cleaning for the year was exceptionally lnavy and this can be accounted for as follows, first on the account of the scar city of help and the early freezing up of the ground in the fall of 1*16 practically all the lateral cleaning was left until spring, second, • he hard winds during the winter and early spring filled up many of the laterals with tumble weeds and drift sand more than ever before; and third, the rains in the spring and the late start of water in the small laterals caused the weeds to grow up so badly that many laterals had to be cleaned just on account of the new crop of weeds. 16. Wooden Structure*. Most of the wooden structures on the 1st and 2nd lateral districts placed in the years of 1907 to 1910 in - clusive have deterioted deyond repair, and the work of replacing these with concrete has continued for the past three years. During this past year not as many structures were renewed as had been hoped for because of the labor difficulties. The total number of renewals for the year was 108 turnouts, 115 weirs, 52 checks, 36 drops. 21 cul - verts, 4 bridges and 7 miscellaneous structures There still remains approximately 800 turnouts, 700 weirs. 300 checks. 200 lateral head - gates, 400 drops, besides some culverts and bridges to be renewed; and the renewal of these ought to be completed within the next two or three years. On the Third Lateral District some of the first structures placed in 1910 on laterals 26 and 27 were also made of untreated lumber and these too are ao badly decayed that it may be necessary to renew then </seg>
            <seg id="p027">BOARD OF IRRIGATION. HIGHWAYS AND DRAINAGE 25 In the next two or three years. But all the wooden structures placed in the Third Lateral District since that time have been made of lumber treated with carbolineum or R. R. Oil. These treated structures, some of which hav-p been placed for seven years are still in such good con - dition that no decay in the lumber is noticeable. IT. Concrete Structures. The concrete structures are practically all in gxtd condition as when first made. The only deterioration that tbeen noticed on any of them is some wear on the floor of the r cushion on a few of the drops, also on the baffle posts on the Lake Minatare outlet. 18. Metal Flumes. The metal flumes as stated in last year's re - port are all more or less affected by rust. In October 1916, four flumes were painted with one coat of water gas tar and one coat of coal gas tar had this paint after one season's wear is still in good condition and shows no sign of peeling off as has been our previous experience with all other paints at the end of the first season. The cost of this paint laid down was 11 He per gallon, and the total cost per square foot of surface painted was lie. It therefore appears to be both the best and cheapest paint for metal flumes that has been tried on this project. 19. Gophers. The gopher trouble this year was about the same as in the past, although considerable trapping was done both by the canal riders and by the farmer boys. During the season approximately 5.000 gophers were trapped by the O. ft M. forces, 3.800 by the canal and 1.200 by special trappers. In addition to this the farmer boys trapped approximately 41.900 for which the Water Users Association paid a bounty of 10c each. The reduction of gophers is apparent in some places, but taking the project as a whole it seems that it may be necessary to adopt some more effectice and systematic method for reducing this pest to a possible minimum. 20 Construction. The new work performed during the year by the O. .v M. anil by the drainage organization but not included in the U. ft M. charges, and approximate cost for the year of sain^ is about as follows: 1. C'ottonwood wasteway at mile 1.4 on the M. C t 3,50« 2. Sand Point Drop at mile 10.3 on the M. C _ MM :i. Winter Creek Lake outlet works 5,0*0 4.

Lateral structures for new land, 66 weirs, 5 turnouts. 10 checks, 4 culverts and flume : » 1,634 Total $4i,14S </seg>
            <seg id="p028">26 REPORT nK STA I 1. KM. I Ml!; The Cottonwood wasleway was built for two purposes, first, to provide tor a sand sluice near the upper end of the M. C. and second, to pro vide for additional wasteway facilities. The Sand Point concrete drop was necessary for the protection of the outlet of the Sand Point waste way on account of the gradual erosion of the natural soft rock over which the waste water fell. The Winter Creek lake outlet works is for the purpose of utilizing the natural basin known as the Winter Creek L*ke for storage purposes. The capacity of this reservoir will be 3,000 acre ft. The lateral 27 siphon is for the replacement of lateral 27 flume which was so badly deteriorated as to require extensive re pairs and which was also of insufficient capacity. The drains MB - strutted were -for the reclamation of lands that had become unlit for cultivation by reason of seepage. The lateral extensions and structures were mostly for the new lands in the Third Lateral District. 21. Operation and Maintenance Cost The actual O. &amp; M costs for the season of 1917 in comparison with the estimate for same and also the cost for 1916 is shown in the following table: The above table shows a considerable increase in the actual lor 1917 over that for 1916 and also over the estiate tor 1917 The large increase on the 2nd Div. M. ('. was largely due to the greater amount of work done than usual on the canal during the months October. November and December, when approximately $10.0&lt;m were spent on improving the canal section and strengthening the banks and also to the two breaks during the summer which cost about $2.04 The increased cost on the whole system is due principally the following two reasons First, after the war broke out last spring it was deemed advisable to guard the most important structures on the project, and hence the Knder dam, Whalen dam. Spring Canyon flume, Kawhide siphon, he Minatare dam have been guarded since about the first of at an approximate cost of $11,000: 1916 1917 Cost Cost Estimated Actual Pathfinder 7.841.8:; ijMa H.977 A-l 1st Division M.

It would seem there - hat a more effective plan should be adopted another year for the extermination of the gopher A Project Agricultural agent is needed in addition to a County Agent. for the reason that about half of the project lands are in other counties A County Agent and Project Agent could work out the problems together that thep would have to deal with in the valley. There would be plenty of work for both for in addition to the gopher problem, we have the grasshopper situation to deal with. The loss to the farmer last year from the gopher and grasshopper together, was enormous, and I lit* greater part of this loss no doubt might have been saved if we had iiad the help and direction of the Agricultural Agent. An Agricultural Agent woulc be of material help to the farmer in many ways aside from those men tioned. and it is the opinion of your Secretary that the money you pa&gt; out for a thoroughly competent Agricultural Agent, would be returned to you many tini-rs through the saving effected by such an agent. </seg>

The fore part of the year was dry and windy, filling the laterals with an unusually large amount of wind-blown soil. A cold, wet spring delayed farming operations considerably and occasioned many floods in the river and small freshets in the cross-drainage extending through the irrigation project. The summer was hot and dry .followed by a dry fall with a very early severe frost, and that followed by warm weather and mild weather up to the end of the year. Operation. The irrigation season of 191S began on May 6th and closed on September :10th. During the month of May there were 11,100 water diverted from the river and about one-half of that was acr&gt; used on the land. Water was turned out of the canal on the 17th and ISth of May due to large quantities of sand lodging in the canal just below the dam. The river was in flood during the entire month of June and water was diverted into the canal until the 22nd of the month, when the canal below the dam had loaded with sand to such an extent as to make it impossible to get more than 55u cubic feet of water into the canal even though the river was in flood. Water was turned out of the canal on the 22nd and about 50 teams put to work scraping sand and water was again turned into th'.' canal on June 27th. The canal continued, in opera - tion until the 8th day of July when the dam broke, washing out a large section of sheet piling under the dam and allowing the river to flow under - neath and immediately lowing the water level of the river about 5 feet Immediately following the breach in the dam steps were taken to open 'he old headgales for the reason that the water stood about IVx fe«t higher there than at the new headgates. or needle dam. A large force of teams and men were put on the canal scraping out sand, and water was turned into the canal on the 11th of July, the river continuing to fall very rapidly, and on the 21st of the month, had fallen to such an extent as to make it impossible to get more than 300 cubic feet of water per second into the citnal through the old gates. On the 22nd of Ju'y, work was begun on the building of a temporary dam near the old head - gates, and on the 27th of the month work was begun on the filling of the breach under the needle dam with rock shipped fro.n Sunrise. Wyo. Both pieces of work were prosecuted day and night by a force of about 60 men at each place A spur track was constructed from the ('. ,B. tt Q. R.

Early in the year a contract was entered into with the United States for the construction of a main drainage line in N'ine Mile Canon which, when completed will relieve and reclaim a very large area of seeped lands in this canon as well as give an outlet for aH of the seepage and waste waters in this water shed. The i'niled States is to construct the drain and the Irriga - tion District is to repay to the Cnited States 40&lt;&gt;; of the cost of the main drain from the river to the Irrigation District's canal in Nine Mile Canon. The portion of the cost of the drain to be paid by the district is to be paid for in ten annual installments. </seg>
            <seg id="p041">38 The Red Willow Drainage District was formed for the purpose of constructing drains covering an area of about 2.000 acres of seeped land northeast of Bayard, and a contract was entered into between the Drain - age District and the Irrigation District whereby the Irrigation District is to repay the Drainage District, the cost of construction of their drains and the Drainage District is to furnish the necessary right of way with out any cost to the Irrigation District. The repayment is to be made annually and equal to the amount of the general fund taxes levied upon the seeped lands within the Drainage District. The drains within this district are about one-half completed and already have accomplished considerable good. A contract was entered into with Frank McX'arter a drainage con - tractor of Bayard, whereby he was to cut certain plow ditches desis: - nt.ted by the Irrigation District, and was to lake his pay in warrants of the district in four annual installments, s 4 in 1917.

            <seg id="p042">39 From a study of the above tables it will be seen that there are 116 timber structures in the main canal and 1912 timber structures in the laterals and drains making a grand total of 2.02S timber struc - tures in the entire irrigation district, and a total of 3,043 structures of all kinds in the irrigation system. These structures were built during the period 1907 to 1913 and have begun to deteriorate very rapidly. A large portion of the timber drops and headgates in the eastern portion of the irrigation district are so rotten that they may be kicked with a persons foot Organization. The organization during the year 1917 was aa fol - lows: A district board consisting of three members, a secretary treasurer, attorney, engineer and manager and a general superintend - ent. There were 19 day ditch riders and 5 night ditch riders. The proposed organization for the year 1918 is as follows: A ditch board consisting of three members, secretarp, treasurer. attorney, engineer and manager, three division foreman, 19 day ditch riders and 5 night riders. The only change in the organization from 1917 to 1918 is the elimination of the general superintendent and the appointing of three division foreman, who will have charge of the operation and maintenance work in their division. The irrigation district having been divided into three divisions.

            <seg id="p046">43 The irrigation district is permitted to issue warrants for only HO per cent of the levy and these warrants are discounted 4 or 5 per rent, making about 85 or Mi per cent of the general fund leyy that is .u-tually cash to the district. This means that while the tax payer is n the dollar on his taxes, the district only gets 35 or 86 per cent for use in operation and maintenance and other listrict expenses Suggestions for Betterment of the District as a Whole If the farmers' irrigation district is to be a success finally there must be better team work of the land owners within the district. Kai-h one should feel that it is to the best interest of the district to boost and work tor the betterment of the project, in so doing each will add to his own interests as well as doing a public service to the community as a whole. The electors or the farmers of the district should get away from the idea that the district is a corporation owned by eastern capitalists, for this is your project, and its success means your success, in fact the district should be strictly a community affair. In order to place the district in good financial condition, and keep it in that condition, it is necessary that the taxes be paid promptly each year before becoming delinquent. If they are allowed to become delinquent, you are the looser, the district warrants will not be paid promptly, and when the district is in that condition it is very difficult to get anyone to finance the district, and for the next two or three years the matter of financing the district will be serious whether the war continues or not. By "financing" is meant, the furnishing of cash and taking our warrants or notes as security. The problem is to find .i bank or loan company that will buy the warrants of the district tor cash; which last pear amounted to $165,975.66; and loan to the district large sums of money in case of necessity as was done dar - ing the past year. By allowing some one to buy up the delinquent taxes of the dis - trict you are simply putting off the evil day for there must be a pay day some time, and the longer the payment is defered the greater are the interest charges to the individual and to the district. If all of the taxes of the district were paid before becoming de - linquent, the warrants would sell at par instead of at a discount, thereby saving six to eight thousand dollars per year in interest and discount. . If the warrants did not run for more than a year they would be considered an attractive investment and would bring a price very near par value. </seg>

The complete failure of all crops because of the drought in 1894, caused the qquestion of adopting an irrigation code to be made a campaign issue that fall. The legislature in 1895 passed an irrigation 60 days and prose^uti &lt;1 diligently and uniterrupu-dly lateral without tin- 0WMr*l consent; that irrigation works wen- interns it improvements: that water from one stream should not be turned int mother stream; that rights of way i-oukl l&gt;e condemned tor irrigatio purposes; that •aecHtM amounts of water should not be used and xhn :he waters appropriated should be distributed in certain ways I'nde his law there was no way of knowing the value of a right except l&gt; </seg>

            <seg id="p053">BOARD OF IRRIGATION, HIGHWAYS AND DRAINAGE 49 code modeled after the Wyoming code, and also an irrigation- district law modeled after the Wright Irrigation district law of California. The irrigation code created a state board of irrigation, consisting of the governor, the attorney general and the commissioner of public lands, the governor being ex-officio president of the board, and divided the state into two water districts. The law provided that at the first meeting of the state oard it should elect a secretary, who should be a hydralic engineer of theoreti - cal knowledge and practical skill and experience, and an under secre - tary for each of the water divisions, and that it could employ an assist - ant secretary and such other assistants as might be necessary. The board either directly or through its secretary or under secretaries, was charged with the measurement of all streams in the state; the deter - mination of priorities and amounts of all claims initiated prior to the passage of the law, and the issuance of certificates of appropriation for claims found valid, the distribution of all waters appropriated; the re - ceiving, recording and considering of all future applications for per - mits to appropriate water; the granted of permits, if there was any unappropriated water in the streams and the appropriation asked for would not in any other way be detrimental to the public welfare; and the issuance of certificates of appropriation when satisfied that the applications had been perfected according to law. This law besides granting the board certain police powers and fix - ing penalties, defined standards of measurement; dedicated the water of the state to public use; fixed the date of priority of applications and the order of preference in using water for different purposes; granted the right of eminent domain for irrigation works; exempted irrigation works from taxation; and provided for mutual irrigation companies. In 1895 to 1911 a number of minor changes were made in the irri - gation code, most of which were for the purpose of assisting the state board in its administrative work. At the sessions of the legislature In 1911 and 1913, practically the entire code was revised and re-enacted, with amendments. Among some of the more important changes made were the following: The "State Board of Irrigation" was changed to the "State Board of Irrigation. Highways and Drainage;" the oard was charged with the duty of examinging into the condition of all water appropriations and of holding hearings and cancelling rights where the water had not een used for beneficial purposes for more than three years; the maximum amount of water that a tract could receive was limited to 3 acre-feet per acre per year; irrigation works were declared common carriers and the rates for water were to be determined by the state railway commission; and the list of all lands to be irrigated were re - quired to be filed with the sMperintednent of each water division April 1 of each year. </seg>
            <seg id="p054">50 The Irrigation District law has been amended from time to time since its passage in 1895. The main provisions at present are as A majority of the electors who also own or hold by leasehold a majority of the lands in the district susceptible or irrigation from a common system of works may petition the county commissioners of the county in which the land, or the greater portion of it lies, asking that an irrigation district be created including all the land. A copy of the plans, etc., submitted to the county commissioners must be filed with the state engineer, who must examine them and submit a report to the board of county commissioners at the meeting set for the hear - ing of the petition. If the petition, either in its original form or in the amended form, is approved by the board of county commissioners, the board divides the proposed district into three divisions, and calls an electon to vote upon the organization of an irrlgaion district, and to elect a director foi each division, if the vote is favorable to organi - sation. If upon canvassing the vote the county commissioners find a majority favorable to organization, the district is declared organized and the directors elected meet and organize. The board of directors has control of the affairs of the district in a general way and is au thorised to make surveys, acquire rights of way. and to secure lands water or other property by purchase or condemnation. All surveys maps, plans and estimates must be made under the direction of a com petent engineer and sent to the state engineer, who shall file a repor upon them with the board of directors. Having determined the amoun of money required, the board of directors calls a special election to vote on the question of issuing bonds, and if a majority of the votes are in favor of issuing bonds, a special proceeding is begun in the district court to have the bonds examined, approved and confirmed If the bonds are confirmed they are sent, together with a history of the district, to the auditor of public accounts for registration if he finds the law has been conformed with in all respects. When registered, the bonds may be sold at 95 per cent of their face value, or if not sold, can be used to pay for property or for construction at their par value. The bonds and interest are paid from the revenues derived from an annua MMMment upon the real estate in the district.

Waters and Water Courses — Appropriation — Adverse User To tbe extent that a landowner, under a prior appropriation, uses water of a river for irrigation when actually needed, diversions by upper appropriators using water for the same purpose are not adverse. (Ed. Note.— For other ca»e, see Waters and Water Course*. Cent Dig. 150, 151, Dec. Dig. 138.)

Affirmed. P. W. Scott, of Imperial, for appellants. Fulton Jack of Bf and C. W. Meeker, of Imperial, for appellee. ROSE, J. Plaintiffs brought this suit in equity in the District Court for Chase County to protect alleged priority of rights to the use of waters of the Frenchman River for irrigation. The statutory appro - priations of the parties are as follows: Defendant. December 23. 1890. 64.86 cubic feet of water a second; plaintiff. Maranville Ditch Company. December 8. 1894. 6 cubic feet of water a second; plaintiff, Inman Ditch Company. February 28. 1895, 6.43 cubic feet of water a second. Plain - tiffs are upper propriators. They assert prior rights alleged to have been acquired by prescription or by adverse user for more than the statutory period ol ten years. The District Court decreed that defendant had a prior right to use 24 cubic feet of water a second. Plaintiffs have appealed. It Is contended that the evidence does not justify the finding below. There is testimony tending to show that by means of two dams. 2 and 5 miles, respectively, above defendant's headgate, plaintiffs have for more than ten years diverted to their irrigation ditches the entire flow of the river at those places. Owing to the peculiar nature of the basin of tbe stream, however, the river, before reaching defendant's headgate, ac - cumulated considerable water which defendant used for irrigation. De - fendant owns 2000 acres of land under its ditch. One of its officers tes - tified that it annually irrigated from 1500 to 2000 acres of its own in ■ ion to 160 acres which it did not own.

CONORA, Director of the Nebraska Conservation and Soil Survey, Chairman of the State Highway Advisory Board Soils are the state's most important road materials. Though ther are many soils In Nebraska, a satisfactory method of handling them ii road work has not been fully determined. This bulletin is a preliminary report based on the work of the State Conservation and Soil Survey* and the Advisory State Highway Board It may be of some use to persons building and maintaining earth roads awaiting a more complete report The purpose of the paper is to out - line the soil provinces of Nebraska and to discuss the physical properties of soils most used in road building. The term "soil," as here mtt, denotes both soil and subsoil. The state owns the highways and the soil materials beneath them These materials when properly combined are better suited for roads than Is generally supposed. Due regard should be had, however, for the cli - matic conditions affecting roads. For example, some earth roads should not be graded; some should be graded to a crown, the form of which is determined by soil type, rainfall and drainage, and others require the mix- Ing of materials to produce a stable surface. The methods of construc - tion and maintenance are largely determined by the demands placed upun a road, and by the nature of the soils with which and upon which the road is built. The Soil Survey — The soil survey has two leading purpos give a general description of the soils of the state, and the other to make known the details of the various soil types relating to agriculture and state development. The first line of survey has covered fifty-two central snd counties. A report on this, the Reconnoissance Survey of Western Nebraska, was published by the U. S. Bureau of Soils, Wash - ington, D. C, and distributed generally in Nebraska The detailed soil survey investigates the origin, topography, drain- Me, mechanical analysis, and agricultural value of soils. Twenty-four counties have been covered in this way. They are Richardson. Nemaha. Cmss, Otoe, Gage, Saunders, Douglas, Washington. Dodge, Thurston, Wayne. Seward, Polk, Fillmore, Phelps, Hall, Chase, Dawes Sheridan, 'The writer Is Indebted to several persons who rendered valuable assistant la the preparation of this bulletin. Among them are George Johnson, state Engi - neer: F. A. Hayes, H. C. Mortlock, B. W. TlUman and A. U. Beyers, of the U. a. Bureau of Soils, and L. A. Wolfanger. V. H. Seabury. France* J.

They may be agreed upon and standardized before long. Among the properties considered in this report are color, structure, tex t, voids, drainage, absorption, packing, drying, stability and wear. Color has no particular importance In this connection except for use dentifying soils. The dark soils are usually high in organic matter content, yet they may be colored in part by a low oxide of iron. The yellowish and brownish soils and subsoils are stained with varying quia ron. The grayish soils may contain calcareous matter or light tit jlored sand or both Structure relates mainly to the layers or zones In a soil section. Most soil sections show three divisions — the upper layer or soil proper; a middle layer (sometimes a hardpan). and a lower zone. (See Figure t). These vary greatly in thickness and texture. The upper soil layer (1) is usually darkened more or less by organic matter. The middle lone or upper part of the subsoil (2) is more compact, made so mainly by the deposition of clay particles, calcium carbonate, and the compounds of Iron and other materials derived from the upper soil.

These, except number 1, are mixtures of different grades of sand with silt and clay, and are deter - mined accurately by mechanical analyses in the laboratory. At least four texture names should be well understood by road builders. They are clay, silt, sand and loam. Clay is very fine grained. It is plastic and sticky when wet. The particles range between .0001 and .005 millimeter in diameter.

There la no grit In nioit S In Nebraska Is composed wholly of clay. Silt Is a large content of most agricultural soils in Nebraska. It ■ n confused with clay because of its relatively fine uniform texture is coarser and more friable than clay. Its grains run between .005 meters in diameter or between clay and the finest grade of sand. There are several silty soils depending upon the percent of lilt and the admixture of clay and sands. The principal thing in our well known loess Is silt, not clay Sand of four grades Is recognized in soil classification. The diameter expressed in millimeters. Is the basis of classification and grade are: (1) .05 to .1, very fine sand, (2) .1 to .25, fine sand, (3t to 0.5, medium sand. Sometimes the grade, fine gravel, is used for rtiile&gt; having diameters between 1 and 2 millimeters. The presenc? sand in a sample is readily determined by the gritty feel, and in most cases by sight alone Loam contains silt and clay and more or less sand. The silt and sand tend to overcome the plasticity of the clay, making the type loamy iable and loose. Loam Is graded, i. e., composed of particles rang - ietween fine and coarse. A typical loam has a little less than 20' clay and less than 50Tc silt. An excess of clay, silt, fine sand, sand or gravel would distinguish the soil type as a clay loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or gravelly loam. Probably the most perfect soil for road building in most places is a gravelly sandy loam. Voids — Soil is far from being solid. It is composed of grains of vari - ous forms and sizes separated by spaces. The proportion of these spaces to a given volume of soil is called the "voids," which is the percentage of pore space. The spaces are very small In tine textured soils and larger in th&gt; coarse textured types. The percentage of voids is greatest in fine tex - tured soils and least in graded loamy soils. It is not practical in most road work to determine voids. The de - sired results are secured by mixing materials ranging between One and coarse. The heavy soils are as a rule well graded and low in voids. Drainage relates to surface drainage, percolation and seepage. Tae fine soils drain rapidly on the surface and the open textured sandy types drain mostly by percolation. Drainage is the principal problem, as a rule, In road construction and maintenance. This is particularly true where rainfall is heavy and the soil is fine. Under these conditions the purpose should be to build and </seg>

The soil texture and the amount of rainfall should largely the kind of road work uspd to facilitate drainage. A knowled conditions will serve to distinguish between soils and roads wl be crowned and those which should not be uraded. il Absorption — Soils differ preatly in their ability to absorb and hold water. The fine soils and graded types absorb water slowly. The clays and silts, being hieh in voids, hold much water if saturated. The ca pactty of fine soils is greater than that of sandy soils. Sandy soils ab sorb water readily and lose it mostly through percolation. The fint grained soils hold a large amount of capillary water and little graviu water. The sandy soils carry less capillary water and more gravity water Most soils should be graded to a well defined crown to promote run - off. The sandy soils should be crowned less because they need water and would in some cases be Improved by a lack of surface drainage. Or- ganic matter, loose dirt, and weeds are a detriment on most well im - proved road beds in the humid areas because they retard surface drain- age and promote absorption. Packing — Soils pack direrently under traffic, dragging and drying The sandy types remain loose under roost conditions, and the fine ter </seg>
            <seg id="p387">tured types become heavy and compact. The graded soil is ideal for pack ing Most soils contract when drying and expand when receiving mois - ture or freezing (if saturated). This is particularly true with th5 clayey and silty types. One of the chief purposes in road maintenance should develop a compact wearing surface. This can be done chlpfly h&gt; at the right timt Drying is caused by drainage and evaporation, but at different rates i with different results in the various kinds of soil and roads. The rying periods of soils and hence the "drag periods" of roads are closely elated. A road cru-sing two or more soils dries by stretches and It is not possible to dra;,- these stretches at in. same tlnio with the best re - sults. This presents a problem of considerable magnitude where a road a number of boils having wide range in texture. The only way ■rect this condition is to build a uniform road surface by mixing iaterials. St-ve.al things cit-it-rniine the rate of drying. The rate i? greatest warm r.eather and on dry windy days. Other things belns, e&lt;iu.il, hilly ies faster than flat land. Fine-textured soils dry slowly when poorly drained. The clay-s form hard cakes, granules and clods. The light soils are mobile. They dry rapidly by aeration and percolation. The heavy soils, drying, make hard roads and the lighter soils make sandy roads. Stability relates to the ability a soil has to stand against suon naiu- as creeping, caving, washing, and blowing. It is the property sts the action of gravity, rains, wind, freezing and thawing. w A soil containing much clay will creep and slide in Oils and cuts. It gullies on slopes. The silts stand well in cuts and fills and are not n much affected by rait. ,.nd wind. The well graded loamy soils are quite stable. The sandy so Is are subject to wind erosion, making their man - agement very difficult in road work unless materials are available for protecting the surface or for mixing with the sandy soil. Wear — Dirt roads are not suitable for heavy travel under all condi - tions. Rain makes the clayey and silty soils muddy, and ruts are formel where the surface breaks through. If not dragged in time, the wear - ing surface becomes rough with clods and finally knotted and pitted. A ■urface in this form is said to be "pitted." This condition can be cor - rected by planing. The silt roads develop dust when dry and the sanrtv roads show areas of lose sand. The effects of wear on soil types and the relation of dirt roads to wet and dry weather are particularly notice - able where a highway crosses several kinds of soil. In maintaining a road bed, the texture of soils Is a controlling factor </seg>

A patchy condition of road is produced which erodes and wears unevenly. There are, as a rule, sufficient materials along bottom land roads for the selec - tion of textures suitable for the production of relatively good road beds. In some places surfacing material can be secured from the gutters. Tins, as along the IMatte, may be medium to coarse gravel.

It has three names — the Table Land Region, Wtestern Region and the Hieh Plains. The most distinctive feature is the high plains, hence the name now used. 'he largest natural subdivisions of the High Plains Region are Pe.

(See Figure :{). These divisions are described in some of the survey reports and In the Geography of Nebraska. The following pages discuss briefly the lanJ forms, soils and roads of each subdivision. Perkins Table — The subdivision, Perkins Table. (See 1 on figure 1). in Perkins. Chase, and Keith counties and northeastern Colorado, has its most typical development in the northeastern part of Perkins unty. It is bordered on the north by South Platte Valley, on the east 1 south by sandhills and loess areas. The surface varies from nearly l.'V gh and is modified by a few sandhills The soils of Perkins Table are residual and aeolian They were de - veloped upon the Ogallala Formation. Three leading series are repre- sented, namply, the Rosebud, Dunlap and Valentine. The Rosebud types are grayish to brown, deep to shallow, and underlain by sand or bedrock. Four types are represented, the silt loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, and loam. The Dunlap soil (called Dawes) has a heavy upper subsoil. It is best developed in the vicinity of LaMar. The Valentine soils repre - sented by five types are lighter than those of the Rosebud and Dunlap. They show less difference between the soil and subsoil and have a ten - dency to blow. Roads on Perkins Table are good to bad. The hard land roads, ex - cept on the Dunlap silt loam, remain in fair condition without working. They are quite easily graded and maintained. The Dunlap silt loam be - comes rutted and rough when wet, but makes a good road when properly graded and especially so if surfaced with gravel. The Omaha-Lincoln-Denver Highway (O. L. D.) traverses Perkins Plain between Imperial and Holyoke, Colorado. There is a noticeable difference in the condition of this highway in Nebraska and Colorado and not to the credit of our state.

Only a ief review of the factors involved in dirt road work will be attempted. Among the subjects to be outlined are surveys, grading, dragging, and load pat id! Road Survey* — The first thing to do preparatory to the work of con - urtinn it- 10 make ■ road survey. This is a detailed survey including running of levels to determine grades, and the preparation of plans osts. Another line of field investigation has importance It relates to the soil sections, soil types, and such investigations as are lecessary la determine the best combinations of soil materials in making t road bed This requires sounding, collecting samples, and the median- I analysis of samples. Soundings are made with augers. Samples are collected from each part of the soil section. They are studied by he pint its conducting the surveys and by those doing the construction work, but are analyzed to better advantage by the State Conservation and Soil Survey in co-operation with the office of the State Engineer. In the early history of the state, before the land was fenced and ■med. it was not necessary to survey and build roads. Travel followed •easiest routes and water (Figure 39). The tendency now is to build I maintain permanent roads (Figure 40). Grading — The term "grade" has two meanings in road work. Amon I the bringing or a road to grade. This involves cutting neral usage of the term refer* to the making of a placing of road materials. The form thus constructed enerally known as the grade. (Jradini: is done with scrapers and teams and with tractors pulling 1 or blade graders (Figures 41 and 42). The materials are v moved from the sides of the roads to the middle, leaving gutters and lift - ing the bed to a crown. The standard crown in Nebraska is 24 feet wide. with an elevation of 6 inches. The gutter slopes are three to one on the inside, and one and a half on the outside. Evidently this should be modi - lied in place? to suit the soil conditions. In placing the soil materials n a grade, due consideration should be given to the texture of the soils is shown by the section. This means that an attempt should be made to segregate the upper, middle and lower parts of the soil section and to place them in that position in the road which will produce the best re- sults. This can be done when an elevator grader is used. The clay pan run be deposited in or near the base of the road and the surface part of the soil can be used to cover or cap the road, or what is better, the sand In the deeper part of the section can be placed on top for surfacing. Though this procedure cannot be followed at all places, it is feasible and possible on certain stretches of alluvial land. The only choice on most roads is in selecting and segregating the soil textures occurring in the different parts of the section encountered in making the gutter. </seg>

This practice and con- be improved to some extent by segregating the materials brought from the gutters, but the only feasible way to produce more per- carry travel efficiently all the year, is to make a surface in:ir with materials suited for the purpose. &gt;ads are clayey. They need sand and gravel and it requires amount to improve the wearing surface, yet it may need a 4 to 6 inches deep to produce the best results. The gravel can be hauled in wagons or in dump carts, deposited along the middle of the '! with a blade grader when the clay is wet. and disked in. The pravel is taken up by the clay and the road soon reaches a condition In which it is easily maintained and will carry travel under a wide range weather oordition. ads are on silt loam soils.

Gravel will improve a sandy soil making it less subject to blowing, but the combintion lacks the binding quality produced by clay Alkali soils are difficult to handle. Most of them contain fine sandy loam and clay. They need gravel, which if not thoroughly incorporated with the soil, makes a very hard, rough surface. It has been found best in some places to spread a thing layer of sand and gravel when the road is muddy and to harrow or disk this, and to repeat the application when the soil is in a condition suitable for the wor Dragging — This is an important process in road work. The purpos is to make a road smooth, and compact. Few road subjects receiv as much consideration as dragging, ye: the work of dragging has n been perfected. Several conditions can be improved. First, the roads can be built to permit dragging over greater distances by a given person or power. As it is. a road crossing stretches of clay, silt ilr is not ready for dragging in all parts at the same time unequally, making dragged periods of different lengths.

This rough condition of a road bed makes ii.t'l disagreeable and unsafe. The road can be made smooth by th9 I of a planer or a maintainer (Figure 43). The maintainer is suitable also tor trading and for removing snow. Removing Snow— Nebraska has not done much in the way of remov- ing snow from roads . Kansas, on the contrary, has this work well or - ganized. It h particularly noticeable that the roads of that s;ate are In i condition when the snows are deep and melting. One is able to el over a dry road oed bordered by deep snow. The snow is removed the road bed by a simple A-shaped drag drawn by horses, or by a r. or a maintainer. It is pushed into the gutters where it melts in tiiiif without weakening the road bed. The expense is light com- d with the benefits and the removal of snow in this way seems to be cessary process in making dirt roads more permanent. Road Patrol — A road is in some respects like a house. It must be ed after to prevent deterioration.

NEBRASKA HOUSE ROLL 298 PROVIDES FOR A SYSTEM OF STATE HIGHWAYS The Bill which provides (or the laying out of some fish-eight lines ot roads to be designated state highways, is House Roll No. -S)S. The actual alignment of these roads is not definitely determined but the general location alone Is given. The working out of the details, however, will not be difficult, as the County Commissioners ami the State Highway Department are already agreed as to what the location of practically all of these roads should be. The accompanying map shows the principal towns connected by these roads, and the general location of the same. Some effort has been made to increase the mileage of this High - way System. This, however, would be injudicious at this time, for there will not be sufficient money derived from the automobile tax in tue average county to maintain the roads and get them in proper condition if there is any material increase in the mileage planned. After these roads are put in proper condition, our Legislature can increase the inile- r the State Highways in proportion to the money that will b - available year by year for road maintenance. Attention should be called to the fact that this bill &lt;ioe&lt; not refer In any way to federal and state aid, so that in case tho.-e is any money left in a county's apportionment after these roads are put in condition that money can be used immediately on other roads in th.? county HIGHWAYS TRANSPORT COMMITTEES ARE DOING AN IMPORTANT WORK In the Highways Transport Bulletin of the National Committee under date of January 14, the work of the Highways Transport Com - mittee is outlined as follows: (1) The establishment and maintenance of rural m.jtor truck ex - press lines and return loads bureaus. (2) The development of a systematic state-wide system o: motor transportation, including a system of highways suitable tor motor transportation which will reach all parts of the state. NORTHWESTERN NEBRASKA IS NOT OBTAINING ITS PROPER SHARE OF FEDERAL AID Those interested in good roads in the western part of Nebraska are endeavoring to obtain the amendment to the Federal Road Law which </seg>
            <seg id="p464">450 be laid out Post roads. Since Northwestern Nebraska lies largely in the sand hill and canyon hill regions, it is chiefly a grazing land with but few laid out post roads. The provision that Federal Aid and post roads go together means then that a considerable section of our :-'aie cannot avail itself of this opportunity, to obtain Federal assistance in road building. It is hoped that the law may be amended to allow fifty per cent of the roads to be other than Post roads. ENGLAND INTERESTED IN HIGHWAYS TRANSPORTATION The movement for bettei roads is not confined to the United S'J'ies. A great deal of attention is now being directed to the question of trans - portation in England for improving hitherto undeveloped rural ar«aa A Select Committee of the House of Commons was recently appointed to Investigate the whole question of transportation on the Island. THE STATES ARE PLANNING TO SPEND LARGE SUMS ON ROADS About $300,000,000 will be put into road building this year, accord ing to estimates by experts of the Department of Agriculture, submitted to the Division of Public Works and Construction Development of the Department of Labor. But this amount will not be sufficient to make up deferred war construction, it is believed, for normally the amount spent on roads in the United States is not far below $300,000,000. and during war times road building came almost to a stop in many localities Estimates of road expenditure for 1919 have been prepared by Department of Agriculture as follows "•«■« $1,500,000 Rhode Island Mi.o.r.

NORTH PLATTE HOLDS A GOOD ROADS MEETING A good roads meeting, with an attendance of 150. was held at North Plaite, February 11. The object of the meeting was to promote interest in road improvement and to provide also a patrol system for the roads leading out of North Platte. It was estimated that $5,000 would be needed to carry on the patrol work successfully and purchase a truck or tractor and a highway maintainer. In twenty minutes' time all but a tew hundred dollars of this amount was subscribed. Before the meeting adjourned, a committee was appointed to draft Unions approving the Highway Bills now before the Legislature.

OKLAHOMA TO HAVE A BONO ISSUE Oklahoma is contemplating a bond issue of approximately $60,000,000. Careful estimates have been made which show that a road in that Mate can be built, touching every county seat in the state and yet not hHM a mileage in excess of 32.000. This amount of roads can be constructed out of the $50,000,000 bond issue supplemented by such Federal Aid as may be received during the period of time covered by the construction of this system. The automobile tax is producing slightly over $1,000,000 6 year at the present time and under the 1917 State Aid Act. Oklahoma jw taking another $1,000,000 per year out of the gross production tax applying it to state aid on the public highways. OMAHA REPORT OF HOG MARKETING BY TRUCKS A total of 21,486 hogs were hauled in trucks to the Omaha market during the month of January. There were 252 cars used in hauling, of which 52 delivered directly to the packers. PRODUCTS WASTED IN THE SOUTH BECAUSE OF POOR TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES Reports from the South indicate that in some parts of the country. </seg>
            <seg id="p467">453 great quantities of cotton on the ground nave not been moved tor want of adequate transportation facilities. Id many places also, tons of food have gor.p to waste for the same reason. In other instances, carloads of produce would have been available In large quantities in such locali - ties, bad there been transportation facilities for the distribution of these products. The mission of the Bulletin is two-fold: first, to encourage the use ol i he motor truck, especially for short hauls of freight, that the present con - gestion of railway traffic may be relieved, and that food and labor ni:«y be conserved; and secondly, to urge the improvement of public highways as a definite reconstruction policy. HOW IMPROVED ROADS WILL AFFECT THE PRODUCTION AND MARKETING OF FARM PRODUCTS Improved roads will result in lower transportation eosts. The bu»i neas of farming is very dependent upon the condition of the roads be - cause whatever is not produced on the farm must be hauled to the farm and farm products must be hauled to the market. The farmer's profits are limited by transportation costs. If these costs are high his entire profits may be wiped out. For this reason the great agricultural prob - lem of today is the marketing, rather than the production of farm products Improved roads will mean the favorable marketing of farm products Market prices for even staple products vary greatly during the year Where bad roads prevail the farmer is compelled to market his produce not when the price is favorable, but when the roads are in condition for naming. Improved roads will largely prevent the glutting of the market re - sulting: from the moving of product in masses to the market merely to set it marketed while the roads are good. One result of good roads will be. then, the disappearance of the periodical congestion of our markets and the accompanying break in prices. Improved roads will lower storage charges to a large extent. At the present time this country is paying large storage prices on foodstuffs. In Chicago the storage charges on grain equal 12) cents a bushel per year when marketing is distributed throughout the year It will mean that ..lor age charges must decline as fewer warehouses will be necessary. Improved roads will lessen freight congestion in two ways. Th«&gt; strain on railway facilities will be relieved through the use of the motor truck for short hauls of freight, and by the distribution of marketing over longer periods of time since the roads will be passable at all seasons. Improved roads will prevent the waste of product* which are not ef - fectively used because not properly distributed. Apples, for example. Kthe ground In farmers' orchards because poor roads result in pro- I transportation costs. Potatoes retail at high prices m cities while </seg>
            <seg id="p468">454 Ra short distance away they cannot be marketed at a paying price, roads would widen the market, increased available supplies, and lize prices. Improved roads will encourage diversified farming. Farmers sooner or later come to realize that it pays to raise other things than the staple commodities such as corn and wheat. But such products as fruits acri garden truck are perishable. Speed of transportation from the farm to the unloading point is essential. Diversified farming is possible only when road conditions are favorable. Improved roads will increase the area of land used for agricultural purposes. About each market or shipping point a circle may be drawn which will Inclose the area that can be cultivated profitably under exist - ing conditions. The size of this area depends on hauling facilities, im - prove the roads and the area of profitable cultivation will be enlarged. If the roads permit the use of motor trucks the area that may bo culti - vated widens still more. Improved roads will reduce the risks of farming. It requires courage to farm because the whole business is so dependent upon weather condi - tions. Why add to the farmer's already difficult position the uncertainty resulting from unreliable roads Farmers by all means need 365-day BRIGHT PROSPECTS FOR MOTOR HAULING SAYS BABSON S Babson's latest bulletin on advice to sellers under the heading "Trucks »nd Trailers Have a Great Future," contains the following: "A large volume of farm products is wasted for lack of facilities for getting them to market. Notably in Iowa and adjoining regions, this situ - ation is being transformed by the introduction of motor hauling. A motor truck travels from farm to farm collecting the surplus products and car - rying them to market. On the return trip, the truck brings merchandise which the various fanners on the route have ordered. The system, therefore, increases not only the farmer's sales, but his purchases as well. The basis of this enlargement of trade is the conservation of prod - acts heretofore wasted; it is a genuine economic gain. We believe that the con'inued development of motor hauling is a fundamental way to avert the evils of depression. Automotive transportation is a major in - dustry in itself; It is also correlated with the big industries producing road-building materials and equipment. Clients should give close atten - tion to this development, both for the sales opportunities and the larger benefits to business in general. WESTERN COUNTIES TAKE THE LEAD IN AGITATION FOR GOOD ROADS A. S. Mirick, Chief Road Engineer of the State, says that the western part of Nebraska is outdoing the eastern in enthusiasm for road improve- </seg>
            <seg id="p469">455 ruent; that farmers, business men, and all kinds of organizations in the western counties are ready to lend the heartiest support to any worthy movement to bring about better roads. Mr. Mirick further states that the convention of the Sixth Congressional District of the Nebraska Good Roads Association held at Sidney on the fifteenth of this month was the most successful meeting of its kind that he had ever attended. All reports from the Sidney Convention agree that the meeting more than met expectations. The townspeople were out in numbers and many neighboring towns were represented. The people from adjacent :owns arrived by train for the impassable country roads made auto travel out of the question. This situation made the subject of good roads very timely. Whatever the cause — whether western enthusiasm or the bad condi - tion of the roads — the Convention went on record in a clear and com - mendable manner as follows: It endorsed the good roads legislation proposed by the Nebraska Good Roads Association. It announced the intention of standing firmly behind any movement which will tend to bring improved roads to Nebraska. It approved thp work of the State Engineer and the system of ioada as laid out by him. It agreed to call the attention of our state senator! and representa - tives to the proposed measures for good roads endorsed by the Nebraska Good Roads Association. It resolved to ask our congressmen and senators to push the Senator Smoot National Road Bill and its appropriations. It endorsed the Road Institute to be held at the University of Ne - braska. March 3-10. It favored Motor Transport Service as outlined by the state bureau and urged co-operation with that bureau. It urged each county represented at the convention to form a tempo - rary organisation then and there which could later be converted into a permanent organization for road improvement. It took a stand on the problem arising from road construction over railroad right of way. Since it has been ruled that federal funds cannot be spent on such roads, it was resolved to ask our congressmen and sen* tors to support some practical measure which would give the state the right to condemn or acquire a sufficient width from such right of way as was necessary for tne highways. At the conclusion of the meeting ninety - ■lx were admitted to the membership of the Good Roads Association. The next meeting of the sixth congressional district of the Nebraska </seg>

Mehren "Ten years ago the highways of this country were subject to a traffic scarcely different from that which they had borne In Revolutionary days. In fact, the traffic was not much different from that which the Romans had imposed on their roads nineteen centuries ago. Indeed highway transportation has changed to a greater extent in the past tea years than it did in all the nineteen hundred years preceding. The motor vehicle is responsible for this revolution in conveyance, and to it is due the stress to which our roads are subjected. Growth of Motor Vehicle Traffic A decade ago the automobile was In Us Infancy. Today 6.6M.004 motor vehicles *rc In service &amp;&amp;d of tbcsQ 11 Is osttXDAtod tb&amp;t 500,000 &amp;r% </seg>
            <seg id="p472">458 commercial cars, ranging from the light delivery wagons to heavy trucks. Figures have not been compiled as to the number of passenger miles totaled in automobiles every year, nor as to the ton-mileage of freight hauled. H. W. Perry, secretary of the Commercial Vehicle and Good Roads Committee of the National Automjble Chamber of Commerce, made an estimate in 1916, however, that gives ground for an interesting com - parison. There were in use then 3,000,000 passenger automobiles. Allow - ing an average of 5.000 miles per year per car, and assuming an average number of passengers per car as three; he obtained a passenger mileage per year of 45,000,000,000. Since that time the number of passenger tnobiles in use has increased to 5,000,000 and even if we discount Mr 's figures heavily and accept with the larger number of cars in his total of passenger miles, 45,000,000,000. we still find that the ;s exceed that for the railways of the United States in the year 1816, which was 34,000,000,000 passenger miles. In the same estimate, published in "Engineering Record" January 20. 1917. p. 112, Mr. Perry concludes that the commercial motor vehicles of the country performed a service of 3,750,000,000 ton-miles when there were 250.000 commercial vehicles in use. He assumed an average of 50 miles per day, 300 working days per year, and two tons per load, with half the mileage traveled loaded. This appears to be a very liberal estimate, but if his figure is twice as large as the facts, the traffic would now, with a doubling of the number of commercial cars, have caught up to his estimate, and surely • freight traffic of 3,750,000,000 tons is not a negligible item. It is not now possible to ascertain what percentage of this passenger •ad freight mileage was carried over rural roads and what portion over city streets. The figures are quoted merely to give an idea of the mag - nitude of the instrumentality — the motor vehicle — which has Introduced the new and troublesome factor into highway construction and main - tenance, and has raised highways into one of the foremost of national problems. Another measure of the new importance of highway trans - portation is indicated by the total annual expenditure for highway work. The Bureau of Public Roads gives the cash expenditure on highways for the year 1915 as t267.0OO.0OO. This already large sum is sure to be rapidly Increased because of the attitude on highway improvement in every part of the country. It is hardly necessary to call attention to the fact that two $60,000,000 bond issues authorized in New York State have been followed by a $50,000,000 authorization in Pennsylvania and a $60. 000,000 authorization in Illinois. </seg>
