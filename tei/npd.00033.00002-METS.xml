Cowgill, succeeded Commissioner W. J. Furse. who had temporarily appointed to fill said vacancy. The term of Commissioner H. J. Winnett will expire January 9, 1913, and he will be succeeded by Commissioner-Elect H. G. Taylor. The secretary of the Comnn since its inception. Clark Perkins, resigned his position, effective Jan - i.ary 1, 1912. and was succeeded by A. B. Allen. I "he present organization of the Commission is as foil. Winnett, Chairman: Henry T.

I The personnel of the engineering department, having chart - ers pertaining to physical valuation, is as follows: E. C. Hurd. engineer; C. H. Gerber, principal assistant engineer; E. W. k -of-way valuator; E. J. Kates, mechanical statistician: Guy Barnes A. H. Edgren, assis'ant engineers; Ina Totten. Mary Woods. Ber- Harlan, clerks; Frances M. Hills, stenographer. LEGISLATION. K'he legislature of 1911 enacted a number of important laws af - g the powers and duties of the Commission, to some of whith nee is here made: B«nate File No. 115 — To regulate and control public stock yards, ; the State Railway Commission jurisdiction to regulate the e, tolls and charges thereof, and declaring such stock yards on carriers. ■Under the operation of this liw, numerous informal complaints been filed with the Commission, involving questions concerning </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 rates and Berviee, principally affecting the Union Stock Yards of South Omaha. These complaints have been adjusted by the Commission upon their merits and, in the main, to the satisfaction of tie parties in interest. One formal (omplaint has been filed under the sta'uie above referred to, namely, Ralston v. Cnion Stock Yards Company, F. 155, in which it was charged that the defendant company discrimi - nated in favor of resident dealers and speculators and against outsid. - shippers in that the former were furnished the best hay while the latter were compelled to take an inferior grade at a high price. A hearing was held and an opinion ultimately rendered, which is re - ported in full in Part 111. h House Roll No. 33 — To protect the lives of- the traveling public the employes of the railroads by regulating the size and construc - of caboose cars, and empowering the State Railway Commission •ant an extension of time for compliance therewith. This law does not become fully operative until June 1, 1914, but our information is that the railroads are adapting their caboose cars to the provisions of the act as fast as saij cars are taken to the shops for repairs. By the time of the effective date the transformation of equipment will undoubtedly have been completed. Kouse Roll No. 197 — To provide for the use of railroad rigtat - • by live stock shippers by requiring the construction of storm for temporary shelter of live stock awaiting shipment, and giving ite Railway Commission power of enforcement. Ed actions have been brought before the Commission under this Apparently the railroads have granted to shippers the con - is provided by the law. Senate File No. 228 — To require all railroad companies operat - ing in Nebraska to build and maintain sheds for the protection of hogs at all hog shipping yards, and giving the State Railway Commis - sion power to enforce such provisions or to grant an extension of time for compliance therewith. EThe application of this law is restricted to yards from which net than forty cars of hogs are shipped per annum. The roads have erally complied without protest, but in a few instances it has been ?ssary for aggrieved shippers to file complaint with the Commis - . The issue has usually hinged upon the question of the amount stock shipped. As soon as the obligation was determined, the Is have promptly complied with the Commission's orders that quate sheds be erected. House Roll No. 269 — To prescribe the waterway dimensions of rai'rnad bridges and giving the State Railway Commission power of relief in certain cases. I This law became operative July I, 1912. Only one or two mat - connected therewith have been brought to the attention of the mission, and these were of minor importance. The presumption at the law is fulfilling its mission. Senate File No. 2 22 — Amending the Banning Demurrage Act of 1909 by giving the State Railway Commission authority to act upon complaint </seg>
            <seg id="p009">t NKBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION By virtue of this amendment the Commission has UMrehu ity over numerous informal demurrage complaints and has been d to effect a speedy settlement. Senate File No. 242 — To provide for direct appeals from th. Railway Commission to the Supreme Court, and prescribing procedure. Ehis law has been invoked in but two instances, but it is a •ary provision, eliminating the delay which would naturally to the prosecution of appeals through inferior courts. E Senate Kile No. 319 — To require common carriers to furnish men to protect shipments of freight, and giving the State Kail - 'ommission jurisdiction over the employment and duties of such men, and giving said Commission jurisdiction over track s by common carriers for the purpose of weighing carload freight. E House. Roll No. 71 — To promote the safety of employes and velers upon railroads by limiting the hours of service of employer-. I giving the State Railway Commission power to enforce, or relieve iporarily from, the provisions thereof. Senate File No. 328 — Declaring irrigation works common carriers and giving the State Railway Commission power to fix reasonable rates for the delivery of water. The question of the jurisdiction of the Commission under this stat - ute was raised in Formal Complaint No. 14 7. Mead v. Cozad I C nipany. In an opinion rendered by the Attorney (Jeneral, dated July 2. 191-2, it is held that the authority of the Commission is confini-il ■oldjr to rates and does not cover general control over irrigation works nor service. See opinion in Formal Complaint No. 14 7. H. ' Mead et al v. Cozad Canal Co., Part III., also Attorney Oeneral's opin - ion, Part IV. In former annual reports a number of pertinent recommendation* made by the Commission concerning needed legislation. ?8e have since been enacted into law. Others failed to • athies of our law-makers and are here again submitted, in that the legislature of 1913 may give to them the attention which importance demands: B Provision that all moneys turned into the treasury as fees ted by this department be appropriated for the use of the tment in addition to other appropriations. B Amendment of subdivision lo), section 2. of the Railway lission Act to include all common carriers under the jurisdiction s Commission in the statistical report required to be made annu - o the Governor. B Elimination of item 11, subdivision (o). section 2, Railway lission Act, requiring a statement in the annual report of "the ?e amount of tonnage that can be carried over each road in ate with an engine of given power." K Amendment of subdivision (a), section 5, to provide for the r in writing or satisfaction of a complaint as to rates before ing a date for hearing thereon. K5. Extension of time for filing reports by common carriers ear ending June 30th, from August 1st to September 1st; broad - ; the scope of section 9, requiring such reports, so as to specific - include and call for detailed information applicable to express anies, telegraph companies, telephone companies, street car com- </seg>

Extension of the Commission's powers to include the award - ing of reparation in cases where rates are found to be excessive or discriminatory. (See order of the Commission in the matter of formal complaint No. 41. Samuel Rat/, et al v. C. St. P. M. * &lt;). Ky. « .... 77-83, Second Annual Report.) Br. Amendment of subdivision (g). section 14, to provide that in exceptions may be made under the anti-discrimination statute vor of other classes of traffic than freight, provided the legis - ■ shall consider such exceptions desirable. Bl. Amendment of subdivision (&lt;■). section 15, to provide that •w rate, schedule or classification may be made effective until ved by the Commission. Ki. Amendment of subdivision (f), section 14, to provide for unishment of shippers as well as railway officers and emp! of false billing of freight. RIO. Correction of a "joker" injected into the anti-pass law by egislature of 1909, whereby it is made neces.-ary for the state ■ove the use, as well as the acceptance, of a pass in order to e conviction. bjl. The enactment of a law providing for track connections to industries besides grain elevators on practically the same terms e now enjoyed by grain elevators exclusively. 12. Provision for taxing costs in cases arising before the Com - mission, wherein it becomes necessary to subpoena witnesses, and disposing of funds accumulating therefrom. During the past year there has been no material change in the status of the litigation pending in the federal court, affecting the va - lidity and reasonableness of the maximum passenger rate law and th&gt; - (ommodity freight rate law, passed by the legislature of 1907. Decisions are due at any time and must seemingly be handed down in the near future, the issues having long since been joined. However, the state if losing nothing by the delay, all the benefits of both laws kaTlag been secured to the people, pending the litigation, by the prompt a&lt; - tion of the Attorney-General, who. acting for the Commission, en - joined the railroads from disobeying said laws, thus reversing the usual procedure in such cases. As a result, the reduced passenger rates, and freight rates on certain commodities, have been in fonv ever since the laws were passed and will doubtless so continue. Mian the ultimate .decision of the court should be against the state, which hardly seems probable in v'ew of the showing made. ■ is conservatively estimated that the saving to the publi - h the operation of these two enactments approximates up to esent time about $15,000,000.00. Neither have the carriers 1MTK TASKS. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 11 I't-Hii corresponding losers, for the increased business on account of reduced rates has largely offset the reduction. The Minnesota rate cases, in which Nebraska is vitally inter' are still pending in the I'nited States supreme court, on appeal from the decision of Judge W. H. Sanborn. of the Eighth District circuit court. These cases were submitted on brief, in which a number of western states, including Nebraska, had a part, and were also heard on oral argument January S, 1912. The Sanborn decision is so oppo - site to the views held by the states and commissions as to their rate - making and regulatory powers that the possibility of its affirmation is viewed with alarm. Nebraska is indirectly interested because Um underlying principles of commission control are at stake, and an miI - \erse decision by the Supreme Court would render futile much of thf work accomplished in the past six years in the regulation of common OTHKK UTHJATIOX.

            <seg id="p012">12 FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT FREIGHT CLASSIFICATION. The history of the preparation and adoption of Nebraska Cla.-.- - flcation No. 1 is given in the Fourth Annual Report, pages 12 and 1 ::. This classification became effective December 15, 1911. Its operation has been generally satisfactory to Nebraska shippers and has ampe - re warded the time and expense necessary to its preparation. A few - omissions and needed changes were called to the attention of the Commission during the year 1912 and on July 31 a public hearing was held for the purpose of revision, to which the representatives of car - riers and shippers were invited to be present. This hearing i pied but a part of one day, there being but few items for considerativ),.. The data and information gleaned from this hearing have since embodied in Supplement No. 1 to Nebraska Classification No. 1, - September 7, 1912, and, by the terms of General Order No. -•&gt;. effective November 1, 1912. The Commission recognizes that Ne - braska Classification, in order to be kept up to date, will require rection and revision from time to time, and it is the intention to a supplement, or make complete revision, at least once a year, ami frequently if necessary. Ei Part VI. will be found a detailed report of the Commit. ering deparment, covering in brief its activities for the ermining the physical valuation of various common carr of the work laid upon this department was of a special chara - necessary by pending complaints and investigations before the ission. The valuations of the several steam railroads operating in the state, as found by the department, are given in the Fourth Annual Report, Part VII. During the present year notices were served, in compliance with law, upon the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Co., Union Pacific Railroad Co.. Missouri Pacific Railway Co.. Chi - cago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Co., St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island Railway Co., Omaha Bridge &amp; Terminal Co.. Chicago, Milwauk St. Paul Railway Co., Chicago Great Western Railroad Co., Wabash Railroad Co.. and Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co., to the effect that the Commission had completed its appraisal of the var - ious properties, quoting the values as found, and fixing specific dates on which the representatives of the various corporations might "appear and show cause why such valuation as found by the Commission should be raised or lowered, or amended or changed in any particular." Kn response to these notices, a number of the respondent com - s appeared on the dates indicated and presented their objections i Commission's appraisals, offering in lieu thereof the figures PHYSICAL VAI.l'ATIOX </seg>
            <seg id="p013">13 than the values as asertained by the Commission's engineers. When it is recalled that the ascertainment of these physical values is tor the primary purpose of rate making, the contention of the carriers I The Omaha Bridge &amp; Terminal Co., Chicago, Milwaukee I Railway Co., Chicago Great Western Railroad Co.. Wabash Rail- Co, and Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. entered no arance at the time set for hearing, their interests in the state ? comparatively small and they being evidently satisfied with 'onimission's appraisals. The Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railway Co.'s hearing began De - cember 19, 1911, and continued intermittently until February 2, 1912, — thirteen sessions in all. Consideration of the Union Pacific's appraisal commenced February 21, 1911, and, through successive adjournments, ended July 3&lt;tth, — ten sittings. The Missouri Pacific appraisal was considered and concluded on the om' date, Man ; The Burlington hearings began April IT. 1912, occupied five sessions, and were ended August 6th. The St. Joseph Ai Grand Island hearings were held September 10th, 11th and 17th. K Several of the respondent companies- were directed to file briefs ipport of their respective contentions but only the North W iad compiled up to the close of the year. The Commission has as yet entered no formal order in the n of any of the valuations above referred to. Th&gt; •veral reasons for the delay. The relation of certain elements of valuation to the whole are not clearly defined. Among these may be mentioned Contingencies. General Expenditures. Adapmt ion and Soli Hi. of Roadway, Engineering and Superintendence, Heal Estate. Right - of-Way, Station and Terminal Fa&lt; ilitit s. Eminent author agree as to the valuation status of these items, anil such disagreement accounts in the main for the difference in values as found by the Commission's experts and the carriers' engineers. Such latrfc tions as these are involved in the Minnesota ran referred to, and when these cases are finally adjudicated the relation of the mooted items to the physical valuation of transportation erties will, it is believed, be definitely and accurately fixed. Com - missions will then have a sure foundation for fixing valuation find - ings, whereas at present there is uncertainty and doubt. A mistake at this stage of the proceedings might prove very serious and the Commission believes it the part of discretion to make haste slowly. TELEPHONE ACTIVITY. B During the past year a radical change has taken place in the rship, control and management of many telephone properties, i of the larger companies have made mutual transfers of their </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 Interests in certain districts, and have also taken over numerous smaller companies. The movement is still going on and it is not im probable that in time the telephone business of the state will be in the hands of a few large concerns. It is not necessary to here discuss the fundamental reasons which have occasioned the change. Suffice it to say that the movement is on and that with it is entailed upon the Commission a vast amount of additional labor. The various mergers have raised, and will continue to raise, numerous serious and perplexing problems concerning rates, service, connections, switching arrangements, valuations, etc., some of which are so' intricate in nature and far-reaching in consequence that much preparation and investi- gation must necessarily be given to their solution. At the present time the Commission is engaged in some very important proceedings along these lines. The immediate future has in prospect a number of cases of equal magnitude, and it is safe to assume that telephone con- troversies during the next two years will tax the Commission's resources to the limit. COMPLAINTS AND APPLICATIONS. During the year just closed 398 informal complaints have beci filed with the Commission, which may be classified as follows: Station facilities 25 Telephone service 41 Discrimination 18 Crossing facilities 10 Overcharge 102 Right-of-way fences, etc 8 Excessive rates 33 Train service 4 2 Express service 12 Lom, damage or delay in transit 21 Car service 11 Stock yards, sidetracks, sites, scales, etc 17 Classification 6 Miscellaneous 52 Total 398 Disposition was made of 460 informal complaints during the same period: Satisfied 247 Insufficient information furnished, dismissed 35 Formal complaint necessary, dismissed 36 No cause of action, dismissed II No jurisdiction, dismissed 70 </seg>

Clarke, Commissioner. After various hearings and decisions as to parts of the controversy, the matter had at the hearing held February 5, 1911, narrowed itself down to an application on the part of the Lincoln Traction Company for authority to increase its rate of fares from six tickets for 25 cents to a straight five-cent fare, whereupon this Commission rendered an opinion on May 17, 1911. deferring final action in the matter until January 1. 1912, in order that further and more definite data might be gathered covering a further period, as set out in detail in said opin - ion, wherein certain abnormal conditione, urged as having obtained in the past, might be avoided and a further practical test made and dem - onstration be given as to whether or not the amount theretofore au - thorized by the Commission to be set aside and charged to operating expenses for maintenance and depreciation was adequate, whether the ( harge to the light and power departments for energy furnished was proper or subject to change or modification, and when such informa - tion was presented, whether upon proper adjustments, if any, are found necessary to be made, the net income remaining was, under pres - ent conditions sufficient to pay a fair return on the property used in the conduct of the business. Before coming to a hearing, in conformity to said opinion and or - der of May 17, 1911, and on March 16, 1912, The Lincoln Traction Company filed and amended its petition, withdrawing and dismissing its application for a five-cent fare as to the city of Lincoln, but spe - cifically retaining its application as to Havelock, College View and I'niversity Place, and asking for a continuance in order that certain data might be procured and presented to the Commission in support of the said application. To this the city of Havelock, the city of I'ni - versity Place and the village of College View filed answers and objec - tions on June 1, 1912. The hearing was set for May 28th, and all parties being present, the hearing was by agreement adjourned to June 1st and the taking of testimony completed on June 4th. Preliminary and prior to the hearing, this Commission had caused Bier and exhaustive investigation and examination of the affairs Lincoln Traction Company to be made by its accountants. .

This report covered in the operation for the calendar year 1911, for the thirty-five i from February 1, 1909, to December 31, 1911. expenditures for ire period for additions and betterments as well as maintenance railway plant; the cost of producing electric current; the average </seg>

The value so shown in the report to be used as a basis for earnings is $2. - .'44.639.54. The value of the depreciable property is $1.s4n,i"&gt; The defendants claimed that the values so founJ are and should be reduced by reason of depre&lt; iation in plant by reason of cer - tain pieces of real estate not actually used in the conduct of the busi - ness, and several certain small pieces of track not now in actual use. The report and the testimony show that deduction had been made for certain track abandoned, as well as for certain machinery, and that tlMM were not included in the value stated above. Certain other track, which is not now in actual use. as shown by the testimony of the company, is needed for certain emergencies or may be used in cer - tain re-acrangements contemplated, and we cannot see any justification for any further deduction which in any event would be a small amount, and would not materially affect the outcome of this controversy. This applies equally to the various small pieces of real estate not now in actual use but apparently acquired for legitimate purposes. As to the depreciation, the testimony shows that the operating efficiency of the plant is better now than it was several years ago. and is probably as good as may be ordinarily expected by current maintenance to keep it, excepting only as to the rolling stock, and as to this, it is more a ques - tion of obsolescence than inefficiency. Taking all these matters into consideration, the Commission is of the opinion that the amounts stated are a fair valuation as bases for earnings and depreciation. If, as is claimed by the defendants, the value should be reduced by reason of depreciation, then, on the other hand, operating expenses would necessarily need to be increased by the amount of depreciation assignable to the period la question, and would necessarily reduce the net income so that in so far as this controversy ncerned the result would be practically the same in that such smaller income would produce no greater, and in all probability a lefser, percentage of net income on the reduced value than is shown in the reports, but this Commission feels that when proper provision is made for depreciation and maintenance through charges against opera - tion, the better policy is to permit an income on the full value of the property rather than on the depreciated value. ■The defendants strenuously urge that the net profits of the light, r and heat subsidiary departments of the Lincoln Traction Com- </seg>
            <seg id="p098">98 FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT pany should be included, and that when so included, would show ade - quate returns upon the value of the property without any increase in rates, but the Commission can see no reason to change its views with regard to the matter of jurisdiction over these subsidiary plants, and adheres to its opinion heretofore rendered in that regard (Third Annual Report, pages 133-138), feeling that when it has seen to it that ade - quate compensation conies to the railway department for any energy furnished to these subsidiary departments, it has done its full duty within the law and has no right to go further. The company claims that the 2% cents per kilowatt, charged by the railway to the light and power department by virtue of the orders of the Railway Commission, is much in excess of the actual cost of the production of the said current, and that it produces a profit to the railway department which is not by it legitimately earned, and thus enables a showing of adequate returns which are not in fact present. An examination of schedule live, attached to the report of our examiners, together with the testimony given on this matter, shows that the 2 V4 cents is in fact more than necessary to cover the cost. The testimony also shows that in figuring interest on the values of the power plant it was by our examiners figured on the basis of the value as of December 11, ttll, for the purpose of prognosticating probable costs for the future, but we are inclined to think that the contention of the company that interest should have been calculated on the average value of the plant during the period is more nearly right, and this would still further reduce the cost from that shown in schedule 5. The excess charge, when we considtr the abnormally high cost of fuel dur - ing a part of this period, the somewhat abnormal expenditures for main - tenance during a part of the period, is at least ten per cent., and for the year 1911 at this rate would reduce the showing of net income to the railway company, under proper adjustment, by $8403.62, and to this extent the income for the year 1911, as shown under the various bases in schedule 6 of exhibit "A," should be reduced. While we feel that this matter of excess charge for the current furnished to the light and power department, as shown by the examination, should be taken into consideration in this case, yet we do not authorize a change in the amounts set up on the books from month to month, as we feel that at no time should the cost exceed the charge against these depart - ments, and as the experience of the past has shown, abnormal condi - tions may. through excessive coal costs or accidents in the plant, raise the cost beyond the figures set at any time. The Commission feels that ample provision should be made to meet any unforeseen contingencies, accidents or abnormal conditions, which the experience of the past demonstrates are likely to occur at any period, and while it is unfair that rates for transportation should be based upon undue profits derived from the subsidiary departments or excessive charges made for energy furnished to them, no final harm can come to the corporation by reason of some slight excessive charges in </seg>
            <seg id="p099">99 these accounts, so long as these questions are given due consideration when the question of adequate rates for the transportation department is under consideration. The other important matter in connection with this case, and th&gt; - one which has brought out the most testimony, is the question of maintenance and depreciation. The Commission, in its opinion filed July 30, 1910, authorized the company to set up an amount from month to month equivalent to five per cent, per annum on the de - preciable property, not as an amount definitely found as sufficient, but to be used until experience should demonstrate whether or not the amount was adequate for the purposes intended. The company hast uniformly claimed that the amount was not sufficient and the ny« of the thirty-five months preceding December 31. 1911. demonstrati&gt; to some extent that this is true. For the year 1911 the expenditures were practically $15,000.00 in excess of the amount authorized by the Commission in the opinion above referred to. For the first year of this thirty-five months period, the amount was far short of the amount allowed, but the testimony tends to demonstrate that the charges were not sufficient to keep the plant up in proper condition, and that part of the expenditures made in the succeeding twenty-four months were necessitated by reason of the neglect during that period. Schedule 4 of exhibit "A" shows the total maintenance costs for the thirty-five months period to have been $276,033.10, an average of |»4,l annum. The expenditure for the calendar year 1911 was $1' The average per month expended for the thirty-five months period was $7,886.66 and for the year 1911 the average per month expended was $8,946.97, and while considerable money lias during this period expended for current maintenance and repairs of rolling stock, it lias permitted no complete replacement of any rolling stock, nor has It possible, under the allowance, to set up a credit balance in the depre - ciation reserve account to care for depreciation of plant which susceptible of repair and upkeep from month to month. The testimony also shows that the operating efficiency of the plant is somewhat ! now than at the beginning of the period under investigation. In words, that in part at least the neglect in this account of the past has been somewhat made up during the past twenty-four months by expen - ditures in excess of the average. There were also some extraordinary expenditures necessitated and made by troubles in the power plant, anil with a proper allowance for depreciation and maintenance in the future, neither of these two contingencies ought to again arise, except - ing in case of some unforeseen accident. The Commission is fully con - vinced that the allowance for depreciation and maintenance should be for the future 5 hi per cent, of the depreciable value of the plant, and that this allowance, under careful supervision of expenditures, should permit of gradual replacement of cars as well as slight and gradual accretions in the depreciation reserve for provision against unforeseen contingencies and such depreciation in the plant as is not susceptible of repair end upkeep from month to month. </seg>
            <seg id="p100">100 Schedule 6 of exhibit "A" shows calculations for the year 1911 made on the basis of 5^i% depreciation and maintenance charge, which results in a net income of $1 40,002.2k. When we deduct from this the admitted excess charge of $8,403.62 for current furnished to the light and power department, the net income left is 1131,61 which is 5.86% on the value of the plant, as shown in schedule 1 of exhibit "A," and while operation for 1911, on the theory of •"■ maintenance and depreciation (which is less in 1911 than the actual expenditures), indicates sufficient net earnings to save the matter from a claim of confiscation, yet when the claim of excess charge for current to light and power, which is clearly shown, is considered, then the in - come Is too near the danger line and leaves no provision for lean years cr other unforeseen demands on the company's revenues for abnormal conditions or losses which may arise at any time. Under the application and pleadings, as they now stand, the only source for added revenue to overcome the present condition and fur - nish sufficient revenue to produce fair return on the value of the prop - erty is the problematical growth in the business and the advai. fares to the three suburban towns named in the amended application. The growth for the future cannot be directly considered in the ques - tion of placing the company in position, so far as may lie within the jurisdiction and powers of this Commission, to earn a fair return under all the circumstances in the immediate present, and fairness to the com - pany, as well as to all public- service corporations, demands that so long as tn~ charge necessary to produce a fair return is not excessive or unusual nor produces unjust discrimination, it is the duty of this Commission to see that when it is appealed to such rates be enforced. An investigation of the company's statistics shows as to these lines the following conditions: College View line via Fourteenth Street, total mileage 5.19: College View line via Normal, total milage 6.25; University Place, total mileage, 5.69; Havelock, total mile - age. 7.26. As against these distances, the longest line strictly within the city limits is 2.88 miles on the Sumner line. The longest distance traveled on any of the lines within the city is on the University Place and Havelock line. 3.r.8 miles, and next, on the College View lines, 3 miles. The next longest line which is within the city and in part without is the line to Epworth Park. 3.38 miles, and the line to the penitentiary, 3.36 miles, and next, to Lincoln Park, 3.07 miles. It will be noted that the longest lines next to these under consideration are, in their total length, short of the distance traveled within the city on the University Place and Havelock lines, and there is no question that the service rendered in transporting a passenger from within the city to College View, University Place or Havelock. on any of the four lines, is much in excess of the service rendered on any of the other lines, be : ing more than double to Havelock and College View via Normal, and almost double in the other two cases. The city of Havelock and the city of University Place contend by their attorneys that the lines of the </seg>

They also claim that the in - uacy of returns on the whole property gives no proper found he establishment of zones. BA careful investigation of the situation in many of the eftfc ast, where traction companies operate lines beyond the city limits ind into the surrounding suburbs, discloses the fact that the pract railway companies to fix rates of fare on the zone basis is quite intl. Some of these zones are large, some rather small, depending pou local conditions, density of population, difficulty of operation, and mam within certain zones or locality's of frequently v - • laces. such as amusement parks, and it will be found that the law gen - rally has not set definite limits on the fares beyond inhibiting gener - illy a charge greater than live cents for one continuous rile within &gt;oundaries of incorporated cities or villages, and to say that - harges must be just and reasonable. The practice generally. ■ :ones are established, is found to be that the companies charge ;i ent fare in each zone. These zones have, of course, arbitrary limits, ind would appear to passengers who are just over the limits of the 'i work a considerable hardship, and this generally exists iktri I system as now in effect exists. In a decision of the Hoard of c Utility Commissioners of New Jersey, December 11. 1911 tion, which in the opinion of this Commission would seem to t&gt; - remedy for such inequalities, would lie in a rather radical dc from the present system, which they describe in the following ar and logical language: "We incline to believe that eventually the entire sone t) together with the flat five-cent fare, will have to be rephic e 1 by ■ more rational and equitable system of charges. The rationa tern would seem to be a uniform basic charge alike for all pas - sengers, plus a charge varying roughly with the length of the actual ride. The justification, roughly speaking, for such a basis, is as follows: — Every passenger upon a trolley car requires from the motorman and conductor practically an identical ser\ : having the car stop twice and in having the fare collected. B passenger also, irrespective of the length of his ride, beneii the extensions, maintenance and operation of certain parts of the transportation property, such as the electric plant with its supply of power. It would therefore appear that a uniform contribution or basic charge might be justly collected from every adult ms - senger. irrespective of the length of his journey on the car. and above the uniform service rendered to every passenger, there is a service which roughly varies with the length of the ride which the passenger takes. There is more current generated and used, the longer the ride, as well as greater wear and tear upon the car and other apparatus. Both the cost to the company and the pre - sumed benefit of the service to the passenger are greater the longer the total ride enjoyed by the passenger. It would thus appear that a uniform basis rate or charge, which permits, without addi- </seg>
            <seg id="p102">102 FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT ional charge, a ride of short but definite length, might properly ae accorded for a uniform basic fare, and that every mile or frac - tion thereof in excess should be paid for at a stipulated rate par mile. If, for example, the basic rate of five cents and a rate per mile were set, for example, at a cent per mile, we should have a system of charges more equitable to the company and its patrons than the present haphazard plan. The present system depends on a sufficient number of short rides to offset the low mileage rates for those who traverse long distances. It is the correlative of an arbitrary zone system which, with its sharp demarcations, creates* a not altogether unfounded feeling of injustice on the part of those who are inconveniently situated as regards zone limits. Precisely what price should be charged for the basic part of the fare, and what rates per mile for the excess distance over the minimum ride covered by the basic fare, are practical questions which experience must determine, but that economical necessity will eventual tablish such a system seems as probable as it is necessary." I 'he argument contained above appears to this Commission rea le and along the proper lines of adjust ng rates between tli • r and the shorter rides, and the company, in making its appli ■.-•» - seems to have done so along these lines, rather than along thu nary lines of arbitrarily collecting a separate full fare for each or part thereof. The testimony discloses that the company estimates that a change from the six for a quarter rate to a flat five-cent fare, on all the lines extending beyond the limits of the city of Lincoln, would increase their gross revenues approximately JlO.OOti.UO per annum, but when this increase of fare is applied only to the College View, Havelock and I'ni - -.&lt;r.sity Place lines, we are of the opinion that the prospective addition to the gross revenue will hardly reach $8.(100.00 per annum, assuming that the result from such increase would produce an added gross revenue of $8,000JMi applied to the lines named, and taking as a basis for figuring the last calculation made on schedule 6 of exhibit "A," which shows the operating income for the year 1911, on the basis of 5^4% of depreciable value expended for maintenance and de - preciation, after deducting taxes, to be $ 1 4 *&gt;.«xi 2. 28 and by adding thereto this $8,000.00, estimated increase to be realized by a change from six for a quarter to five-cent fares on the College View, Havelook and University Place lines, and deducting for excess charge made for current furnished to the light and power department, $8,403.62. the net revenue then left would be $139,r&gt;98.66, or 6.2% on the value of the plant, as above found, provided no unforeseen accidents or abnormal conditions shall arise to further reduce it. It is to be noted that pursuant to an order of this Commis.si in. ed on April ."&gt;, 1912. in connection with application No. 1856, the any was ordered to reduce the value of the plant account, is a by their books, in the sum of $49,485.06 for charges therer &gt;- made to said account and entered in by reason of consolidation ises. $18,098.83, and discounts and expenses in connection with </seg>

This constitutes a still further reduction annually of the amount of net profit remaining to the Traction Coii - pany and would place the net return, as now indicated bv the account. still closer to the danger line of insufficient returns.

The lan- I used in said opinion as to this particular point, was as follows: "That the company is not receiving a fair return on the actual value of its property, and that the present showing discourages capital investment, there can be no doubt. T'.iis is purely a mathe - matical problem, capable of demonstration to anyone willing to lay aside prejudice and base judgment on facts. The Commission will, for the present, defer action as to relief from this unfortunatf situation, and will hold in abeyance any ruling in that regard. "The Commission will hold, however, that regardless of financial embarrassment to the company, the existing discrimina - tion against Havelock must be removed, and that until such time as it may be found practicable to establish zone rates for the city of Lincoln and surrounding suburbs, the Havelock rate should not be higher than the rate to other suburbs whose lines posses&gt; earning power."

However this case is considered from the standpoint of public policy, as as from the standpoint of exact justice, it is my belief that the if Lincoln will be the loser by the issuance of ths order, and that 'raction Company will not be relieved of its embarrassment. The findings in this case indicate the presumption that the addi - tional revenue provided for is sim;:ly for the purpose of carry'ng the company beyond the danger line of confiscation. My understanding of the duties of a Commission, as arbiter between thost- who serve and those who are served, is not that it should simply protect from th* confiscation line, but that it should permit pul&gt;i ; ; sen c corporations to earn a sufficient amount on a fair ratasUwa, to encouragv capital ••&gt; invest in surh public utilities as the people may demand. I it is my belief that a straight nve-icnt fare for the entre system, the cxctption of school children, and a f;iur-cent fare for persons ;o to their work before 7:30 a. n., would place the Traction C on a fair earning basis, and, all things considered, would prove policy for the city of Lincoln. H. .1. WIN'NETT. Chairman. City of Havt'liM-k. Complainant vs. The Lincoln Traction Company. Defendant. rthe Matter of the Application of Defendant Company to Increase Its Rate of Fares. Hall, Commissioner: (Dissenting in part. &gt; I concur in the opinions of Commissioners Winnett and Clarke in so far as they hold that the percentage set aside for depreciation reserve should be t% '■', instead of 5%, but do not agree with them in their or - der in raising the fares from six tickets for a quarter to straight five - in the outside zone which they establish. Kissenting in part as I do, I feel called upon to state my reasons doing, and will undertake to do so without going into an extended sion of the great mass of statistics which have been compiled by ommission's departments. The Commission at one time fixed the amount upon which the com - pany might earn dividends, which now amounts to $2,244,639.54, by reason of additions and betterments that have been made since said finding. This amount also includes $300,000.00 which was allowed by the Commission to be capitalized, which represents former costs, good will, going value, etc., etc. Then, in order to ascertain what the com - pany was making on the above amount, it was necessary to know that the plant was being maintained and kept up in a good state of repair. </seg>
            <seg id="p107">NKHRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 107 »&lt;.• it was therefore necessary to provide for a depreciation reserve fund which should be used for such purposes. Accordingly, on July 10, lUlo, an order was issued by the Commission, which required the company to take out of gross earnings an amount equal to i% on the depreciable property of the plant, which was to be set aside as a depreciation reserve fund, and that the fund so created should be used to take care of the depreciation of the plant. Of course, this could be only an experiment, us it was impossible to say what amount would lie necessary to main - tain the plant in as good condition in the future as it was in the past. The experience of the plant since the issuing of said order has raised .some question as to the sufficiency of the fund created, and in order to increase the fund to an amount which will leave no question as to the sufficiency of it, the Commission has raised the per cent to "1V4, in which I concur. When this is done, and attorneys' fees, salaries, taxes. operating expenses and damages are all taken care of out of the gross income, the only thing left to be considered is an amount sufficient to pay a reasonable net dividend upon the amount fixed as a dividend The accountants' report, as of December :&gt; 1 . 1911, referred to in the opinion, being very comprehensive and doing approximate justice to all parties interested, is one that reflects credit upon Messrs. Powell and Wettling. Exhibit No. 6. of said report referred to, shows that an allowance of 5% for depreciation leaves a net profit to the company of 6.62 r ; . This "&gt;% for depreciation is the per cent, that has been set aside pursuant to the order of the Commission of July 10. 1910. Kx - liibit No. 6 also shows that if "&gt; \ &lt;7 r is allowed instead of the 1%, just referred to, for a depreciation reserve fund, the net profit to the com - pany will be 6.24't. When the Commission added J300.000.00 to the railway portion of the plant, upon which dividends are to be paid, it compelled the people to make good to the company that amount to past losses and periods when the company was not making a sufficient return upon the money it had invested. So. in considering the qu&gt; of fares, we are not to consider any elements of the past, such as money invested for a time when there was no return upon it. extra hazardous conditions etc. All of the past was taken care of and the only thing to consider is what net dividend should the company make now. ■In the opinion of the Commission dated May 1 7. 1911, in this case. Commission was pleased to quote the Wisconsin Commission, in h it has said that "The rate of return which must or should be allowed on what - ever investment ma-v be determined to exist. * • * * must be sufficient, under all circumstances, to attract capital to that par - ticular enterprise," ■then continues by following the Wisconsin Commission in saying 8% would not be unreasonable. But the Wisconsin Commission not allow a lump sum to be capitalized to take care of past losses </seg>

Ov The Commission, by virtue of the powers vested in it, says to tlta pfople: "You are to i:ay fares to the railway part of the company thar taken together with all other profits, will create a fund sufficient to par attorneys' fees, salaries, operating expenses, taxes, and take hh of maintenance, depreciation and obsolescence to the extent that tH - plant will be as good, if not better, in the future than it is now." The people, in compliance with the order of the Commission in which it fixed universal fares at six tickets for 25 cents. ar«» not. cnly doing this?, but the fund created is sufficient to leave a net balance that will pa; - upon the $2,244,639.62. The investment in a public utility that is a monopoly, and is sub - ject to the Commission's control, is, and ought to be. as safe and mid as any investment that can be made. It is certainly safer than th - average business of the city, and when we come to consider the net rat - of return of 6.24 c ', as compared with the average net rate of return on other businesses we find that the 6.24 % is the higher of the two. Mone; - in large amounts, for a long period of time, loaned on security that wiH be taken, is loaning for much less than that after which taxes have to be paid, which reduces the net return to a considerably less per cent. During the period from September, 1908, to July 30, 1910. the Commission made a thorough investigation of the relation of the Uaeoll Traction Company to its light and power departments and its heatin. plant. and the result of such investigation was that the Comni - ordered that "There should be charged by the railway to the light an i power departments 2% cents per kilowatt hour for each kilowa'* hour of current furnished to said commercial light and power d- - partment," and in the same order the Commission said that "The amounts so charged shall in the railway books be treau as earnings." ■above order went into effect September IB, 1910. and it has loped that the rate charged is producing a small profit to the rail - portion of the plant. Ehe whole question has been thoroughly discussed by all parties t. ntroversy, and the Commission has refused, and still refuses, u • said .charge on the ground that the margin of profit is not ex </seg>
            <seg id="p109">NKURASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 109 cessive and that it should go to the railway department proper. The fixing of the charge referred to is strictly within the jurisdiction of the Commission, and the net profits of the charge go, and should go. into the total net profit of the railway portion of the plant, and the result is that the net surplus that comes from this and all other sources of profit is sufficient to pay 6.24% upon the total value of the railway property The several sources of profit to the railway from which this 6.24 derived are as follows: The Morris Transportation Company, un^-r its contract with the Lincoln Traction Company, pays a profit to th? cor. - pany, which goes directly to the net profit of the railway part of the plant. There is an income from the Capital Beach line; an incrire from advertising in the cars; an income from mail carrying; an income from the steam furnished to the steam heating plant; an hwg from tka charge of 2 % cents per kilowatt, energy furnished 'o the lisli' K departments; and the fares. The $8,403.62. that is the profit de - from the charge, of 2 Va cents per kilowatt that is made by order Commission to the light and power departments, is just as much :i part of the net fund for dividends to the railway department as the incomes from the other sources, and an attempt to consider it in any other light will not bear analysis. It is not fair to subtract this amount from the total net profit of the railway, thereby making a showing that the railway is not making 6.24'; and using this as an argument for the purpose of justifying a rise in fares upon the entire system, or upon any of its lines. The people of Lincoln might well Question the right of the Commission to require the company to make a certain charge to the light and power departments which produces a net profit of $8,403 - .62 per annum to the railway part of the plant, and then set it off in a side pocket and not consider it when it comes to the question of fares. The public should get credit for ii some place, either in the light and power portions of the plant, or by the railway proper, and, if the rail - way gets it, it should be considered when the question of fares is up. The first duty that is incumbent upon the Commission is to deter - mine what minimum net dividend the company should !&gt;p reduc. before the Comnr'ssion will say that fares should be raised. If I is iIih minimum, what should the maximum be before the Commission will reduce the fares? The net dividend will always vary: it can never be constant, therefore it would be practically impossible for the Com - mission to fix an absolute rate for a net dividend. It follows that there must be considered a minimum net dividend and a maximum net divi - dend (a high and low) between which the net dividend earned will vary as the business varies, without which the fares charged would have to r&gt;e changed constantly. To raise the fares is to say thai !iet is below what the minimum should be, and this is just what the Commis - sion is doing, and when this is done the next question to be s. by the Commission is, shall the fares be raised on the entire system or </seg>
            <seg id="p110">110 FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT ETbe establishment of the zone system is not directly and primarily he purpose of realizing a greater net dividend to the company but r the purpose of equalizing fares between the patrons of the coni - '. If the net dividend is what it should be, still there may be the I reason for establishing zones in order that some may pay more others less for the services they are receiving; but, in order to do the Commission would have to be informed fully as to the service 11 the lines as compared with each other. Bn the case of Wilcox vs. Consolidated ««s t'o., 212 V. S., 1!&gt;. Mr. e Peckham made the following announcement: "There is no discrimination between the individual consumer and the city by fixing the price of gas for the city at five cents per thousand cubic feet less than is permitted in the case of individual « onsumnrs. so far at least as the complainant is concerned. If the amount obtained from the total gas sold to the city and the indi - vidual is enough to secure the requ'site return on the property, it is all the complainant can require, and the question of discrimina - tion between the city and the individual is one in which the com - plainant can have no interest." So, in the" case under consideration, the Traction Company has no ground for complaint on the ground of discrimination as between the citizens of Lincoln and those of the neighboring towns if the total net surplus is sufficient to pay a "fair net dividend" to the holders of the common stock. After fares have once been established, the citizens Of Lincoln might properly raise the question and show to the Commis - sion that they were paying more (everything being considered) than the neighboring towns. The Commission, on its own motion, might make an investigation of the matter, but the Traction Company is not in position to complain. But, deeming the complaint proper and one that should be considered, so far as I am able to gather information from the great mass of statistics, and from the hearings that have been held, there is very little evidence which tends to prove that the University Place line is not one of the best paying lines of the entire system, and to raise the fares on a line without the company first assuming the bur - den of proof and showing to the Commission that the line is not taking care of its share of the burdens, and at the same time returning a rea - sonable profit to the company, would be unjust. Let us look at the whole question from a different angle. We find that the first thing the Commission has to determine is. how much is the railway portion of the Lincoln Traction Company's property worth, and the next is. what is the net dividend that investors should iwHve «n the money they invest in such enterprises. The first question has been settled by the Commission and the railway portion of the plant has been found to be worth $2,244,639.54. ■One of the most reliable sources of information to determine what ?y is worth, invested in such securities, is the open money market of *orld.

'If ntlemen: Kou have requested my opinion on the question of the jurisdi. Nebraska State Railway Commission to hear and determine th» - lint made by complainants against tbe respondent and to grant lief prayed for by said complainants. Bn the consideration of this question, it is, of course, elementary he Commission has only such power as is conferred upon it either ■ constitution or by statute. It becomes important then to con^ institutional and statutory provisions bearing upon the powers - uties of the Commission. At the general election held N'ovember 6. 1906. a constitutional amendment was adopted which provided for the establishment of the office of State Railway Commission, and denned the duties of that BThe powers and duties of such Commission shall include t li • of rates, service and general control of common carriers as thi ture may provide by law.' There is a further provision that: "In the absence of specific legislation, the Commission shall else the powers and perform the duties enumerated in this provir- ■lut, it is not necessary to be considered here, for the reason that etislature of 1907, which met soon after the adoption of the am to the constitution providing for the state railway commission, dul le by law what the powers and duties of said commission should Section 2, of said act, provides among other things: PSaid Commission shall have the power to regulate the rates and sb of. and to exercise a general control over all railroads, ex; nies, car companies, sleeping car companies, freight and freight impanies. and all other common carriers engaged in the tran^ of freight or passengers within the state." (Compiled Btatnti rh. 7 2, Art. 8, Sec. 2, sub-div. b. ) Section 4, of the act, defines the term •■common carriers" as used in said ad: "The term common carriers as used herein shall be taken to in - clude all corporations, companies, individuals and associations of indi - viduals, their lessees, or receivers (appointed by any court whatsoever I that may now or hereafter own, operate, manage, or control any rail - road, interurban or street railway line, operated either by steam or electricity or any other motive power, or part thereof, or any ex company, car company, sleeping car company, freight and freight line company, telegraph and telephone companies, and any other carrier engaged in the transmission of messages or transportation of passen - gers or freight for hire." (Compiled Statutes of 1911, ch. 72, art. 8. sec. 4.) This definition of "common carrier," as found in the act of I. 1 as been judicially conntrued in the case of State v. I'nion Stock Yanls i Neb. 68. wherein it is said: </seg>
            <seg id="p122">122 FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT "Any person or corporation, holding itself out to the public as of - fering its services to all persons similarly situated, and performing as its public vocation the services of transporting passengers, freight or intelligence, is a common carrier in the particular spheres of such em- It is, of course, quite evident that irrigation works are not engaged -either in the transmission of messages or the transportation of pas - sengers. Their object and purpose are something quite different. Hence, they are not common carriers for either of those reasons. If they are common carriers in the sense in which that term fs use3 in the above quoted excerpt from the 1907 law, they are such because they are com - mon carriers of freight for hire. Are they such? In other words, is water running through an irrigation ditch freight, and is it carried for hire, in the ord'nary acceptation of those terms, where the ditch is oWMd by some person or corporation who is furnishing water by means &gt;&gt; ditch to water users for irrigation purposes? It eeems to the writer that neither of the above questions can rly be answered in the affirmative. That 's to sav. I ,lo not think rater running in an irrigation ditch is freight within the common ing of that term, nor do I think that it is carried for hire, as that e is commonly understood. Therefore, I do not think the statute I in 1907 gave your Commission any authority to regulate or con - i any way irrigation ditches. ""In the interpretation of statutes, words 'n common use are to be construed in their natural, plain, and ordinary signification. It is a very well-settled rule that so long as the language used is unambiguous a departure from its natural meaning is not justified by any consider of its consequences or of public pol'cy." (36 Cyc. 1114.) ■"In construing a statute, words should be given their usual mean - (State v. Hyiuin, SO Neb. 384.) I It may be remarked in passing that if irrigation works are common ers, within the meaning of that term, as defined by the law of 1907, Hows, by at least a parity of reason, that water works which fur - water for the use of the inhabitants of the various cities an1 vil - of the state are also common carriers within the meaning of such ition. I presume that no one will seriously contend that such was egislative intent. Kut, in 1911, the legislature passed an act which, omitting the ency clause thereof, reads as follows : B 'Irrigation works constructed under the laws of this state are y declared to be common carriers. B'The owner or operator of any works for the storage, (arriage or lion of water, exeeot irrigation districts, must deliver all water y appropriated to the parties entitled to the use of the water for cial purposes, at a reasonable rate, to be fixed bv the State Railway lission, according to the law in such cases relating to common car - ' (Compiled Statutes of 1911. ch. 93a, art. 2, sees. 70, 71.) It will be observed that the first section of this act declares broadly, without any reservation or exception whatever, that irrigation works ■constructed under the laws of this state are common carriers. This includes, of course, irrigation works constructed or under t*ie control ■of irrigation districts. But, the second section of the act, which pro - vides that the rates charged for the delivery of water shall be hxd by the State Railway Commission, makes an exception in the case of Irrigation districts.- The Commission is n«*t given power to fix rates as to them </seg>
            <seg id="p123">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 123 I It is contended on behalf of complainants that the bare declaration lined in said act, that irrigation works are common carrier :ient to clothe the Commission with power to regulate and control irrigation works in the same way and manner that it has power to "ol other common carriers, such as railroads for instance, under the isions of section 2. of the Railway Commission Act of 19nT. here - 'ore quoted, except in so far as such power is modified by the clause ipting irrigation districts from the provision of the act which illy clothes the board with power to establish rates. II cannot agree with this contention. I do not think th;u such was 'gislative intent. If it was. then it follows that it was t 1 ntent to clothe your Commission with power to regulate the I ervices of, and to exercise general control over, all irrigation works ructed under the laws of this state, with the single exception that mot fix the rates to be charged by irrigation districts. 1 do no the legislature contemplated any such result by the passage of the ist above quoted. To so hold would bring said law in direct &lt; on - n more than one respect with the general laws covering the subject igation. To illustrate, it is expressly provided by statute that not only all ap - propriations of water for irrigation purposes shall be allowed by the state board of irrigation, but it is also made the duty of the water com - missioner, appointed by said board for each water district, to divi.le the water of his district among the several appropriators according to prior - ity of right of each respectively, and to see that the headgates of any ditch, reservoir, or other device for the appropriation and use of water under the laws of the state are shut down when it is necessary to §m we by reason of the priority of rights of others taking water from the stream and of its tributaries or any stream to which it is tributary. (Compiled Statutes of 1911, ch. 93a, art. 2. sec. 3.V) I It is further made the duty, by statute, of every person, cori or association owning or controlling any ditch, canal, or reservoir. tie purpose of storing or using water for any purpose, to construct naintain a substantial headgate at the point of diversion of a design jved by the secretary of the state board, and so built that it M rl and partially closed and fastened at any stage with lock and I It is further provided by statute that such person, corporation, or 'iation shall construct a measuring device for measuring an1 ap - riating the water appropriated, which measuring device shall sign approved by the secretary of the state board and built at tin - practical point to be selected and approved by him. (Coin ites of 1911. ch. 93a, art. 2, sec. 37.1 I It is made unlawful, by statute, for any person to wilfully op. . change or interfere with, any headgate or controlling gate, or ly means take water from any natural stream, reservoir, or other e. without authority of the state board of irrigation through ater commissioner, after the beadgate of such ditch or ditches shall been closed and fastened by lock or seal, or ordered closed by the r commissioner of the district in which such ditch or reservoir is ted. (Compiled Statutes of 1911. ch. 93a. art. 2. sec. (•.) Many other provisions of statute might be cited to show that the control which the state board of irrigation has over irrigation works is inconsistent with the claim that the Nebraska State Railway Commis - sion has power, under the statute, to regulate the service of. and to ex - ercise general control over, such works by reason of the fact that they are declared bv statute to be common carriers, but enough has doubtless been said on that subject. It is apparent that the Commission does not </seg>
            <seg id="p124">124 KIFTH ANNUAL REPORT have such general control unless the passage of the act declaring irri - gation common carriers repealed, by implication, various provisions of ■statute giving the state board of irrigation control over such works. (Bearing in mind the elementary rule of statutory construction that :*als by implication are not favored," I am constrained to believe the provisions of statute hereinbefore referred to, and others giv - he state board of irrigation control in certain respects of works of ition, were not repealed by implication by the passage of the act ring such works common carriers, and that, therefore, the Ni - ca State Railway Commission was not clothed by the passage of act with power to exercise general control over such works, but its authority is limited to that specifically conferred upon it by said te. viz., the power to establish reasonable rates for service.

Railway Company objected to the taking of testimony on the complaint of the South Omaha Live Stock Exchange, making the contention that the matters therein contained had been heard and passed on by the Com - mission in January of the previous year. It was then decided by the Commission that it would hear any additional evidence that the Live Stock Kxchange had to present, and which had not been presented in the Ruden case. It was further agreed that if, after hearing the evi - dence given by the Live Stock Exchange, the Commission considered it of sufficient importance to justify a reversal of the opinion rendered in the Ruden case, it would fix a time and place at which the Railway Company would be permitted to present its evidence in that case. The Commission finds that the extra service ordered by it after the hearing on January 18, 1911. should be continued for the pr&gt; but should the business decrease to such an extent as to make it unduly burdensome to the Railway Company, it reserves the right to permit the discontinuance of the service during the season of light Mock movements, without further hearing. The Commission also finds that the evidence introduced by the South Omaha Live Stock Exchange is not such as to justify it in re - versing its decision in the Ruden case. It was shown in that case that the scheduled service in that territory was of a character superior to the service accorded to the most of similar branch lines, and that the increased service asked for could not be given by a change of schedules, but could only be provided by increased service, thus placing a burden on the transportation company, which this Commission cannot see its way clear to justify.

Ralston for himself, a citi - ind stock shipper of Lexington, Nebraska, and for other citizens stock shippers residing at several towns on the Union Pacific jad in the vicinity of Lexington, is one charging the Union Stock s Company of South Omaha, its agents, servants and employees, ttending favors to the resident dealers and speculators at said 5, who do business for speculative purposes only, of which the wing is a copy: ■'This complainant, and others for whom he appears, shows to your Honorable Board that said defendant, its agents, servants an.: ployees, extend favors to the resident dealers and speculators in the yards that reside in the vicinity of the defendant corporation, and do business in said company's yards for speculative purposes only, and in this they discriminate in favor of said speculators and against the out - --!(Ih shippers, giving them the best selected hay for rack live stock as they may have purchased, and for which the speculators are hohiii . market in said yards, and the shipper fs thereby forced and compelled !(• use the inferior hay, which is almost entirely worthless for the stock that he has shipped to said market. Because of such unfair discrimina - tion in the poor quality of hay furnished at an exorbitant price to the shippers throughout the country, and in this section particularly, the cattle and live stock refuse to eat the hay so furnished, and as a natural result drink very little water and do not Jill up. to the great loss, detri - ment and damage of the outside shippers, and damages growing out of the exorbitant price paid for the poor quality of hay furnished at three times its real value. Wherefore, your complainant for himself and on behalf of all other shippers patronizing the Union Stock Yards at South Omaha. Nebraska, prays this Honorable Board of State Railway Com - missioners for an order directing the said defendant, the Union Stock Yards Company, its agents, servants, and employees, to cease such tin - fair discrimination, and that they fix a reasonable rate of profit for the grades of hay so furnished to the shippers that patronize the yards of the said defendant, and that an early date be fixed for a hearing of said complaint, and for such other and further relief as equity and good conscience may seem to require." There was a hearing held by the Commission at the office of the sci niary of the Live Stock Exchange at South Omaha, on the L'uth day of February, 1912, at which all parties interested were represented by themselves and their attorneys. KThat part of the complaint which alleges exorbitant prices charged ay need not be discussed at this time by the Commission, for the n that the complainants practically abandoned that part of the 'laint, in that they did not introduce any testimony tending to antiate their charge, but did admit that they were satisfied with </seg>
            <seg id="p130">130 FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT Kices charged, provided they got choice hay, equal in quality which the speculators were receiving at the same time, and for ne price. There was some testimony introduced to show that the hay sold in the yards is of underweight, and the Commission finds this to be true to a certain extent. The hay is loaded out of the barns on the dis - tributing hay wagons, and the entire load weighed. The total net weight of the hay is then divided by the number of bales in the load, and the average weight is charged for each bale sold. The result of this is that some receive a few pounds more, and some a few pounds leas than the actual weight of the bales. This is an injustice that can hardly be avoided, because it is practically impossible to weigh each bale of hay separately. This leaves but one allegation in the petition to be settled, which is the real cause of complaint, and that is a discrimina - tion in the distribution of the hay between the speculators and th&gt; shippers, in that the speculators receive the better quality of the hay, while the shippers receive the poorer.

The testimony introduced on the part of the complainants by ■ large number of witnesses, shows that in many instances poor hay is sold to the shippers, and at the same time the speculators get the very best of the hay. The witnesses for the defendant testified that when - •v. r hay is distributed to any of the patrons of the yards, and a com - plaint is made that the hay is not up to standard, new bales are immediately furnished to take the place of the poor hay, without extra charge. This was admitted by the plaintiffs. </seg>
            <seg id="p132">FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT 132 It is entirely possible for this to occur, as the speculators are constantly on the ground with salaried men to look after those matters and to refuse to accept hay as soon as it is found that it is not up to the proper grade, while the individual shipper, in many cases, not being with his stock, and thereby depending solely upon the commission firm, who being anxious in many cases to make a quick sale, do not take the time and trouble to see that good hay is furnished, and tin - men who distribute the hay in the yards, very often receive hay that is not up to grade. This brings the whole matter down to a very serious duty, that devolves upon the commission merchants, who should at all times protect the interest of their customers, and see to it that good hay is immediately furnished when it is found that the hay which is ■red is not up to standard. If this were done there would be no grounds for further complaint, so far as discrimination is concerned While the Commission is of the opinion that there is ground for complaint in the matter of proper distribution of the hay in yards, it believes that the trouble is not so much with the Stock Yards Company as it is with the commission merchants, in that they do not se quite the amount of diligence that they should in order to pro - lie interest of their customers. While the Commission has no direct jurisdiction over the commission merchants at the Stock Yards. yet we suggest that more care be exercised by them in the inspection of hay and grain that is sold to their customers. If this does not remedy the cause for complaint, it might be necessary for the Commission or shippers to recommend that the legislature authorize the appointment of weighers, inspectors and distributors of hay and grain at said yards. The individual shipper must remember that if he cannot be with hi* stock to see that it is properly fed, watered and cared for, that the next best thing is to employ a commission firm who will do those things for him.

The prayers of the petitions he defendant railroad be compelled to so operate its trains that igers may alight from, or board, such trains on the side nt . ition building, or that the company be required to furnish shelter. and light on the opposite side. ■he I'nion Pacific Railroad is a double track road so far ■ to the main line through the greater part of the state 01 . and the testimony of the complainants is undisputed so fa Etes to the inconvenience to which the general public is subji - wishing to board trains located on the second track.

The contention of complainants was that there was less danger Eatrons by following the practice of remaining in the depot until train pulled into the station, and then being permitted to board train between the east and west bound tracks, thus obviating the ;er of crossing to the opposite side of the track in front of an incom - train. Numerous witnesses testified to having witnessed narrow pes, some injuries and one death by attempt to cross the track ia face of through trains which had been mistaken for the ones the ms wished to board. S)ther witnesses gave evidence to the effect of having waited on the ite side of the tracks while two or three east and west bound gh trains passed, being exposed to inclement weather, in some ices the temperature exceeding 20 degrees below zero. Bt was also contended by the witnesses for complainants that r to patrons would be almost eliminated if permitted to enter and the cars between the east and west bound track.

E Other witnesses testified to the inconvenience of passengers alight - rom eastbound trains, in being compelled to await the departure e train from which they alighted before they could get to the de - the only alternative being to walk around, either in front or rear of rain, cross both tracks, making a distance of several hundred and increasing the danger from westbound trains whose approach d be obscured by the train from which they had alighted. Evidence introduced by the Complainant Stewart showed tha was a water crane located on the platform space at Lexington was the cause of much inconvenience to patrons on account of it^ surrounded by mud in the summer months and ice in the wintei s, compelling passengers to leave the platform and get down into blic highway in order to pass it. Defendant admitted that patrons had been subjected to som - unnecessary inconvenience by failure of proper notice to passengers as to time of arrival of trains, by absence of lights on the side of the train from which passengers alighted and boarded the cars, and perhaps by the presence of the water crane at Lexington, and rested their entire defense on the element of danger to patrons of the road, should they be permitted to board the cars between the east and west bound track. Complainants claimed the rule in force was an arbitrary one. not based on actual experience and a desire to beat serve the public, but was purely theoretical, one which in practice worked a hardship that was intolerable. There can be no question but that the witnesses for eomplainant. - in these cases were sincere in their statements "that the most con - venient and safest place to board these trains was between the ea6t and west bound tracks," but it is incumbent on the Commission to make a very careful investigation, by every possible method at its command, before ordering a railroad company to reverse a rule that has been adopted by all railroads, and has stood the test of a quarter of a century's experience. The double tracking of a road brings with it con - veniences as well as, inconveniences, and it must be admitted that the boarding of trains is one of the inconveniences, but on a final analysis the question of danger must govern. Khe operation of a railroad is a technical one, requiring not only I education and training, but a knowledge of actual results ol&gt; - froni long experience. K'he defendant in these cases placed its reliance on the evidence of itness, Mr. W. B. Scott, its general manager. He qualified to ai&gt; ence of almost forty years in various departments of railroad He made the statement that operating officials of all roads, in </seg>
            <seg id="p135">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 135 anada, Mexico and the United States, agreed on and practiced the method of loading and unloading passengers against which this protest is made. Mr. Scott laid special stress on the danger to persons when they were either between the rails or between the tracks, as well as the efforts of operating officials to prevent such practice, so far as it was possible to do so, at the same time admitting the inconvenience iinl risk of crossing the tracks. A copy of the rule prohibiting trains from pulling into a depot while another train is loading and unloading passengers, was made vine of the exhibits in this case, and Mr. Scott explained that a rail - oad company felt that this was a reasonable precaution but that it was impossible to know that it would not be violated either through gnorance, accident or carelessness. It was also suggested that uni - 'ormity in rules for employees to follow was essential, and according •o present methods of operation all passengers, express and mail .ielivered on the right hand side of the track, whereas, if the request of 'hese complainants was granted, this rule would be reversed in accord- nce with the location of the depot. Exceptions are made by the railroad, at certain more important -rations and division points where passengers are permitted to board 'rains on the side of the cars next to the depot. The reasons assigned ««re that conditions differ to an extent making the exception jus ufiable. The Commission has not the information at hand to pass on 'he reasonableness of these exceptions, or as to whether they are mjustly discriminatory, but suggests that there be filed with this board a list of such stations, together with the reasons for such excep- Ki must be conceded, in the consideration of these cases, that , speed and service are what the public are demanding, and that 'hese considerations are the constant aim of the railroads. Saf. The first consideration. Men have spent their lives in efforts to per - fect devices for such purpose. Congress and the legislatures of the sev - eral states have spent time and money to have these devices put into service. The Interstate Commerce Commission has been clothed with authority to investigate accidents and make recommendations for 'heir prevention. As an abstract proposition, no one would contend that it is not safer outside of the tracks than between them. It was suggested that one door be opened on the s'de nearest the depot for the egress and .ngn-ss of passengers, but this would necessitate a division of the Train crew, consisting of a limited number of men who are made responsible for the safety and comfort of the passengers, as well as •he handling of mail, baggage and express, and it must be conceded 'hat it would be bad practice and almost impossible to discharge mail and express between the tracks. Baggage, mail and express men are frequently crowded for room and must arrange their loads in the ■Ml economical manner and space near the door from which it ia to </seg>

To discharge passengers from one side of a and express, mail and baggage from the other side, would mean he crew must be divided, and schedules for the performance of ties would not be uniform but would vary according to the side tracks on which depots were located. P Established rules are essential in the operation of trains, but st be conceded that the human element, on which the enforcement ch rules depends, is liable to err, and every possible precaution is aary to guard against accident in case such error occurs.

Conditions resulting in interferes ■•• with patrons of the road by the maintenance of the water crane at Lexington should be corrected, but the Commission cannot concur with the opinion of complainants as to the discharging of passengers bet the tracks.

Chairman |)n January 3", 191:.', a complaint was filed with the Commission tizens of the village of Bethany, involving the operation and ;es of the Omaha. Lincoln &amp; Beatrice Railway Company. This came on for hearing April 4, 1912, at which time a number of ns of Bethany gave testimony for the complainant, being repres - d by Mr. Fred Shepherd, their attorney. The defense was repre - d by H. H. Wilson. The fact that the petition was signed by L'lV. citizens of said vil - lage indicates that there is a fairly unanimous feeling in that com - munity that it is not being properly served. The Omaha, Lincoln &amp; Beatrice Railway Company was organized and is being operated under the law governing steam railways, and while terminals have been secured in both Lincoln and Omaha and most of the right-of-way between these cities has been provided, the construction of the rail - \\;ty lias only been completed between the city of Lincoln and the village of Bethany, a distance of about five and one-half miles. This portion of the road has been in operation for the past six or I The complaint is that while the road is incorporated under the steam railway act, in practice it is doing a street car service and should conform to the rules and practices regulating street car com - panies. The Lincoln Traction Company is now serving University Place. Havelock. College View, other suburbs about the same or a greater distance from Lincoln, and for such service is charging a five - cent fare, or, when tickets are purchased, six are given for 25 cents. The Omaha, Lincoln &amp; Beatrice Railway Company, under the law, is entitled to charge a minimum of five cents, with a total charge of two cents per mile. Its filings with this Commission show that it has one station at University Place, besides the terminals at Bethany and ■ : A. B. Allen, Secretary. I </seg>
            <seg id="p138">138 FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT Lincoln. The rates filed are, five cents to University Place, or teri lickets for 45 cents; five cents from University Place to Bethany; teL cents from Bethany to Lincoln, or two tickets for 15 cents; and parties wishing to buy four tickets get them for 25 cents. The distance from Lincoln to University Place is about three and one-half miles plus University Place to Bethany, one and three-fourths miles plus; Lincoln to Bethany, five and one-half miles. The five and four and one-halt cent rates to University Place are evidently made for the purpose of meeting competition with the street car line operated by the Lincoln Traction Company to that point. The ten-cent charge to Bethany in two cents less than the law permits, and the commutation tickets at l and one-half and six and one-fourth cents between Lincoln and Bethany are probably made to conform to the practice of other roads' serving suburban towns and cities. The practice of stopping on signal to receive or discharge passengers at other points than the stations I is in common vogue, not only on interurban lines, but also where motor cars are used for service on steam railway lines. Such practice is evidently for the accommodation of the patrons of the road, and the custom is to charge from station to station, though the patron has onl&gt; riddi-n a mile, or a block, as the case may be. Eounsel for the plaintiff argues that it is within the power of tlM ission to make a rate lower than the two-cent rate, as provided ; law. This cannot be questioned, but such action by this Coni - in, under the circumstances developed by the evidence in thi&gt; lieve would have no standing in a court of justice. The gross income of this company for the year ending June 3u. 1911. was &gt;25,962.00; the operating expenses, including taxes and about $80.0o for interest, was $24,580.00; leaving a net income of $1,382.00. A proper depreciation and maintenance account, according to standard rules of accounting on a property of this kind, would be in the neighborhood of $5,0&lt;mi.oo per year. The net income, as shown above, added to the amount charged during the past year for the maintenance of the property, would about equal the necessary amount for the maintenance and depreciation. However, it is not claimed by the petitioners that the owners of this property are earning interest or dividends on the money invested, the principal contention beins that the city of Bethany is discriminated against by lower fares being Kiven to other suburbs of the city of Lincoln, resulting in loss t&lt;&gt; Bethany of home seekers who locate in other suburbs on account or less charge for transportation to and from the city of Lincoln. Discrimination is also alleged on account of a charge of ten cent? from Adrian Avenue to Thirty-second Street. This same principle it - involved when a patron lives say three miles north of Beatrice and wishes to go to a point five miles south of Cortland on a Union Pacific motor. Instead of going to Beatrice and paying 36 cents fare to Cort - land, a distance of 18 miles, he signals the motor at his home, three miles north of Beatrice, and rides to his destination, five miles south of </seg>

This the Commission does not look u|xmi as discrimination, but a service permissible under the law. and one in which the patron is the greater beneficiary. If the Omaha. Lincoln &amp; Heat rice Railway Company was a part of the Lincoln Traction Company's system, there can be no question but that a greater charge to Bethany than to other suburbs for similar service would be discriminatory, regardless of the earnings of the line. However, as we view it. if the • onipany was a street railway line, incorporated under the statutes governing street railways, operated independently, and its income was such as to show no earnings on the money invested in its construction and equipment, we would question our ability to sustain an action to lower the fare before a court that had jurisdiction over our acts. KPhe property under consideration is an uncompleted project, and is form the company cannot expect to earn dividends, but it appear reasonable to the Commission that it should be per - il to make such charges for the service performed as would —m nable if the entire line were being operated. The Nebraska Traction &amp; Power Company operates an interurban line out of the city of Omaha, its charges being two cents per mile, and no commutation tickets are sold. The Omaha &amp; Southern Inter - urban Railway Company operates a line between South Omaha and Fort Crook. The fare from South Omaha to Bellevue is ten i ■ from Bellevue to Fort Crook, a distance of about two miles, five cents. Commutation tickets are sold between South Omaha and Bellevue at the rate of twenty tickets for $ 1 .5"&gt;. Viewing the situation as it exists, the Lincoln Traction Company, operating under the state railway franchise, having a system made up of many lines, some of which are profitable, others not paying oper - ating expenses, but taken as a whole, earning sufficient revenue to pay about six per cent, on a value which this Commission has fixed as a fair one for earning purposes, is an entirely different problem from the one before us, and we do not believe it is in the power of this Commission to successfully maintain that there is discrimination in this instance. Neither do we believe the evidence before us is suffi - cient to warrant the contention that the revenues would be increased by increased travel over the Bethany line if fares were reduced to the extent asked for by the petitioners. The attention of the Com - mission was called to the excursion parties going to various suburbs during the evenings of the hot summer months, which greatly increase earnings on certain lines, and owing to the greater cost of transporta - tion on the Bethany line, the latter did not get the benefits thus de - rived. Investigation shows that this patronage is deceptive so far as results are concerned, and that the income to a street railway </seg>
            <seg id="p140">140 FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT line is best conserved by the daily patrons who so to and from their work or business. Examination of the earnings on the lines of the Lincoln Tractioi Company most likely to produce this class of traffic, shows that for fhe six winter months, viz., January, February, March. October, Novem - ber and December, the earnings are about 97% plus of what they ar - for the summer months, beginning with April and ending with Sep - tember. The earnings on the Bethany line for the winter months are 98% of those for the summer months, a difference of 1 '.&lt; plus in favor of the Traction Company's lines. The Bethany line is handicapped by the fact that most persons wishing to use this line for pleasur* - rides are compelled to pay two fares, one to get to the Bethany lint - over the Traction Company's system, and one for transportation over that line. A lowering of the fares on the Bethany line would no r correct such a disadvantage. It was developed during this hearing that the road under con - sideration was violating the law by not transporting baggage free or charge to the extent as provided in the statutes, and was charging full fare to children between five and twelve years of age when ac - companied by parents or others authorized to care for them. We als&lt; find that the proper accommodations for the purchase of tickets ar* - not provided, and until proper arrangements are made at the sta - tions, conductors should accommodate patrons by the sale of tickets or ORDER.

Clarke, Commissioner: Khc complainant herein is a manufacturer and shipper of I pop and kindred articles, doing business at Superior, Nebraska, also secretary of the Nebraska State Bottlers Association. ( of about thirty per cent, of the manufacturers and shippers of id kindred articles in the state of Nebraska. In substance the complaint is to the effect that cases of 24 bottles, eight-ounce soda*, and cases of 24-ounce quart bottles of sodas and kindred articles, are shipped at varying weights instead of actual weights used by complainant, which tends to make uncertain the amount of charges assessed against such shipments, and results in discrimina - tion between the various shippers, and prays for an order of the Commission, fixing a uniform weight of 45 lbs. on the cases of 24 bottles eight-ounce sodas, loaded, and 95 lbs. on the cases of 24-ounce (quart) sodas. After the filing of the complaint the Commission received a large number of petitions from various bottlers throughout the state, calling attention to the discrimination resulting from the failure of express f !tr, lbs. per i ;ist </seg>
            <seg id="p142">&gt; 142 agents to bill packages at actual weights, and joined in the prayer of the complainant's petition. The evidence clearly shows that there has been a wide variation of the weights on shipments of the character complained of, particu - larly 24 eight-ounce sodas, the billing running from 40 to 55 lbs. While it is clear from the evidence that there is oftentimes a varia - tion of weight on these packages, depending upon whether they are new and full of sap, or soaked from rain, or other causes, or whether they are made of soft pine or cottonwood, or whether they are built of one-inch or half inch material, or whether they are with or without covers, or with or without inside racks, it is also clear that there is lflM liability to loss by breakage resulting from rough handling when shipped in the better class of heavier cases. The Commission has had occasion heretofore to consider the ques - tions involved in this complaint in the case of the Fremont Bottling Works vs. Chicago * North Western Railway Company et al, formal &lt;omplaint No. 103 (Fourth Annual Report, Nebraska State Railway Commission, page 104). in which it fixed estimated weights for ship - ments by freight on two dozen quart bottles in cases with or without covers, loaded, at !*5 lbs. and two dozen eight-ounce pop bottles, in cases, with covers, at 45 lbs. Nothing was adduced at this hearing which would cause the Commission to modify the order arrived at in the Fremont Bottling Works case, but on the contrary, strengthened the Commission in its opinion that shipments of this character should be billed at uniform estimated weights. We find that shipments of ginger ale, ginger tonic, pop, soda water and cider, shipped in bottles in cases, with or without covers, should move on a standard estimated weight, and that the following schedule of estimated weights for such shipments is reasonable and more conducive to equality among shippers than the practice that ob - tains at present of shipping some on weights offered by shipper, in some instances guessed at by railway agents, and in other instances at actual weight, to-wit: — Two dozen quarts (24-ounce) loaded, 95 lbs.; two dozen 8-ounce pop, loaded, 45 lbs.

The Burlington is the short line from Omaha to Fairfield and Edgar: the Rock Island is the short line from Oma - ha to Fairbury: and the rates we charge from St. .Joseph are the rates that have been fixed by the Burlington and Rock Island roads where they cross us. Where possible on account of these through tariffs on the Union Pacific Railroad, it is the policy of our company to throw open the whole line to the various markets, bo that shippers to our points can go to St. Joseph, or Kai or Omaha, or Lincoln, all of which they do. and purchase at those points. Omaha is a very heavy distributor of most merch ■&lt; to our stations along the Fairbury line, including Grand Island, as well as Kansas City.

The reason that the I'nion Pacific route their business to points on the Grand Island Ra east as far as Davenport via Grand Island, is to give the Omaha people better service than they would eet if it was route.!

Under the law, th« ission is expected to determine the conditions which directly any given rate or rates. I The complainants, by their petition and testimony, ask for a ion in this case on the question of discrimination only. They specifically stated that they do not consider the present estab - d rates between Omaha and Grand Island, and from Grand Island itions on the St. J. &amp; G. I. Railway, unreasonable, in and of them - s. In view of this fact, these findings will deal alone with the on" :ion of discrimination, as charged by the complaint. (It Section 14 of the Railway Commission Act clearly defined what shall constitute ' unjust discrimination." This section reads in part: "If any railway company or common carrier, subject to tu- - provisions of this act, directly or indirectly * * • • ghali charge, demand, collect, or receive from any person, firm or cor - poration, a greater or less compensation for any service rendered or to be rendered by it, than it charges, demands, collects, or re- ceives from any other person, firm or corporation for doing like and contemporaneous service, the same shall constitute an unjust discrimination, which. :s hereby forbidden and declared I be unlawful." Subdivision (' of the same section further provides: "If any railway or common carrier, subject to the provision* of this act. through or by its officers, agents or employees, shall charge or receive any greater compensation in the aggregate for the transportation of like kind of property or passengers for shorter than for a longer distance over the same line, the sam- shall constitute an uniust discrimination, which is hereby pro- hibited. • • * • Provided further, that nothing herein shall be construed so as to prevent the Commission from making wha&gt; are known as 'group rates' and 'emergency rates,' as herein pro - vided, on any Une or lines of railway in this state." ■f the first portion of section 14, quoted above, were to be appliea s case at bar, there would be but one question to settle, i. e . er or not discrimination against Grand Island does exist. It would embarrass the Commission to contend that, under th' - law as quoted above, a shipment of a given commodity from Grand Island to Davenport, is "like and contemporaneous" to a shipment of the same commodity shipped at the same time from Omaha to Daven - port, even though the Omaha shipment might be transferred in transit Omaha is located on the Missouri River and Grand Island is located in an entirely different position, so far as the rate situation is con - cerned. In other words, this Commission cannot disregard the present rate and commercial situations. We have to consider the whole territory as we find it, and to contend that Grand Island is discriminated against, because her jobbers are not given the same transportation rate from all points east or west, as cities located in a different commercial territory with due regard to state and interstate rates, does not indi- </seg>
            <seg id="p147">NKHRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 147 rate discrimination under the Nebraska statute as we see it. It would be a* fair, and possibly more so, to contend that Central City is dis - criminated against as compared with Grand Island, because a Central City shipper has to pay from twenty to thirty per cent, more freight tharges on a fourth class article shipped to a point say one hundred miles west on the Union Pacific, than the Grand Island shipper pays for the same distance on the same commodity. In other words, we say that under a strict interpretation of the law. there might b. &lt; rim i nation as between Central City and Grand Island, because Grand Island has jobbing rates, (on the first four classes), while Central City must pay straight Nebraska Distance Rates. If the Commission would do what the complainants ask to be done in this case, (disregard the actual fact) and refuse to recognize the fact that Grand Island is located where it is, we possibly could not do otherwise than find that Central City is discriminated against. We find in subdivision C, quoted above, that the law specifically states that "nothing herein shall be construed bo as to prevent the Commission from making what are known as 'group rates'." We understand "group rates" to be what art 1 often termed in railroad parlance "blanket rates." aud more lately expressed by the Interstate Commerce Commission as "zone rates." Defendants contend that the rate situation complained of, is ti.nsed by competitive conditions on account of short lines of rail - road crossing the territiory mentioned in the complaint. As we under - stand subdivision C. the law contemplated that such rate conditions would be submitted by the Commission, and for their guidance the legislature provided in the act that "group rates" might exist and still not constitute "unjust discrimination." We are confronted by this question of apparent discrimination in practically all of the public utilities that come under the jurisdiction of the Commission. In the telephone business we find the retail merchant who uses his tele - phone but a few times a day paying the same rental charge that the wholesale merchant pays who may receive hundreds of calls per day. In the street railway we find the passenger riding but five blocks pays the same rate of fare as the passenger who rides fifty blocks. In the express business the charge will be the same to a patron who has his package delivered only a few doors from the express depot as a patron living many blocks away. It hardly seems necessary to continue this law question further. To our minds, complainants have not submitted testimony of a nature that would justify us in finding that Grand Island is discriminated against as a matter of law. Is Grand Island discriminated against as a matter of equity by reason of the fact that her jobbers cannot compete with jobbers located at other points (such as Lincoln, Fremont and Missouri River cities) by reason of their having to sell their commodities on the basis of a higher transportation charge on those commodities received from the territory east of the Missouri River into Grand Island and re-shipped </seg>
            <seg id="p148">148 FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT from there to the stations mentioned in the petition? The same theory would permit Omaha to be put on a parity with Chicago. The testimony of Mr. Stohr clearly shows the real reason why the 51-cent first class rate from Missouri River gateways is carried as a maximum to stations, Grand Island to Davenport, inclusive. Obviously, the defendants cannot establish a higher rate, Omaha to Davenport, than the C. &amp; H. \V. establishes at that point, and the C. A N. W. in turn cannot carry a higher rate at Davenport than the Burlington (which has the short line mileage) establishes at near-by cross country stations, and the Burlington in turn cannot change its mileage scale on which the rates arc made up. simply because it happens to cross competing lines of railroad which happen to have longer mile - age between such competing territory and large cities where a general wholesale business is conducted. Naturally the St. J. &amp; G. 1. wants i.. protect the retail dealers on its line of railroad, Davenport to Grand Island, as against dealers on other lines where they come in direct competition. The distance from Omaha to Davenport. D. P. and St. J. 4i G. I. via Grand Island, is Z"~t miles; Burlington mileage, Omaha to Ong. is 138 miles. This question of 'short line mileage making the rate" has been a thorn in the flesh of state and federal commissions for a long time, in fact, ever ifaMia railroad rate regulation by commissions be a positive factor. Numerous complaints have been filed with th&gt;- Interstate Commerce Commission, and long and expensive hearings hav. been held, in order that some equitable basis might be formulated for a satisfactory adjustment of rates between different territories wher&gt; - the short line mileage was giving one group of shippers the advantage in transportation rates over other groups of shippers. The carriers of the country, before commission regulation, had undertaken to han - dle this question by making blanket rates which would often cover large areas of territory. The Interstate Commerce Commission was unable to propose any better plan, and so has oftentimes continued and applied the practice in decisions rendered by them. •'Commissioner Lane, concurring in the "Lemon rate case," 1. C. C. Rep. No. L'l'. ■ 149, spoke very plainly on this question of blanket rates. He said "The result of this mutuality of interest is a blanket rat- which imposes on the consignees in some parts of the country higher rate than would be charged under a scheme of graded rates, in order that a lower rate than otherwise would be reasjn - able may lie made into a small section of the country which i.- intensely competitive. Now, this may be good policy. I am not prepared to say that it is not, and therefore concur in the opinion of the Commission. This case, when broadly regarded, involves a question of th highest national importance. What is to be our policy with re - spect to the movement of traffic? Shall the country be treated as a whole for commercial purposes, or shall it be infinitely divided' In our postal service we deal with the country as a unit. As tt </seg>

In other territory we have a system of small zon&gt; roups which are placed upon a common basis — a scheme of rat&gt; - making that has worked most happily in the country to th&gt; f the Mississippi River and which, it seems to me. should 1 • ended westward.

At the same he lumber of the far Northwest is not so treated, nor th lides of the interior. Perhaps the I'nited States will one day declare a policy its own In this regard. Primarily it is a matter of nationil ( tin and not of railroad policy as to what system of rate ma shall obta'n so long as the carriers receive a reasonable r upon the value of their property.

The rates proposed by complainants on first class commod - ities are approximately 28% less than the rates complained of.

If this was done, what reason could we give jobbers at Omaha, Lincoln, Fremont, Nebraska City, Beatrice, and Hastings, if they would complain to the Commission and ask for the same rate basis to be applied from their stations on business coming to them from the west. &lt;-&lt;Tit8 per cwt. : KW 16 lie 18 20 Iri 9fl II Davenport 21 XI Belvidere ..

( Irnke, Commissioner: The complainant herein, acting for and on behalf of the Commercial Club of Albion, filed his petition, complaining of the defendant, the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company, in three particulars, to-wit: — First, that its passenger train schedule of six hours between Albion and Omaha, a distance of about one hundred twenty-five miles. is unreasonably slow, and upon the hearing prayed that an order be entered, requiring the defendant to run the trains now serving the Albion branch, as through trains, without stops at stations on its main line between Scribner and Omaha, other than at Fremont. This portion of the complaint was supplemented by petitions signed by the citizens of various towns located on this branch asking for the faster Mi-vice. Second, that the condition of its roadbed is rough and causes accidents. Third, that its depot at Albion is inadequate, unventilated, unlighted and unsanitary, and prayed the defendant be required to join with the Union Pacific Railroad Company in the erection and maintenance of a union station, equipped with modern conveniences.

IV t the hearing it was stipulated by and between the parties hereto the plans submitted by the defendant were adequate and satis - rjr save and except in the following respects, to-wit: — That they ot provide for furnace heat; that they did not provide for light- Kjth by gas and electric light; and that the freight root ?d at the west end instead of the east end. as desired by the lainauts. I That portion of the complaint complaining of the slow time from s on the Scribner branch to Omaha, and praying that the - being made by these trains between Scribner and Omaha be ilis - nued, with the exception of Fremont, was supplemented by peti - from other towns on this branch asking for the same relief. From the evidence it appears that the distance from Albion to Omaha is about one hundred forty-seven miles; that the running time consumed is six hours in one direction and six hours and seven minutes iu the other, or an average of twenty-four and one-half miles per hour, including stops. This is a little above the average speed of branch lines considered as first class in various portions of ihe state, and compares favorably with the local trains on the main lines. To discontinue the stops at stations between Scribner and Omaha, as requested, would necessitate the handling of baggage and express now handled on these trains by main line trains, thereby slowing up their time. It would also un - doubtedly greatly inconvenience many patrons of defendant's line residing at or near the towns where the present stops are proi to be discontinued, who use the trains in question to go to Omaha and return on the same day. These patrons, who would be aft - by such an order, were not notified and had no opportunity to be heard. Since the hearing the Commission is in receipt of remonstr signed by a large number of defendant's patrons living at or Hooper, protesting against the proposed discontinuance of stops of trains at that point. Bn view of the foregoing, the Commission believes that this portion I complaint should be dismissed, and so finds. </seg>

"The 'line' of the track is good for the entire distance and sus - c-i ptible of little or no improvement. A few bridges need lining but the amount of lining necessary is less than normal. "The 'surface' of the track is, in general, good. There are four track sections of about seven miles each where some improvement can Ve made, but altogether the resultant is 98% condition for surfacing. These four sections are located between Hradish and Newman's (Jrove. Newman's firove and Lindsay, Cornlea and Humphrey, and Creston nnd Hill Siding. t' With a small amount of cut ditching, as outlined, and by placing cinciers now distributed along the track, the line can be placed in class service condition. With reference to the cinders distributed, lould be stated that these really are a detriment in their present tion along the outer edge of the track by preventing free drainagt - the track itself. This is true in a number of cases, both in cuts and Ills. §"The rail condition was found to be good for the traffic of this line, with the exception of a few wheel burned rails near the summits le grade line, occasioned by the snow during last winter, the rail i very good condition.

The general condition of the ties now in track is very good, better than the average condition of track ties, and will show about 61% of new. The average branch lint - tie condition is 11%. The renewal ties allotted for this line for 191:' are all treated hemlock ties 7"x8"x8' and 24,845 ties are assigned for renewal work. This amount of ties represents approximately 7 of the total ties in track .and is just a little less than the average annual renewal as shown for the past five years on the attached table, which is made a part of this report. 1911 and 1912 renewal ties are treated hemlock. Prior to 1911. cedar was generally used, with a small amount of mixed oak. The table of renewals indicated that all ties would b» renewed in thirteen years, which time is a fair average life for branch line ties. Of the 1912 renewals. 30% of the ties have been rei • and 26% of the ties have been placed in track, together with api raately 600 switch ties for main line turnouts. "Concerning the speed of the train, which element must b. - sidered in determining the general line and surface of the track, it is found that the average speed, as shown by schedule time, is a above the average of branch lines considered as first class in i portions of the state. The exact time during which the train st" stations was noted and amounted to ■&gt;'■&lt; minutes and IS spcoti the total time consumed between Oakdale and the west end of th~ yard at Scribner. An additional stop of six minutes and twmit] made at the west end of the yard at Scribner for coal and water. "In train was on time. The resultant average running time show of 34.1 miles per hour. The maximum sj;eed sustained for a contii. stretch of two miles or more was ix miles per hour. Tin- n\ schedule time from Oakdale to Scribner Junct'on was :'ti 1-:: mi!. hour.

A table of scheduled time, as shown by time card for several other branches in the state, is also attached for purp&lt;&gt; - &lt; miparison. K'ln determining the roadway and track condition of this leration should be given to the fact that for five days during th. water in the early part of March, and at which season the tra ly in its poorest condition, the entire main line traffic of the North ?rn was diverted over the Albion branch and was carried snf&gt;-: nable speed and without materially affecting the line or sm 1 branch track, indicating that roadway conditions must lie | ttensive re-lining nor re-surfacing has been done sine handling leavy traffic.

Ehe improvements now in contemplation will serve the people ol for years to come. Its population will, and the business of tht ant will, under ordinary conditions, increase. K'he use of stoves for heating purposes at a station when a large ?r of passengers and patrons are passing in and out, for rea - essary to discuss, can hardly be considered adequate. The Com - n therefore finds that defendant should be required to install laintain a furnace, steam or hot water central heating system in pot at Albion. Complainants insist that defendant should provide for lighting its station with both electricity and gas. They urge that the electric lighi - simpany shuts off its service at midnight; that defendant's pas - • r train, due from the east at 11:30 p. m., is frequently late and not arrive until after midnight: and further, that during the past year the electric lighting service was discontinued for a period of two months by reason of a breakdown at its power house, and that similar contingencies may happen again. The defendants, in reply, contend that while such a contingency is possible, it is hardly probable; that they liave arranged with the lighting company to continue its service after midnight, upon notice, in the event trains are delayed, and that in the event of a discontinuance of the service by reason of a breakdown. adequate and sufficient lighting will be furnished through the medium of oil lamps. Ihile the installation of gas fixtures by the defendant to light its might evidence its good will and desire to conform to the of its patrons at Albion, it cannot be justly argued that when tion is properly equipped with a sufficient number of electric same to be supplemented by oil lamps in the event of a tern - breakdown, that such provision for lighting is inadequate or onable. Khe complainants further insist that defendant should locate its t room at the cast end of the depot instead of the west end, for ason that almost all, if not the entire, passenger travel approaches aves the depot at the west end, and that the location of its freight at that end will result in more or less freight and baggage cover - e platform, and cause its patrons more or less inconvenience in g through and around same. E'hile there is room for the placing of a freight room on the east the depot, the close proiimity of a large elevator, with Its ap - es, makes it impossible for the company to provide safe and ably adequate approaches to the freight platforms at this end t moving the elevator. </seg>

Hill in the interest of the tizens of Gandy and vicinity. Gandy is located in Logan County aska, being about one and one-half miles from the branch line of the nion Pacific Railroad, recently constructed. It was practically agreed between the attorneys for the plaintiff and the defendant, at the time the arguments were made in the case, that, brushing aside all of the immaterial issues involved, the qn&gt; to be determined is. What is Gandy and the surrounding country en - titled to in view of location and all the existing circumstances? The population of Gandy, as given by the last census report, &gt;s :'. is. At the time of taking the census it had no railroad facilities nearer than twenty or more miles. It is the county seat of Logan county, and previous to the time of the building of the extension of the I'nion Pacific lailroal. was the business center of Logan county, having a court house, two banks and a number of well established business houses. It is situated on an elevated site in the Loup Valley. As to the construction of the contiguous railroad line, it is contended that it vs. I nion 1'iu-itU' l^iili-oail ( &lt;&gt;iii|iiin&gt; , Defend- ant. </seg>
            <seg id="p164">164 was impractuable to leave the valley, along which the road is built, and attempt to climb the grade to Gandy, consequently the road is lo. one and one-half miles north of this village. On the line some three miles west of Gandy a new town has been incorporated, known as Stapleton. It is the contention of the Railroad Company that th« - citizens of Gandy and vicinity are reasonably well s-erved at Staplet &gt;n. and that the company should not be compelled to provide facilities for this purpose at Gandy. The evidence shows that the village of Gandy has been the county seat of Logan County for more than twenty years, and that the major portion of the local business of the present railroad will come from ■ farming settlement on what is known as Garfield Table, where most of the farm products of the county are produced, and that in order to reach Stapleton these products will have to be hauled through Gandy. The distance between Gandy and Stapleton is something over three miles and the road is very sandy, while the road between Gandy and a point on the railroad one and one-half miles north of Gandy is solid and can be well maintained. It is argued by the defendant that most of the business houses formerly located in Gandy have moved to Stapleton and that it is only a matter of time until all will do so, and that eventually the court house will be located there. The facts in the case seem to be that a large number of persons are dtsirous of maintaining their homes at Gandy. that they have so maintained them for many years, having no railroad facilities, and now that the road has been built they should have the Opportunity of enjoying the benefits of the same at the nearest point possible. A large |.art of the strictly farming population of the county lies south and east of Gandy. making a longer and more difficult haul necessary if Stapleton is to be reached. Logan is a sparsely populated county, the population shown by the last census being about 1500. The court house was bu:lt years ago, and the bonds issued for its construc - tion have just been paid. It is not a thing of beauty nor a joy forever, but it may be that the citizens of Logan county are not ready to assume new court house obligations now, and that they will prefer to put up with the present inconvenient location and antiquated structure for a considerable period rather than build at another point. The Commission has no way to estimate the earnings of this line of road, but by the building of the road the company has obligated itself to give reasonable service to the community through which it losses. Had Gandy not been built, the county seat not located, nor the business center built up at this point previous to the time the road was con - structed, the prayer of the petition might properly be denied, but, under existing circumstances, we believe these people have some rights that should be protected.

The reason for this recommendation is as follows: Beginning at Jansen and extend - ing east to Harbine both the line and surface of track is poor; from Har - bine to Ellis the line and surface of track is fair with some exception?: from Ellis to Mile Post 131 the line of track is fair, but the surface is poor, notwithstanding a considerable amount of labor in evidence ex - pe'nded on the curves this season; from Mile Post 131 to Beatrice a con - siderable of track work has been done with heavy tie renewals, and condition is good; from Beatrice to Virginia both line and surface of track are good except in few spots; from Virginia to Lewiston the alignment of track is fair, while the surface is poor; from Lewiston to Pawnee and beyond the line and surface of track is poor. As covering a portion of the last mentioned section lying immediately westward from Pawnee a number of cuts have been ditched and tile delivered on the ground for drainage, but the tile has not been laid. Eastward from Pawnee some ditching work is in progress.

ORDER. Epon the application of Bancroft Telephone Company to raise it^ arm line switching rates from 25 to 35 cents per month. HeUI. hat the evidence adduced does not warrant the increase, and ap - ilication denied without prejudin'. Ctarke, Commissioner: I 'he applicant herein, operating an exchange at Bancroft, Nebraska, its application for authority to increase its farm line switching from 25 to 35 cents per month. Notice was given, and at th&gt; ig both the applicant and representatives of the farm line: - red. At the time of the hearing applicant reported fifty-one business telephones paying $2.00 per month, sixty-four residence telephones - paying $1.50 per month, seventy-nine farm line telephones paying $1.25 per month, and sixty-four farm telephones which it switches - at a rate of twenty-five cents per month, aggregating a yearly revenue of $3,648.00. In addition there is a reported monthly revenue of $30.00 per month as commissions on toll business, increasing th - total annual revenue to $4,008.00. Applicant pays its manager $115.00 per month, and furnisher light, heat and rent. The manager out of this allowance provide? the switching service and looks after the maintenance and operation of the exchange. The services of an additional lineman or trouble shooter, when required, is obtained at 25 cents an hour, but by reasoi. of reconstruction and extensions, and failure to segregate such charge? from proper maintenance charge, no definite or satisfactory idea could be furnished of actual cost of maintenance. Other monthly expenses are estimated as follows: Taxes, $5.50; light and heat, $10: </seg>
            <seg id="p171">171 rent, $12; bookkeeping and collections. $2n. These do not include insurance, postage or incidentals. Applicant in support of its contention submitted a statement which it deemed properly chargeable to its monthly exchange operating costs, as follows: Depreciation and interest on central equipment (cost This, if properly chargeable to all telephones, including those farm lines telephones switched, or 194 in all. would, if apportioned to all alike, represent a monthly switching cost of 57 cents per telephone. The charge of $35. on per month for two operators was based on the experience of applicant in hiring operators for that purpose, the lowest wages paid being $20. on a month, and board and room at $4." week. As high as $25 per month with board and room had been paid. The applicant was unable to furnish any definite data as to other costs, or as to number of calls put up to the various classes of sub - scribers, as it had but recently taken over the assets and books of another company, and had been and was then engaged in the recon - struction and extension of its lines. There was some evidence to there being more time required to put up calls destinating on farm lines than those destinating on city lines, but as to the number of calls originating and destinating on each class of line there was no evidence whatever. I Such information can only be secured by the keeping of accurate as to the number of calls originating and destinating on the various es of telephones, and the time consumed in making the necessary ections; also a careful accounting of the labor and material in maintaining the equipment, and in this case the central equip - in particular. The Commission is not satisfied that all the items submitted by applicant as chargeable to switchboard operation and mainten - ance are properly wholly chargeable to it, particularly taxes and bookkeeping and collections. The estimated cost for maintenance of $20.00 per month in addition to a monthly interest and depreciation charge of $11.32 on a central exchange equipment costing $849. In. seems excessive. Furthermore, the revenue of $30.00 per month for handling toll messages should be credited to switchboard operation. This alone would reduce the central operation cost per telephone on applicant's basis 15 cents per month.

            <seg id="p172">172 FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT satisfied that the cost of operating the switchboard, when accurately and definitely obtained should be charged on an equal pro rate basi - between all classes of telephones. I As a rule, in this state the charge for switching farm lines is ti i per month. We are advised of cases where such service is fur - id at lower rates, and in a few cases have specifically approver, higher charge. In the latter cases, however, the Commission, clearly satisfied that in addition to other factors determining equitable distribution of the cost of telephone service justifying lcreased rate for switching, the applicants were not receiving a. return on the investment. We are not advised as to the value of applicant's plant. It was purchased in the spring of 1911 for $5,200.00, and one of its officer* estimates that an additional $4,500.00 or more, has been expendeu in reconstruction and extensions, and that its value at the time of tlu - hearing was $11,000.00. Making a fair allowance for maintenance cost, concerning which no definite information was. nor probably could be furnished, and after examining the operating and maintenance costs of other companies - of about the same size and character, it would appear that a groat - revenue of $4,000.00 a year would not only take care of all operating expenses, taxes, etc., and pay a fair dividend, but would provide • reasonable reserve for depreciation and emergencies, and that th» - application should be denied. K'he denial of this application is, however, without prejudice u ght of the applicant to renew its application, if it shall develop experience, after careful cost and traffic accountings, etc., that venue will not provide a fair return on its value in addition tc lonable depreciation reserve, or that under a 25-cent switching l farm line telephone does not bear its fair portion of expense tral exchange operation, rr IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the application of the Ban- Telephone Company to increase its farm line switching rates 25 to 35 cents per month, be, and the same is, hereby denied Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 30th day of January NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION, H.

Allen, Secretary APPLICATION NO. 1299. In the Matter of the Application of The Chicago. Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company to Have Approved Supplemen Cancelling Supplement 86 to Freight Tariff 21432 W'iinifU, Chairman: un January 18, 191-', the Chicago, Rock Island *.- Pacific Rail- Company made application to this Commission for authority to cancel Supplement No. 86 to Freight Tariff 21432. under which the following firms have been served, viz_. Bailey's Sanatorium. Beards - ley &amp; Deane. Cushman Motor Company, Enterprise Planing Mill. C. H. Pray, Frey Ai Frey. and C. T. Payne, and to have approved, in lieu thereof. Supplement No. 97 to same tariff, under the provisions of which service to the firms above named would be eliminated. The contention is that while the tariff carries a rate for &gt;-■ to these firms, that in fact they are not located on the right-of - way of the Chicago, Hock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company. Generally considered, common carriers have been permitted to exercise the right to designate the purposes for which their tracks are to be used, that is. they may determine what tracks may ba used for team tracks and what shall be used for switching tracks. No rates are filed for the team tracks and under present conditions, it is probably proper that team tracks should be protected from use by other lines. It is also proper that the public be provided with reason - able facilities, but we do not assume that each particular shipper can choose a point where his cars must be delivered, unless he is located and named on some particular switching or industrial track. The question of charges for this service is not involved, in this case. Neither is the question raised as to the service being limited to non-com - petitive business. The only question raised is. shall the Chicago. Kock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company be permitted to discontinue certain service it has hitherto performed, and to file a tariff from which the service is eliminated. It seems to be contemplated that these industrial tracks, to which rates are named, are intended for the use of such industries as are located on the right-of-way owned by the railway company or on private property contiguous to such right-of-way. While this may be true as to the rule, we find in practice that exceptions are </seg>
            <seg id="p176">176 FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT so numerous that in the case before us the exception becomes the rule. In fact, not only is this true but these tracks have been used as team tracks to a limited extent, and to prevent discrimination such use must be discontinued or all who wish to use them for such pur - poses must be permitted to do so. To throw them open for team track purposes we feel would be an injustice to industries now being served, and we find that the use of them for such purposes should be discon- The Nebraska law contemplates equal facilities and rates to all under like conditions. Section 3 of the Interstate Commerce law. referring to the reasonable and equal facilities for the interchange of traffic, says: — "But this shall not be construed as requiring any such common carrier to give the use of its track or terminal facili - ties to another carrier engaged in like business." In a case before the Interstate Commerce Commission, handed down May 14, 1912, tae Commission said, that where a common carrier voluntarily offers such service to its competitors, Section 3 can have no application, not - withstanding the rates fixed are so high that they are prohibitive. At the hearing above mentioned, counsel for the railways said, "Wi have, by the fixing of $30.00 per car, done what Section 3 tells us to do, — protect ourselves against our competitors." The holding of the Interstate Commerce Commission was, "It is admitted, however. that there was no distinction between the collection of charges for interchanging competitive and non-competitive traffic, and that these defendants offered each to the other the use of their respective tracks for terminals, and, having elected to perform this service, the rate must be reasonable." In the case before this Commission, the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company has elected to perform this service, hav - ing been doing bo for years on a voluntary rate fixed by itself. The industries named have been accommodated, and there was no showing made that these industrial tracks were congested to such an extent as to make it an inconvenience to those located on the right-of-way, or adjacent thereto, on account of the service being given to in - dustries located at more remote points. The Commission finds that until such time as a showing may be made that the industries en and adjacent to the right-of-way of these industrial spurs are inconvenienced by service given to indus - tries named in thjs application, that the service should be continued as to Beard8ley &amp; Deane, Cushman Motor Company, Enterprise Plan - ing Mill, C. H. Frey, Frey &amp; Frey, and C. T. Payne. The Bailey Sanatorium, being located between one and two miles from the switch, has no valid claim to be classed as an industry and to be served by it. To bo order would embarrass the Commission unless such order Included all who should desire a like service. </seg>

This amount was increased at a subsequent hearing by $2.:!&lt;hi.&lt;h&gt; on account of advances omitted in the original showing and advances made subsequent thereto for the same purpose. Ietitioner prayed that for the purpose of paying and refunding lebtedness, and raising funds to provide additions ami t&gt;. •• in its plant and service, that it be authorized to laaw in the sum of $3&lt;&gt;.ihim.ih&gt;. said bonds to run for a period not than twenty years and bear a rate of interest not to ex • cent.

The plant, since its taking over by the present company, has paid no dividends, and if depreciation is charged off. has probably not more than paid operating expenses. Its physical condition. ho» has been greatly improved, its patrons increased from 111 in number to 350, with good prospects of increasing this number materially: its franchise has recently been extended, and while there is no data or evidence whereby any conclusion can be accurately drawn as to its future earnings, it would appear that the company has reached that period of its existence where it will yield some return upon the capital invested in its properties. The first question for the Com mission's consideration is on the application for approval of the issuance of the |45,immi.O'i stock. It was /admitted by the petitioner that the $45.immi.imi bond issue of The Citizens Gas Company covered the original investment, and that at the time the petitioner took over the property for the bondholders in 1909, the property was badly run down and not worth the face of the bonds. Can the Commission, under the law. in the proper ex - ercise of its duties, approve the issuance of said stock? The Nebraska statute relating to the issuance of stocks and bonds, requiring an order approving same by the Commission, is, with the exception of certaian penal provisions, an exact copy of paragraphs 55 and 56 of the Public Service Commission Law of New York, and provides as follows: "A common carrier or public service corporation organized, and incorporated or hereafter incorporated, under or by virtue of the law* of the state of Nebraska, may issue stocks, bonds, notes or other evi- </seg>

It was realized that dividends might be declared at the expense of the property, and that inadequate provision might be made for depreciation and other reserves, l&gt;ut the Commission did not consider such methods wise nor lawful." On certiorari the determination of the Commission denying the application was reversed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, People ex rel Third Ave. H.

The court's decision was based on sections 9 and 10 of the stock corporation law of New York, which provided inter alia that the capital stock of the new corporation should not exceed in the aggre - gate the maximum amount of stock mentioned in the certificate of incorporation of the old corporation. These sections, as expressed by Justice Ingraham. in a concurring opinion, provided Ka system by which the readjustment of the respective interests property and franchises of a corporation which have been sold by of a mortgage or deed of trust or a judgment or decree of a </seg>

They expressly allow the creditors, mortgagees, and stockholders of a corporation owning property and franchises to purchase at the foreclosure sale and to organize a corporation to carry out the objects for which the corporation was originally organized. The statute expressly givea to such creditors, mortgagees and stockholders or any of them the right to become a corporation to make an agreement among themselves for such reorganization and readjustment, to acquire the property and franchises which have thus been sold, and to issue its bonds and stock in conformity with the provisions of the plan or agreement under which the property was purchased at the foreclosure sale. It was recognized that upon such a reorganization or readjustment new cap - ital might be required, and so the amount of bonds or stock m limited to the amount which had been issued by the predecessor poration. The legislature left it to the creditors, mortgagees and stockholders, who were unrted in the purchase and in the plan of ganization and readjustment, to fix the amount of bonds and sti&gt;&lt; be issued to meet the requirements of the situation. There was thus in existence a comprehensive statute to provide for one condition — the case of a corporation whose property had been sold under a deer fc.reclosure or under a mortgage or deed of trust. It required entirelv different treatment from the organization of a new corporation to acquire a new franchise and to acquire or construct property wltl which to exercise it. It was not the general condition r. either new corporations organized to acquire a fianchlie, or to i;r corporations exercising and oneratlim the franchises and which would require from time to time additional money or property for the u?es of such corporation, and this statute was re-enar te 1 in lift after the passage of the Public Service Commission's Law. " From the opinion of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Coun. an appeal was allowed to the Court of Appeals and unanimously af - firmed. People ex rel vs. Public Service Commission, Hrt N. B. Rtp. lull'. Chief Justice Cullen. speaking for the court, said: ■"Hold'ng. as we do. that the relator corporation falls within the provisions of section 55 of the Public Service Commission's law. w&lt; brought to the question whether, unier the prov'sions of tb;i hnd those of the s'ork corporation law, relative to the rejrgani/ of corporations, the Commission was justified in refusing 1 1 1 - applied for, becarse the value of the mortgaged property an I the amount of the new capital to be invested were less than the amo'int or securities to be issued bv the corporation.

One is found in the statute itself. In the case of the merger or consolrdation of two </seg>

Thus. case of merger the limit of the amount of stock of a corporation endent, not on the value of its property, hut on the stock out - n« of the constituent corporations prior to the merger. We the same rule is applicable to the case of a corporation formed ■ reorganization of a foreclosed railroad." I From the foregoing it is clear that if there were no statutory sions for the reorganization of existing corporations, as provided (ctions 9 and 10 of the New York Stock Corporation law and egality of the plan rested upon the interpretation of the Public ce Commission law applicable to the case, which is identical the Nebraska statute, that the corporation formed on the reorgani - n of a foreclosed company was entitled to a capitalization equal iiount to that of the original company. And further the court said: "It is not necessary to consider the issuance of the securities of the new corporation as a refunding of the outstanding obligations of the old. It Is sufficient to say that the statute authorizes the bond - holders, stockholders, and creditors to agree upon a plan for the read - justment of their respective interests, and authorizes the new corporp - tion to issue its stock and bonds in accordance with the agreement. A readjustment of the interest* of the parties does not contemplate that the new securities shall necessarily he scaled clown to the actual \alue of the property. If this was the contemplation of the statute, the statute would be of little value. The property sold rarely realizes the amount due on the mortgage foreclosed. If the sale price is considered the criterion of value, there could he no plan which would give the holders of stock or of junior securities any interest in the new corpora - tion, while often the bondholders under the mortgage foreclosed might lind themselves without the right to obtain any securities of the new curnonttion in lieu of their Ixmds. The intent of the statute was to enable the various persons interested in an insolvent or defaulted rail - road to agree upon some plan or scheme to take the road out of in - solvency and a receivership, and make the enterprise a going concern. For this purpose additional money is generally recfuisite, which as already said, can be obtained only from those interested in the property, and not even from them, unless, as an inducement to advance the money. t'-ey are given the opportunity of retrieving their prior investment. In many instances the growth of the community in which the railroad was located and the improvement in business conditions has ultimately justified the advance of new capital, and the benefit and protection of 'he original investors in the enterprise was also the object of the si;- lute. We do not say that in the reorganization of a railroad the new corporation is author'/.ed to issue securities in excess of those of the (•mipanv to whose property and franchises it li'is succeeded and the new iiK'iiey that may be put in the enterprise.. Such a plan would l&gt;e plainly inconsistent with the spirit of the Public Service Commission's law against the issue of 'watered 1 stock or bonds, but, up to the limit we have named, the new corporation has the right to issue securities." 96 N.

This contention is based on an interpretation of that section of the general incorporation law which provides that the highest amount of indebtedness or liability to which a corporation shall, at any one time, be subject must in no case exceed two-thirds of the capital stock actually issued (4120 Cobbey's Annotated Statutes for 1909), to the effect that "capital stock actually issued" means I While such a statutory requirement might be advantageous for &gt;rotection of the public investing in corporate evidences of in - •dness, it might at the same time result to the serious inconvenience loss to patrons of public service companies demanding service, </seg>

"The application is one to discharge certain indebtedness; but in - ly to capitalize certain improvements, the desirability of which I a matter of dispute.

The Commission might become in - volved in endless complication* which would tend to defeat the very purpose of its existence; and improvements ne"ded for the efficieii si i vice might be held up, while tile facts as to a matter ware 'ained. which, however interesting and valuable in themselves would not help the Commission in the least as to deciding the point at The past of a corporation, whether financially faulty or blanx- - sliould not of itself bar the way to its rendering '&gt;f efficient servic ••- in the present or future. •••••••••••• Ami. * therefore, will not inquire in this proceeding i'lt" any ;«ll«'ue&lt;l Mw &lt;;i|iit »li/.al : oii of the applicant cvistinu at tlie time the application was "That the investigation upon this application for additional talization will he continei to the question whether such capitali/ (1 be authorized by reason of tlie actual investment of money for irposes of the corporation recognized by law as a subject of capi - talisation." We do not believe that the present law makes such a requirement. nor that the Commission has the discretion to refuse the issuance of bonds when reasonably required for the purpose set out in the statute, and not in excess of two-thirds of its capital stock actually ■ d, or the limitation prescribed by its charter. Knder date of January 22, 1910, Attorney General Thompson, request of this Commission for an interpretation of said section rendered an opinion (3rd Ann. Rep. N. S. R.

Gentlemen: This letter is to acknowledge your verbal request for an opinion on the questions involved in the following letter: Bl hereby notify you that we 'The Farmers' Cooperative Telephone it ion ■ have this day decided, by a majority vote of all our stock - b, to quit renting phones to outsiders and adhere strictly to the I plan, said service to outsiders to be discontinued March 1st, that being the date their contracts expire. Bin case some should come in and take an equal share, what may we th the money, as we would not care to have so much lay in the iry? B Would it be necessary for you to st;&gt;te the amount or rate per cent, he new members are to pay?" The following question is involved: ■'After a telephone company has transacted business as a public •e corporation, may it, on vote of its stockholders, retire from position and thereafter serve only its stockholders on a mutual r Upon examination of the articles of incorporation of this com - pany. I find that its authorized business "shall be to construct, own and operate telephone lines and telephone exchanges, and to buy. hold, sell and transfer such real and personal property as may be neccwry to carry out the purposes of this corporation." (Article 3) Acting under these articles, which permit a general telephone business as a public service corporation, the Louisville company has. in the past, furnished this service to others along its lines, making no discrimination in favor of its stockholders. It has accepted the gen - eral franchise granted to such companies of use of public roads in the location of poles and wires. (Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of 1911. aec. 11963). It has furnished this service for hire in the past, and pro - poses to continue it to its stockholders alone. On November 18. 1910, Attorney General Martin advised you "That a telephone company, organized solely for private purposes, or for the purpose of accommodating its own members, and which is pro - hibited by its articles of incorporation from renting telephones to the public does not come tinder the provisions of law which reouire the No. ;»7. </seg>
            <seg id="p202">202 ■&lt;■ I Railway Commission to authorize it to issue stock, bonds forms of indebtedness. This law evidently was designed to pla&lt; • the control of the State Railway Commission such public servic •ations as undertake to serve the public for hire. The company bed by you does not undertake to serve the public for hin •ve it in any manner, but expressly provides to the contrary. , I do not think this company conies under the term 'public ser - orporations,' as used in the statute." Bhe Wisconsin Railway Commission has held similarly. (190 , 1&gt;. 281.) Bn State v. 1'iiion Stock Yards Co. 81 Neb. 67, the supreme cour" ustained the legislative definition of common carriers, w I the Farmers' Cooperative Telephone Association under th-r ition of the State Railway Commission. It is probably true that if the Farmers' Cooperative Telephou Association is permitted to cut off its non-stockholders, those people will be compelled to become stockholders or forever be precluded fron: having telephone service. It is not probable that another line will be constructed, which will serve the patrons who now lose this service Bhe supreme court of Nebraska, early in the history of the tele laid down the rule that a company of this sort, which held itsel serving the public, must serve all alike. (State v. N&gt;l&gt;ri«-.k. Telephone Co., 17 Neb. 126.) Chief Justice Reese there said: "The wires of respondent pass the office of relator. Its posts ar - planted in the street in front of his door. In the very nature o: things, no other wires or posts will be placed there while those or respondent remain. The relator never can be supplied with this new element of commerce so necessary in the prosecution of all kinds o: business, unless supplied by the respondent." The Farmers' Cooperative Telephone Association proposes to abai. - don the service of the public and become purely a mutual company, proposing to act in no way as a public service corporation. In other words, it proposes to retire permanently and absolutely from the fielri as a common carrier, as defined by the statutes. Ktake it that this cannot be done so long as, by its articles of in ation, it holds itself out to the world as a public service corpor It ought not to profess to be such a corporation and practic* lination in favor of its stockholders. In my opinion, your commission would be justified in advising 'armers' Cooperative Telephone Association that so long as it ns, by public profession, in its corporate charter, a public servii&lt; - ration, it cannot refuse to serve the public without discrimina - and that so long as it retains its present charter it will be subje&lt; I jr regulation as a common carrier.

            <seg id="p203">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION" 203 No. :*8 Lincoln, July 2, 1912 Nebraska State Hallway Commission Kincoln, Nebraska, men: ■ ou have requested my opinion on the question of the jurisdiction Nebraska State Railway Commission to hear and determine the aint made by complainants against the respondent and to grant lief prayed for by said complainants. In the consideration of this question, it is, of course, elementary that the commission has only such power as is conferred upon it either by the constitution or by statute. It becomes important then to con - sider the constitutional and statutory provisions bearing upon the powers and duties of the commission. ft the general election held November 6, 1906, a constitutional ment was adopted which provided for the establishment of the of State Railway Commission, and defined the duties of that "The powers and duties of such commission shall include the regulation of rates, service and general control of common carriers as the legislature may provide by law." There is a further provision that: 'In the absence of specific legislation, the commission shall exer - cise the powers and perform the duties enumerated in this provision." Rut. it is not necessary to be considered here, for the reason that the legislature of 1907, which met soon after the adoption of the amendment to the constitution providing for the State Railway Com - mission, did provide by law what the powers and duties of said com - mission should be. Section 2, of said act, provides among other things: KSaid commission shall have the power to regulate the rates and ss of, and to exercise a general control over all railroads, express nies, car companies, sleeping car companies, freight and freight &gt;mpanies, and all other common carriers engaged in the trans - ion of freight or passengers within the state." (Compjled stat - t 1911, ch. 72, art. 8, sec. 2, sub-div. b. ) Section 4, of the act, defines the term "common carriers" as used in said act: I 'The term common carriers as used herein shall be taken to in - all corporations, companies, individuals and association of indi- Is, their lessees, or receivers (appointed by any court whatsoever) may now or hereafter own, operate, manage, or control any ad, interurban or street railway line, operated either by steam or icity or any other motive power, or part thereof, or any express iny, car company, sleeping car company, freight and freight line my, telegraph and telephone companies, and any other carrier :ed in the transmission of messages or transportation of passengers </seg>
            <seg id="p204">204 FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT or freight for hire." (Compiled Statutes of 1911, ch. 72, art. 8. sec ■his definition of "common carrier" as found in the act of It*" en judicially construed in the case of State v. l"ni»n Stock Yard L Neb. 68, wherein it is said: "Any person or corporation holding itself out to the public a&gt; offering its services to all persons similarly situated, and performiiit as Its public vocation the services of transporting passengers, freiglw or intelligence, is a common carrier in the particular spheres of such employment." Kt is, of course, quite evident that irrigation works are not en*: in the transmission of messages or the transportation of pa- Their object and purpose are something quite different. !!■ are not common carriers for either of those reasons. If the. uninion carriers in the sense in which that term is used in th&lt; quoted excerpt from the 1907 law, they are such because the; - are common carriers of freight for hire. Are they such? In othn words, is water running through an irrigation ditch freight and is ii Kd for hire, in the ordinary acceptation of those terms, where tlu is owned by some person or corporation who is furnishing watn ans of said ditch to water users for irrigation purposes? It seems to the writer that neither of the above questions ca: rly be answered In the affirmative. That is to say, I do no that water running in an irrigation ditch is freight within tli - on meaning of that term, nor do 1 think that it is carried fo as that phrase is commonly understood. Therefore, I do no the statute passed in 1907 gave your commission any authorir ulate or control in any way irrigation ditches. "In the interpretation of statutes, words in common us&gt; are to be, construed in their natural, plain, and ordinary sign; fication. It is a very well-settled rule that so long as the languag&gt; used is unambiguous a departure from its natural meaning is no justified by any consideration of its consequences or of publii policy." (36 Cyc. 1114.) ' In construing a statute, words should be given their usu meaning." (State v. Ityrum, 60 Neb. 384.) I it may be remarked in passing that if irrigation works are con; carriers within the meaning of that term, as defined by tu - rf 1907, it follows, by at least a parity of reason, that wate: i which furnish water for the use of the inhabitants of the variou and villages of the state are also common carriers within th&gt; ing of such definition. I presume that no one will seriously con that such was the legislative intent. ■But, in 1911 the legislature passed an act which, omitting th gency clause thereof, reads as follows: "Irrigation works constructed under the laws of this stat are hereby declared to be common carriers. </seg>
            <seg id="p205">"The owner or operator of any works for th&lt; riag* or diversion of water except irrigation districts must d&lt; all water legally appropriated to the parties entitled to tli - of the water for beneficial purposes, at a reasonable rate, to be fixed by the state railway commission, according to the law in such cases relating to common carriers." (Compiled Btal of 1911, ch. !)3a. art. I, sees. 7n. 71.) It will be observed that the first section of this act d&gt; broadly, without any reservation or exception whatever, that irriga - tion works constructed under the laws of this state are common carriers This includes, of course, irrigation works constructed or under the control of irrigation districts. But, the second section of Um which provides that the rates charged for the delivery of water shall be fixed by the State Railway Commission, niak s an exception in the of irrigation districts. The commission is not given pow - fix rates as to them. It is contended on behalf of complainant: that the bare dechi contained in said act. that irrigation works are common carriers, is sufficient to clothe the commission with power to regulate and con - trol said irrigation works in the same way and manner that it has power to control other common carriers, such as railroads for in - stance, under the provisions of section 2, of the railway eoinn. act of 1907. hereinbefore quoted, except in so far as such power is modified by the clause exempting irrigation districts from the provi - sion of the act which specifically clothes the board with po« t.lish rates. I cannot agree with this contention. I do not think tha - w-as the legislative intent. If it was. then it follows that it was the itive intent to clothe your commission with power to regulate the rates and services of, and to exercise general control over, all irrigation works constructed under the laws of this state, with the single exception that it cannot fix the rates to be charged by irrigation districts. I do not believe the legislature contemplated any such result by the passage of the act last above quoted. To so hold would bring said law in direct conflict in more than one respect with the g&gt; laws covering the subject of irrigation. To illustrate, it is expressly provided by statute that not only all appropriations of water for irrigation purposes shall be ill by the state board of irrigation, but it is also made the duty of the water commissioner, appointed by said board for each water dis - trict, to divide the water of his district among the several appro - priators according to priority of right of each respectively, and to see that the headgates of any ditch, reservoir, or other device for the appropriation and use of water under the laws of the state are shut down when it is necessary to do so by reason of the priority of rights of others taking water from the same stream and of its tributaries or any stream to which it is tributary. (Compiled Statutes of 1911. ch. </seg>
            <seg id="p206">FIFTH ANNUAL HKI'ORT 206 It is further made the duty, by statute, of every person, corpora - tion, or association owning or controlling any ditch, canal, or reser - voir, for the purpose of storing or using water for any purpose, to construct and maintain a substantial headgate at the point of diversion of a design approved by the secretary of the state board, and so built that it may be closed and partially closed and fastened at any stage with lock and seal. It is further provided by statute that such person, corporation, or association shall construct a measuring device for measuring and appropriating the water appropriated, which measuring device shall be of a design approved by the secretary of the state board and built at the most practical point to be selected aad approved by him. (Compiled Statutes of 1911, ch. 93a, art. 2, sec. 37.) It is made unlawful, by statute, for any person to wilfully open or close, change or interfere with, any headgate or controlling or by any means take water from any natural stream, reservoir, or other source, without authority of the state board of irrigation through its water commissioner, after the headgate of such ditch or ditches shall have been closed and fastened by lock or seal, or ordered closed by the water commissioner of the district in which such ditch or reservoir is situated. (Compiled Statutes of 1911. ch. 93a, art. 2, sec. 50.) Mapy other provisions of statute might be cited to show that th* control which the state board of irrigation has over irrigation works is inconsistent with the claim that the Nebraska State Railway Commission has power, under the statute, to regulate the service of, and to exercise general control over, such works by reason of the fact that they are declared by statute to be common carriers, but enough has doubtless been said on that subject. It is apparent that the commission does not have such general control unless the passage of the act declaring irrigation common carriers repealed, by implica - tion, various provisions of statute giving the state board of irrigation control over such works. Bearing in mind the elementary rule of statutory construction that "repeals by implication are not favored," I am constrained to believe that the provisions of statute hereinbefore referred to, and others giving the state board of irrigation control in certain res - pects of works of irrigation, were not repealed by implication by the passage of the act declaring such works common carriers, and that, therefore, the Nebraska State Railway Commission was not clothed by the passage of said act with power to exercise general control over such works, but that its authority is limited to that specifically conferred upon it by said statute, viz., the power to establish reasonable rates for service.

            <seg id="p207">Lincoln, Neb., July 6, 1912 Nebraska State Railway Commission, Kincoln, Nebraska men : You have presented to me the application of the Callaway Mil - ling &amp; Electric Company, of Callaway. Nebraska, in' which said com - pany asks that it be authorized by your body to issue and sell its capital stock in the amount of |7S,00« and its first mortgage bond in the amount of $25, &lt;m". Irhis company appears from the application to be an organ - ii in the nature of a consolidation of the Callaway Milljng &amp; facturing Company and the Callaway Electric Light &amp; Power any, and that the assets of the new company will be the combined of the last named companies. as Um — n art- shown by ules and inventories attached to the application. SFrom the statement of the proposed new company, I learn that combined capitalization of the two old companies amounted to t $40.imhi, whereas the new company is to be capitalized for iMHi. The application discloses the nature of the business to be sacted by the new company, to-wit. the Callaway Milling &amp; Bh pany. It is novel in this respect, in that the purposes for which organized are numerous and diverse in their nature, beta| umber: 1. To acquire and operate water power B. To acquire, construct, and operate flour mills and ■ her purposes. 3. To engage in the buying and selling of grain, flour, feed and other agricultural products. KTo act as warehouseman and broker in the handling and g in grain and agricultural products. 5.

To consolidate its property rights, franchises, privil - assets, or any part of them with any other corporation or my. ■ou ask for a written opinion of this department as to whether body is authorized to permit the issuance of bonds by this ted company. The first question that confronts me is whether or not the corporation has a right, under our general incorporation laws, to organize and to state in its articles of incorporation that it is organized for two or more distinct purposes, one of those purposes being public service in its nature. 1 am unable to find any express constitutional or statutory inhibition against a corporation stating in its articles of incorporation that its purpose is to follow two or more kinds of business. In the absence of such inhibition I see no reason why it might not so incorporate. This corporation, as suggested above, is unusual, and it is doubt - ful whether the general incorporation laws ever contemplated the organization of a company that would cover such a large field of en - terprises. Be that as it may, the public service feature of the articles seems to be a small part of the business contemplated by the company. If the company has the power to operate flour mills, erect and operate grain elevators, engage in the purchase and sale of articles of merchandise, purchase and sell real estate for all purposes, purchase and sell the capital stock of other corporations, it would seem that the manufacture and sale of electricity, and thus the running of a public service corporation, would be but an insig - nificant part of the business to be transacted by the company. IPhe power conferred upon your Commission is found in section .rticle 8, chapter 72. Compiled Statutes of 1911, and, among things, provides that a common carrier or public service corpora - hereafter incorporated under the laws of this state may issue b. bonds, notes, or other evidence of indebtedness for four pur- 1.

For the discharge or lawful refunding of its obligations Before authorizing the issuance of such bonds, stock, and notes, incumbent upon the Commission to find that the same are necessary or reasonably required for one or more of the purposes enumerated above. If the Commission makes an order authorizing the issuance of bonds under the application presented by the Callaway Milling &amp; Electric Company, how is it to determine for what purpose said company is to use the bond issue? Will it use it on that branch of its business which pertains to the public service, or wjll use it in </seg>
            <seg id="p209">NEBRASKA STATK RAILWAY COMMI.- Estruetion of flour mills and elevators, or in the buying of Late for any and all purposes, or in the buying of capital bonds, and securities of other corporations? The applica - nt's that the proceeds of the sale of the bonds proposed to ed are to be used for all these purposes, and particularly s that a part of it is to be used in building elevator*. It is quite clear, from the reading of the section referi above, that the legislature had in mind that the Commission should authorize the issuance of bonds of public service corporations, and those IM corporations who were pretending to serve, and \\rr&gt; actually serving the public, and that the Commission could only authorize the issue for one of four purpo&gt; KFor the acquisition of property to be used by the public corporation in serving the public. BFor constructing, completing, extending, or improving ies for serving the public. KFor the improvement or maintenance of its service in miiai blic. 4. For the discharge or lawful refunding of its obligations incurred in its enterprise of serving the public. It devolves upon you to determine whether or not there should order made authorizing a bond issue of this company for &gt;re of the purposes enumerated in the law. and if upon an igation you cannot find that said bond issue is to le or more of those purposes it is not your duty to auth&lt; uance. It is difficult to lay down a rule that would apply to each and every case. Each application of this kind must be passed upon and determined by a full consideration of the purposes and o! which the corporation has in view and the various kinds of bu - which it undertakes to perform. If the service of the public w.t - prime and controlling object of this corporation, and it was pnnnrinici of some other property or was compelled incidentally, to take over some other property in the course of its business, which did not exactly relate to its business as a public service corporation but which at some time in the near future it proposed to utilize for that purpose I think the Commission would still be authorized to make an order for the issuance of bonds under such circumstances I do not think your body is required to authorize the issuance of bonds by a corporation in process of organization, the proceeds of which are to be devoted to a multitude of purposes which are entirely foreign to the public service feature contemplated by its articles of incorpora- The is another feature of the law which it is well to ol It provides that the capital stock of a corporation formed l&gt;y the merger or consolidation of two or more corporations shall i. the sum of the capital stock of the corporation so consolidate </seg>
            <seg id="p210">210 the par value thereof, or such sum or any additional sum actually paid in cash. From the application I learn that this proposed con. - pany is to be a consolidation of two former companies, the con. - bined capital stock of which does not equal the capital stock of the proposed company. It does not appear that any' additional cash is to be placed la the new concern, but rather that the new concern is to be capitalized for an amount equal to the inventoried values of the properties of the other companies. If this is the true situation and the new company is virtually a consolidation of the two other com - panies, under these circumstances the statute would be a barrier to said consolidation. Therefore, in my judgment, in this particular case I do not think that the bond issue ought to be authorized by your body. On the other hand, if you should not agree with me in this, and should think that this is a case where you have the right to make an order I would suggest that it be so made that the bond issue be governed according to the amount which is to be devoted to the public service feature of the business, and that the accounts of the company be kept separate and its business segregated so that any time in the future the Commission may easily ascertain what portion of its capital is devoted to the public Bervice and what portion is used for other private interests. This would act as a foundation for the fixing of service rates. ise it became necessary in the future for the Commission to deal with that subject. I have suggested that it would be nec - essary for the Commission to deal with each application as presented, and that it cannot be guided by any fixed rule applicable to all case? This is apparent for the reason that one class of companies might wish the Commission to vouch for. a bond issue and in order to secure it attach to its general private business a small public service feature, whereas another class of companies doing a con - siderable public service business, and wishing to escape the lia - bilities of the act might combine with it other private enterprises Hence, it becomes necessary to deal with each case separately, and determine the course to be pursued by all the facts and circum - stances surrounding the same.

Note. — Under date of July 27, 1912, the Commission grant" 1 authority to the Gage County Independent Telephone Co. to discontinue service to the one phone maintained by said company in the town »f W ymore. Kelly Brothers, the parties in whose office the phone in question was located, sought to have the Commission reconsider its decision and, failing in that, instituted suit in the District Court of Cage County to compel the defendant company to continue service to the one phone. The following opinion sustains the position taken by the Commission, though the state was not a party to the suit: IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF GAGE COUNTY, NEBRASKA Kelley Brothers, Relators, vs. r&lt;;n»re County Independent Telephone Company, Respondent. OPINION This action is not properly brought. It should have been brought in the name of the State of Nebraska on relation of Kelly Brothers; </seg>
            <seg id="p215">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 215 but as the resi ondent has made no objection on that account, • will consider it waived. The action is brought by Kelley Brothers, as relators, to compel the respondent, the Gage County Independent Telephone Company, usually called the Blue Springs Telephone Company, to coune. telephone line with the relators' telephone and furnish relators the same service as it furnishes to its other members, stockholders and patrons. Relators base their demand on the theory that they. as members, patrons and stockholders of the respondent company ntitled to talk with the patrons of the Liberty, Barneston and Odell independent companies, with whom all, or most, of the patrons of the respondent are enabled to talk through some arrange between said companies and respondent, the nature of which i - disclosed by the evidence. It is conceded that relators might talk with all the patrons of respondent, except the members of said independent companies, by using another telephone system in Wyniore. Relators contend that the lnw as determined by our Sup Court in the case of State vs. Nebraska Telephone Conipan&gt;. IT Nebr. lLMi. l'L' N. \V. l':!7. gives them the right demanded. In case it was held "that the telephone is a public servant in the &lt;• :&gt;mn of the country, and that the respondent, said telephone &lt;:&gt;n ; having underu-ken to supply the demand in the City of Lii wherein the relator in that case, a Mr. Webster, resided, ami : able to furnish him with a telephone instrument the Ml other subscribers, it was its duty to do so." Said decision on the well known principal that telephone companie- 11 as other public service corporations, when they undertake to serve the public, must serve all the public who are like situated, without partiality or discrimination. Kl is plain that before relators, Kelley Brothers, can demand this rule shall be applied to them, they must show that they eing discriminated against by the respondents in favor of other ■s who are like situated with themselves. This leads to an ry into the facts of this case in that respect. The undisputed evidence shows that respondents ran a special line from their headquarters in Blue Springs into the City of Wymor» for the accommodation of the people of Wyniore. and solicited patrons in said city; that at one time, respondent had about 20 patrons in Wyniore, of whom relators formed a part; that for one reason or an - other all of these parties, except relators, had given up their tele - phones before this action was brought, and that relators, who were partners and had only the one telephone, were the only persons in Wymore who were using one of the respondent's telephones at the time respondent disconnected their telephone and refused again to connect it with its line. </seg>
            <seg id="p216">216 It thus appears that at the time respondent disconnected its line from relators' telephone, there was no one else in Wymore who occupied the same relation toward the respondent that relators did: and that at the time this action was brought, respondent was not discriminating against relators and in favor of any one else in Wymore. In fact respondent was treating everybody in Wymore exactly alike, for it was not operating its Wymore line at all. If respondent had furnishing a telephone to any one else in Wymore, then relators might have justly complained that they were being discriminated against, and might have had a right to complain and ask this court to compel respondent to treat them the same as It did any other person in the city of Wymore. But as respondent was not servine any other person at all in Wymore, it was treating relators the same as it did everybody else in Wymore, and relators have no reason to complain in that respect. In the Lincoln case above cited, upon which relators rely, the Telephone Company was doing business in Lincoln and had many patrons there, but refused to furnish Mr. Webster, who was the relator in that case, a telephone although he offered to pay for it and comply with all the rules of the company. The Supreme Court said the telephone company, while furnishing telephone* to other-., could not discriminate against Mr. Webster without cause, and com - pelled the company to furnish him a telephone. But in the present ca«e the respondent in not furnishing a telephone to any person in Wymore and is, therefore, not discriminating against the relators in favor of any one else in the city of Wymore. But relators further contend that because the respondent has wires running through Wymore on the section lines, in order to reach and serve farmers who live south of Wymore, that the respondent by refusing to connect relators with one of said lines, is discriminat - ing against relator in favor of said farmers. The evidence shows that respondent is essentially a farmers' company, organized to serve the farmers for several miles around Blue Springs and Wymore, and that it does so serve them. Nobody in Wymore is connected with either of said lines, which happen to run through Wymore as being the most direct route to its patrons in the country. Relators are not farmers, but business men in Wymore, one-half a mile away from either of said lines. Is the respondent discriminating against them by not connecting them with said farmers' line? If there is any good reason why the respondent should separate the city business from the country bus - iness so that the business of each could properly be placed in a class by itself, it is plain that serving one class and not the other would not be a discrimination against, or in favor of, either class. (Cumberland Telephone etc. Company v. Kelly. 160 Fed. 316, 15 Ann. Cases. 1S19. i </seg>
            <seg id="p217">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 217 Suppose this court should compel respondent to connect relators' telephone with the farmers line running through Wyniore; then. of course, the respondent would have to connect everybody else in Wyniore with such farmers' line, if demand was made theref&lt;,r; because if it did not it would be discriminating in favor of relators and against everybody else in Wymore. The result might be that the farmers' lines through Wymore would be so overloaded with city telephones as to be of no use to the farmers. The court would certainly have no right thus to destroy a farmers' line in order to accommodate people in the city. Especially is this true in view of the fact that respondents built a line into Wyniore expressly for the use of the people of Wymore but which, for some reason, they have failed to use. True, it is claimed by the relators that the reason the people of Wyniore gave up their eMMC - tion with the respondent's line was that there was a conspiracy between respondent and the New Home Telephone Company wti. the patrons of respondent in Wymore were induced to give up res - pondent's telephones and accept New Home Telephones in lieu there- Even if such were the case, I do not see how that could affect relator's rights in this action. As long as respondent's old patrons are satisfied with the change and make no complaint. I see no reason why relators should complain. The other patrons were under no obligations to relators to keep their old telephones and. had a |M right to make any kind of a deal with the New Home Company that they saw fit; and the New Home Company had a right to get all of respondent's patrons in Wymore that it could by offering what was to them a more acceptable service, which is all that the evidence shows that it did. If the New Home Company is not now living up to its agreements with its patrons (a matter about which the court is not now concerned), how could that give relators any cause of action against the respondent? Kelators further insist that as they are stockholders in res - pondent company. they are entitled to the same treatment that any of the rest of the stockholders are. That depends upon whether they are situated the same as such other stockholders. It is certain that if a farmer stockholder living near Wyniore should remove to Lincoln and take his telephone with him. he could not compel respondent to connect with it there. So if he should move from his farm into Wymore he could not compel respondent to coniiw -t with his telephone there for the very same reason that relators cannot compel it to connect with their telephone. The fact that relators are stockholders in respondent company does not give them any greater right to maintain this action of mandamus than is possessed by any - other citizen of Wymore. They must maintain the action, if at all. as part of the public to whom the respondent owes a legal duty, and they cannot maintain it merely in their individual capacity as stock- </seg>
            <seg id="p218">218 FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT holders of respondent. Respondent's constitution and by-laws con - tain no requirement that respondent shall connect with the telephone of its stockholders merely as such. If the respondent cannot be required to furnish a telephone connection to the public generally in Wymore, It cannot be compelled to furnish it to relators; because they have no greater rights in that regard than the rest of the Wymore public. It may be in disconnecting relator's telephone and permitting its direct line into Wymore to be taken down, respondent has violated some contract with relators, and they may have suffered damage thereby. But even if respondent has so violated its contract (upon which question I express no opinion), they cannot have redress by a writ of mandamus. Such writ is an extraordinary remedy and is never granted merely to compel compliance with a contract. It is not intended to take the place of an equitable action for specific performance, or any ordinary action at law to recover damages for breach of contract. Unless relators can show that they are being dis - criminated against by respondent in favor of the rest of the public they cannot make a case for the issuance of a writ of mandamus. Relators earnestly insist that the contract of 1912 between respondent and the Lincoln Telegraph &amp; Telephone Company is void as being in restraint of trade and commerce, and that the object and effect of it is to shut Wymore out from connection with the surrounding towns of Liberty, Barneston and Odell. That may be true, but if it is I do not see how it can affect this action. This action is not brought by the city of Wymore or the people of Wyniore . and the Lincoln Telegraph &amp; Telephone Company, which seems to be the company most complained of, is not a party of this action, and the validity of its contract cannot be determined in this suit brought by Kelley Brothers alone against the Blue Springs company alone for a writ of mandamus. Moreover, if relators succeed in this action, it will not materially help the people of Wymore, for it is not of respondent they are complaining. They do not want to depend upon respondent, which is merely a farmers' line, for their telephone facilities. The gist of their complaint seems to be that the Lincoln Telegraph and Telephone Company is not carrying out the policy of the New Home Company in furnishing connection with all the surrounding towns. The respondent has not been furnishing anybody in Wymore, except relators, with such outside connection for sometime, and no one has complained of it. It is only since the Lincoln Telegraph &amp; Telephone Company has absorbed, or attempted to absorb the New Home Company, and in doing so has stopped giving connection with the outside towns that anybody in Wymore has complained. But these companies are not before the court and any contract or contracts they have made with respondent or with each other are not properly before the court, and the court cannot now pass upon them. To attempt to do so would be to attempt to adjudicate </seg>

It is suggested in relator's brief that as respondent has been granted a franchise by the city of Wymore it can be compelled to comply with said franchise and furnish telephones for the use of the city. But the terms of said franchise are not before the court, so that it is impossible for the court to say what respondent is required by its franchise to do. Moreover, if such an action can be maintained. it probably should be brought by the city of Wymore and not by a private individual who has no more interest in seeing the terms of a franchise enforced than the public generally has. But whether the respondent can be made to comply with the terms of any franchise is not before the court and the court expresses no opinion thereon. For the reason that the relators have not shown that they are being discriminated against by the respondent, the writ of mandamus must be denied. L. M. PEMBERTON, Judge I, FRANK E.

To The Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Honorable Gentlemen: — Following the initial physical appraisal ot steam railroads and the transportation facilities property of stock yard companies as of July 1st, 1909, heretofore rendered, there has been progressed under similar procedure much further work of importance. The re-valuation of the above mentioned property for July 1st, 1911, would now be in your hands but for preference given to other pressing matters. It is expected, however, to complete the same within the next 60 days. It is anticipated that the 1911 re-appraisal of this class of property, especially because of matters developed at the several ex - tended hearings before your honorable body, and because of more time being allowed for thorough investigation, and because of a more thorough understanding of valuation of public utility property gen - erally, this considerably aided by several interstate conferences of which you are aware, will reach a very satisfactory perfectness upon which to build all further work. Bither properties initially under treatment or the physical value ich has been found are — Electrically Operated Inter-urban Railroads. — These properties it is true that in every case they are in close association with street railroad conditions and service, yet in organization and in some other matters different. Five properties are reported herewith. It seems proper to mention that the same care and treatment has been exercised in reaching these results as has obtained in prior work covering the ■team railroads. In each instance an accurate field inventory has been made by the Department, thereby making certain the total pro - perty reported. Complete original cost records were available in three of the instances and which were used to great advantage, while in the remaining two no such information existed of a reliable character. Attendant with each report there will be found explanatory notes setting out pertinent matters relative thereto. Kreet Railroads. — As you are aware no complete appraisal of roperty has been attempted since the question of obtaining such </seg>
            <seg id="p356">356 FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT has been appealed to the courts and not yet determined. However I considerable of influencing information essential in making up such valuation has been compiled considerably aided by the work already entioned under the subject immediately preceding. Express Companies Properties. — Statements covering the physical property owned and used by the four express companies doing business within the state of Nebraska are herewith submitted. The principal basis for the accuracy of these statements has been placed upon the book records of the company, and a field checking on the part of the Department has only occurred in part. It is believed though that the statements rendered will well serve any purpose at present de- Telegraph Properties. — It is expected that reports covering these properties will be completed co-temporaneously with that of the re - appraisal of steam railroads. A complete field inventory has been made by the department, thoroughly checking the various reports made by the respondents. Because of a considerable portion of this property being in close relationship to that of the steam railroads, and because of varied complicated contracts for placement and operation of such thus inter-related, the work of this appraisal has been both ex - tended and difficult. It is intended that the statements when rendered will set out in complete form all that may be demanded. Telephone Properties. — There is herewith submitted for your consideration reports covering the property owned by 277 separate companies, all but two of which are complete. Three other companies properties will be embraced in the final appraisal, making altogether a total of 280 telephone companies properties in the state considered as common carriers and subject to appraisal. It is expected within about three months from date to complete the initial valuation of all such property within the state, unless the same shall be materially interfered with by special investigations, etc. It will not be possible, however, for the Department to perform a field checking of all of this class of property in the state for the initial statements. A considerable of field inventory has been accomplished, especially where special in - vestigations and conveniently accessible opportunities have been pre - sented. The very nature of the telephone property so widely distributed, Citatly differing froir that of the railroads, has made it a much different problem to treat in as far as local investigations are concerned. To give an insight Into the scope of the work represented in the reports herewith only, there are 101,601 subscribers stations requiring 29, - 247 pole miles, 97, $59 wire miles and 2,265,793 feet of cable, the same to be considerably augmented by a completion of the work. Thus it is made plain that to make a state wide valuation of telephone property is a stupendous task involving many details. Again the appraisal of this kind pf property it has been made evident is one of the most important yet attempted, in fact it seems </seg>
            <seg id="p357">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 7 to be the most important information which your body has and is being supplied with. Too, telephone property to large extent is now undergoing a reconstruction epoch — important consolidations and amendments have recently occurred and must be expected frequently as time advances. Because of the latter condition of affairs frequent statements and inquiries as to the property are essential in order to furnish the information needed up to date. Because of such condition it will be noted that some of the reports are of various dates, thereby representing the date of the later investigation, and it has seemed unavoidable to report otherwise. In Nebraska as well as outside, telephone developement has been remarkably rapid. This bears evidence in presenting many matters that are experimental and crude. Records in many instances have been loosely kept if at all, even with some of the larger properties. In the make-up of a good many of the smaller properties especially it has been found that a considerable of the labor was donated, and there - fore no value represented even where the records show some care. This has presented to the appraiser a rather novel problem, but under - taking to interpret the meaning of valuation for presumably regulation purposes, all elements of value evident have been included as having been actually paid for. Thus under all circumstances the actual physical property in existence has been the basis for valuation, and such has been determined by an endeavor to apply the proper coat units in accordance with our understanding of what should be included In a physical appraisal as heretofore presented. I Perhaps as to a portion of the telephone property in the state ebraska there is no immediate demand for a local investigation le part of the Department, thereby creating expense, until cir - tances shall require such. Prior to undertaking this valuation a great amount of local and general information was gathered and compiled from which to organise and apply proper cost units. Without boasting it may be stated that this Department now possesses fully as complete and accurate data of this nature as can be found anywhere. Equally it may be so stated with reference to information concerning depreciation, a factor of no mean importance. Courteous acknowledgment should here be made of the valuable assistance rendered by representatives and owners of a number of the telephone properties to the Department in the acquirement of much of the needed local information, as without such assistance the task in hand would have been considerably extended. Working Force and Expense of Appraisal. — The appropriation of $40,500.00 for carrying out the work here mentioned, it is believed will be sufficient as measured in the preceding paragraphs. A state - ment covering the expenditures already met is now in your hands. As heretofore mentioned strict endeavor has been made to reach </seg>
            <seg id="p358">358 FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT results practising due economy. The number of regular employees generally baa consisted of ten people, mentioned as follows; Number Persons. Much credit should be given to the assistants without whose careful, conscientious, capable and speedy endeavors the present im - portant results would not be possible. It is believed the work thus far accomplished and to be early consummated, in addition to its present worth will form a very accurate basis for further matters of this nature.
