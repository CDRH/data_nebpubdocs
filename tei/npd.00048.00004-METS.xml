Western Sarpy Drainage District, Complainant. vs. Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, Defendant APPEARANCES: For complainant, A. G. Langdon, attorney; For Nellie Langdon, I. G. Dunn, attorney; For defendant, Byron Clark and Jesse L. Root, attorneys. OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: tThis is a complaint by the Western Sarpy Drainage District against Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company, in which it is aed that the railroad company has negligently constructed a bridge across complainant's drainage ditch. The ditch originates at a point northeast of the confluence of the Elkhorn river with the Platte river and runs thence almost due south a distance of something like seven miles into the Platte river. At a point nearly midway of its length it is crossed by the main line of respondent's railway, the point being about one mile and a half southwest of the station of Melia in Sarpy county. From the time of the construction of the railroad, about 1886, until shortly before the filing of the complaint, the respondent maintained at the point of crossing a pile trestle bridge. The landowners of the dis - trict objected to the pile bridge, charging that it obstructed the waters in the drainage ditch and was causing its channel to fill up with silt. In the year 1917, the respondent undertook the construction of a new bridge across the drainage ditch at the point indicated and had proceeded with the building of the piers when the complaint herein was filed- After its filing, the respondent continued work upon the bridge and the same was practically completed before the hearing, but some of the piling of the old bridge had not yet been removed and some of the forms used in building the concrete piers were still standing. The decision has been -delayed as, shortly after the hearing, the roads were taken over by the </seg>
            <seg id="p123">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 123 The new bridge is what is known as a through plate girder bridge of fifty foot span, resting on two concrete piers, each about six feet in thickness. The negligence in construction is alleged to be due to the placing of the concrete piers, sustaining the superstructure, partly in the ditch and at right angles to the line of the railroad, which brings them at an angle of about fifty-two degrees with the line of the drainage ditch. The complainant alleges that thereby the waterway under the bridge is cut down; that at times of flood the water is deflected by the piers and certain lands on the east side of the ditch below the bridge are flooded; and that to make the bridge adequate the piers should be placed so that they would not be in the line of the ditch and so placed as not to obstruct or deflect the flow of water. The prayer is, that the company be re - quired to reconstruct the bridge so as to secure these results. The railroad company contends that the waterway is sufficient; in fact, that it will carry far more water than can be delivered to it through the ditch. It also contends that the Railway Commission is without power to determine the issues raised. Other matters are presented, but the foregoing sufficiently states the facts for an understanding of the real questions involved. A number of witnesses called by the plaintiff testified that, owing to the placing of piers diagonally with the ditch and extending into it, the water flowing therein, the flow being from north to south, was ob - structed and deflected, causing it to overflow the land south and east of the bridge; that by reason of the slowing up of the current the ditch itself was becoming filled with silt and other matter, which would soon greatly lessen the carrying power of the ditch and would render it prac - tically valueless. None of the witnesses called by the plaintiff directly testified that the waterway under the bridge was insufficient to carry the water delivered to it by the ditch. The principal witness, Mr. Towl, the engineer who constructed the ditch, was called by the plaintiff. He testified as follows: "Q. So far as the area is concerned the opening through the grade, you admit that is of sufficient size in and of itself? A- O yes, certainly. "Q. Then the only question you see in it as an engineer is because of the way the opening is constructed ? A. That is my judgment, yes sir." * * • • "Q. Now the opening between the piers will permit the flow of all the water that will come to it from the ditch above, will it not? A. Yes sir, more rapidly than it comes down the ditch. "Q. You say the water will come through under the bridge more rapidly than it will come down from above? A. Yes sir, it has the capacity there to let it come through faster than it approaches in the ditch. </seg>
            <seg id="p124">124 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT "Q. Then the water does come through there faster than it comes down from above? A. I think there is less resistance than above the ditch. "Q. Then the only complaint is that the water is deflected? A- That is the only complaint I would make." I He is corroborated by most of the other witnesses, by the engineers the respondent, and the chief engineer of the Commission, Mr. Forbes. . Forbes uses the following language in his report: "The area of the carrying capacity of the ditch before flooding adjacent land is 136 square feet. The area of the waterway under the bridge at the 7 foot level corresponding with the maximum depth of water in the ditch is approximately 385 square feet. This means that when the ditch is full and before it overflows the open - ing under the completed bridge is two and eight times as large as the area of the ditch. The total area of the bridge opening is 957 square feet, which should be sufficient to carry any amount of water which could reasonably be expected to come down the ditch even when it flooded the land to the east." The finding of the Commission is that the waterway under the bridge is fully adequate to carry all water delivered by the ditch. L There is no question in this case as to the safety or sufficiency of bridge in the service that respondent renders as a common carrier. Assuming for the purpose of argument that placing the piers diagonally and so that one of them stands within the ditch causes flood waters to be deflected to the injury of the land south of and below the bridge, two questions present themselves; first, whether or not the Commission has jurisdiction, under its constitutional powers, to supervise the coiv struct ion of bridges in the interest of the general public; and second, whether or not under the statutes, being sections 6045, 6046, and 6047 of the Revised Statutes for 1913, it is the duty of the Commission to supervise the construction of bridges so as to protect landowners whose property may be damaged by overflowing waters- Under the authori - ties the Commission is not vested, by virtue of the constitutional pro - vision, with authority to supervise the work of engineering unless the service rendered by the carrier is in some way affected. The Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Co. vs. State Railway Commission, 88 Neb. 239; The Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Co. vs. State Railway Commission, 89 Neb. 853. The plaintiff relies upon sections 6045 and 6046 above mentioned. The former provides as follows: "Every railroad corporation shall maintain and keep in good repair all bridges, with their abutments, which such corporation shall construct for the purpose of enabling their road to pass over or under any turnpike, road, canal, water course or other way." And the latter thus: </seg>
            <seg id="p125">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 125 "It is hereby made the duty of every person, company or cor - poration operating a railroad in the state of Nebraska to so con - struct all bridges on its line of railway that every bridge over a running stream in this state shall have an opening below high water line whose area is sufficient to allow the free and unob - structed passage of the water of such running stream at extreme high water stage: Provided, if in the case of any given bridge satisfactory proof be made to the state railway commission that the dimensions herein prescribed are greater than are necessary to permit the unimpeded passage of the water under such bridge at high water, the commission may by order authorize the con - struction of such bridge with dimensions less than those prescribed in this section." Section 6045 waa enacted many years a,go, while section 6046 was enacted in 1911. Section 6047 must be taken in connection with section 6046, as they were both parts of chapter 91, Session Laws 1911. Section 6047 reads as follows: "All railroad bridges shall be made to conform to the pro- visions of the next preceding section before the first day of July, 1912: Provided, the state railway commission are hereby author - ized to extend the time for the enlargement of any existing bridge for such period as they may deem just and reasonable" Under section 6046 it will be observed the only function of the Com - mission is to permit a reduction in the dimensions of a waterway under a bridge if it finds that such dimensions are greater than necessary. Section 6047 simply gives the Commission power to extend the time for com - pliance with the previous section. There seems to be no provision for a hearing before the Commission on a petition for the alteration of an existing bridge- The enforcement of the law is in the hands of the courts. It seems clear that it is not intended that the Railway Commis - sion should undertake to supervise the engineering works so as to pro - tect the landowners in the vicinity. That is a matter that is out of the field of the Commission's activities. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE CONSIDERED AND ORDERED by the Ne - braska State Railway Commission that the petition and complaint of the Western Sarpy Drainage District, concerning the bridge of respondent over the ditch of the Drainage District, situate about 1.5 miles west o* Melia, be and the same hereby is dismissed.

            <seg id="p126">126 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 371 Tri-Connty Telephone Company, Complainant, vs. Gandy Switchboard Company, Defendant. SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER Browne, Commissioner:- The matters involved in this case relate to toll connections, toll serv - ice between the towns of Gandy and Stapleton, and disputes relative to the division of toll charges. The case has been before the Commission on various occasions and a brief history of the proceedings is necessary. t Almost two years ago the Tri-County Telephone company, operating exchange at Stapleton, with various short toll lines radiating there - in, filed a complaint with the Commission alleging that the Gandy Switchboard company, operating at Gandy, Nebraska, refused to permit the complainant to connect its toll line with the defendant's switchboard and made it necessary that it maintain pay stations within the town of Gandy, scarce available to those desiring the use of toll service. Before the matter could come on for hearing, the defendant switchboard company permitted the connection to be made and filed an answer and cross-bill alleging that complainant toll line owner refused to divide toll earnings originating and terminating at Gandy on such a basis as to be compen - satory to defendant, Gandy Switchboard company, and praying the Com - mission to take jurisdiction of the matters involved in the cross-bill and make such division of toll earnings as would furnish to defendant proper compensation. The matter came on for hearing in July, 1918, at Gandy, Nebraska, and from the evidence there adduced order was entered on July 24, 1918, finding that the statutory divisions of toll earnings set out in Section 7416 R. S. 1913 were not compensatory in the case under investigation, and ordering and directing that all toll earnings on business originating and terminating at Gandy on the short line business between Gandy and Stapleton be divided on the basis of forty-five per cent to the Gandy Switchboard company and fifty-five per cent to the Tri-County Telephone company, the toll line owner. Almost immediately quarrels arose between the two companies as to the interpretation of the order. Complainant, the Tri-County Tele - phone company, insisted that the sole revenue to the Gandy Switchboard company contemplated in the order was the forty-five per cent on the short line business. Defendant insisted that in addition thereto it should have the statutory division on toll calls passing to or coming from points beyond Stapleton. These quarrels led to the summary disconnection of service by complainant and the establishment of toll connection in the office of the county clerk in Gandy. The county commissioners ulti- </seg>
            <seg id="p127">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 127 mately ordered the phone out of the county clerk's office. The village board of Gandy directed that the poles of the toll line company be re - moved from the streets of Gandy and be placed in the alleys. This order of the village board applied equally to the Gandy Switchboard com - pany. Notice was served by complainant on the Commission that it in - tended to remove all of its property from the village of Gandy. The Commission issued an order directing that physical connection be not severed, but in defiance of that order complainant did take up its poles and lines within the town of Gandy and required that the Gandy Switch - board company make connection at the village limits. Temporarily service was restored the latter part of 1918, but not for long. Complainant and defendant again quarreled with the result that the service was cut off. Action was begun in the district court of Logan county to require compliance with the Commission's order and restora - tion of toll connection. Hearing on the petition was held at Kearney and stipulation entered into whereby defendant agreed to keep a deposit of $5.00 in the bank of Stapleton as a guarantee that toll bills would be paid and further stipulation that the order of the Commission would be complied with. This stipulation was entered into April 9, 1919. It was temporary relief only. On June 12 relations had again become so strained between the manager of the Tri-County Telephone company and the lady operating the switchboard at Gandy that service was again dis - connected- Motion was filed with the Commission by defendant, Gandy Switch - board company, asking for a supplemental order definitely establishing the controverted points and requiring the complainant to maintain the toll connections constantly, rather than the intermittent service tempor - arily between peace pacts. Complainant objected, through its counsel, to immediate hearing and a continuance of thirty days was granted in which complainant might plead to the motion, but the order of the Com - mission found complainant in contempt and directed that before its answer pleading would be received it must purge itself of this contempt by reconnecting its toll line. The connection was reestablished and has remained in force to the present time, although no settlements have been made pending the conclusions from the rehearing. Complainant filed answer and cross-bill to the motion of defendant, asking for a supplemental order, but took upon itself to re-entitle the case as a new proceeding before the Commission. Reply was filed by defendant, using the original title. This mixup on the pleadings was considered at the time of the hearing at Gandy on October 8, 1919, and a ruling was made and not excepted to that the original title should be held throughout all the pleadings and that correction of the pleadings to meet that title was to be considered as having been made. It was also ruled, and no exception taken, that the new pleadings, viz., the motion for a supplemental order and cross-petition thereon, had the effect of re - opening the whole cause for further consideration. </seg>

That a new order be entered upon the matter of division of the toll between complainant and defendant. 2. That complainant be permitted to disconnect its toll line at Gandy on account of poor condition of the lines of the Gandy Switchboard com - pany. 3. That connection not be required until the Gandy Switchboard company had organized as a legal entity under the laws of the state of Nebraska. 4. That toll rates be measured on short line business from Staple - ton to the respective termini of the calls on the farmers lines. That these farmers lines be considered as toll lines for the purposes of making charges and divisions thereon. 5. That until defendant has organized as a corporation, no divisions of toll calls be made, but all charges be paid to the complainant, Tri- County Telephone company. At the hearing in the court house at Gandy in October last, the matters in dispute and the quarrels between the parties were brought forth with painful detail. Much testimony was given, which can play bat little or no part in reaching conclusions. Following the taking of testimony, time was requested by counsel for filing of briefs, and con - clusions in the case were delayed while those briefs were being prepared. Exhibits were filed by the Tri-County Telephone company, showing the gross amount of business between the time the last connection was made in July, 1919, and October 1, following, and during the preceding short period of connection. These may be summarized as follows: These gross earnings cover a steady period of service slightly less than four months and include not only the short line toll business between Gandy and Stapleton, but all longer toll messages originating or terminat - ing at Gandy- The short line business between Gandy and Stapleton, passing apparently entirely on a fifteen cent rate, amounted to $94.90 of the total of $161.16, or approximately sixty per cent. Date Out 919, May $2508 In $16.80 June 16.55 17.85 July 2.95 August 14.23 September 19.50 ■ 5.40 23.80 19.00 Total $78.31 $82.85 </seg>
            <seg id="p129">129 The total amount of business which will apparently originate or ter - minate because of the connection at Gandy is something like $500 per annum. Of this amount a considerable portion must be paid to termi - nating and originating companies beyond Stapleton and for proper line haul of other companies owning toll lines. It will thus be seen that this unfortunate series of quarrels has resulted in the expenditures by the parties thereto for counsel fees and expenses in excess of what the con - troverted amount will be for a period of five years. It has been a financial mistake throughout that the companies could not come to. a proper understanding. Counsel for the Gandy Switchboard company estimated that the net revenue of the Tri-County company from this toll line would be from $40 to $60 per month and that every effort was being made at the expense of the Gandy Switchboard company to increase these earnings. It will be seen at once that the conclusions were er - roneous. Unless the business grows considerably the gross tolls between Gandy and Stapleton will not exceed $275 and the gross tolls on which divisions must be made not to exceed $500 per annum. It is contended by the Tri-County Telephone company that the Gandy Switchboard company cannot maintain an action before the Commission or any court because it is not legally constituted. It is an association with bylaws loosely followed. The association's property is confined to the town of Gandy and its revenues are from the town properties and from switching charges paid by country lines- The Gandy Switchboard company is a common carrier under the laws. The constitutional amend - ment creating the Commission gave it jurisdiction over the rates and service of common carriers. The loose organization of defendant switch - board company does not make it other than a common carrier. It is itself privileged to appeal to the Commission and it is the Commission's duty to exercise supervision over this company and its relations with ether companies according to law. Counsel for the Tri-County Telephone company insisted earnestly that toll messages arising at Stapleton and terminating at telepnones of farmers and others on the lines connected at the Gandy switchboard should be measured over the entire distance and toll charges be commen - surate with that distance. The Commission does not consider the con - tention well taken. It has always ruled that toll messages are measured from switchboard to switchboard and that the lines radiating from the switchboard within the territory served by an exchange are merely locai means of delivering these messages and the distances required for such delivery do not figure in the toll rate. It has always been held that a switched line is for service purposes a part of the exchange and is en - titled to all the privileges of subscribers belonging to the exchange and that "other line charges" for toll messages between the switchboard and the point of destination on the switched line are not proper. It is also contended by counsel for complainant, the Tri-County Tele - phone company, that messages arising or destinating at points beyond knife switches on lines connected to the Gandy switchboard should be </seg>
            <seg id="p130">130 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT subject to toll charges for the entire distance. These parties beyond the knife switches pay nothing to the Gandy Switchboard company, but through the operation of knife switches are able to reach the Gandy switchboard for local interchange or for purposes of originating toll calls to Stapleton or beyond. These persons beyond knife switches are in the same position as non-subscribers who originate calls on points on lines directly connected to the Gandy switchboard. They cannot be held to have originated toll calls at the telephone instruments beyond the knife switches. The service is purely local until it reaches the Gandy switch - board and the toll line company is not interested in how these local mes - sages reach that switchboard- The contention of counsel cannot be up - held in the light of the facts. The position taken by the Commission through many years in regard to these matters will be followed in this instance. The further contention that all toll charges on messages arising or terminating at Gandy should go to the owner of the toll line without division until such time as the defendant, Gandy Switchboard company, becomes a legal entity, seems to have no warrant in fact or in the sup - porting argument of counsel. We come now to the last contention of the Tri-County Telephone company made in its cross-bill and answer to the motion for a supple - mental order, viz., that the division of tolls found by the Commission to be proper in its order dated July 24, 1918, is without warrant in law. Counsel for complainant makes the flat assertion that inasmuch as the statute has fixed the division of tolls at a certain percentage, the Com - mission is without power to change those percentages. Counsel for de - fendant is equally positive that the Commission has the power. Each insisted in brief that the position taken by it was too obvious to require discussion. This matter in dispute, however, was a close enough question that it received considerable attention from the Nebraska supreme court before its conclusions could be reached, although counsel in this case found it was easy to reach a determination without reference to the opinion of the supreme court. In State ex rel M. P. Ry. Co. vs. Henry T. Clarke, et al., 98 Neb. 5B6, the identical question chiefly under consideration in this case was dis - cussed. The railroad company had asked the Commission to consider an increase in passenger fares, alleging the confiscation of its property under the statutory two cent rate. The Commission found it had no juris - diction to change a rate fixed by statute. The supreme court was asked by the railroad company for a writ of mandamus to require the Com - mission to take jurisdiction. The court sustained the Commission and found that it was without jurisdiction to change a rate fixed by the legislature. The opinion was by a divided court. It is interesting to note, however, that the minority opinion in this case did not urge that the Commission had the power to set aside a rate fixed by the legislature, bat contented itself with the argument that the legislature did not, in passing the two cent passenger rate law, intend to divest the Commission </seg>
            <seg id="p131">131 of the power to review that law and to amend it under the terms of the Railway Commission Act. The position taken by the court in this case is sustained by in - ference in other cases. The constitutional provision .gives the Commis - sion jurisdiction over rates and service of common carriers. These two powers are correlative and of equal rank in the language of the con - stitution- Whatever power the Commission has over service, as com - pared with the legislative power, it has over rates and no more. The legislature has from time to time passed statutes affecting thi service of common carriers which by constitutional provision are under the supervision of the Commission. Some of these statutes, relative to service, have been contested by the carriers in court, and in no instance has the court, in passing on the cases, indicated that the legislature had usurped the prerogatives of the Commission in an unlawful or uncon - stitutional manner. Hooper Telephone Co. vs. Nebraska Telephone Co., 96 Neb. 245; Dawson et al. vs. C. &amp; N. W. Ry. Co., 100 Neb. 462. The action of the Commission in revising the percentages for ter - minating and originating toll messages between Gandy and Stapleton was a change by the Commission of a rate fixed by the legislature. The Commission is constrained to find that it erred in thus changing the statutory percentages on the grounds that they were non-compensatory in the case under consideration, and must find now that it is without power to change those percentages. The Commission has certain judicial powers. These do not include the passing on constitutionality of legislative acts. The courts have that exclusive function. Much testimony presented in the last hearing on this case related to the value of the toll properties for the purpose of showing what a proper division ot" toll revenues should be. This testimony, in the light of the Commission's conclusions, cannot be considered. Very possibly the commissions which under the statutes will be paid to the Gandy Switch - board company for its services in originating and terminating short line messages between Gandy and Stapleton will not compensate for the labor performed by the operator at Gandy. It is, however, a matter for the courts to determine and not this Commission until such time as the statutory provision contained in Section 7416 R. S. 1913 has been repealed by the legislature. Service between Gandy and Stapleton during the year and a half this controversy has raged has been unendurable. It cannot be allowed to continue. The town of Gandy is unfortunately situated. Its railroad connections are not good and its only telephone outlet is by way of Stapleton. It is entitled to continued and reasonably adequate service. The practice of the manager of the Tri-County Telephone company of severing connections whenever he gets into a controversy with the oper - ator of the Gandy switchboard is reprehensible and illegal- Neither the </seg>
            <seg id="p132">132 Commission nor the courts have ever said that disputes over toll charges warrant the severance of toll service. The law plainly says that where a controversy arises between the toll company and its connections, such controversy is to be presented to the State Railway Commission. The manager of the Tri-County Telephone company reaches violent con - clusions frequently and does not exercise in language the ordinary cour - tesies of business life. It is unfortunate that the law under which the Commission operates does not permit it to use more vigorous methods in enforcing its orders on matters of service. It must rely on the dis - trict courts, through application for mandatory injunction. The physical connection law, however, is a separate statute with penalties of its own and the aggrieved party has the right to begin criminal proceedings for these hasty and unwarranted disconnections of toll service such as have taken place in the case under discussion. On the other hand the relations between the operator of the Gandy Switchboard company and the manager of the Tri-County Telephone company have apparently become so strained as to seriously interfere with the service between the two points. It is the duty of the officers of the Gandy Switchboard company to keep in touch with these business relations and to do what they can to prevent this controversy becoming a permanent interchange of questionable compliments. The Gandy community is entitled to this active effort on the part of the officers of its telephone company. They appear to be fairminded men and the situation that has grown up has been partly due to carelessness. The operator of the Gandy switchboard is not being particularly well paid and is of course reluctant to take care of this important toll business on the compensation awarded by the statute. The officers of the Gandy Switchboard company should relieve her of all expense incident thereto, such as the sending out of toll bills, or the delay of settlement of tolls until the six months rental payment is collected. The expense of send - ing out the statements and doing the collecting should be borne by the switchboard company out of revenue which it is in a position to collect rather than to come out of the meager earnings of the operator- The Gandy Switchboard company has admitted that non-subscribers beyoml the knife switches have full benefit of the operator's efforts at the Gandy switchboard for local interchange of service and for the originating of toll calls. It is axiomatic in telephone regulation that proper business rules will prevent any one getting a service for nothing and the switch - board company should at once publish a charge for all messages reach - ing the Gandy switchboard from any person who does not pay the re,?ular rental rate for the support of the central office. These persons beyond the knife switches should pay the same charges as those directly on the lines connected at the Gandy switchboard, or should pay a non-subscriber per message charge, which charge is in no sense a toll charge. The mes - sages are entirely local in their nature and should not be considered in the divisions of toll earnings. The Tri-County Telephone company testified that toll messages </seg>
            <seg id="p133">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 133 destinating to points beyond the knife switches were sources of consider - able annoyance. This was denied by the switchboard company, which declared that such messages were rare and that the service was not poor. The service between Stapleton and Gandy is apparently on the two-ticket plan. Especially where there is any danger of delay in making the connections, the Stapleton operator should, on inbound messages, merely notify the Gandy operator as to the party wanted and the Gandy operator should get him on the line and then make the connections with Stapleton. The testimony adduced at the time of the hearing indicated an abuse of certain knife switches connecting farm lines between Gandy and Stapleton. This abuse must not continue. Any messages between Gandy and Stapleton should not be put through these knife switches unless the toll line is not in working order and when these farm lines are used in lieu of the toll connection between Gandy and Stapleton the same charge should be made as if the toll line were used. The ex - istence of these knife switches should in no case relieve a patron of the payment of a toll charge which he would otherwise have been compelled to pay. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the settlement between the Tri-County Telephone com - pany and the Gandy Switchboard company of certain toll earnings nc.v in dispute shall be made on the basis of ten per cent of the toll charge to the Gandy Switchboard company on all inbound messages from point of origin to point of destination and fifteen per cent measured likewise on all outbound messages arising on the lines radiating locally from the Gandy switchboard. These percentages shall be paid up to a maximum which binds the toll company on all toll business where the Gandy Switchboard plays a part. These commissions shall form the basis of settlement on all future business. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that particular person calls between Gandy and Stapleton shall be charged for at fifteen cents per call of not to exceed five minutes duration and five cents for each additional two minutes. Station-to-station, or number-to-number, calls shall be ten cents for a like period with the same added minutes extra charge. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that in making the settlement monthly on toll business, the Gandy Switchboard company shall receive in addition to the percentages heretofore set out its due proportion of the line haul to represent the one-half mile or thereabouts of toll line owned by de - fendant to make connection with the toll line of the Tri-County Telephone company. Any disputes relative to these settlements shall be forthwith referred to the Nebraska State Railway Commission. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Gandy Switchboard company shall make a non-subscriber charge applicable to all messages arising beyond certain knife switches at the ends of its farm lines of ten cents </seg>

Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 22nd day of January, 1920. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION, H. G. Taylor, Chairman. Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 385 Cambridge Community Club, Complainant, vs. Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, Defendant. Appearances For Complainant — B. F. Butler, attorney; For defendant — J. W. Weingarten, attorney; E. Flynn, general superintendent. OPINION AND FINDING Browne, Commissioner: This matter came on for hearing in the community club rooms at Cambridge, Nebraska, on August 27, 1920, on complaint that the stock - yards at Cambridge were entirely inadequate to serve the purpose for which intended. In brief, complainant alleged ( 1 ) that the water supply was inadequate and uncertain; (2) that it was necessary to have better lighting facilities, inasmuch as regular live stock shipping day requires night loading during part of the year under difficult conditions; (3) that the yards are muddy, poorly drained and filled with holes of almost im - passable depth; (4) that the troughs furnished for water for cattle and hogs are inaccessible because of mud-holes, and not sufficient in number; (5) that no adequate schedule for stock trains is maintained; (6) that the location of the stockyards on the house track is such that frequently it is impossible to load all the stock ready for shipment until the arrival of the stock train and after switching has been done; (7) that the stock - yards are not sufficient in capacity for maximum demands; (8) that the yards are without equipment for feeding, whereas both bunks and racks are essential for proper care of live stock awaiting shipment; (9) that there are no stock scales in the yards, whereas it is of vital importance that such scales be available for the use of shippers. We will deal with these items of complaint in the order in which they are set out above. (1) Water supply. The evidence showed that the water is pumped from a company well by windmill power, the windmill being larger than ordinarily used for that purpose. It was formerly the power which supplied the water to a railroad water tank for locomotive purposes, the </seg>
            <seg id="p135">135 tank having since been removed. From the well the water is run through a four inch pipe to a six thousand gallon tank which is set on a platform, the base of the tank being about thirteen feet from the ground. From the tank the water is piped underground to two hydrants, and from these hydrants it is carried by pipes located on the yard fences to the various troughs. Testimony of complainant's witnesses all was to the effect that very frequently the water supply was inadequate in the tanks, and that fully as often there was difficulty with the piping, which made it impracticable to secure water. This testimony was conceded in part by defendant. Complainant desired that the hydrants be connected up with the city water system and that that supply be used exclusively. Defendant objected to abandoning its own water supply. None of com - plainant's witnesses appeared to be aware of the fact that a connection had been made with the city water supply in June, 1920. This was after the complaint was filed. The connection was made at the depot, pipes being in existence between the hydrants and the depot. The practice now, according to the station agent, is to rely on the windmill and tank for water supply during the ordinary shipping days, and on regular stock train day to turn on the city water, which in turn supplies both the tank and the hydrants through a "T" connection. This appears to the Commission to be ample water supply. There was some testimony about the condition of the hydrants and broken aerial piping which prevented full use of the distribution system. De - fendant admitted these conditions and said voluntarily they would be at once remedied- It is presumed that these statements were made in good faith and that the condition of the distribution system has been corrected. (2) Electric lights. All the witnesses for the complainant testified as to the very great advantage that would come from electric lights in the stockyards whenever cattle and hogs were to be loaded after dark, and the testimony was undisputed that part of the time such night load - ing is necessary. Complainant contended in brief that this was a facility that the carrier should be required to furnish, it having direct connection with the transportation duty. Defendant contended in its brief that neither by common law nor by Nebraska statutes are the carriers re - quired to install electric lights at stockyards and that to do so in this case would not only be arbitrary but would create a discrimination against other stockyards. It was declared by defendant that outside of feeding in transit yards there is no point on the Burlington system where electric lights are so furnished. Complainant had no positive testimony to the contrary. There is no doubt in the opinion of the Commission that the question here involved is one so closely related to transportation as to fall, if circumstances warrant, under the common law obligations of the carriers. It is only a question of judgment as to whether the electric lights are as essential as the loading chutes or the pens supplied for collecting the </seg>
            <seg id="p136">136 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT live stock, together for purposes of loading. The Commission, however, is impressed by the argument that discrimination would result by an order to install electric lights at this point, certainly if Cambridge is entitled to electric lights as an aid in loading live stock, the towns of Holbrook, Arapahoe and Edison to the east and Bartley and Indianola to the west are likewise entitled to the same facility, and not only those towns but all other towns on the Burlington where stock train schedules require the loading of live stock at certain seasons of the year after the fall of night. Each load of stock presents the same trouble as each other load. If Cambridge is a heavier shipping point, it only means that more shippers are affected. Certain other considerations impress us in this connection. At this particular station for seven months in the year stock loading time falls in daylight except at irregular and unusual instances. During five months of the year stock will be loaded sometimes by moonlight and sometimes by aid of artificial light unless the shipper elects to load an hour or two in advance of train time in order to avoid the inconvenience- Night loading occurs but once a week and when the moonlight nights are eliminated the number of occasions in a year that electric lights are necessary is very greatly reduced. There is an additional question as to the policing of the use of this electric current and preventing the destruction of light bulbs. We are not prepared to pass on whether these points are sufficient to offset the advantages derived from the better lighting, nor are we prepared to make any final conclusions until the question is brought up in a broader aspect than for one station. The defendant will not be required to install electric lights until and unless the Commission shall have entered a more .general order affecting other stations likewise situated. (3) Drainage and mudholes. The yards at this point are located on flat valley land, the soil of which is sandy enough to drain readily were it not that the trampling of live stock renders the surface soil almost impervious to water. Drainage is towards the east along the railroad track. Within the yards are several large mudholes. These are located for the most part close to the water troughs where the ground is scooped out to such a depth as to make it impossible for hogs to reach water in the troughs. The condition seems to be of rather lon,g standing. De - fendant alleged that shippers run the water out onto the ground and help create mudholes for the benefit of hogs in hot weather. Com - plainant's witnesses testified that this is done in order to furnish water for the hogs to drink when they cannot reach the water in the troughs. Defendant agreed during the hearing that conditions in the yards were not proper in this respect and that efforts would be made at once to im - prove them. It is presumed that before this time the improvement has taken place- The mudholes adjacent to the water troughs should be filled with rock to within six inches of the top of the hog troughs. If this is dene, overflow water when it does create a mudhole will form such </seg>
            <seg id="p137">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 137 mudhole at a distance from the troughs and leave the troughs available for the stock. No proper depth of ditch eastward from the water tank towards the small creek has been maintained, and the carrier will be expected to deepen this ditch for drainage purposes and to extend it westward alongside the stockyards as far as the hydrants and along the east and south sides of the yards to help carry off the surface water from the pens. (4) Water troughs. The Burlington furnishes concrete troughs for hogs and cattle. At the present time there are six troughs installed at Cambridge, one hog trough in each of four pens and one cattle trough in each of two pens. Inasmuch as there are twelve pens, eight pens do not contain water. These troughs are of most excellent construction and are standardized. If made available by the filling in of the mud - holes they serve the purpose very well. Superintendent Flynn stated in testimony that if there were not enough troughs the defendant would be willing to install others. Inasmuch as this position is taken by de - fendant, the Commission will expect complainants and defendant to reach an agreement as to the minimum number of troughs which will supply the average needs of the yards, and in case of their failure to agree the matter may be again referred to the Commission. It is so much a matter of judgment as to be best passed on by those actually having the experience. It- does not, however, appear necessary that troughs be located in all the pens. (5) Lack of regular schedules of stock trains. This point was not emphasized by complainants in testimony other than to show the need for electric lights. Testimony of defendant was that a stock train leaves McCook each Saturday night at six o'clock and picks up shipments of stock to Oxford, a consolidation point. Defendant alleges it is will - ing to add as many more trains as are necessary to handle the business offered, and that it is ready at any time to run extra trains. In the light of the immediate testimony the Commission will leave this point open and it may be raised at any time in the future when the train serv - ice is inadequate to care for the business offered. (6) Switch track not of sufficient length. The stockyards are located near the east end of the industry track. East of the stockyards is an oil tank. At a considerable distance west is an elevator. The customary method is to set in the stock cars west of the chutes, leaving the east two cars spotted at the chutes. As the cars are loaded they are pinched with crowbar to the eastward. Complainant's testimony is that about the only difficulty experienced in loading in this respect is when an oil car is standing at the oil station. The carrier will be ex - pected to see to it, as a matter of operation, that a tank car be not left standing at the oil station on those occasions when stock loading is go - ing to be heavy enough that the tank car will interfere with the move - ment of the cars. There was some testimony as to inconvenience to regular industries by switching in and out of carload freight onto the </seg>
            <seg id="p138">138 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT team track, and suggestions as to the necessity for a team track spur. These suggestions were beside the issues in this case- The points made by complainant in this respect in testimony could be repeated at every other station in Nebraska where the team track is a segment of the industry track, and this includes almost all country stations in the state. (7) Capacity of yards insufficient. The yards comprise twelve pens, each of at least one carload capacity. The east end of the runway will hold an additional car of stock. There is therefore capacity for at least thirteen carloads of stock at one time. The records of live stock loading and unloading in Cambridge in 1919 and 1920, as the same are on file with the Commission, were made a part of the record in this case. These show that in 1919 there were forwarded 53 carloads in January, 39 in February, 68 in March, 33 in April, 50 in May, and 36 in June. In 1920 there were forwarded 74 cars in January, 46 in February, 43 in March, 46 in April and 67 in May. Loadings were not heavy in the remaining months either year. Inbound shipments were not heavy enough to influence the point in issue. Complainant offered no specific testimony as to instances where the yards were of insufficient size. Some witnesses testified that they had no objection on this score. The Com - mission will not deem this point established in the light of the testimony entered, but will allow complainant to ask to have the case reopened on this particular point at any later date when they have a specific record of instances when stock had to be held outside the yards awaiting turn at loading because of insufficient capacity of the yards. (8) No feed racks. Witnesses for complainant generally testified that wherever it was necessary to drive cattle for a considerable distance preparatory to loading that it was also necessary that they be allowed several hours in which to rest before being loaded, and that it was quite essential also that they be given some feed during the resting period. Only part of the witnesses indicated that grain bunks were necessary, but all believed feed racks were essential in muddy weather. Defendant alleged, both in testimony and in brief, that feed racks are no part of the equipment of ordinary stockyards on its system of railroad, and that the law does not contemplate any such service as this. It also contends that even the furnishing of water facilities is no part of its duty and is done merely as an accommodation. If these contentions are correct they are equally true of shelter sheds for hogs in hot weather. Shelter sheds are installed under statutory requirement, but in the absence of specific legislation this Commission has all the power of the legislature* in such matters. By practice the carrier does not become the insurer of live stock until it is loaded on cars and bill of lading is made out. By practice also the shipper retains control of his live stock while in the pens, looking after the watering and the loading onto the cars. Shippers do not even ask the consent of the carrier to remove any portion of a shipment awaiting loading or to sell and trade among themselves. These circumstances appear to be underlying reasons which led the carrier to allege that while </seg>
            <seg id="p139">139 the stock is awaiting shipment in the pens no common law obligation rests upon the carrier to keep the live stock in condition or to furnish facilities for such conditioning. The stock is not in the sole care of the carrier. It is quite probable that the state could require that the carrier re - ceipt for live stock at the gate to the yards and thereafter assume all obligation of feeding, watering, loading and transporting provided ade - quate compensation were made for the services. This is not the practice, and tariffs are not predicated upon this amount of service. However, the shipper has, as an incident to the transportation move - ment, reached a point when he has yarded the stock as to be no longer free to supply all the needs of the stock. Obviously he cannot enter the property of the carrier and dig wells when there may be no other wells in the vicinity. If the wait for loading time is long enough, and humane treatment and good judgment would indicate the necessity for light feed - ing, the shipper may be in no position to remove his stock at an ordinary shipping point for such purpose cf feeding. The yards are under the rules and regulations of the railroad company, which rules must be ob - served, hence there appears to be a joint responsibility, although it can - not be said that the carrier's responsibility is that of a common carrier. 7ti C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. vs. Powers, 73 Neb. 816, the court held that the liability of the carrier as to live stock in pens awaiting shipment may be only that of depository or bailee, but in Nelson vs. C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co.. 78 Neb. 60, the fame court quotes approvingly from Cleveland &amp; T. R. Co. vs. Perkins, 17 Mich. 296, that "when cattle have been delivered to and accepted by a railroad company for immediate shipment the railroad company is liable as a common carrier for damages to the cattle from the time of delivery to it". Hence it appears that the liability of the carrier as to stock in pens may vary according to the circumstances of the case. Defendant contends that if feed racks were installed at Cambridge it would be discrimination against other points not so served. This would be true if conditions were like, but, as was pointed out by the court in Zekrzerwski vs. Great Northern Ry. Co., 145 N. W. 801, wherein it was held that facilities for furnishing water and racks for holding feed were essential requirements of the carrier at stockyards, the determination of the extent rf station facilities must be measured by the specific cir - cumstances. The court there refused to say that the same facilities were essential at all stations. This reasoning appears to us to be well founded. In the Cambridge case the evidence was adequate to show that ship - ments of cattle are moved from distances of eighteen to twenty-two miles and loaded at Cambridge, and that it requires a full day or two half days and a night to drive the stock to the loading point. It appears to us that this creates quite a different situation from stockyards where railroads are not widely separated and the shipments are transported relatively short distances before being loaded. At Cambridge only a minor percentage of the stock is driven for considerable distances before </seg>
            <seg id="p140">140 being loaded. It is the opinion of the Commission that these shippers should be served by some facilities for feeding without waste at the stockyards. We think that three or four pens should be equipped with racks for hay. This conclusion does not create a general precedent. t There are local buyers of live stock at Cambridge interested in the provement of the facilities. The evidence rather indicated that the rrier allows these stock buyers the use of the yards for congregating rchases until carloads are secured when such use does not interfere with the regular purpose of the pens. It is not the intention of the Com - mission to require the carrier to install these racks for the use of such local buyers. If the carrier permits the local buyer to use the yard's as holding pens when business is light, it should require such individuals to furnish their own facilities for feeding. LThe question of stock scales at yards at this point, much empha - 1 by complainant, requires little attention. Time was when carriers supplied this facility as an accommodation at stockyards in divers parts of the state, and when this Commission frequently ordered installation of such scales at stations not so equipped, basing the orders on existing discrimination. When the supreme court of the United States passed adversely on this requirement in Great Northern Railway Co. vs. Min - nesota, 238 U. S. 340, the Nebraska Commission changed its attitude to conform to the directions of this high court. It has not since that time attempted to direct the installation of stock scales. It has, however, in - formally said that it would consider complaints of discrimination relative to scales at one shipping point and lack of scales at another shipping point in competing territory, and if serious discrimination were estab - lished by testimony it would require the carrier either to remove the scales at the one point or install at the other. No cases of this kind, however, have arisen. The testimony indicated that at this important, shipping point vne carrier had neglected for years to provide unloading chutes. This caused considerable inconvenience to shippers, which fact was admitted by de - fendant. Very likely the chutes have already been furnished, but the matter will be covered in this order for fear of continued carelessness on the part of the carrier. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company be and it hereby is ordered and directed to fill all mudholes in the stock - yards at Cambridge with rock or other solid matter which cannot be displaced by live stock, so as to keep the level of the ground in close proximity within six inches of the installed hog troughs; to deepen the drainage ditch eastward from the stockyards to the creek bed and to extend in a sufficient manner these ditches around the stockyards to carry off the surface water from within such yards; to take care of the question of additional troughs as may be agreed upon between complain- </seg>

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the prayer of complainant re - garding stock scales and water supply be dismissed, and that the prayer of complainant relative to electric lights, sufficiency of stock train ser - vice, and capacity of yards be also dismissed, subject to the conditions set forth in the opinion as to reopening for additional consideration.

D. Barr et al, Complainant, vs. Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company and Walker D. Hines, Director General of Railroads, Defendants Appearances : For complainants — G. T- Barton, attorney, Pawnee City; Jacob F. Halderman, chairman of committee repre - senting Pawnee City; W. C. Huntington, chair- man of committee representing Liberty. For defendants — Jesse L. Root, attorney; L. W. Wakeiey, general passenger agent; C. C. Holtorf, division superin - tendent, Wymore division; E. Flynn, division superintendent, Lincoln division. OPINION AND FINDING Hall, Commissioner The gist of the complaint is that complainants living between Pawnee City and Wymore and along the main line of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy railroad cannot get to their county seat, Pawnee City, and return on the same day with the service the Burlington is now furnishing; also that they cannot go to Lincoln and points intervening between Table Rock and Lincoln and return on the same day. The defendants operate trains Nos. 119 and 120, together known as the "Irish Mail," between Table Rock and Lincoln, which render daily round trip service except Sundays. This train comes to Lincoln in the morning and returns in the afternoon. However, on its return trip it arrives at Table Rock too late for the afternoon west bound train on the </seg>
            <seg id="p142">142 main line, which goes through Pawnee City to Wymore and west, making it necessary for passengers to wait until the night westbound train, which reaches points west of Table Rock between midnight and morning. I A hearing was had in Wymore November 14, 1919, in which a very haustive record was made, going into every detail of the service between ymore and Lincoln by way of Beatrice and Crete, and also by way of Pawnee City and Table Rock. The Commission directed that defendants should make studies of the passenger traffic moving on both routes and submit them to the Commission. The company made an exhaustive study and filed it with the Commission. After a careful analysis of all of the testimony and the studies, the Commission was convinced that if a new train were to be operated it would be better from an operating stand - point, and would accommodate the .greatest number of people to start it from Wymore in the morning and run to Lincoln by way of Table Rock and return in the afternoon, daily except Sunday. This train should be an exclusive passenger train and Nos. 119 and 120, known as the "Irish Mail", should be discontinued as to passenger service, the freight to be handled by exclusive freight trains. The defendants, after considering the matter, have filed a stipula - tion agreeing to install the service in accordance with the suggestion of the Commission. The particular schedule of the train cannot be deter - mined by the Commission at this time because that is an operating matter the railroad company will have to work out so as to take care of the service at junction points, and also the matter of over-time for train crews. The new service will go into effect May 30, 1920, by which time the company will have the exact schedue provided for. The Commission is of the opinion that this service will completely satisfy the complaint and will render adequate service to the greatest riber of people wishing to reach Pawnee City and Lincoln and return game day. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE CONSIDERED AND ORDERED by the Ne - braska State Railway Commission that the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company install and operate an exclusive passenger train be - tween Wymore and Lincoln by way of Table Rock, said train to leave Wymore in the morning and return in the afternoon or evening, and that the exact schedule of the train shall be determined upon and filed with the Commission on or before May 30, 1920. Operation of the train shall begin on that date. Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 17th day of May, 1920. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION, H. G. Taylor, Chairman. Attest: John E.

OPINION AND FINDING HALL, Commissioner: The complaint herein was filed on May 10, 1920. It alleges inade - quate westbound express service by the Union Pacific Railroad company and the American Railway Express company out of Grand Island. The towns of Lexington, Eddyville, Wood River, Overton, North Platte, Cal - laway, Brady Island, Arnold, Stapleton, Cozad, Gothenburg and Shelton filed complaints, signed by many retail merchants at these points, alleg - ing that the service from Grand Island to them was inadequate. The Fairmont Creamery company and others also filed petitions of interven - tion in which they joined in the complaint. The Omaha Chamber of Commerce filed a petition in intervention in which it denied that there was any discrimination in favor of Omaha as against Grand Island. The matter was set down for hearing at 10 o'clock a. m. on July 30th. A complete record was made of all testimony taken in which the com - plainants attempted to show that the service rendered by train No. 25 was inadequate, and that discrimination existed between Grand Island and Hastings by reason of the fact that No. 15 carries express west, daily, out of Grand Island, which originates at Hastings and shipped west out of Hastings by way of the St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island Railway and the Union Pacific Railroad, and that No. 15 docs not carry express west out of Grand Island which originates at Grand Island. The Union Pacific Railroad company and the American Railway Express company both agreed that such discrimination should not exist and they were not aware of such conditions. The complainants agreed that if the defendant would carry express out of Grand Island on No. 19 that their complaint would be entirely satisfied. At the close of the hearing the Commission requested that the par - ties hold as informal conference for the purpose of undertaking: to get together and submit to the Commission a stipulation as to what might be done in the way of betterment of the service. This was agreed to by all of the parties. We now are informed by the Chamber of Com - merce of Grand Island and the Fairmont Creamery company that the defendant company agrees to carry express west out of Grand Island on No. 19 which entirely satisfied the complaint herein. The Commission has not heard from all of the rest of the intervenors but the testimony shows that if No. 19 carried express it would entirely satisfy the com - plaint. We, therefore, take it for granted that all the intervenors wish to have their complaints dismissed. We are of the opinion that the complaints should be dismissed as having been satisfied. </seg>

Defendants, Order on Motion vs. Gothenburg Light &amp; Power Company, a Corporation, Complainants. BROWNE, Commissioner: Complainants herein make certain allegations relative to conditions of irrigation canal of defendant company, particularly that portion from a point midway between Lake Helen and the outlet of the canal to the outlet, and allege further insufficient and inadequate service in the past and prospects of similar conditions in the future by reason of such physi - cal conditions alleged. t Complainants ask that a hearing be held and an order be entered re - ring the defendants to clean out the canal over the portion complained &gt;ut; that defendants be required to use the maintenance tax paid by complainants and others similarly situated on that portion of the canal which serves much complainants and others; that defendents be prohib - ited from selling temporary water rights to seasonal users in excess of the capacity of the canal to carry water needed by the complainants and other similarly situated; that defendants be required to maintain a ditch rider, and proper measuring boxes at points of intake to the laterals; E defendents operate the canal through a longer period each year; the rights of each person, as to temporary water rights, shall be sec - ry to the rights of those owning permanent water rights. Motion was filed by defendants asking that complainants be required to name all owners of water rights on behalf of whom they prosecute as complainants, with description of the lands of each person; that com - plainants be required to name the years in which the maintenance tax has been $2.50 per acre per annum; "that complainants set out and name the years intended to be covered by allegations in the first part of para - graph eleven which relates to the misuse of maintenance tax by defend - rm and that complainants make more definite and certain the allegations paragraphs 12-13-14 and 15 of the complaint.

            <seg id="p145">145 Commission has always allowed the practice set out in Section 7600 R.

It appears to the Commission further that the complainants speak with such clarity as to the territory affected as to permit of defendants properly preparing answer. It is the opinion of the Commission further that other amplifications of the charges desired by defendant in its motion are more properly mat - ters of evidence than of pleadings. The complaint states a cause of ac - tion. The defendants will therefore be required to answer not later than February 25, 1920, and the matters at issue will be set down for hearing at Gothenburg, Nebraska, on the 8th day of March, 1920.

            <seg id="p146">146 on the lower half of the irrigation ditch of the Gothenburg Light ft Power company, object to the condition in 'which the said irrigation ditch has been maintained, alleging that it is entirely impracticable to furnish the service for which they pay annual maintenance charges, and ask the Commission to make certain findings specifically as follows: 1. That the ditch must be cleaned out and the accumulated deposits of silt removed in order that the ditch be restored to its original capacity; (2) that such supervision occur in the future as to prevent the taking of water in an unauthorized manner through troughs in the banks rather than through lateral measuring boxes; (3) that the company be required to maintain ditch riders during the irrigation season; (4) that defendant be forbidden during the 1920 irrigation season to close down its ditch during any portion of the period from April 1 to November 1, as oc - curred in the season of 1919; (5) that defendant be forbidden to sell extra water to the detriment of the permanent water right owners; (6) that more adequate measuring boxes be installed. t Hearing on this case was held at Lexington, Nebraska, on March and 11, 1920, and was submitted on the evidence saving only that a tain principal exhibit of complainants should be further identified by deposition of an engineer, who was ill at the time of the hearing. This exhibit, being a profile map containing a large amount of essential data, is still in the hands of complainants, the witness whose deposition was to be taken still being too ill to be examined. kThe undisputed evidence showed that even when the spring is not it is necessary to turn the water into the ditch the early part of • in order to take care of the demand. This makes it necessary to concentrate deferred maintenance work previous to the first of June and for that reason this temporary order is being issued. Later, when the final exhibits have been filed, and when defendant has furnished certain final data asked for by the Commission, a more comprehensive order will be entered. I It is not necessary at this time to pass on most of the points raised the complainants as the testimony did not show them to be imme - tely vital. Defendant did not resist the statements of complainants that the ditch had not been properly maintained in 1919. It was alleged that such lack of maintenance was due, first, to inability to secure labor; and second, to the water having been turned off for periods of eight to ten days on two occasions, giving the weeds a start which could not be overcome. The only dispute between the parties relative to the condition of the ditch was as to the extent of the deferred maintenance and as to whether they were seriously incapacitated under existing conditions to furnish the required amount of water. No plea was made by defendant that the existing rates are inadequate, or that there are no funds with which to do such repair and deferred maintenance work as may be </seg>
            <seg id="p147">147 Complainants' engineer testified that 21,000 cubic yards of silt have been deposited in the ditch in the twenty-five years since its construction, and according to exhibit of defendant this filling-in approximates ten per cent of the total original excavation. Complainants' estimate of amount of filling will have to ba adjusted if it is finally determined that the assumption of improper grade is wrongly taken. Members of the Commission made a personal inspection of the part of the ditch which is in the worst state of repair, and the conclusion is that vigorous work must be done this spring to insure proper functioning during the months when the heavy call for water is heard. In this temporary order all questions will be subordinated to the chief one as to the amount of deferred maintenance that can reasonably be accomplished during the remainder of the period before water is turned into the ditch for the summer. Besides the cleaning out of dead weeds, trash, small trees, and brush which must obviously be done, and which the defendant company ad - mits, there appears to be little question but that the ditch is of insuf - ficient capacity at certain points. In the main these points are located at Stations 35, 37, 39, 87, 89, 174, 177, 191, 200, 337, and 343 in varying degrees of stricture, and at a considerable number of places in the lower half of the ditch. In the opinion of the Commission the ditch should have a carrying capacity of at least 110 second feet between the headgate and Station 206, a capacity of at least 100 second feet between Station 208 and just below the point where the second lateral takes off from the main ditch on the farm of N. Brownfield, and a capacity below that point gradually decreasing from 75 second feet to 18 second feet just above the inlet to Lake Peden. This decrease in capacity shall be governed by the ex - tent of adjacent water rights lying under the ditch. In addition to this excavation the company shall clean out debris from the ditch, and from such laterals as the company is required to maintain, and shall strengthen the south bank at those places where trouble from overflow occurred last year, or is likely to occur by reason of the ditch above carrying full capacity of water at any time. The company will make a report to the Commission on May 1 and weekly thereafter as to progress of the work in such detail as shall en - able the Commission to keep in touch with developments. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Gothenburg Light &amp; Power company be and it hereby is directed to proceed with all possible diligence to clean out the accumulated weeds, willows, brush, and trash from all parts of the ir - rigation ditch herein under consideration.

Brownfield, and 75 .second feet below that point with reductions in capacity at various points as is warranted by a reduction in acreage with right to the use of water, such capacity reaching at minimum of not less than 18 second feet immediately above the Peden Lake outlet.

(SEAL) FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 400 Oakley Andrews et al., Complainants, v. The Lincoln Traction Company, Defendant. Appearances: For Complainants— -Oakley Andrews and H. N. Pierce. For Defendants— F. M. Hall, attorney. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Chairman This is a complaint directed against the Lincoln Traction company, asking that the Commission's order in Application No. 4149, fixing cer - tain rates of fares for said company, be amended so as to provide that the territory formerly known as Normal be included in the so-called city zone, within which the base rate is 7c cash fare or four tokens for 25c. The rate charged to Normal is 8c cash fare or one token or ticket plus lc. » Since the issuance of the order in Application No. 4149, the lines the city have been extended so as to take in the suburb of Normal, is largely because of this fact that complainants ask for a readjust - ment of the rate schedule. Their complaint is based on the assumption that the Commission established a zone bounded by the city limits, with - in which the rate of 7c, or four tokens for 25c, should be applied. Such, </seg>
            <seg id="p149">149 however, is not the case. In the order referred to, the Commission made certain specific exceptions with reference to the base rate of 7c, the para - graph of the order relating thereto reading as follows: "1. Seven (7) cents cash, or one token, for the transportation of each adult passenger, with the following exceptions: Eight (8) cents cash, or one token plus one cent between Lincoln and Havelock, Lincoln and University Place, Lincoln and Bethany, Lincoln and Normal, Lincoln and College View; between Havelock and Bethany, Havelock and Normal, Havelock and College View; between Uni - versity Place and Bethany, University Place and Normal, University Plnce ar^ College View; between Bethanv and Normal, Bethany and College View; and between Normal and College View." Had the order specifically established a base rate zone within the city limits, the complaint in this instance would be reasonably well found - ed. As shown, however, no such zone is established and the mere fact that the suburb of Normal has subsequently been made a part of the corporation of the city of Lincoln does not modify in any way the reasons for fixing the rate to that territory. The distance to Normal is as great as to some of the other points named in the order. The cost of handling the passengers to and from that point is just as great now as before Normal became a part of the city of Lincoln. There appears to be no good reason, therefore, for modifying the order at this time and the complaint will therefore be dismissed. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the complaint herein be, and the same is, hereby dismissed. Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 21st day of July, 1920.

            <seg id="p150">150 made came on for hearing at Newman Grove, Nebraska, on July 8, 1920. Certain exhibits were filed later, as per directions at the time of the hearing. The petition in general alleges inadequate passenger train service and specifically complains as follows: First. That mail for points between Scribner and Albion is carried on freight train No. 339, which train is so irregular as to deprive sever - al towns east of Albion of mail delivery the same day the mail leaves Omaha. Second. That there is unusual delay in the delivery of mail from the depot to the post office. Third. That inadequate connections are made at Oakdale for points west and east. Fourth. That the town of Newman Grove, particularly, is inade - tely supplied with station help. The prayer of the petition is that defendant be required to operate an additional passenger train each way daily, said passenger train to originate at Scribner, departing after the arrival of No. 1 westbound, making connection again at Oakdale with No. 1 and returning in the afternoon in time to make connection with No. 8 at Scribner; and that the other matters complained of be remedied and general relief be grant - ed. At the time of the hearing the case was broadened by testimony to include the delivery of merchandise at Newman Grove and to include the failure of the North Western to make connections from No. 310 at Fremont with No. 21 for Lincoln. This so-called Albion branch between Scribner and Oakdale, serving a highly prosperous and well settled agricultural region, has the follow - ing train service: Passenger train No. 309 leaves Omaha at 5:30 p. m. and arrives at Oakdale at 1:15 a. m. Passenger train No. 310 leaves Oakdale at 5:45 a. m. and arrives •t Omaha at 1:30 p. m. Westbound freight trains Nos. 339 and 365 carry passenger coaches Eastbound freight trains Nos. 366 and 340 are likewise equipped No. 339 carries mail from Scribner to Albion and No. 340 mail from Oakdale to Albion. Train service on this branch has been under dispute for several years and during that time has seldom been satisfactory to the people served. In the instant case the Commission has the benefit of carefully presented testimony from witnesses representing almost all the towns on the branch as well as data prepared by the Commission on several studies made of the service prior to the hearing, the exhibits thereof having been placed </seg>
            <seg id="p151">151 The testimony dealt largely with the density of population and a comparison with the class of passenger train service rendered on the branch with that rendered on the main line, together with the figures of business done on branch and main line. It also included testimony relative to the inconveniences in the handling of the mail, overcrowded passenger trains, the unfavorable hours of service, particularly between Albion and Oakdale, and the slow schedule resulting from the amount of business done by the passenger trains. Witnesses were generally agreed that another passenger train would relieve the present trains of a portion of their express burden and would be a very great convenience to all the towns served. They were also very well agreed that the amount of business done, if not now justifying an additional passenger train, would justify it if service were improved. These will be dealt with in turn. An extra passenger train leaving Scribner after the arrival with No. 1 and connecting again with No. 1 at Oakdale would require an elapsed schedule of 33 1-2 miles per hour, necessitating a running speed much higher than that. The North Wes - tern's fastest train in Nebraska has a schedule of only 30 miles per hour. It is obvious that on this branch such time cannot be made. The present speed of the train is 25 miles per hour including stops, which is probably as fast as the track will permit. No. 310 leaves Oakdale at 5:45 a. m., and is rather an early train for citizens of Elgin, Petersburg and Loretto. It cannot in justice to these citizens leave Oakdale at an earlier hour. The connection at Fre - mont is missed by one hour and twenty minutes. If the leaving time from Oakdale is the same as it is now, it would require an increase in speed of 8 miles per hour.which is out of the question. If the connection at Fremont is of enough importance, that is, if the amount of traffic from the Albion branch to Lincoln warrants close connection at Fremont, ad - justment would have to be made on the time of the Lincoln trains. An extra passenger tram each way on this branch line would have to be warranted by the volume of business. Evidence as to the increased business that would result from the extra trains is not sufficiently defi - nite to tie conclusions to. The North Western does not keep its passenger earnings separata for each train, and no special studies were made for this case, hence what evidence is in existence, concerning the earnings of the branch line in question, must be more or less an estimate. The ticket sales at all stations on the Albion branch in 1919 amounted to $104,866, which includes the sales of tickets for traffic on the four freight trains which carry passenger coaches. It does not include ths sales of tickets for returning trips to points on the branch except round trip tickets. The average mixed train earnings of the North Western in Nebraska runs approximately 20 per cent of the straight passenger earnings. On the Albion line they will run higher for the percentage of mixed trains to the passenger trains is much higher than the aver - age. If we estimate the percentage of ticket sales for passage on the </seg>
            <seg id="p152">152 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT mixed trains at 25 per cent of the total sales at the stations in question, the earnings of the two passenger trains in 1919 for outbound journeys and for trips inter-town, it is safe to assume would be about $78,000. Allowing for the amount of traffic inter-town, we estimate the earnings of train No. 309 on traffic returning 'from points beyond Scrib - ner at 75 per cent of the earnings on train No. 310 inbound. On such a E thesis the earnings per train mile of each passenger train on the in branch would be |1.64. The average of all trains of defendant any in Nebraska for 1919 was $1.78 per train mile. Gross express earnings on the Albion branch in 1919 were |27,547, which together with the mail earnings amounts to 39.3c per train mile, whereas the average express and mail earnings on all defendant's trains in Nebraska is 27.8c per train mile. t Allowing for the mistakes which such an estimate undoubtedly con - ns, it can hardly be assumed on the evidence presented that the ad - ional train is, at this time of high operating cost, warranted. It would thus appear that the solution of such service problems as exist must be found in another way. The mail service to the towns between Humphrey and Albion is undoubtedly poor and very irregular. The earnings from mail service do not warrant making the carrying of mails the first consideration. Mail service must be secondary to the convenience of passenger service. Nor does mail service in itself warrant the establishment of additional trains where in other respects such additional trains are not warranted. The carrier is, however, not doing its full duty, if means for improving mail service are available and are not used. There was much of merit in the contention of witnesses from towns West of Albion that the train service is unusually inconvenient. The eastbound train passes those stations at a very early hour in the morn - ing and the night train is extremely belated. These towns have sufferetl under such services for many years. It appears that if means can be fcund for improving their service without at the same time requiring the carrier to operate service at a loss, such means should be used. The westbound passenger train which arrives at Oakdale at 1:15 a. m. makes no connections at that point. The first eastbound train thereafter on the main line is too early to give passengers, desiring to go in that direction, a night's rest and westbound trains are eight or nine hours af - ter the arrival of No. 309 at Oakdale. Hence connections from the Albion line at Oakdale are almost im - possible. Passengers desiring to go west of Oakdale find it necessary to drive across to the main line. This situation should be improved, if possible. Complaint is made as to the slow movement of train No. 310 to Omaha. The speed of this train, including stops, is 23.4 miles per hour or 1.6 miles per boor less than the average of all North Western passen- </seg>
            <seg id="p153">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 153 ger trains in the state. A considerable amount of express business is done, especially milk and cream. Chief stops are made for this purpose at Arlington and Bennington on the main line. Until the traffic warrants the additional trains on the Albion line it appears impossible to improve the running time of this train to Omaha, except as in the future the op - eration of a cream train on the main line may eliminate the necessity of handling large quantities of sweet milk at Arlington and Bennington, thereby improving the time of arrival of No. 310 at Omaha by at least twenty minutes. Testimony was presented as to inadequate station service at Newman Grove. The station force at this point includes the agent, operator and one helper. The helper's chief service is in the evening, in order to keep the station open for the arrival of No. 309 at 11:15 p. m. A merchandise car is set out each day from freight train No. 339. This train usually arrives after the station force has completed the day's work with the exception of the helper and the morning force is so light as to make it. impracticable to check the freight in the car to the drayman before 9:30 a. m. The Commission had a personal check made of this situation and it docs not appear that under present conditions an improvement can be made without the addition of another helper beginning duty at the same time the agent goes on duty in the morning. This difficulty can, how - ever, be solved in one of two other ways, which will be mentioned. Present passenger train service from the Albion line provides an arrival at Omaha at 1 :30 p. m. and the leaving of westbound train from Omaha at 5:30 p. m. These schedules have been maintained for years on the assumption that a considerable traffic, arising on the Albion line, returns the same day. All testimony given from the various towns on the line .'hows that this traffic does not exist to any considerable degree. The Commission had certain trains checked by one of its employes, which in the main substantiated this testimony. Witnesses stated that wiicn it is necessary to go to Omaha and back the same day, it has been found preferable to drive to Union Pacific points routh. as such a scheme gives more time in the metropolis. It appears, therefore, that the present solution of the inconvenient train service on the Albion line lies in a change of schedule for train No. 309. This train should leave Omaha before noon, at such time as will enable it to make connection at Scribner with No. 6, main line eastbound train, thence making the rest of its schedule largely in daylight hours. Such a plan appears to us to have many advantages. Mail from points east of Omaha to points on the North Western west of Fremont is routed via Missouri Valley and Blair on train No. 21, arriving at Fre - mont at 9:22 a. m. This mail can be picked up by No. 309. No. 6 brings passengers and mail from points on the main line, particularly Norfolk and the connection with that train is essential. No. 309 should be scheduled to leave Scribner directly after the departing time of No. 6 in order that its mail service west should be as convenient as possible. If No. 309 is </seg>
            <seg id="p154">154 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT scheduled to leave Scribner at 2:45 p. m. it will reach Humphrey at i: 42 p. m., Newman Grove 5:20 p. m., Albion 6:00 p. m. and Oakdale 7:25 p. m. Such a schedule will solve the mail problems complained of and will provide reasonable hours of westbound service for stations Humphrey to Oakdale. It will provide excellent connections at Oakdale with Nos. 3 and 5 westbound. It will provide poor connections with eastbound trains at Oakdale. However, passengers for points east of Oakdale have an opportunity of traveling by way of Humphrey, transferring to the Union Pacific, thence making connections at Norfolk west with No. 1 and east with Nos. 6 and 8. If No. 309 departs from Omaha before the noon hour it will relieve that train of some of the passengers to Fremont, Hooper and Scribner, which now use the train and which cause all the congestion testified to. These passengers will naturally take No. 5 or No. 3 at a later hour. t Under the present plan of regulating station hours under the labor ;, many of the stations on the Albion line are closed before dark. 309 is, therefore, required to run at a disadvantage, inasmuch as it must meet freight train No. 340 some place between Humphrey and Scribner and both trains are necessarily slowed up by reason of the na - ture of their orders when station forces are absent at the various stations. No. 340 carries 'Stock and it would be advantageous to shippers of stock if this train could make better time, such as undoubtedly would be the case if it was not required to meet No. 309. It is quite possible also that if No. 339 were relieved of carrying the mail and the necessity of meeting No. 1 at Scribner, this freight train could leave Fremont at an earlier hour and perform its entire schedule so far as the Albion line is con - cerned, during daylight, thereby increasing the efficiency in freight handling. » If No. 309 is run at the earlier hour suggested, it will relieve the railroad company of the necessity «f station helpers working the first half of the night and at Newman Grove in particular will permit such helper to be used in the forenoon, thereby expediting the handling of freight and morning express. However, as suggested, freight tram No. 339 could by reason of this change leave Fremont in the early morning hours. The merchandise cars set out at the various stations, including Newman Grove, would be available for checking out freight in the late afternoon. t After considering all these points the Commission is of the opinion the advantages of providing that train No. 309 leave Omaha not than 12:00 o'clock noon will outweigh the disadvantages. These dis - advantages appear to be solely, so far as the public is concerned, the removal of the opportunity of making a round trip to Omaha and return on the same day, and so far as the railroad is concerned, the necessity of fur - nishing additional baggage and passenger cars to make up the equipment of No. 309. We find, therefore, that the North Western should change the schedule of time of passenger train No. 309 to provide that it leave </seg>
            <seg id="p155">155 Omaha not later than 12:00 o'clock noon, making connection with No. 6 at or before reaching Scribner and that such changes in working time of the station force at Newman Grove be made as will provide for the prompt handling of merchandise. If this plan of operation does not improve service as we think, patrons are privileged to apply for further consider - ation. An order to this effect will be entered ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Chicago and North Western Railway company be and it hereby is ordered to run its passenger train No. 309 between Omaha and Oakdale via Albion on such schedule as will permit its connection to handle mail, passengers and express from No. 6 to points on the Albion line and to be scheduled to leave Scribner immediately after the schedule time of No. 6 at that point. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that such adjustment of station force at Newman Grove be made as will permit of the prompter handling of merchandise from the merchandise set-out car at that point.

Short et al, Complainants, vs. Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway Company, Defendant. FINDING AND ORDER HALL, Commissioner: This proceeding is based upon a complaint filed by Ben A. Short and others against the Omaha A Council Bluffs Street Railway company, which operates a street railway system in Omaha, Nebraska, Council Bluffs, Iowa, (connecting the two cities), and their environs. The com - plainants are employees of the company. The complainants allege that they are citizens of Omaha and are users of the service of the defendant; that it is a common carrier, engaged H. G. TAYLOR, Chairman. </seg>
            <seg id="p156">156 Ethe transportation of passengers; that the wages paid to its employees the various divisions and classes of employment are not sufficient to rmit the employees to maintain themselves in keeping with the nature of their employment and are not sufficient to enable the company to keep an adequate number of competent conductors and motormen, thereby impairing the service to the public; that the complainants are members of the Amalgamated Association of Street &amp; Electric Railway Employees of America, Local Division No. S07, of Omaha, Nebraska, and as such members have taken a strike vote and intend to strike if adequate relief is pot provided in wages and conditions. An increase of thirteen cents per hour is asked, which would make the pay of all motormen and con - ductors, who collectively are called trainmen, sixty-six cents for the first three months, sixty-eight cents for the next nine months, and seventy Fts thereafter, with a corresponding increase over present wages for other classes of employees. defendant filed a plea to the jurisdiction, in which it alleges t the State Railway Commission has no power to fix or determine a .-cale of wages to be paid by defendant to its employees; that the right of contract is guaranteed by the constitution of the United States and by the constitution and the laws of the state of Nebraska; and that no E mental authority has the right to interfere in the fixing of terms n defendant and its servants. After extended argument upon the was overruled. The defendant then filed its answer in which it is denied that the wages paid are insufficient, and denied there is any impairment of the service. The defendant alleges that there would be no impairment of the service even temporarily in the event that a strike should occur, unless complainants use force to oroluce such impairment. It also al - leges upon information and belief that the strike vote referred to in the complaint does not truly represent the will of the employees of the com - pany and that a large proportion of them wished to continue their service at the existing scale of wages and do not intend to strike. It denies that the scale of wages is inadequate to secure the services of a sufficient number Ci men capable of operating the system, and alleges that the scale of watres is fair and reasonable. It sets forth that there hava !&gt;een numerous increase:, in wages during the past six years; that the company is operating at a loss and that it is unable to pay iarger wage.s; that complainants havinp voted to strike and intending to do so unless their demands are complied with, are not acting in good faith and therefore have no standing before this Commission. It alleges generally that the service rendered by the company is efficient, and that it will, if it re - ceive proper protection of law. continue to furnish such service to the public. The reply denies that the strike vote does not represent the will of the employees; denies that a large proportion of them are willing to continue in service at the existing scale of- wages; and particularly </seg>
            <seg id="p157">157 denies that at any stage of the controversy the complainants, or any one in their behalf, have interfered or threatened forcibly to interfere with the service of the company. The foregoing states all of the essential allegations of the pleadings. The city of Omaha appeared by its corporation counsel but filed no pleading. Prior to entering upon the hearing, the Commission made the follow - ing statement for the record: "The Commission has concludad to assume jurisdiction of the issues involved in this complaint. It is with no small degree of reluctance that we have reached this conclusion, because we have a profound realization of the many difficulties with which it is beset. The decision is the result of a rather protracted and exhaustive con - sideration of the law and the authorities, and of our duty in rela - tion thereto. The question is close and invades new fields, but where doubt exists we have endeavored to resolve it in the public intero.-t, content to assume unwelcome responsibility if we may contribute even in small measure to the solution of a most perplexing problem. "It is not our intention to go fully into our reasons at this time, reserving those for fuller discussion later. The basic principle which controlled our decision, however, should, in fairness to all parties, be stated so that the limits of this investigation may be definitely fixed. We hold that our jurisdiction extends only to the mainte - nance and continuance of adequate service by the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway company within the city of Omaha and its suburbs; that to that end we can, after proper inquiry, establish a general schedule of wages for the employees of said company, sufficient, in our opinion, to attract and secure the necessary number of men to operate the system. In fixing a general schedule we shall go only so far as is required to determine what amount will be necessary to insure service, and collateral economic questions will not be considered. "The ability of the company to pay any schedule we may de - termine is of necessity a prime factor, and for that reason we shall receive evidence with reference to the present revenues and oper - ating- expenses and general financial condition of defendant, so that we may, if found necessary, make emergency rates to cover the new obligation imposed. Such a showing need not involve a valu - ation of the property as that might take so long as to defeat the purpose of the rate increase in the event such increase is required." The Commission struck out all references in the pleadings to the cost of living, and all references to the fixing of a general wage standard. Throughout the hearing the complainants endeavored to introduce evi - dence as to rents, cost of food, cost of clothing, etc. The Commission consistently refused to go into such an investigation. It conceived its jurisdiction to be limited to fixing a scale of wages that would attract an adequate number of capable employees to enable the defendant to carry on its service, and further than that it refused to go. It appears from the evidence that defendant operates as an "open shop"; that it employs men as individuals without regard to membership in a union; that most of them are not members of such an organization </seg>
            <seg id="p158">158 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT at the time of employment; that shortly after they are installed in their positions they are solicited tc join the union and most of them join, about ninety-five per cent being members. There is some reference to working: conditions, but not much stress is laid on that phase. The controversy centers on the issue as to wages, and principally on the wages of motor - men and conductors. The controversy seems to have arisen because at the time of the increase in fares granted by this Commission to the defendant on August 1, 1919, the employees considered they did not re - ceive as much increase in wages as they were entitled to. The company urged that it was still operating at a loss but some of the employees seem - ed to doubt the accuracy of the figures presented by the defendant and in - sisted upon submitting their differences to arbitration. It was finally suggested by the men, and agreed to by the defendant, that the con - troversy be submitted to this Commission as a board of arbitration. The Commission, of course, declined to act in that capacity in a matter in which it was likely to be called upon officially. Thereupon the complaint was filed. As the case is one of first impression in this state, and as it is one of great moment, the Commission feels that it should fully set forth the grounds of its decision. It may also be of advantage in case of appeal to have the views of the administrative body fully stated in the record. LThe first ground urged by the defendant against the jurisdiction of Commission is chapter 257, laws of Nebraska of 1919, (page 1048). The constitutional amendment creating the State Railway Commission provides as follows for its jurisdiction: "The powers and duties of such commission shall include the regulation of rates, service and general control of common carriers as the legislature may provide by law. But, in the absence of spe - cific legislation, the commission shall exercise the powers and per- form the duties enumerated in this provision." The act of 1919 is not such "specific legislation" as to divest the Commission of any jurisdiction granted it by the constitution. There are several reasons for this conclusion: First, the act relates to railroads and not to street railways. In each of its several paragraphs the word "railroads" is used, but nowhere is the term "street railways" found. This is particularly clear in the paragraph providing penalties, which is as follows: "When a railroad company shall be liable for any damage or injury that shall be caused or contributed to by a violation of the provisions of this act", etc. In Lincoln Street Railway Co. vs. McClellan, 54 Neb. 672, this lan - guage is employed: "In the common understanding, a railroad and a street railway have always been separate and distinct things. One is a graded road over which heavy cars, running on iron or steel tracks and unusually propelled by steam, carry passengers, freight, and bag- </seg>
            <seg id="p159">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 159 gage, while the other is exclusively employed for the transportation of passengers in cities and is so constructed as to interfere but little with ordinary traffic." The legal liabilities of the two classes of carriers are not the same. The difference results from the fact that one, the railroad, is affected by the statute, which the court then had under consideration, and the other, the street railway, is not. In Omaha Street Railway Co. vs. Boesen, 74 Neb., 764, it is held that the statute governing the liability of railroad companies for in - juries to passengers does not apply to street railway companies. See also Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway Co. vs. Interstate Commerce Commission, 230 U. S., 324; 57 Law ed. 1501. Second, there is nothing in the title of the act indicating that it should apply to a street railway. It is entitled "An act to vest the State Railway Commission with jurisdiction to regulate the service, facilities and equipment of railroad companies, and to provide penalties for viola - tion of this act". The legislature must be presumed to have had in mind the condition of the law before the enactment and having it in mind it would not have used that title if it had intended to include street rail - ways. It certainly cannot be said that the subject is clearly expressed in the title of the act as required by the constitution. Third, the terms of the act itself do not show that it was intended to limit the constitutional power possessed by the Railway Commission. It provides (Section 2): "This act shall not be construed as a limitation upon the powers of the State Railway Commission which have heretofore been grant - ed, but as supplemental thereto. It is further provided that nothing herein contained shall be construed as giving the State Railway Commission jurisdiction or control of the relations between the rail - way companies and their employees and employees orders either contractual or otherwise." The language is purely negative and is a limitation not upon the Commission but upon the effect of the act itself. Fourth, the legislature does not attempt to occupy the field and in the absence of "specific legislation" the Commission has all the juris - diction granted to it* by the constitutional provision. It was urged by the defendant throughout the hearing that the complainants were not doing equity and therefore could not seek equity; that they came threatening to strike and consequently could ask nothing at the hands of the Commission. That view proceeds upon the theory that this is a controversy between two parties, — in other words, an ordi - nary lawsuit. We consider it to be an entirely different affair; that it is a proceeding, the object of which is to protect the public in an im - portant service and that the rights of the public transcend the rights of either party, or even both of them combined. In Hodges vs. The Lin- </seg>
            <seg id="p160">THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 160 fin Traction Co., 11 Nebraska Commission Report, 134, which involved controversy between a street railway company and its employees, this Commission said: "An operating agreement was proposed and discussed by the parties, but no conclusion was reached, owing principally to the refusal of the company to recognize the union. We wish to say in passing that the proposed agreement contained provisions inconsist - ent with the powers of the State Railway Commission over the company, and such provisions, even though adopted by both parties, would have been wholly ineffective, as the constitutional powers of the Commission are not to be abrogated by private agreement; contracts affecting the service or general control of common car - riers are always subject to the powers of the Railway Commission." • * * * "The Commission's powers are exceedingly broad; it may, for instance, in regulating the service, fix the hours of labor of the employees, the conditions of service, the number of employess and may even fix the scale of wages." tOne object of the people in establishing the Railway Commission s to protect the public service against interruption. When information brought in the form of a complaint, it is not material who files the complaint or what his attitude may be. If the Commission has informa - tion that the public service is threatened with suspension, it immediately becomes its duty to protect it. It must be presumed that the complaint was filed in good faith and that if, after a full hearing, the employees are not satisfied with the de - cision of the Commission they will not strike but will pursue their right of appeal. As above set forth, the power of the Commission is derived from the constitutional amendment, vesting it with jurisdiction over the rates, Crice and general control of common carriers. In construing the pro - on, the supreme court uses this language: "The legislature may make provision as to these powers and duties, but the Commission, 'in the absence of specific legislation, shall exercise the powers and perform the duties enumerated'. It was submitted to the people by the legislature of 1905. Laws 19u5, ch. 233. Unless there has been specific legislation that might limit or affect this power given to the Commission, it would seem that the people have given this Commission all the control over common carriers that they themselves could exercise." In re The Lincoln Traction Co., 103 Neb. 229. This Commission is therefore on a different footing from that of most regulatory bodies. They usually derive their powers from statutory enactments, or from constitutional provisions in which their jurisdiction is specifically limited. This Commission is not limited in its power except as the field may be occupied by legislation or the matter may be beyond the control of the people themselves. We have seen that there is no statu - tory provision touching the matter involved in this case, and it therefore resolves itself into the question of whether or not the people have the power to protect themselves in the continuance of an important public </seg>
            <seg id="p161">161 service when that service is threatened with interruption or destruction. It seems to us to propound the question is to answer it. It is self-evi - dent that the public has a right to protect itself; that the people do not have to sit idly by and see the industries and social life of a whole community brought to a state of paralysis because the owners and the employee: 1 of a 1 ransportation system are not in agreement as to wages. Let us consider where the power lies to fix wages. Does the com - pany have the power to make a wage so low that it can secure only in - ferior men? Do the men have the right to extort the highest wages possible from the company? A few further queries will probably show the position of the Com - n.ussion better than extended discussion would disclose it. Suppose the defendant should vote its general officers' salaries so excessive that to pay them would require the fare to be raised one cent; would any one say that the public was remediless but must meekly submit to the excessive charge simply because the board of directors of the company had so ordered ? Again, suppose instead of the excessive salaries to the general officers the company allows its motormen and conductors wages that are so excessive that thereby an increase of one cent in the fare is necessi - tated; is the public again without means of redress? Or suppose that the general officers and the employees should combine and force the company to allow salaries and wages so excessive that the fare would have to be increased two cents; would the public still be powerless? We think not. In any of these situations the public has the right to protect itself and ample means have been provided through which it may act. As to how far the state may go in regulating wages generally we sre not called on to determine. The jurisdiction of the Commission re - lates to the subject only so far as wages affect service and rates- It is our duty to determine that matter, and we shall not hesitate to do so, but it is just as clearly the duty of the Commission to refrain from under - taking to determine matters not affecting the public service and there - fore not within its jurisdiction. So that as announced by the Commission at the opening, it went only so far in the hearing as was required to de - termine what amount of wages would be necessary to insure service and collateral economic questions were not considered. Let us now refer to the authorities. The supreme court of the United States has answered the first question above suggested as to the ex - cessive salaries in the case of Chicago &amp; G. T. R. Co. vs. Wellman, 143 U. S. 339; 36 Law ed. 176. In that case the court held that before pass - ing upon the constitutionality of a rate statute the courts must be clearly informed as to the reasonableness of salaries paid and that operating expense accounts could not be swollen with extravagant salaries. The question as to excessive wages is discussed in re Western N. Y. &amp; Penn. Traction Co., P. U. R. 1920 A, 951, where the New York commission uses this language: </seg>
            <seg id="p162">162 "The Commission should not, without question, permit an in - crease in rates in order to permit the payment of such wages as may be demanded by employees. The so-called platform expenses of an electrical railroad constitute a very large proportion of its operating expenses and the Commission should see to it that that item, like all other items of expense, is reasonably incurred before permitting it to be loaded upon the public in the form of increased rates." We come now to the principal question: Has the public the right to fix a wage scale which in its judgment is sufficient to attract an adequate number of efficient men to the service ? One naturally turns to the latest and most important case bearing upon the subject, Wilson vs. New, 243 U. S. 332; 61 Law ed. 755. An act of Congress, known as the Adamson act, fixed a standard working day, and certain wage regulations on in - terstate railways (with exceptions). At the time of the enactment the country was confronted with the immediate suspension of interstate com - merce by reason of a threatened general strike of railway employees, the outcome of a dispute over a wage standard. In order to protect the country against such a condition congress enacted the law. Some of the carriers sought to enjoin the officers of the Federal government from enforcing its provisions and the case shortly after reached the supreme court. The opinion of the court may be summarized thus: Congress, when confronted with an imminent strike on interstate railways, has power to establish a standard working day and to fix temporary waere regulations; interstate commerce, differing from private business, is im - pressed with a public interest and both the capital and the labor employed in it are devoted to the interest of the public and are subject to regulation. We quote below some of the more striking paragraphs of the opinion, Cch express the views of the court; also a paragraph from the concur - j oninion of Justice McKenna: "Thnt the business of common carriers by rail is in a sense a pub'ir business because of the interest of society in the continued operation and rightful conduct of such business, and that the public interest begets a public risrht of regulation to the full extent neces - sarv to secure ard protect it, is settled by so many decisions, state and Federal, ard is illustrated by such a continuous exertion, of state and Federal leirislative power, as to leave no room for question on the subject." • * • * * • * "We are of opinion that the reasons stated conclusively estab - lish that, from the point of view of inherent power, the act which is before us was clearly within the legislative power of Congress to adopt, and that, in substance and effect, it amounted to an exer - tion of its authority under the circumstances disclosed to compul - sorily arbitrate the dispute between the parties by establishing as to the subject matter of that dispute a legislative standard of wages operative and binding as a matter of law upon the parties, — a power none the less efficaciously exerted because exercised by di - rect legislative act instead of by the enactment of other and ap - nronriate means providing for the bringing about of such result. If it be conceded that the power to enact the statute was in effect </seg>
            <seg id="p163">163 the exercise of the right to fix wages where, by reason of the &lt;lis - pute, there had been a failure to fix by agreement, it would simply serve to show the nature and character of the regulation essential to protect the public right and safeguard the movement of interstate commerce, not involving any denial of the authority to adopt it. "And this leaves only to be generally considered whether the right to exercise such a power under the conditions which existeW was limited or restrained by the private rights of the carriers or their employees. "(a) As to the carrier. — As engaging in the business of in - terstate commerce carriage subjects the carrier to the lawful power of Congress to regulate irrespective of the source whence the carrier draws its existence, and as also, by engaging in a business charged with a public interest, all the vast property and every right of the carrier become subject to the authority to regulate possessed by Congress to the extent that regulation may be exerted, considering the subject regulated and what is appropriate and relevant thereto, it follows that the very absence of the scale of wages by agreement, and the impediment and destruction of interstate commerce which was threatened called for the appropriate and relevant remedy, — the creation of a standard by operation of law, binding upon the carrier. "(b) As to the employee. — Here again it is obvious that what we have previously said is applicable and decisive, since whatever would be the right of an employee engaged in a private business to demand such wages as he desires, to leave the employment if he does not get them, and, by concert of action, to agree with others to leave upon the same condition, such rights are necessarily subject to limitation when employment is accepted in a business charged with a public interest and as to which the power to regulate commerce possessed by Congress applied, and the resulting right to fix, in case of disagreement and dispute, a standard of wages, as we have seen, necessarily obtained." By Justice McKenna: "I speak only on intention; of the power I have no doubt. When one enters into interstate commerce, one enters into a service in which the public has an interest, and subjects one's self to its be - hests. And this is no limitation of liberty; it is the consequence of liberty exercised, the obligation of his undertaking, and con - strains no more than any contract constrains. The obligation of a con - tract is the law under which it is made, and submission to regulation is the condition which attaches to one who enters into or accepts employment in a business in which the public has an interest." The authority of Congress over interstate commerce is derived from the constitutional provision giving it power "to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian tribes". The court has held in a long line of decisions, beginning with Gibbons vs. Ogden, 9 Wheaton (22 U. S.) 189; 6 Law ed. 68, that the power of the Federal government over interstate commerce is "complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent and acknowledges no limitations, other than are prescribed in the constitution". Broadly speaking, the people of the state of Nebraska have the same </seg>
            <seg id="p164">164 power over intrastate traffic that congress exercises over interstate traffic. There are exceptions, but it is not necessary to note them here. The language of Wilson vs. New, therefore, is just as applicable to this case as it was to the case in which it was applied. As stated above, the exercise of the authority possessed by the people of this state is vested by the constitutional amendment in the State Railway Commission. It is fundamental that a carrier must perform the service it has undertaken; that it cannot at its option abandon its service because it is no longer profitable or because it might be otherwise more advan - tageous to the carrier to abandon it. A willful failure to render the service lays the carrier liable to mandamus and being persisted in sub - jects it to a forfeiture of its charter. State vs. Sioux City &amp; Pacific, 7 Neb. 357; Herpelsheimer Co. vs. L. T. Co., 97 Neb. 113. Gates vs. B. A N. Y. Air Line R. Co., 53 Conn. 333 In Wilson vs. New, supra, it is said: (p. 302) "Clear also is it that an obligation rests upon a carrier to carry on its business, and that conditions of cost or other obstacles afford no excuse and exempt from no responsibility which arises from a failure to do so, and also that government possesses the full reg - ulatory power to compel performance of such duty." tin this state a carrier cannot discontinue a part of its service with - the permission of the Railway Commission. In Herpolsheimer Co. Lincoln Traction Co., 96 Neb. 154, the court uses this language: "The power to regulate the rates of common carriers would be incomplete and comparatively useless without the corresponding power to regulate the service, and control the common carrier in performing such service, and these powers arc expressly given to the state railway commission by the terms of the constitution, and the statute enacted thereunder. It seems clear that these provisions prevent the defendant from making such changes (abandonments! ir the service without first obtaining the authority of the state rail - way commission so to do." Taking the duty of the carrier to render the public uninterrupted service as established and keeping it clearly in mind that the power of the state will quickly be brought to bear upon any carrier failing in that respect, by what process of reasoning can it be concluded that any body of persons by concerted action may bring about a condition in which it becomes impossible for the carrier to obey the law and perform its duties to the public? It is the duty of the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway company to render service as a carrier to the public of the city of Omaha. Can the employees of the company who have undertaken equally with the stockholders of the company to serve the people of that city lawfully agree to strike — to leave en masse and thus paralyze the </seg>
            <seg id="p165">165 industries and social organization of a great center because they are not receiving what they consider a suitable wage ? The state has provided a tribunal for the adjustment of wage diffi - culties and there is no occasion for the settlement of such difficulties other than by resort to it. In short, there is no place for a strike in the public economy of a state that has provided for regulation. This view is wholly consistent with the right of employees to leave the company as individuals. The company passes upon the merits of each individual as he is taken into the service. The employer cannot secure its employees collectively, but must secure them individually, assigning them to the respective departments and positions to which they are best adapted. Those who prove themselves meritorious are promoted to more responsible positions and thus an efficient and unified organiza - tion is built up. It is no great loss to the company and does not disturb its working power when an individual drops out of the service. Adjust - ments are readily made and there is no appreciable injury. But when the employees form themselves into an organization and quit work as a unit, the public service is totally disrupted regardless of the high stand - ard of efficiency prior to the strike and the public suffers until the com - pany has had time to reorganize and develop a new working body and gradually build up the service anew- That the employees of the company in this instance have invoked the jurisdiction of the Commission to settle the controversy between them and the company is a recognition of the fact that the people have the power to adjust these matters and that they have created a tribunal for that purpose, and we have every confidence that the decision of the Commission will be received as a final determination by all parties ex - cept so far as they may desire to exercise their right of appeal. With the foregoing considerations concerning the law in view, the Commission entered upon the hearing. The complainants offered a large amount of testimony as to the working force required to conduct the operations of the company; that there was a lack of men owing to the smallness of the wages paid by the company; that the present em - ployees could not afford to remain in service at the wage schedule now in effect; that they could secure better paying positions elsewhere, and that while they did not wish to leave the service of the company they would do so unless the wages were increased. There were also persist - ent efforts on the part of the complainants to show what was required to meet living expenses in the city of Omaha. As above stated, the Commission consistently refused to consider that subject and when fin - ally it was presented to the Commission by counsel for the complainants, in such form as to require a positive and final ruling, the Commission restated the position it had taken prior to the opening of the case that it would not enter into a general wage hearing or consider collateral economic questions. Thereupon the complainants moved the CommU- </seg>
            <seg id="p166">166 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT sion to dismiss the complaint and discontinue the cause. A protracted argument ensued. The complainants presented at great length the grounds of their motion. The company, through its attorney, expressed its willingness to have the motion sustained and the action dismissed, and complainants urged as a matter of law they were entitled to a dismissal. They relied on section 7654 of the Revised Statutes of Ne - braska for 1913, as giving the absolute right to dismiss. That section refers to the dismissal of an action by the plaintiff. It is sufficient to say that this proceeding is in the hands of the Commission at all times because of the public interest involved and is not subject to con - trol by the parties. The Commission overruled the motion. The complainants had made a prima facie showing that the wages were inadequate to secure operatives for the company; that the service had already become impaired and that it would very likely be suspended. It would be strange indeed if a regulatory body with such facts before it would allow the proceeding to be dismissed and the public service to be disrupted simply because the complainants had concluded that they did not care to go on with the case. If the Commission had jurisdic - tion to enter upon the investigation at all, of which it has no doubt, it was certain that such investigation should be completed. It therefore proceeded to call witnesses upon its own motion and to hear the testi - mony of the defendant company. The complainants, although disclaim - ing responsibility for the further conduct of the case, requested that certain witnesses be called and such witnesses were called; they cross - •xamined and otherwise participated in the hearing. The testimony is very voluminous and anything like a summary of it would extend this opinion beyond reasonable limits. It will there - fore be confined to a statement of the conclusions at which we have ar - rived and of the more important facts upon which they are based. It should be said that the testimony has all been carefully re-examined by the Commission since the close of the hearing. The company employs motormen and conductors, together, to the number of 858, and 420 persons in other branches of the service, making a total of 1278 in all departments, not including the accounting and clerical force and the general officers. This represents an increase of thirteen per cent in the operating force of the company in the past year. The company secures its help from almost all walks of life. A tabulation prepared by the defendant shows that a large number of trades and businesses are represented among the employees. The lar - ger numbers, however, come from the farms and from the smaller towns and from among those engaged in general labor. The time of train - ing being short, the service offers an easy means of changing from rural to urban life and it is therefore attractive to many young men in the country districts. The change of the personnel of the company, or as it is termed in the evidence the "turn over", is very large. During 1918 the company employed more men than it had in its employ at </seg>
            <seg id="p167">167 any one time during that year. This was owing chiefly to war condi - tions. A greater stability is shown in the body of the employees at the present time, probably not over fifty per cent of the men leaving the employ of the company in one year. It is among the newer men that most of the resignations and discharges take place. The service of the trainmen is not as stable as that of those employed in the mechani - cal departments of the company. The service of the trainmen, like that in all other fields of labor, has some advantages and some dis - advantages. The work of the trainmen is not heavy, but the hours are long. It is also clean and healthful, but at times is trying on the nerves and the greatest service is required at hours when most men de - sire release from work. The greatest objection is perhaps that, as stated by the secretary of the company, "street car men work while other men play". They are required to work during evenings, on Sun - days, and on holidays, and a great many of them find the service irk - some on that account. An investigation shows that not a great many of the men who have left the service of the company have assigned smallness of pay as the reason for leaving, although some have done so. In general, the service of the company is of a high standard. It now operates a larger number of cars, with a greater mileage, than at any previous time in its history. It also has upon its pay roll a lar - ger number of men than ever before, and at present there is no lack of men. Considerable testimony was adduced to show that it was difficult for men to secure leaves of absence, but that is a condition that always prevails unless the number of extra men is so large as un - duly to reduce the number of hours during which the extra man can have employment. It is a matter of great difficulty to arrange the runs and the hours for so large U number of trainmen and it is extremely difficult to keep just the proper number of extra men on duty so that they will have a reasonable amount of employment and yet not endanger the service in case of absence of a number of regular men. The company has recent - ly l-ept a record of the number of its applicants for positions as train - men and it is now averaging something like ten a day. These appli - cations were received without advertising and without special effort. At the present time the company has a much larger number of men to select fj-om than formerly and it is now able to follow its rules as to 1 equ:rements, which it was not able to do during the labor shortage of the war period. In fact, it is daily turning away many applicants who have the required qualifications. The trainmen are now receiving from fifty-three cents to fifty-seven cents per hour, according to length of service. When an inexperienced man applies, for work as a motorman or conductor, he is given two weeks in which to learn the service required of platform men. During this so-called "student period" he is paid at the rate of $1.00 per day. </seg>
            <seg id="p168">j HiR T r.hA I H ANNL&lt;AJ-&lt; KLrUKl 168 Those who have had prior experience, if they have not been out of service too long, do not have to devote as much as two weeks, but all, whether experienced or inexperienced, are required to go through a training period. At the end of the period, if the man is found to be acceptable, he is given work as an extra man. The extra men operate the extra cars during rush hours, and cars that are not moved at regular intervals, such as those for excursions, picnics and other gatherings. They also take the place of those regular men who are absent. The pay for the first three monl*is is fifty-three cents per hour. After three months the employee receives fifty-five cents per hour and at the end of the first year fifty-seven cents per hour. There is also a provision for pensioning employees who have rendered long service, but as the system is comparatively new and has not yet had time to make itself felt to any great extent, it will not be mentioned further. The evidence shows that 720 men worked twenty-five days or more during the month of May, 1920. Of these, 652 earned, on the average, 1155.53 for the month, the highest being $204.98. The remaining 68 of the 720 worked twenty-five days or more, but a lesser number of hours per day and received on the average $125.15. The average wages earned by the 720 men were $152.66 for the month. The rest of the trainmen, 138 in number, worked less than twenty-five days, some of them working only one or two days and some of them working very short hours. The 138 included a large number of new men as well as those who left the service during the month and others who were ill or otherwise detained a part of the time from their work, and some who were performing other employment along with their service in the company. The average earned by all trainmen for the month of May, regardless of the number of days or the number of hours worked, was $140.17. It is a fair statement to say that those who were experienced and who worked faithfully during twenty-six days of the month and a reasonable number of hours per day, received on the average upwards of $150. It should be added in this connection that the wages of trainmen have been more than doubled from August 1, 1914, to this time. To be exact, they have increased on the average 114.98 per cent. The wages of the other employees of the company have been increased in about the same proportion. These figures should be considered in con - nection with the increase of thirteen per cent in the operating force for the year 'ending June 1, 1920, as compared with the year ending re 1, 1919, and that the total number of employees now is the great - in the history of the company. Under the holding of the Commission that it has jurisdiction to require the company to pay a sufficient wage to secure competent men, it becomes necessary to consider how the wages paid to its employees compare with the wages paid to other employees in the city of Omaha </seg>
            <seg id="p169">169 whose occupations are comparable with those of the company's em - ployees in skill, responsibility and effort required. A considerable number of witnesses examined during the hearing had been employed in other vocations and stated what they had received therein. The company made an exhaustive study of wage conditions in Omaha and presented evidence showing the results of such study. The Commission was not thoroughly satisfied and made an independent study of its own of wage conditions in the city. From all of these sources we find that wages in Omaha are as stated below. It must be understood, of course, that there are rather wide variations, but we state what seems to be a fair average in each instance. Teamsters are employed at from $20 to $28 per week. The stand - ard wage appears to be about $27 per week. They usually work nine hours per day with a half holiday on Saturday during the summer months, no Sunday work. Truckman's pay runs from $23 to $31 per week, some of them working eight hours per day and others nine hours per day with Sat - urday afternoon off during the summer. This applies to such con - cerns as coal merchants, lumber dealers, and companies engaged in regular teaming or warehouse business. The standard wage for truck drivers in these lines of employment appears to be about $118 per month. Those who drive small trucks average about $106 per month. The drivers of the large express trucks, who have considerable responsibility in handling express matter and who put in part time on Sunday, reach as much as $150 per month. The creameries ' employ truck drivers who not only operate truck?, bul are also salesmen. They get $27 a week plus a commission which amounts to about $3 per week on the average. It is possible for such a truck driver to make as much as $35 per week. Drivers for milk cempanies work on a commission. Their pay varies f-om $125 to $160 per month. The highest amount earned on any route is $200 per month. This includes soliciting and selling, as well as delivering the milk. The work starts extremely early in the mcrn - ing and is very arduous and runs seven days per week. Truck drivers for ice companies earn from $110 to $120 per month. Route ice drivers are paid $125 per month. They usually have helpers receiving $100 per month. They work from nine to eleven hours per day in the summer and from six to nine hours during the winter. Taxi clrivc-rs are guaranteed $21 to $25 per week, on a ten hour day. including Sundays. The commission paid varies with the differ - ent drivers. The actual amount received is from $30 to $35 per week. Employees of the fire department receive $100 per month for the first year; $110 per month for the second year; and $140 per month thereafter. Captains in the fire department receive from $150 to Sl€'£ per month. ~ —^^^ </seg>
            <seg id="p170">170 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT L Policemen are paid $125 per month for the first year; $135 per th for the next six months; and $140 per month thereafter. Police sergeants have a salary of $160 per month. They work eight houi s a day and have one day off per month with a ten day furlough each year with pay. Mail carriers will receive after July 1, 1920, $1,400 per year for the first year with an increase of $100 per year until $1800 is reached. They work eight hours a day and generally get two weeks vacation with pay. Men in charge of gasoline and oil stations earn from $90 to $95 per month. Some companies allow $110 per month, but require their men to work seven days a week. I Retail grocery clerks are paid from $25 to $35 per week, working nine houi day except Saturday, which is ten hours. Bank clerks receive from $80 to $140 per month for an eight hour day. Bank tellers receive from $120 to $185 per month. Much testimony was adduced as to the earnings of men engaged in skilled crafts. They usually require long apprenticeships and the conditions of employment are so different and the work varies so much with seasons, weather, financial conditions, etc., that a comparison can hardly be made. The lines of work above mentioned are the most nearly comparable with that of the trainman, all things considered, that could be found. No average can be struck among all of the different lines of work named. Only two or three of them reach the level en - joyed by the street car employees. The testimony shows that men are continually leaving other employments, including some of those mention - ed above, to engage in street car work. We cannot, therefore, say that the wage paid by the defendant company is not sufficient to attract suitable men and the fact that its lists are now full is evidence that they are coming in sufficient numbers. It also follows that if the pay of the street car employees is to be raised, the operating expenses will be correspondingly increased, all of which in turn must be met by an increased fare. To give increased wages to the street car employees would be to subtract that much from the income of those engaged in other lines of labor in the city of Omaha, and who are now getting, on the average, a smaller wage than are the employees of this company. The company should be allowed by the Commission to charge the public only such a rate of fare as will enable it to furnish proper ser - vice. This, of course, includes a wage that will keep in its employ an adequate number of men sufficiently qualified to carry on the work. When the men receive the wage that is offered generally for like ser - vice and the company has properly maintained its facilities, set aside sufficient reserves and paid a fair return to its stockholders, the sur - plus, if any, should and must stand for the use and benefit of the rate- </seg>
            <seg id="p171">171 paying public. The Commission has no right to allow this surplus to be encroached upon either by the stockholders or by the employees. The evidence does not sustain the allegations of the complaint that the wages are inadequate and it should be dismissed. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE CONSIDERED AND ORDERED by the Ne - braska State Railway Commission that the complaint of Ben A. Short, et al., against Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway Company be and the same hereby is dismissed. Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 18th day of August, 1920 NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION (Signed) H. G. Taylor, Chairman ATTEST: (Signed) John E. Curtiss, Secretary. &lt;SEAL) BROWNE, Commissioner. Concurring: I concur in the conclusions of the majority on the facts presented, but find myself unable to agree to part of the conclusions of law. The controlling opinion in this case reaches the conclusion that men engaged in the public service do not have the right to strike, basing that position in the main on the now celebrated decision of the supreme court of the United States in Wilson vs. New, upholding the Adamson Act of 1916. The decision is readily subject to such an interpretation. However, at the very time that decision was rendered there stood on the federal statutes an act which specifically permitted employee "singly or in concert" to quit employment and "recommending, advis - ing, or persuading others by peaceful means to do so'' (Clayton Anti- Trust Act. Sec. 20.) And the Nebraska supreme court, more than a year after the Adamson decision, found that "In the absence of a contract for a fixed term of employment, employees have a right to refuse to work, if they believe such re - fusal will aid them in accomplishing 1 such objects (raise their gen - eral standard of living), and for that purpose, in a legal and proper manner, they have a right to persuade other workmen to cease work, or to employ other legal means which will aid them in attain - ing their end" State vs. Employers of Labor, 130 Neb.: 786. No exception was made in the Clayton Act or in the decision of the Nebraska court concerning the public service. The majority read in the decision of Wilson vs. New a distinct difference in the mind of the courts where the service is of a public nature. Such a destine- </seg>
            <seg id="p172">172 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT tion should exist. Unfortunately, such prohibition is not provided by Nebraska law in my opinion. Were the law to provide that it is illegal for those engaged in the public service to strike, there must be provided some adequate tribunal before which all questions of dispute between employers and employees might be brought. The majority sees in the constitutional amend - ment creating this Commission, and court interpretations of that a - mendment, the existence of just such a body. But the opinion of the majority, and the taking of testimony during the hearing, were pre - dicated upon the conclusion that the Commission had authority only to insure a continuance of the public service, with competent and suffi - cient employes, and the payment of such wages as would bring this to pass. This eliminated the most important factor, in the opinion of the workmen, in dispute, i. e. the maintainance of a proper American stand - ard of living. I am now fully of the opinion that no adequate or satisfying solu - tion of wages disputes can be had which does not take into account this question. The employes took the position that this Commission is amply clothed with power to investigate the cost of living and to re - quire the payment to them cf such wages as will insure a proper Amer - ican standard of living. They were much disappointed that the Com - mission did not interpret the law in the same way. I am in full accord with the ruling of the Commission when the hearing was begun that it lacked authority to investigate the cost of living and refused to take testimony on the matter. The proper stand - ard of living is just as important to other workmen as it is to those in the public service. Did the people of the state, in adopting the Com - mission amendment propose to protect that standard for employees of common carriers, and ignore the vast majority of workmen in other lines? Such an assumption would be necessary if the wider interpre - tation of the Commission's power is accepted. Take the conclusion of the majority opinion that those engaged in the public service have no legal right to strike, and one may reason from such a conclusion that the state had in consequence created a proper tribunal to settle contro - versies which in other businesses might lead to strikes. How then are we to reconcile the situation of workmen in gas, water, and electric plants, who are just as vitally engaged in the public service as are the employees of common carriers, yet for whom no similar tribunal has been created as that assumed in the Railway Commission? I There is other evidence that the Commission went at least as far its powers permitted in making this wage investigation. In pass - the law creating the state board of mediation and investigation with limited powers the Nebraska legislature made no exception con - cerning workmen engaged in public service. In attempting to enlarge certain powers of the Commission in general terms the legislature of 1919 (Session Laws 1919, Chap. 257) expressly stated that as to the </seg>
            <seg id="p173">173 subject matter of that act (railroads) such increased powers were not to be interpreted as extending to relations between employers and em - ployes. In submitting the proposed constitution the recent conven - tion in its article on the industrial court did not make an exception which would indicate its thought that the State Railway Commission already has wide powers in wages disputes where the public service of carriers is affected. There is nothing conclusive in these illustra - tions, but, they seem to me to have weight where the question of ex - tent of jurisdiction is a close one. All the above considerations lead to the conclusion, that no proper tribunal now exists for the settlement of all disputes between employ - ers and employes where the public service is involved and if such tri - bunal is lacking it seems an impossible conclusion that employes of public utilities have by engaging voluntarily in such business thereby surrendered the right to quit work collectively if peaceably. I think we are fast approaching a time when the law will prohibit strikes, at least in the public service, but there must accompany it an adequate method of settling all such disputes as now result in strikes and great economic waste. As to the conclusions of fact from the testimony no other result is obtainable than that using the measure applied by the Commission, an increase of wages is not at this time necessary to secure an adequate supply of competent men. This conclusion also disposes of the im - mediate question of a rate advance to the company. FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 410 AND INFORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 5703 CONSOLIDATED Village of Laurel, Complainant. vs. Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway Co., Defendant Appearances: For Complainant — B. Ready, Attorney; George A. Wright, Village clerk. For Defendant — E. C. Blundell, division superintendent; Robert D Nealy, assistant attorney. HALL, Commissioner: The two cases consolidated came on for hearing at 10 o'clock a. m., October 29, 1920, at Laurel. The town of Laurel is located southeast, wrath and southwest of the intersection of the C. St. P. M. &amp; O. and C. B. &amp; Q. railroad companies' lines. The C. B. &amp; Q. line extends tangent almost east and west on the north side and the C. St. P M. &amp; O. on the northeast side of the town. </seg>
            <seg id="p174">174 6 east and west streets are numbered from the north tu the south, nning on the north with "First" street, which is parallel and ad - nt to the south line of the C. B. &amp; Q, railroad company's depot grounds. "Second" street is the main or business street. The streets running north and south are named from the east to the west, "Pine", "Cedar", "Oak", "Elm" etc. The location of the C. B. &amp; Q station is at the north end of Oak, and that of the C. St. P. M. &amp; 0. at the east end of Second street. The federal administration consolidated the business of the two roads into the C. St. P. M. &amp; O. depot, and moved the building northeast to the intersection of the two roads, which is at the north end of Cedar street. The town then proceeded to pave its business streets and, in doing so, paved Second street east to its intersection with the depot grounds of the C. St. P. M. &amp; O., where the depot was originally located. It also paved Cedar street north from its intersection with Second street to the consolidated depot. When the roads were turned over by the federal administration to their respec - tive owners, the C. B. &amp; Q. moved back into its own depot and the C. St. P. M. &amp; O. moved its depot back to its original location, out of which arises this complaint, the prayer being to maintain and operate a consolidated station at the point of intersection of the two railroads, which is at the north end of Cedar street. LThe complainants allege and testify that about $15,000 were spent paving north Cedar street to the depot, which would not have been le had not the town been assured that the location of the depot was permanent The testimony is also to the effect that the pavement is practically useless with the depots back at their old locations. We are of the opinion that the town of Laurel has no vested interest, or right, in the location of a depot by reason of the fact that it paved its street to that location. The town, however, could have been reasonably sure as to location of the depots had it brought an action before the Commission, it having jurisdiction of such matters, and had the loca - tion permanently settled before it paved. The question to be determined is of course what will best serve the traffic, everything being considered. The present location of the C. St. P. M. A O. depot at the end of the business street is practically in the center of all of the industries upon the depot grounds. The water station is located just east of the depot, at a proper distance, to be used as a filling station when passenger trains are stopped at the depot. Just east of the water station is an elevator; further east the stockyards and several other industries. West of the depot is another elevator, and still other industries. The Burlington station is located at the north end of Oak street, which is a block west of the intersection of the two railroads and a block, plus the width of the depot grounds, north of the real business center of the town. Most of the station facilities are west of the depot, a part of them being located between the depot and the intersection of the two roads. If the depots were continued to be consolidated and located at the intersection, the depot would be </seg>
            <seg id="p175">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 175 at the extreme east of all of its tracks and depot facilities, while for the C. St. P. M. &amp; O. it would be at the northwest end of all of its industries. This, of course, would result in a great inconvenience to both roads, so far as the operation of their own business is concerned. If there were a great amount of transferring done at that point from one road to the other of course the necessity of the consolidated sta - tion would immediately arise, but that is not complained of. So far as the patrons of the roads are concerned who live in and around Lau - rel, we can see that it makes no difference to them whether they go to a union station to take a train or to a station on the tracks of the par - ticular line that they intend to travel on. We do see, however, that it makes a very great difference for a stockshipper, who loads his stock at the yards and then has to go to the extreme end of the industry track in order to bill his stock out. It certainly takes no argument to see that a depot, located at about the center point of all industries on its line can render service to its patrons more efficiently than if the depot were located at one end of all its industry tracks. The present location of the Burlington station on the average is a little closer to the business center than the location of the consolidated depot. The old location of the C. St. P. M. &amp; O., which is at the east end of the business street, is about 170 feet further from the inter - section of Cedar street with Second street than the new location is from that point. Of course, as you go farther east on Second street from the intersection of Cedar with Second, the business men become closer to the old location of the C. St. P. M. &amp; 0. than they are to the new location. We can see that if all tracks were to be rearranged and the two railroads were run on the north hide of the town, parallel to each other and all industries and businesses arranged according to the new arrang - ment of the tracks, a union station could be established which might enable the companies to handle their business more efficiently and with less expense, but we must take conditions as we find them and, in look - ing over the entire situation, we are sure that no one would contend that all team tracks, industry tracks, depots, depot facilities and industries located thereon should be rearranged so that the business might be properly and efficiently handled by one consolidated station. This all would be very ideal, but the realization of which cannot be hoped for. We are of the opinion, and so find, that the complaint should be dismissed. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE CONSIDERED, ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the complaint herein should be and the same is hereby dismissed. Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 18th day of Novem - ber, 1920. </seg>
            <seg id="p176">176 NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION H. G. Taylor, Chairman Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 411. Arthur M. Miller et al. Complainants, vs. Union Pacific Railroad Company, Defendant. OPINION AND FINDING HALL, Commissioner: Holmesville, Gage county, Nebraska, is located on the high land adjacent to the east side of the Blue river The main highway on the section line leading into town from the west crosses a wide bottom on the west side of the river, thence over a steel and cement bridge across the river. The west end of the bridge is apparently on the section line but it extends across the river in a southeasterly direction, which throws the east end of the bridge south of the line. Upon leaving the bridge the road takes a northeasterly direction up a steep bluff which ex - tends up to the river at this point For a distance of several rods the road cuts through the point of the bluff and leaves a bank of earth on the north side considerably above the road. Below the bridge there is a :1am, on the east wing of which there is a water power house. About one hundred feet east of the power house and on the south side of the public road a mill is located. The Union Pacific railroad track is located on the east bank of the river at this point and crosses the highway thirty feet east of the east end of the bridge and passes between the power house and the mill. The intersection of the railroad with the public road at this point is the crossing complained of. LThe railroad depot is located several blocks north of this crossing on what appears to be the low bottom land of the river, as over - flow water from the river floods the track and depot when the rise of water is approximately four feet above its normal height. The rail - road track extends south of the depot on the low bottom ground for several hundred feet, where it takes a 1.1 per cent ascending grade along the side of the bluff. At the crossing it cuts through the nose of the bluff and about 1500 feet south of the crossing reaches the summit of the hill. On the east side of the railroad adjacent to the crossing and on the north side of the public road the bluff rises sharply above the railroad track between twenty and thirty feet. The land then rises </seg>
            <seg id="p177">177 gradually to the east until the level of the town is reached. The pub - lic highway bridge was originally constructed three feet higher than it now is, which was five feet six inches above the railroad track. This left a drop-off from the bridge to the railroad track, a distance of thirty feet, of five feet six inches. Later the county lowered the bridge three feet to its present height. This leaves the bridge thirty inches above the railroad track. On the east the public highway immediately takes its ascent up the hill at the east end of the ties at the crossing. This leaves the railroad track in a trough between the bridge an&lt;l the hill. The things complained of are the trough or low dropping in the public highway between the east end of the bridge and the hill and the fact that the bank of earth between the public highway and the rail - road in the northeast angle of the intersection cuts off the view of ap - proaching trains from the north from the public road. The highway is one of heavy country traffic. Forty school chil - dren are carried over it morning and evening in two motor buses. The testimony is that serious accidents have been barely averted at the crossing. Automobiles, trucks, tractors, threshing machines and other heavy farm traffic is apt to get stalled on the track, because it is be - low the bridge and the rise from the track to the bridge begins at the west side of the track. If the track were made level with the floor of the bridge, all traffic in going down the hill to the west would pass easily over it and the danger therefrom would be greatly lessened. It is true the company has installed a wigwag and bell since the filing of this case. The in - stallation of the wigwag and bell is one of the precautions that should be taken, but nevertheless it does not furnish adequate relief from the real trouble at this particular crossing. The complaint was filed by Mr. Miller and his associates primarily for the purpose of protecting the public traveling on the highway. During the progress of the in - vestigation it became apparent from the evidence in the record and from a personal inspection of the crossing by the Commission that the condition of the crossing made the operation of trains over it very haz - ardous. Owing to its low level the track is inundated during periods of high water, a stream flowing through the trough at such times. This occurs even before the water is high enough to leave the river and spread out over the bottom west of the bridge; the descent from the east is so rapid that it would be almost impossible to stop an auto or truck ap - proaching the track from the east if the ground were slippery from snow, ice or mud; the trough is so narrow that if an automobile or a truck were to become stalled on the railroad track it would be out of the question to move it out by hand. The last mentioned hazard is greatly increased by reason of the down grade of the railroad from the south and the curve in it almost fifteen hundred feet south of the crossing. If a collision were to occur between the train and such ve - hicle it would very likely result in derailment of the train, as it would </seg>
            <seg id="p178">178 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT be hard to throw the vehicle out of the depression and clear of the tracks. If the track were raised it would reduce the danger of operation, as it would remove the trough and would decrease the percent of grade from the south. It would also reduce the descent of the highway - coming from the east. All of these considerations impel us to find that the railroad track should be raised to a level at least as high as the floor of the bridge. We are also of the opinion, and so And, that the bank of earth referred to above, which extends down from the bluff and cuts off the view of the track on the north side of the high - way, should be removed for a distance of 150 feet back from the inter - section of the railroad with the highway, so that the view of the rail - road track to the north from the public highway may be uninterrupted ORDER tIT IS THEREFORE CONSIDERED AND ORDERED that the in Pacific Railroad Company, defendant herein, raise its track at crossing under consideration to a level at least as high as the of the public highway bridge, above mentioned, and that it remove the bank of earth lying within the right-of-way in the northeast angle of the intersection of the railroad with the public highway at that point for a distance of 150 feet northeasterly from the intersection, so that the view of the railroad track to the north may be uninterrupted from the public highway for that distance. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the defendant shall comply with the order herein within six months from the date hereof. Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 30th day of Decem - ber, 1920.

            <seg id="p179">179 complaint the Commission had an inspection, inventory and valuation of the properties made by the engineering department of the Commis - ssion. The report of the engineering department shows that the prop - erties were in such a depreciated condition that it would be impossible for the company to render adequate service to its patrons. The Com - mission then issued an order upon the company to show cause why its service should not be brought up to a higher standard, which was made and entered on the 16th day of August, 1919. An exhaustive hearing was then held as to service on October 7, 1919. The Commission now finds that the complaint as to service was justified and that it was necessary to bring about a great improvement in the properties before adequate service could be rendered. The com - pany then filed application for an increase in rates, admitting that the service was poor, but alleging that it was impossible to maintain it.s properties to a standard at which adequate service could be rendered. After a thorough investigation as to rates, the Commission found that the revenues were not sufficient to properly maintain the properties and operate them. Following the hearing as to service and rates, the com - pany installed a new switchboard at Stella and has worked over the en - tire office equipment. The old operators have been discharged and a family employed to take charge of the central office, with living rooms on the same floor with the telephone exchange. The company is also working over its lines, which promises to bring them up to an adequate service efficiency. The Commission believes that all of the work in pro - gress, together with that that has been accomplished, will bring about a condition of service which will reasonably satisfy the complainant and that it will not require a further order as to service. The Commission is therefore of the opinion that the complaint should be dismissed without prejudice to the complainant; that is, when the work of rehabilitating the properties has been completed, if the service is not reasonably satisfactory the complaint may be renewed. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the complaint herein and the order to show cause be dismissed. Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 2nd day of August, 1920.

(SEAL) INFORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 5393 John Aahford et aL, Complainants, vs. Matheny Telephone Company, Defendant. </seg>
            <seg id="p180">180 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT OPINION AND FINDING By The Commission: LThis is a complaint against the Matheny Telephone company, which exchanges at Walthill, Winnebago, and Rosalie. It is directed against the service at Winnebago and is signed by 32 out of the 95 subscribers of the company at that place. It was filed September 3, 1919. The gist of the complaint is as follows: That long distance calls are unduly delayed; that repairs to telephones are not promptly made, leav - ing them out of service for long periods; that local service is frequently suspended; that there is no service between ten o'clock p. m. and seven o'clock a. m., and no service on Sunday afternoons; that installations are not promptly made when ordered and that the service actually ren - dered is very unsatisfactory and far belcw the ordinary standard. tThe Commission ordered its engineering department to make a &gt;ical valuation of the company's property. All three plants were idered "by the engineering department and report was duly made. The matter was called to the attention of the company and promises were repeatedly made that the necessary expenditures would be made to put the company's property in proper condition. Nothing was done and finally the matter was set down for hearing on November 24, 1919, at which time a hearing was held at Winnebago. Notice was served by the Commission upon Mr. Matheny, the owner of the company, who lives at Wayne, and a copy of the complaint was mailed to him, which seems never to have been received. At the time of the hearing Mr. Matheny stated that as he had not received a copy of the complaint he asked to make answer orally. The request was granted and Mr. H. E. Walker made a statement on behalf of the company, answering the complaint. The answer is as follows: That the delay in toll calls was half due to the inefficiency of the operator of the company, and half to the poor toll facilities furnished by the Nebraska Telephone company, over whose lines most of the long distance calls are transmitted; that that was particularly true between Winnebago and Sioux City, where most of the long distance calls destinate; the second charge that telephones were not promptly repaired was only partially denied, in fact, it was tacitly admitted; the same was true of the third count of the complaint that local service was frequently interrupted, and of the fourth count that there was no service between ten o'clock p. m. and seven o'clock a. in. In answer to the fifth count that installations were not furnished as requested, it was admitted the installations had accumulated and at the time the present lineman took control there were some forty or fifty orders ahead and that they have been taken up us fast as material could t secured. It was conceded that the service was not good, and that condition of the properties was low. The exchange at Walthill has 252 subscriber stations, that at Win - r.ebago 95, and that at Rosalie 104. They are all under the ownership </seg>
            <seg id="p181">181 and management of Mr. Matheny. He employs a lineman to look after all three exchanges and as he lives at Wayne, some distance away, he gives little or no personal attention to the company, his time being fully occupied otherwise. Under the circumstances, the company has had very little supervision and things have gone, as the record shows, at loose ends. The engineer's report, as to the Winnebago exchange, shows an original construction cost of the central office equipment of $349, which was in a thirty per cent condition. Subscriber stations equipment cost originally $1,447.25 and was in a fifty per cent condition. The distribution system was in a fifty-four per cent condition. The total figures show an original cost of $5243.90 in an average condition of forty-six per cent. Owing to the small - ness of the company and the unfortunate position in which Mr. Matheny, the owner, has been placed, the Commission has hesitated to act as it would otherwise, especially as he has promised from time to time to put the property in proper condition. The subscribers have again filed a complaint and urged the Commission to take immediate action. All of the allegations of the complaint were fully proven at the hearing, and in fact were practically admitted by Mr. Matheny and his employes. It would serve no useful purpose to review the testimony in detail, but numerous and specific instances were given in substantiation of each charge in the complaint. The evidence shows that conditions are in - tolerable and that action must be taken without delay. At the close of the hearing and at the suggestion of the commissioner who presided, Mr. Matheny stated for the record that he would spend at least $1000 .,n the rehabilitation of the properties at Winnebago and that he would make a detailed report to the Commission of the amount of money spent and on what particular lines and that he would require weekly reports from his general manager, copies of which were to be sent to the Com - mission. A? he has wholly failed to spend the amount of money specified and has done practically nothing to rehabilitate the plant, the service remains as poor and unsatisfactory as ever. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE CONSIDERED AND ORDERED by the Ne - braska State Railway Commission that the Matheny Telephone company, defendant, proceed at once to the rehabilitation of its properties at Winnebago, Nebraska; that the exchange there located and all of the lines in connection therewith be put in good operating condition, in not less than seventy per cent condition; that the service be improved and that continuous service at all times be furnished subscribers; that the work of such rehabilitation be begun immediately and that the proper - ties be brought to the condition herein specified on or before July 1, 1920; that reports be made weekly to the Nebraska State Railway Commis - sion Of the progress Of the work; and if proper construction is not pro - ceeded with, as herein required, the Commission institute appropriate action against the company to compel performance of this order. </seg>

(SEAL) ORDERS ON APPLICATIONS APPLICATION NO. 3308 In the matter of the Application of the Arcadia Electric Light &amp; Tele phone Company for an Increase in Telephone Rates APPEARANCES J. L. Wait, Owner. O. E. Johnson, accountant for the Commission, OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This applicant has been seeking for a very considerable period an increase in telephone rates, alleged by him to be essential to effective operation of his system. The first application for relief was made prior to the most pronounced increase in costs of labor and materials, which change in prices has accentuated whatever financial embarrassment ap - plicant suffered by reason of inadequate rates. Applicant operates an electric light plant and telephone system with the same working forces and up to the time of his original appli - cation had been very careless in keeping: the accounts of the two com - panies segregated. It was therefore impossible for the Commission to determine whether his financial disability was due to inadequate tele - phone rates or inadequate electric light rates. Applicant was directed to make the segregation covering a period sufficient to give the informa - tion, but found himself inadequate to the task. The Commission finally sent its accountant to intake a study of the books of the two companies *nd to make such segregation of expenses as appeared equitable. Applicant purchased the telephone properties in 1915 from the Sher - man County Telephone company for $14,255, of which $4,255 was paid in cash and the remainder by a mortgage against the plant. Various financial arrangements were made during the next year and a half, taking in of new partners, the selling of partnership equities, until in the spring of 1917 J. L. Wait found himself the sole owner with a debt against the plant and against himself, as owner of the plant, con - siderably in excess of the original debt, but with a small equity in the </seg>
            <seg id="p183">183 property over and above the debt, as evidenced by his payments. Since that date he has paid $2,000 on the indebtedness. This money has come out of earnings, almost all of it from wages earned, but not paid, by himself and his wife. The Commission's accountant, from a study of the accounts since ' f Mr. Wait became the sole owner, indicates that after withdrawing from k the telephone properties a house theretofore included, he had overdrawn i proper salary allowances by $600. This includes the payments on prin- cipal from earnings, but makes no allowances for any earnings on the equity, whatever it may have been over and above the indebtedness. The indebtedness at this time amounts to $13,668.81, on all of which he is paying eight per cent interest. From all the facts in the case developed at the hearing, it would appear not unreasonable to as - sume that applicant has an equity of at least $3,000 over and above the indebtedness. Upon this assumption this order will be based, pend - ing an inventory and appraisal by the Commission's engineers during the temporary life of this order. Because the Commission was of the opinion that the applicant ac - tually needed some financial assistance, and because applicant himself | did not present all of the facts in the case as clearly as seemed advis - able, the Commission had its telephone accountant reconstruct the 1919 telephone business of the company in order to ascertain the situation. Such reconstruction shows: Total operating revenue for the year, of. Operating expenses of $ 6,146.22 4,636.61 | Leaving a net operating income of $ 1,509.61 Total deduction made for taxes and interest on notes and mortgages in amount of 1,421.67 Leaving a net income with which to pay dividends on whatever equity applicant has in property, of 67.94 The expenditures for 1919 contained a maintenance account in a - mount of $1,891.42, after the books were properly reconstructed, and a depreciation reserve account of $192.97. The evidence indicated that the property actually drifted down hill during the year, many of the poles having been reset and sleet storm damage having been but tem - porarily relieved. It is our opinion more money should be spent on this property for some time in order to insure good service. Appli - cant has about four hundred subscribers and switches approximately fifty independently owned stations. He uses two day operators at $40 per month each. The Commission does not believe that this is a suf - ficient operating force to give the results needed and will suggest, with - out having gone into the question far enough to make a mandatory or - der, that applicant engage another operator for at least part time so- </seg>
            <seg id="p184">184 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT that during the two peak loads of the day two operators can work at the same time. Applicant will report on this matter not later than January 1, 1921. This will be an additional expense. Applicant owns the building which houses the business department of the electric light company, as well as the telephone central office, and has never charged rent for it. The allocation of expenses set forth above includes rent for 1919. Applicant should hereafter charge a reasonable rent on this building against revenues. The electric light company has furnished the current for central office power and has never been paid by the telephone company therefor. Proper charges should hereafter be made, based on the kilowatt consumption of current. bit will be a condition of this order that applicant shall set aside thly not less than $200, which shall be devoted exclusively to main - nce and replacements of the property, and if the exigencies of the situation require at any time some part of this fund be used for better - ments or extensions, careful record of such borrowing shall be kept and when the bette* ments and extensions are capitalized the money shall be restored to this fund for its proper purposes.

(SEAL) APPLICATIONS NOS. 3701 AND 3953 In the Matter of the Application of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company for Authority to Increase Rates. SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: Applicant herein has filed supplemental application asking for auth - ority to continue existing temporary rates for another temporary period and to make certain adjustments in both exchange and switching rates at various points specified in the application. The first order in this case was entered, effective November 1, 1918, reflecting the first advance caused by rapidly increasing costs of oper - ation. It changed the rates in a large number of exchanges but was not a horizontal increase. By its terms it was to automatically terminate May 1, 1919, unless other actions were in the meantime taken. After further hearing in April, 1919, order was entered, effective May 1, 1919, extending the then existing rates until December 31, 1919. The costs of operation continued to increase steadily and rapidly and in May, 1919, additional application was filed asking for still further adjustments, these adjustments to be applied to exchanges which, in the judgment of the company, were on a lower rate level, comparatively speaking, than financial conditions warranted. After careful hearing, order was en- </seg>
            <seg id="p188">188 t tered effective July 1, 1919, making: certain other adjustments and, Slanting: in part the prayer of the petition. This order was to term - inate December 31, 1919, coincidentally with the extension of the &amp;sder under Application No. 3701. Prior to December 31, 1919, order was' entered, effective January 1, 1920, extending the complete schedule, as then existing:, throughout the year 1920, subject to all the conditions of the preceding orders and subject also to any determinations of the Commission as result of hearings which might be ordered ad interim. tThis application for still further extension is based upon the finan - showing of the company as a result of the 1920 operations. No ring has been held on the question of extending the existing rates. The Commission has at its disposal complete monthly reports of the results of operating this extensive system for each month during the year 1920, as well as similar reports for several years preceeding. During the first eleven months of 1920 the company failed to e .r operating expenses, a reasonable amount for depreciation reserve, fixe ; charges, and five and seven per cent, respectively, on the two classe of outstanding stock, in amount of $4,397. Its net earnings amounte to 5.36 per cent on the average plant in service. In eleven months of 1919 the company earned enough to pay all the items designated above and had a remaining surplus of $12,355. The net earnings in elevert months of 1919 were at the rate of 5.47 per cent. The difference in the showing of 1920 and 1919 was due to increased cost of operation, well known not only in the public utility field but in all other business. The rates charged have not been increased since July 1919, and in so far as expense increased it had a direct effect on the net earnings. Gross revenues from all sources during eleven months of 1920 amount - ed to $3.02 per station per month. This compares with eleven month* of 1917, when the company was operating on pre-war schedules. The average earning from all sources per station was $2.37 per month. The increases then in gross revenues per station amount at this time to 27 and one half per cent over the pre-war level. Gross revenues, includ - ing growth of business increased 46 per cent in the same period. L Gross revenue from exchange service during eleven months of 1920 ounted to $2,108 per station per month. During eleven months of 1917 they amounted to $1,672 per station. The increases, therefore, over pre-war rate levels at this time on exchange service has amounted to 26 per cent. •Expenses have increased much faster. ' The net revenue per sta - tion for the first six months of 1917 was 67 1-2 cents per month; for eleven months of 1920 the net was 55.9 cents. No such showing as this could possibly have been made on a gross increase of 26 per cent in ex - change revenues had there not been considerable expansion in toll busi - mh, as well as expansion in exchange areas, without a corresponding expansion in operating costs. As it is, the figures just quoted show </seg>
            <seg id="p189">189 that the company is not in as good financial condition as it was before the war. We are bordering on a possible period of reduced costs of operation. At various times during the past two years the Commission has antici - pated reductions in costs of operation that have not materialized, be - cause similar reductions have not been possible in private business, with which the public utilities must compete both as to wages and costs of materials. The costs of operation of public utilities have decreased none yet. Wages are stationary and it is impossible to tell how soon the cosst of living will justify a reduction in wages levels. It depends on th&lt;» competitive business situation. The materials used in this public sei-vice also remain at high levels with such few exceptions as to play but small part in cost reductions. The per station cost of operation, excluding fixed charges and dividends, in November, 1920, was $2,234. The average for the year 1920 was $2,218 and for the year 1919, $2,076 pe»" station per month. These considerations lead us to the conclusion that a further tem - porary extension of time must be approved, and the Commission will direct that the company continue its present schedule until midnight June 30, 1921, unless in the meantime after proper hearing other ac - tion is taken. Relative to that part of the application which is devoted to specific exchanges and to the desire of the company to make alterations in rate levo] s in an upward direction, it is our opinion that this matter should be considered in detail, and for clarifying the record the application will be divided in two parts and that part which relates to the specific exchanges not touched upon in this order will be designated as Appli - cation No. 4489, and will be treated under that number hereafter. A hearing will be necessary on that application and a date for such hear - ing will be fixed in the very near future. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company be and it hereby is authorized, an emergency existing, to continue to charge and collect schedules of rates and charges in effect during the year 1920 until June 30, li»21, unless in the meantime after proper hearing other directions are entered by the Commission. Failing in such other ac - tion the rates at midnight, June 30, 1921, will revert to the rates in effect for exchange service existing immediately prior to November 1, 1918. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all conditions in the original or - der;-, on Application No. 3701 and Application No. 3953 and as modified by supplemental orders thereto, remain in full force and effect until June 30, 1921, except in so far as they may be legally modified by ap - propriate action in the meantime. </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3725 la the Matter of the Application of the Farmers Telephone Company of Dodge County for an Increase in Rates. SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This applicant, operating five exchanges and having approximately fourteen hundred subscribers, with free interchange offered to all sub - scribers between any and all of the exchanges, was authorized by the Commission, effective April 1, 1919, to make certain increases in rates. After carefully checking the effect of these increases, the Commission on July 1, 1919, authorized certain additional small increases for a tem - porary period terminating December 31, 1919. Because of press of work, the Commission granted a temporary extension to March 81, 1920. The case now comes before the Commission to determine whether the present scale of rates should be continued. A condition of the original orders was that certain extensive re - pairs to improve the service should be made and that applicant should not pay dividends until it had financed the repairs. No dividends ware paid in 1919. A valuation of the company's properties was found by the Commission in the original orders after extensive investigation *nd on application by the company for authority to issue a stock dividend covering the investments of dividends earned but not paid, the Com - mission authorized such stock dividend with rider attached that the com - pany as a condition thereto should sell $8,000 of stock for cash to re - plenish depreciation reserve from which funds had been borrowed for new construction. Arrangements for this financing have been complet - ed. By the close of the present year the properties of this extensive farmers' company will be in excellent operating condition. The net effect of the new financing made with the Commission's con - sent and approval was an increase in the outstanding capitalization along conservative lines, a very much lower schedule of rates than would have been required had the company's original idea been carried out. In 1919 the company earned from all sources $30,261.69 and spent for operation and maintenance, depreciation set-up, and taxes all bat $2,644.25. This amount was not sufficient to pay the dividend* at ■even per cent on capital which the Commission found proper. The reason for this was that the company paid out for maintenance al»*ost </seg>
            <seg id="p191">I 191 $4,000 more than normal maintenance would require in the opinion of the Commission. Adjustment being made for that excess expenditure shows the company with approximately a $3,000 surplus as a result of the year's operation after dividends were paid. \ The present scale of rates which the company desires to have con - tinued will produce in revenue between $30,500 and $31,000 as a revenue per annum. Certain additional expenditures for 1920 cannot be avoid - ed. The scale of wages necessary to pay operators at this time, with no prospect of reduction during the year, will require $1400 more than the expenditures in 1919. It is the company's desire and the Commis - sion's request that hereafter the company furnish all batteries which has not been the practice in the past. This will require an additional ex - penditure of $1,500 per annum. The Commission believes the schedules now in effect will not pro - duce excessive revenue and that they should be continued. The prop - erties are being carefully and conservatively managed along economical lines and the subscribers of the system are beneficiaries of that manage - ment. The company will continue to set aside on a monthly basis a fund for maintenance and depreciation equal to ten per cent of the origi - nal cost of the properties based on the Commission's valuation of 1917 plus additions and betterments made since that date. If, after all pro - per expenditures have been made and dividends have been paid, there remains a surplus, this shall be carried on the company's books as a margin of safety to be at no time capitalized, except by sales of stock against such surplus invested for the purposes of securing funds with which to meet discrepancies which might in the conduct of the business arise.

Out of thii fund shall be paid all maintenance charges, the remains to be passed to .depreciation reserve and used according to the accounting rules of thei Commission.

Curtiss, Secretary. \ APPLICATION NO. 3729 In the Matter of the Application of the Farmers &amp; Merchants Telephone company of Alma, Nebraska, for Authority to Issue Stock. SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: Under date of September 29, 1919, order was issued by this Com - mission authorizing the applicant herein to issue under certain condi - tions, stock dividends, $16,012.50 covering deferred dividends and other investments in the property which had not theretofore been capitalized. In these findings as of date January 1, 1919, the company was allowed the right to earn on the adjusted capitalization from that date. In the previous order on Application No. 2981, the Commission had found that the company had unwisely, unjudiciously and wrongfully in - vested depreciation reserve in the central office structure in Alma, there - by depriving itself and the telephone using public, of finances at that time essential to the giving of good service. It was, in that first order, directed to sell this central real estate and replace the money in the depreciation reserve for certain reconstructions found necessary. At the time of the order on the stock application, the company had not yet divorced this real estate from its holdings, hence the order author - izing the stock dividend provided that the company might turn over the central office real estate to the stockholders in lieu of the proper pro - portion of the stock dividend, but that this must not be done until the indebtedness had been funded for a period not less than ten years. Applicant filed a motion for modification of the order, alleging that it was impossible to divorce the real estate so long as it was und^r a blanket mortgage on the entire properties and that it was impossible to fund the indebtedness without leaving these very tangible proper - ties under the mortgage. It asked the authority of the Commission to leave the disputed properties in the corporation and agreed to tifrite off as a "loss", the value of the central office property and land df&gt;wn to $9,000, and to reduce the stock dividends found due the stockholders by enough to represent this charge. I In its order on Application No. 4033 by the same company, d&lt; January 16, 1920, the Commission found that the investment in central office property in addition to what was proper for corporate poses, was earning a very good rate of return and was therefore ni burden on the subscribers of the company. It did not excuse the vestment of depreciation reserve in the excess central office real ea H. G. TAYLOR, Chairman </seg>
            <seg id="p193">193 under the financial condition existing at the time the investment was made, but agreed with applicant that the correction found essential by the Commission in its original order, could only be made with serious financial results. The service deficiencies which were found in the or - der dated in 1918 to exist were relieved to a very large extent by the borrowing of money by the applicant and the reconstruction of che de - teriorated properties. Hence, this part of the real estate which is not used for corporate purposes stands now in the position it would be in had the corporation merely borrowed the money with which to construct it. The Commission does not believe it equitable to write off as a loss to stockholders any portion of the property investment to which they are entitled as found in the original order in this case. There is ample property in existence to cover all this investment and at this time the continued holding of the central office structure will not embarrass the service of the company under the conditions which will be imposed in this order. The non-essential real estate consists of a store-room i'nd a room fitted up in the basement of the exchange portion of the building, for rental purposes for social events. A revenue of approximately $600 a year is secured from this excess property which is ample to take care of the return on the proper value, to pay its share of taxes, and to set op necessary depreciation reserve. There is still lacking a liquid depreciation reserve as a protection against unforeseen demands which the Commission has twice said here - tofore is very essential. The readjustments proposed by applicant do not provide this essential liquid reserve. The properties are in good operating condition so far as demands on the maintenance funds are concerned. The remaining demands of the territory can properly be met now only by additions to capital. In its order on Application No. 4033, the Commission ha.s provided earnings on the present outstanding capital plus the capital found in order on Application No. 3729, to be due the stockholders. Supple - menting the provisions of that order, in part duplicating them, the Com - mission will here find that the- company shall hold all the stock dividends in trust and the accruing dividends thereon. When $2,000 of additional stock shall have been sold for cash and the money shall have been placed in depreciation reserve in liquid form, the company may release from the treasury one-half of the stock dividend and from the time of said release pay dividends thereon. When $2,000 additional shall have been secured from the sale of stock for cash at par, the company may then issue from its treasury the remainder cf the stock dividends and pay dividends thereon from time of such issue. One-half of the pro - ceeds of the sale of $4,000 worth of stock for cash herein released, m»y be used for retiring current liabilities outstanding, which may have been incurred because of reconstruction properly chargeable to depreciation </seg>
            <seg id="p194">194 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT reserve. The remaining one-half of such proceeds shall be held in some liquid form until a reconstruction emergency arises warranting its use. Dividends on the $4,000 of stock shall run only from the date of sale. Any surplus created from the rates by reason of an allowance on divi - dends on this stock prior to the date of sale, plus the accruing dividends on the stock dividend prior to its release, shall be held in surplus account until further order of the Commission. In case the company fails to sell the recommended $4,000 of stock for cash, the authorized stock dividends shall be held in the treasury until such time as the accruing dividends thereon shall amount to $4, - 000 and such dividends appear on the assets side of the balance sheet in liquid form. These accrued dividends shall in such circumstances never be drawn out as cash dividends but may be represented by stock divi - dends upon proper application. It is urgently recommended that these proceedings be not followed inasmuch as deferred dividends only add to the financial perplexity of the company. tin lieu of accruing depreciation funds for reconstruction purposes the sale of central office properties the company undertook to finance h reconstruction by borrowing money, which borrowed money still stands as a liability. Except for the issue of $2,000 to retire current liabilities heretofore mentioned, the present indebtedness should be re - tired only from the proceeds of sale of securities and not by the use of depreciation reserve, until such time as the depreciation reserve has reached an amount which will be ample to safeguard the public service. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the original order of the Commission in this case dated September 29, 1919, be amended, and the Farmers &amp; Merchants Tele - phone Company of Alma, Nebraska, be and it is hereby authorized to retain in corporate assets that portion of real estate holdings in Alma, Nebraska, as represents investments for other than corporate purposes, provided that the company shall undertake forthwith, to sell stock at par to the amount of $4,000, one-half of such proceeds to be used to retire current liabilities incurred for reconstruction purposes and one - half to be retained as a liquid reserve against future service contin - gencies. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the stock dividends due the com - pany in the original order on Application No. 3729, and stock dividends to represent the unpaid dividends on the 1919 capital liabilities, shall theld in trust in the treasury and shall be issued as per the terms of finding above.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3748 In the Matter of the Application of the Kearney Telephone Company for Authority to Increase its Rates for Business, Residence and Switching Service and to Discontinue Certain Free Service. SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER TAYLOR, Chairman: This matter arises on an application of the Kearney Telephone com - pany for an extension of the order issued by this Commission on August 16, 1919, which in turn was an extension of the original order in this case, approving certain increases of rates for exchange service. The last order expires March 1, 1920, and under its terms the rates approved would be discontinued and the former rates, in effect at the time the or - iginal order was issued, would be restored. Meeting the conditions prescribed by the Commission in the previous orders, the company submits a showing as to its operating revenues and expenses in support of its request for a continuation of the present nates. This showing is made in two ways, first, for the six months period from July 1 to January 1, and also for the entire year of 1919. Figures are submitted in great detail. It is manifest, from an examina - tion of the showing made by the company, that conditions have not changed since the issuance of the last order. At that time the show - ing for the six months previous disclosed a surplus of $2,491.23, which was available for dividends on the common stock. The surplus for the six months from July 1 to January 1, 1919, is $2,454.12, approximately the same as for the previous period. For the year ending December 31, 1919, the surplus amounted to only $1,995.19. The present rates were made effective on March 1, i919, so that the revenues for the year 1919 reflected only ten months of the increased rates. Applicant shows that there was an increase in revenues for the four months, September, October, November and December, over the four months of May, June, July and August, of the same year, amounting to 1.8 per cent, whereas the expense for the same later period was 8 per cent more than for the </seg>

On the contrary, the company has already exper - ienced some increases since the first of the year. It is apparent, therefore, that the rates as they now exist are not producing any excess revenue, and we are of the opinion that they should be continued in effect until such time as conditions change. An order will issue, making these nates effective until January 1, 1921. The Commission will retain jurisdiction of the matter so that, if at any time conditions change, the rates can be re-adjusted. The rates should con - tinue to be subject to all of the conditions set out in the original order in this case. • ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the original order in this case and the supplemental or - der expiring on March 1, 1920, be and the same are hereby extended from March 1, 1920, to January 1, 1921, the rates, rules and schedules herein approved to be subject to all of the conditions as set forth in the original order.

On August 16, 1919, the rates were extended for another period of six months and in an order issued on the 27th day of February, 1920, the rates were again extended to January 1, 1921. The rates, therefore, have again expired. In the meantime the company has made application for a further increase in its present rates.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3788 In the Matter of the Application of the Wynot Telephone company for Authority to Increase Rates. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: Applicant herein asks for authority to increase residence rates from |1.50 per month net to $1.75 per month net, alleging lack of sufficient revenues to give adequate service. Under date of October 1, 1919, order was entered by the Commission authorizing certain increases in the rates of the Wynot Telephone com - pany, these rates to expire April 1, 1920, by limitation of the order un - less extended. The rates have been extended twice while investiga - tions of the company's finances were being made and are to terminate October 1, 1920, unless otherwise ordered. This Company has never had adequate accounting methods. The Commission has ordered the installation of a uniform accounting system and has taken the necessary steps to see that the accounts are properly opened. It has also made a careful study of res'. Its of the company's operation under the rates approved in October for the first six months of 1920. The figures do not warrant the company's conclusion that it is operating at a loss. The cash account is overdrawn, but the company has outstanding a very considerable amount of bills receivable. There has been spent on the plant slightly more than the average found by the Commission to be essential, but in itself this does not mean that the same is insufficient but rather that the company is improving its service. For the six months period the total operating revenue was </seg>
            <seg id="p198">198 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT $2,443.79; the total operating: expenses $1,886.36. After allowance is made for accrued taxes and interest the plant shows a profit of $412.43 for the six months before the dividend allotment. In the original order the Commission found a temporary value of $6,000 on which eight per cent dividends were properly to be earned, although we did not fix this as a final figure inasmuch as a physical valuation had been made but had not been considered in a hearing. Out of the eight per cent dividends it was directed that the interest on the $3,000 indebtedness should be paid. The company has, therefore, on this basis earned its dividends and earned fixed charges after all operat - ing expenses were paid. bThe Commission will temporarily deny the application for an in - se in residence rates and will authorize a continuance of the present with leave to the company at any time to make showing that the rates are not properly maintaining the property in serviceable condi - tion, protecting the depreciation reserve, and paying all operating ex - penses and a reasonable dividend. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Wynot Telephone company be and it hereby is au - thorized to continue its present schedule of charges for telephone ser - vice as set forth in the order dated October 1, 1919.

SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER BROWNE, Commissioner: The original temporary order in this cause was to terminate April 1, 1920, by its own terms unless the Commission extended the time. The company was required to file certain financial reports, which it has failed to do. This failure is due either to disinclination or inability of the owner to make a financial statement. In the opinion of the Com - mission the rates temporarily authorized are not higher than those nec - essary. The company deserves ho consideration because of its care - lessness, but service conditions warrant the Commission in taking a lenient position. These rates will be extended nunc pro tune until August 1, 1920, in order to give the company an opportunity to make a financial showing.

A. Davies, president; J. A. Dixon, secretary; H. W. Marshall, treasurer; G. I. Pfeiffer and H. W. Rockmeyer, directors. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Chairman An ascending scale of material and labor costs prompts the appli- cant in this case to ask for increases in its exchange rates. Its present and proposed rates are as follows Present Proposed Individual Business $ 1.75 $ 2.00 Individual Residence 1.25 1.60 Party Residence 1.00 1.25 Farm 1.25 1.50 Extension Phones .75 Residence .50 Business .75 Extension Bell .25 .25 In addition to the rates as asked for applicant desires to make a charge of 25c per month extra for residence desk phones. Permission is also requested to collect farm rentals six months in advance and city rentals one month in advance. The affairs of this company were very thoroughly investigated in a proceeding, involving an application for an increase of its capital stock (Application No. 3168). In a final order issued in that case on May 29, 1919, the company was authorized to issue $1,500 of additional common stock, making the total authorization $19,985. For the purposes of that case, a valuation of the property was made by the Commission's en - gineers and an original cost of $38,089.33 was found and a present or depreciated cost of $24,429.79. For the purpose of determining the basis for maintenance and depreciation, the Commission eliminated certain real estate and general expenditure items and fixed a figure of $37,500 for that purpose. Upon this an allowance of 9 per cent was made for maintenance and depreciation. It appears from the records that the company has as yet not sold the $1500 of additional stock authorized. It was a condition of the order, issued in that case, that dividends should be deferred for a period of three years, commencing with January 1, 1919, to create a fund to reimburse the depreciation reserve. At the hearing held in this case applicant submitted some figures, relative to its revenues and expenses, which have been supplemented </seg>
            <seg id="p201">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 201 since by monthly reports of the company required under the new ac - counting system of the Commission. Of these reports there are avail - able the figures for November, December, January and February. Upon this showing it appears that the gross revenues for the four months period amounted to $2,713.86. The allowance for maintenance and de - preciation on the basis of 9 per cent was $1,183.88. The traffic ex - pense, which covers the salaries of operators only, was $515.73, and the commercial expense amounted to $760.85, making a total of $2,400.4&lt;i. This leaves a net operating income of $313.40. From this should be deducted the taxes of $106.43 and interest of $110.16, leaving a net in - come available for dividends of $96.81. Allowing dividends at 8 per cent on the capital stock outstanding of $18,485 we have a net deficit of $396.00 for the four months period. Extending this for the period of a year, the deficit would amount to $1,188.27. The allowance for depreciation was made in 1918 and is about one per cent lower than the Commission has found necessary in recent cases. The salaries being paid to operators are somewhat below the normal and will very likely have to be increased. The rates as asked for would produce approximately $1500 more revenue annually. From this show - ing, therefore, it is apparent that the company should have more reve - nue and that the rates as asked for are reasonable and necessary. The rates compare very favorably with exchanges of similar size. The company serves 510 subscribers at the present time and the system is entirely metallic. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Arlington Telephone com - pany be and the same hereby is authorized to charge and collect the following scale of rates for exchange service, the same to become effec - tive May 1, 1920: A charge of 25c per month extra may be made for residence desk phones. Farm rentals may be collected six months in advance and city rentals one month in advance.

TAYLOR, Chairman Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3811 In the Matter of the Application of the Cortland Telephone Company for Authority to Increase its Exchange Rates. Appearances For Applicant — B. B. Jackson, President; W. C. Luckey, Director; J. T. McPherson and Leonard Grieser, Patrons. SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER TAYLOR, Commissioner: Originally this was an application for an increase of the exchange rates of the Cortland Telephone Company from $1.00 per month for all classes of service to $1.50 per month. The Commission denied the ap - plication substantially for the reason that the representative of the company appearing at the hearing announced that it was not. the inten - tion of the management to keep a lineman continuously, but that it would be the policy to hire men only occasionally to do repair and con - struction work. In the original opinion we discussed this policy at some length and announced the conclusion that good service could not be maintained by such methods, but that if the people of that communi - ty desired that kind of service there could be no reason for increasing the rates for it, inasmuch as the existing rates were sufficient to pay the operating expenses and a dividend on the outstanding stock. Within a few weeks after the effective date of the order the Com - mission received informal complaints as to the service. It then devel - oped that the people of that community really wanted better service. Officers of the company made application for a rehearing, which was granted. At that hearing they urged that all the facts had not been presented to the Commission and that the policy of the company with respect to the maintenance of the plant had been misrepresented. They vigorously asserted their desire to hire a lineman and keep him perma - nently. They also stated their purpose to rebuild the plant and im - prove the service. Upon this showing as to the intention of the com - pany and upon the changed conditions which such a policy will produce the Commission is convinced its former order should be modified and some increase of rates allowed. In the original opinion we found that a net surplus of $95 would remain from the operation of the company for the year 1918. The expenses included, however, only a nominal amount for maintenance. It is the opinion of the officers that they cannot secure a lineman for </seg>
            <seg id="p203">203 less than $1,500 per year. If to this we add $400 for materials we have a total of $1,900, which is $725 more than the former basis called for. In the previous calculation we took into consideration the col - lections of the company, rather than the possible gross revenue. The collections evidently included advance payments, as the amount was larger than would be produced by applying the present rate of $1.00 per month to the number of subscribers; which is 235. The gross rev - enue from all sources on the latter basis would be $3,259.27. Adding to the $1,900 for maintenance, the direct operating expense of $1,432.25 and $760.68 for dividends we have $4,092.93, as the gross operating expense of the company for the year. Deducting the gross revenue, leaves a deficit of $834. The company asks for a uniform increase of 50 cents per month for all classes of subscribers. This would produce an increased revenue of $1,410, which is more than is required. The present rate schedule of the company makes no dis - tinction between the various classes of subscribers. It is more pre - ferable, in the opinion of the Commission, to make such distinction, particularly as to business subscribers. Such a practice is almost universal. An increase of 25 cents on residence and farm service and 50 cents on business would produce added revenue to the amount of $762. Under all the circumstances we are of the opinion that such rates are justified and they will be approved. If the company pro - ceeds promptly to an improvement of its service and if, at the end of a six-months period, it finds it impossible to operate on these rates, the Commission will, upon further showing at that time, grant a fur - ther increase. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the original order in this case be, and the same is, hereby modified and the said Cortland Telephone Company be authorized to charge and collect the following schedule of rates for exchange service: IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the applicant herein set up for the purpose of maintenance and depreciation the sum of not less than $1,000 annually, out of which shall be paid the salary of the lineman, the cost of batteries, the cost of all materials used for repairs and re - placements and such other expenses as is properly chargeable to the upkeep of the plant. No part of this sum shall be expended for new construction.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3825 In the Matter of the Arnold Telephone Company for an Increase in Kates SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER BROWNE, Commissioner: Upon hearing held at Arnold, Nebraska, on October 10, 1919, the Commission issued an order authorizing certain increases in rates for the Arnold Telephone Company, and because of some uncertainties re - garding the financial records and expenses of the applicant, these rates were for a four months period, at the close of which time showing as to the effect of the increased rates was to be made by the company. Such showing as was made was reasonably convincing that the tem - porary rates were not in excess of the needs of the company in this per - iod of high operating expenses. Verbally it was understood that the rates might continue for some time beyond the period fixed as date of termination in the original order. The Commission has now carefully gone over all the data submitted by the company from its records ami monthly reports and it is found that after paying all proper operating expenses, setting aside a nominal amount for depreciation reserve to protect the property against accruing depreciation, making allowances for such deductions as taxes and dividends at the rate of 8 per cent on an investment of $4,500, there remains practically no surplus to care for unforseen special expenditures. The town of Arnold, however, is thriv - ing and growing, and it is anticipated that a continuance of the present rates throughout the period of high operating costs will produce a con - tinually increasing revenue and that the company can safely operate on the present rates. The rate schedule put into effect on January 1, 1920, will therefore be continued indefinitely, the order being as of date May 1, 1920, and being subject to proper downward revision when normal conditions allow the company to reduce operating costs sufficiently to permit such re&gt; </seg>

(SEA'L) APPLICATION NO. 3881 In the Matter of the Application of the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company for Authority to Publish Switching Rate of Fifty Cents at Certain of Its Exchanges. OPINION AND FINDING HALL, Commissioner On October 1, 1918, the Commission authorized temporary increases in all exchange and toll rates of applicant, which were to remain in effect for a period of six months unless the time were extended. The application herein was filed March 14, 1919. The rates on file for switch - ing service at certain exchanges were fifty cents per month, which the company was collecting. At other exchanges the company was collect - ing fifty cents for such service, but schedule of rates had never been ap - proved by the Commission and were not on file with the Commission. At other exchanges the charges for switching were below fifty cents per month. The company asks that the rates being charged and collected but not on file with the Commission be validated and that the rates below fifty cents be raised to that amount. On the 27th day of June, 1919, upon another application, the Com - mission granted the company another temporary increase in all rates and at the same time raised all switching rates that were below fifty cents per month to fifty cents per month. All of the rates and orders above referred to were to remain in effect until December 31, 1919. On De - cember 31, 1919, all temporary rates and charges authorized by the Com - mission were continued until December 31, 1920, subject to any modifica - tion that might be made in switching rates in the application herein. We are now of the opinion that it will be impossible to fix reason - able and equitable switching charges, based upon the record taken at the time of the hearing, because of the many changes in operating con - ditions and costs of the same that have taken place since that time. We </seg>
            <seg id="p206">206 are of the opinion that the application herein should be dismissed with - out prejudice and that all charges for switching service should be satis - fied and adjusted in the final determination of Applications Nos. 3701, 3953, and supplemental orders thereto. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE CONSIDERED AND ORDERED that the ap - plication herein be and the same hereby is dismissed without prejudice and that the whole matter o' switching charges be considered by the Commission in Applications Nos. 3701, 3953, and supplemental orders and f ndings thereto.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3914 rthe Matter of the Application of the Odell Independent Telephone Company for Authority to Issue and Sell $5,000 or More of Its Cap - ital Stock. APPEARANCES: For Applicant — Ernest Loempker, president; W. T. Stanosheck, secretary; D. W. Housman, treasurer. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Chairman: The Odell Independent Telephone company was organized in 1904. It purchased at that time the beginnings of an exchange owned by the Diller Telephone company, consisting of less than fifty subscribers. The time was ripe, however, for the development of a telephone system in that territory and the plant was rapidly extended, until in 1917 it was serving approximately 396 subscribers. The company was incorporated at the outset with an authorized capital of $10,000. Of this amount $8,200 had been issued up to 1917. The records are somewhat obscure as to the actual investment in the property, although it would appear that if consideration is given to services contributed by the organizers the in - rment would reach approximately $10,000. Dividends averaging eight one-third per cent were paid on $8,200 for the period referred to. In 1917, certain farm subscribers became dissatisfied with the ser - vice of the company. At that time the company had a rule that non - subscribers should pay a fee whenever using the company's lines. Tele - phone companies immediately adjacent to this territory did not main- </seg>
            <seg id="p207">207 tain such a rule and farmers in the territory north and west of Oclell, subscribers of applicant company, protested against what they termed was a discrimination. The dissatisfaction became quite acute and grad - ually extended until it included a large part of the farm subscribers served by the company. None of these farmers ever registered com - plaint with this Commission with respect to the rule, nor did they ask for any investigation of the trouble by the Commission. Rather, they sought to cure the trouble complained of by organizing a second company to occupy the Odell field. At the outset it was planned to incorporate and issue stock, but when it was discovered that stock could not be is - sued without the approval of this Commission, it was decided to create a voluntary association, or partnership, for the purpose of constructing the proposed plant. Committees representing the farmers called twice upon the Commission and were warned against the duplication of tele - phone facilities in that territory and urged not to make such an unwise expenditure. It was suggested further that a better plan would be to purchase the existing company. Such warnings and suggestions went unheeded, however, and money was subscribed for the purchase of equipment and material, and construction of a second plant started. The success anticipated by the promoters, however, was not realized and only about one hundred subscribers were secured after several months of solicitation. During this time lines were constructed which practically in every instance paralleled the existing lines of the Odell Independent Telephone company. The new plant was constructed as cheaply as - possible, only about one-half the usual number of poles being set, the plan being to later add to these as the business developed. The operation of the second plant only served to impair telephone service in that community. The subscribers of the new company were able to secure service only to one hundred patrons, while the subscribers of the old company found themselves cut off from the farmers joining in the new enterprise. Naturally the construction of the second com - pany had resulted in considerable friction, with the result that the com - munity as a whole became very desirous of effecting a consolidation so as to restore uniform service and settle the controversy. Negotiations vere finally instituted by the farm company for the purchase of the property of the old company. As a result of these negotiations a pur - chase was effected at a price of $20,000. The farmers had expended including the labor contributed, approximately $8,500 in the construction of their plant. In the consolidation of the two plants, two or three of the stockholders in the old company retired, thus transferring the con - trol and management to the farmers. It was the plan to issue stock of the Odell Independent Telephone company to the farmers in an amount equal to their cash contributions to the new property, which amounted to $4750. The difference between $8,200 of capital stock of the old com - pany and the price paid therefore, plus $2,000 of indebtedness of the new company, was to be assumed as indebtedness of the consolidated com - pany. This aggregated approximately $14,000. </seg>
            <seg id="p208">THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 208 The Odell Independent Telephone company, as now constituted, now brings its financing problems to the Commission. Its original applica - tion was for the approval of an issue of $5,000 of common stock of the company. At the hearing, however, it asked leave to amend its appli - cation to increase the amount to $10,000 or more, as the Commission might find necessary. This statement of the situation, as we have pre - sented it, reveals a problem by no means easy of solution if justice is to be done all parties. kThe Commission has gone quite thoroughly into the value of both perties, its engineers having made a physical valuation of each pro - ty separately, and a study as to the practicability of the consolida - tion of the two plants. In addition, the Commission's accounting de- Eient has made an analysis of the books of the company to determine riginal cost, as nearly as it can be found from that source. The tion, as found by the engineers, is as follows: Original Cost Present Value Odell Independent Telephone Co $ 26,366.43 $ 15,134.27 Farmers Mutual Telephone Co 8,570.41 7,865.62 Total I 34,936.84 $ 22,999.89 The estimated original cost, as shown by the analysis of the books, referred to, is as follows: Odell Independent Telephone Co, $ 25,080.18 Farmers Mutual Telephone Co. 7,651.98 The figures covering the Farmers Mutual Telephone company do not include any allowance for labor performed by the farmers for which no compensation was paid. It will be seen that the property of the Odell Independent Telephone company was not in the best of condition, being fifty-seven per cent, and that it had reached the point where considerable reconstruction would be required to maintain adequate service. The engineers report that practically all of the farm lines of the new company can be utilized by consolidating them with the lines of the old company. The new poles can be moved across the road and set in the old line, and the wire can be used in furnishing added circuits that are required by the pres - ent subscribers. This consolidation will result both in replacing por - tions of the old line and, to the extent of the new wire circuits, will result in an addition to the old system. The new telephone instru - ments can likewise be utilized to good advantage in the consolidated plant. The switchboard of the new company will not be needed and can be sold. The Farmers company borrowed approximately $2,000 during the construction of its plant. It is planned, however, to sell excess property in this amount and reduce the indebtedness to that ex - tent The labor of consolidating: the two plants, in the opinion of the </seg>
            <seg id="p209">209 engineers, will amount to about $1,400. Deducting property in the amount of $2,000 from the present value, as found by the engineers, there would remain about $21,000 of value in the consolidated plant. From this should be taken the $1,400 necessary to effect the consolida - tion. This leaves between $19,000 and $20,000 as the present value of the consolidated plant. As we have stated, the original investment in the old company was about $10,000. If to this we add $8^000 as the present value of the in - vestment in the Farmers company, we have $18,000 as the total invest - ment in the two properties. From this should be deducted the $2,000 of excess property referred to, leaving $16,000 as the probable invest - ment in the consolidated plant. We think it requires no argument to show that a mistake was made in the construction of the second plant. We are confronted with the results, however, and must seek a solution as equitable to all concerned as possible. In one way or another the public in that community, or a considerable portion of it, will eventually have to bear the cost of the duplication of these properties. Under all the circumstances, as they have been outlined, the Commission is of the opinion that the present fair value of the consolidated property is $19,000 and that stock to that amount should be authorized. This figure is still within the present physical valuation of the consolidated property. Of this amount $8,200 is already outstanding as having been issued by the old company. Forty-seven hundred and fifty dollars will be issued to the farmers of the new company, leaving $6,050 to be sold, and the proceeds from which to be applied in reducing the in - debtedness of the company. If excess property in the amount of $2, - 000 is disposed of, the indebtedness remaining after the stock is sold should be approximately $6,000. It has been the plan of the company to pay off this indebtedness out of the surplus earnings of the com - pany. In view of the burdens already imposed upon the rate payers, however, such a method would be unjust to them. For that reason the Commission is of the opinion that the stockholders of the company, a majority of whom are responsible for the present situation, should be required to defer dividends until the indebtedness is fully amortized. At the same time the physical property of the company should be main - tained so as to provide for adequate service. Since the filing of this application, the company has made an application for an increase in its rates. The conditions just referred to will be taken into considera - tion in the rate case. At the time of the filing of the application in this case, applicant had not amended its articles of incorporation to provide for an increase in the authorized capital. It should file with the Commission a copy of the amended articles, together with notice of publication of the same, as required by law. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Odell Independent Tel- </seg>
            <seg id="p210">210 ephonc company be, and the same hereby is, authorized to issue and sell additional common stock in the amount of $10,800, making a total of $19,000 approved and authorized by this Commission. Said stock must be sold for cash, or its equivalent, and at not less than par. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant shall set up for the purpose of maintenance and depreciation a sum equal to ten per cent annually of $32,000, plus such additions and betterments as may be mads to the property from time to time; the money thus set aside shall be used for the purpose stated and for none other. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that no dividends shall be paid upon the stock of applicant company until the present indebtedness has all been paid. After such indebtedness has been paid, dividends in an amount not to exceed eight per cent per annum may be paid upon the outstanding capital. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant shall file with the Com - mission a copy of its amended articles of incorporation, together with a notice of publication, as required by law. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within thirty days from the dale of this order a statement signed by the officers and directors of the company, accepting all of the conditions as outlined herein, shall be filed with the Commission.

Curtiss, Secretary (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 3984 In the Matter of the Application of the Antelope County Mutual Tele - phone Company for Authority to Increase Its Exchange Rates. SUPPLEMENTAL FINDING AND ORDER TAYLOR, Chairman: On December 3, 1919, the Commission issued an order authorizing the Antelope County Mutual Telephone company to increase its ex - change rates, subject to the condition that the rates should not become effective until certain improvements had been made to applicant's plant. These improvements were made so that the rates became effective on May 1, 1920, the condition of the order being that they should remain in effect for a period of six months. Before the date of expiration the company was required to make a showing as to its operating revenues and expenses. This showing is submitted in a very abbreviated form and indicates </seg>
            <seg id="p211">211 that the company is not keeping a modern system of accounts. The figures show that the total revenue for the six months period, from May 1, 1920, to October 1, 1920, was $3,982.20. The expenses for the same period were $3,345. Included in this amount, however, is an item, "wages due November 1, $220," concerning which we are in doubt as it is not shown whether this amount is merely a deferred payment and included in other labor expenses, or whether it is an item of expense in addition to that shown. Deducting this, however, would leave an ex - pense of $3,125, without any allowance for dividends. It is apparent, therefore, that the rates approved are not excessive. According to the report, the company is engaged in making mater - ial improvements to its plant. It has purchased an exchange build - ing; it is installing considerable cable in town; it is setting some heavy poles; and making other very much needed replacements and improve - ments. On January 1, 1921, applicant states it will owe $4,000. These improvements are with the approval of the Commission, as it was stated in the original order that the plant was not in condition to give adequate service. The existing rates should be continued and an order will issue ac - cordingly. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the rates approved for the Antelope County Mutual Telephone company in the original order in this case be extended from November 1, 1920, to November 1, 1921, un - less further ordered by this Commission. Such rates shall be subject to all the conditions of the original order. Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 27th day of Octo - ber, 1920. NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION H. G. TAYLOR, Chairman ATTEST: John E. Curtiss, Secretary (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4033 In the Matter of the Application of the Farm - ers &amp; Merchants Telephone company of Alma, Nebraska, for Authority to Increase Rates. Appearances: For applicant — R. L. Keester; For Orleans — C. T. Simpson; For Republican City — Dean Drummond. </seg>
            <seg id="p212">212 OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: Applicant operates exchanges at Alma, Orleans, Republican City and Stamford, Nebraska, and at Woodruff, Kansas, with trunk toll lines be - tween and free interchange to all subscribers. The subscribers of the company are, therefore, furnished connections without extra cost to more than 1,500 different telephones. It asks authority to increase rates at Alma and Orleans twenty-five cents per month for business, thirty-five cents per month residence and farm, and twenty-five cents per month for switching service- At Republican City, Stamford and Woodruff it asks authority to increase business rates twenty-five cents per month, residence and farm rates thirty-five cents per month and switching rates twenty - five cents per month. The increases are net figures. Service is given from 5:30 a. m. to 10:30 p. m., and a charge for night calls of ten cents is made for the remainder of the twenty-four hours. Applicant's rates have not been increased for many years. In Jan - uary, 1917, hearing was held on the application of the company to make increases of approximately the same amount as are now asked. In the opinion in that case, the Commission found that the company needed no increase in rates for proper purposes, and found also that the desired increases were for purposes of replacement of properties which should be cared for in other manner than from the revenues of the corporation. The opinion found also that services were not up to standard and the company was directed to make certain specific improvements. Applicant had constructed at Alma shortly theretofore, an exchange building larger than was essential for corporate purposes and was renting one part under the single roof as a store building. It had bought lots and constructed this building at a cost of more than $12,000 out of funds properly belong - ing to depreciation reserve- It had no depreciation reserve in liquid form and the Commission severely condemned the use of the depreciation reserve for those purposes. It ordered the company to sell the central office real estate and to put the proceeds of such sale in the depreciation reserve, to use such parts of it as were needed for replacements and to carry the remainder as a liquid or semi-liquid reserve fund. There is no question that the construction of this building on so pretentious a scale at the time it was built was embarrassing to the company's service, inasmuch as it deprived the company of liquid assets which all companies should have to meet emergencies. However, it is not wise economy for any telephone company to retain in liquid form all the accrued depreciation reserve, as not all of it can be economically used at any time. It may be invested in such a manner as to return a reason - able rate of interest and still be held liquid. Some may be invested in fixed property and earn a better return which becomes part of the re - venues of the company. The investment of the portion which was not necessary in this building does return a good rate of interest, which goes </seg>
            <seg id="p213">213 into the revenues of the company. It does not represent the investment of a greater portion of the depreciation reserve than can be safely placed in fixed property. The chief objection which was found in the original order, and which in a lesser degree exists yet, was that too much of the reserve had been placed in fixed properties. The company has not divorced this real estate from its holdings and has represented that it was absolutely impossible for it to do so. A mortgage of $10,000 stands against the entire property, including this building, and unless that mortgage was paid off the building could not be taken out from under it. Other conditions of the order made it seem - ingly impossible to pay the mortgage off through the sale of additional stock, hence the failure to comply with that provision of the order. The company has, through borrowed money and other means, reduced the necessity for liquid depreciation reserve by increasing the per cent con - dition of the property and in that degree has lessened the necessity of acquiring additional liquid reserve either through the disposition of the central office building, or by covering other fixed property not capitalized into a capital investment- The trunk lines between Alma and Republican City and Alma and Orleans have been reconstructed and converted to metallic. The main lead west from Orleans has been rebuilt, as per the order. Native poles have been replaced with cedar poles on all but one rural line, which was new at the time of the order and reconstruction of which has been de - layed on that account. The number of rural subscribers on each party line has been reduced materially, but not in all instances to the ten-party basis. As a matter of economy this cannot be done at once. The company also has been embarrassed by inability to finance the additions to the property involved in this reconstruction, no part of which construction should properly be paid from revenues. A new switchboard has been installed at Alma, as per the order. At Republi - can City, temporarily, the reconstructed Alma board has been installed, but later a new board will be put in at Republican City. The original order required the replacing of open wire construction at Alma, Orleans and Republican City with cable construction. This work has not all been completed, due to the difficulties of securing new capital. At Alma, cable has been put under ground, additional aerial cable has been in - stalled at Orleans and Republican City, but much of that improvement has yet to be made. Applicant testified that this work would be pushed as rapidly as new funds can be secured. At the time of the original inventory of the company's property by the Commission's engineer in April, 1917, it was found to be in 72% con - dition- Thfl condition per cent has now been increased to 75% and added investments have been made which have materially improved service conditions. This condition per cent is well above the average of tele - phone companies in the state, and is good enough to render sufficient </seg>
            <seg id="p214">214 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL BEPORT service for the class of service offered. No reason exists why with its present condition of plant good service cannot be rendered, save only that much of the system is still of grounded construction and cross-talk will never be wholly relieved until metallic construction is substituted. Such improvement, however, can only keep pace with the additions to capital. Applicant testified that the company i- constantly seeking investors and the way remains open therefore for any town in the system, which desires metallic service to secure it by its citizens aiding in the financing. Some portions of the question of applicant's finances are properly to be discussed in connection with Application No. 3729, the supplemental order on which will be issued at once. Hearing on the application for authority to increase rates wa.s held at Alma on November 7, 1919. No objections were entered by sub - scribers of the Alma exchange to the application. This exchange had been very much improved and what testimony was given was to the effect that service conditions were excellent. Business interests of the town of Orleans were well represented in protest. The matters covered by those protests will be mentioned later. Farm lines in connection with Republican City filed brief protests, which will also be considered. In April, 1917, the Commission's engineer found property owned by applicant costing originally $81,2bo.38, which property was in a condition valued at (59,431.71. The property has not been revalued. Applicant has endeavored to keep careful accounts since the original hearing, and from those accounts the Commission's accounting force found an original cost as of June 30, 1919, of $90,727.49. Following the Commission's ac - counting system the original cost shown on October 31, 1919, at $92,439.80, with a depreciation reserve showing a present condition of $69,230.02. These later figures are from book accounts. This additional investment in property was largely the result of the original order of this Commis - sion. Applicant has been seriously embarrassed during the year and a half to find the funds to make such improvements and replacements as have been made, and testified that the only reason improvements have not been extended still further was inability to secura the finances. The record shows that in April, 1917, the bills and accounts payable and mortgage debt amounted to $12,147-93. In October, 1919, this indebted - ness had risen to $20,213.94, showing that from this source more than $8,000 had been secured for the reconstruction and betterments de - manded by the Commission. The increase in assets during the period was $11,203.42. The difference between the borrowed money and the increase in assets represents invested depreciation reserve, accrued but not realized, and investments of such dividends as had been earned. The company by the Commission's order had been denied the right to pay any dividends during the year and a half and for such future period as was necessary to put into its depreciation reserve account the value of the central office building heretofore discussed, such being the alter- </seg>
            <seg id="p215">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 215 native to the releasing of this real estate from the corporation's mhU The company has experienced also a normal grcwth and there is no reason to believe that such normal growth will not continue for some - time to come, as the localities served are prosperous and the population i* increasing. In its order on Application No. 3729, order dated September 2D. 1019, the Commission found »»fter careful studies that applicant had inve.-ael enough of its proper earnings and had donated services and made other sacrifices in sufficient amount, between the date the corporation was formed in 1902 and January 1, 1919, to entitle it to issue 100&lt;? atash dividend. This stock dividend represented moneys an 1 services invesce I in the plant, which would otherwise be available for annual cash dividend and modest wages. While the Commission found this stock .liviilen.l due, it required the company to make certain financial arrangements with reference to the central office real estate in Alma, mentioned heretofore, as precedent to the actual issuing of the stock. The particular matter will be discussed in the supplemental order on Application No. 3729 and only indirectly affects this case. This valuation as of January 1, 191!), was subject to earnings, which the Commission found to be reasonable at 89J-, inasmuch as applicant has been required to pay S'r for all moneys borrowed, whether on short or long time basis. The dividend for 1919 was only partly earned, but inasmuch as there is ample property in the surplus account uncapitalized to cover this dividend, the Commission will authorize enough additional stock to represent the unpaid dividend of 1919. As heretofore stated the company still lacks a liquid reserve to take care of such sudden emergencies as sleet storms and other unavoidable abnormal destruction of property. Applicant testified that while it was very difficult to secure additional cash from the sale of stock, the presi - dent of the company would be in a position, through the sale of real estate privately owned to invest some more in the corporation stock in which he has great faith, and agreed to do so. The Commission believes that the company should secure $4,000 additional resources from sale of stock, not more than half of which should be used to retire current liabilities incurred during replacement work heretofore completed, and not less than half of which shall be carried as a liquid reserve to be drawn on only when a sufficient current emergency arises to warrant its use. When this financing has been completed the company's capital lia - bilities will show as follows: •resent stock outstanding $16,012.50 Itock dividend due as per order on Application No. 3729 16,012.50 Mvidend accrued in 1919 and not paid 2,562.00 Sale of additional stock for cash 4,000.00 Total capital proposed $38,587.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p216">216 The company is entitled to earn a dividend on this amount of stock, although certain conditions will be attached regarding the payment of part of these earned dividends- The company may pay out in 1920 not to exceed 8% dividends on the present outstanding stock, $16,012.50; it may issue from its treasury half of the remaining issues due the corporation, as mentioned above, whenever $2,000 of additional stock shall have been sold for cash and the cash placed in the treasury for the purposes men - tioned above. It may issue from its treasury the remainder of the stock found due the stockholders as a stock dividend heretofore and pay divi - dends thereon in 1920 as soon as an additional $2,000 of stock has been sold for cash and the money placed in the treasury for the purposes in - dicated above, being the $4,000 found by the Commission as essential at this time. Failing to secure the cash reserve from stock sales in amount of $4,000 the company shall accrue and not pay dividends on the amount of stock dividend, namely $18,574.50, and pass these dividends to de - preciation reserve until $4,000 has thus been accumulated. This sum shall then be handled in the same manner as prescribed for a like amount if secured from cash sales of stock. This stock adjustment the Commission deems adequate at this time to protect previous stockholders in comparison with new ones. The increases in capitalization are conservative and leave in the property an ample surplus to represent any donations which ought not to be capital - ized and a margin for the protection of the holdings of existing stock - holders. No hint of stock watering is involved in the transaction. Property will exist in excess of each dollar of outstanding liabilities. This fact is best illustrated by a condensed statement of assets and liabilities as •£ October 31, 1919, if the capitalization adjustment had taken place at that time. Following is the balance sheet, indicating a surplus reserve and other credits of more than $15,000 after the readjustments are made: Balance Sheet (as of October 31, 1919) Total assets (based on original cost) $97,324.64 LIABILITIES Capital (after adjustment) $38,587.00 Funded debt 10,591.00 Notes payable 6,221.82 Accounts payable 2,782.64 Accrued liabilities not due 618.48 Depreciation reserve 23,209.78 Surplus reserve and other credits 15,313.92 Total liabilities $97,324.S4 'otal fixed investment (subject to depreciation) $89,26328 'otal working assets 4,061.36 lash (or securities) for depreciation reserve 4,000.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p217">217 We come now to the current financial situation of the company and to a discussion of its need for additional revenue. In the original order in 1017, the Commission found the company at that time needed no in - crease in rates- The changed conditions since that time need little ex - planation. Increases in wages and salaries and in costs of materials are so uniformly felt as to be well known to all citizens. This company has increased wages of linemen 100% since the first hearing in order to hold its help. Operator's wages have been distinctly increased and are yet somewhat below the average for systems of this magnitude. The origi - nal order figured on dividends only on the outstanding stock, although stating that there was much additional investment in the plant subject to capitalization. That adjustment has since been made and additional income must be secured to pay the proper dividends on proper allowances. All these are factors to be considered in scrutinizing the expenditures presented in the instant matter. In June, 1919, the Commission installed a uniform accounting system for this company. Those accounts have been well kept in accordance with the directions of the Commission and an accurate statement of all revenues and the expenditure thereof is available for the period down to October 31, 1919, the hearing having been held a week thereafter. Using this particular year as a basis of the company's needed expenditures and making certain adjustments for higher wages which went into effect in July and August, the Commission is in a position to judge as accurately as one can look into the future the financial necessities for 1920. By using the standard percentage which the Commission has adopted for this period of high prices as the basis for arriving at necessary funds for current maintenance, current replacements and a reserve to cover a reasonable amount of accrued but unrealized depreciation of property, and by extending the experiences of the company during the latter part of 1919 as the basis for 1920, the following tabulation is made to reflect the expenditure prehabilities for 1920: Original cost of depreciable properties (October 31, 1919)— $87,548.00 Maintenance and depreciation per month at 10% of original cost $ 730.00 Traffic expenses (based on present experience) per month) 60000 Commercial expenses (present experience and needed additions) 420.00 Total telephone operating expenses per month $ 1,750.00 Total telephone operating expenses per year $21,000.00 $21,000.00 Operating revenue (based on 1919 expenditure) $21,620.52 Operating expenses needed 21,000.00 Total operating income per year at present rates $ 620.52 Deductions from Income Taxes (based on 1919) $ 614.76 </seg>
            <seg id="p218">218 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Interest (on mortgage $10,591; notes $6,221.82 and small allowance for accounts payable $1,513.68 Total deductions $2,128.44 Loss in year (without dividends) $1,507.92 Dividends (8% on $38,587) 3,08696 Total deficit at present rates- $4,594.88 It will be noted from the above tabulation that present rates for serv - ice will leave the company $1,507.92 in the red at the end of 1920, without any payment being made as dividends. When allowance is made for dividends on the capital mentioned above, the deficit will be increased to $4,594.88, less any part of 1920 dividends which may not be earned on the $4,000 mentioned above, due to the fact that it may not be put into the property until the year is partly gone. Increases in rates will be necessary to cover this deficit and to pro - vide a small surplus to care for unforeseen exigencies. Nor will these expenditures be excessive under present conditions. Using the company's own experience on maintenance for five months and adding to that an additional l'&lt; for depreciation reserve, the entire amount which will possibly be set aside as an unrealized depreciation reserve against the future will be 4.3 percentage of the original cost of the depreciable properties. Commonly, rate-making bodies figure de - preciation of telephone properties anywhere from five to six per cent. This figure is then very conservative. The total operating cost, less dividends and interest on borrowed money, will amount to $16.74 per station per annum- The rates provided in the order below will, on the best estimate that can be made, furnish additional revenues of tetween $5,000 and $5,100. Applicant asked for increases approximating $6,000 and did not spread these increases in the opinion of the Commission in a manner properly to reflect the different classes of service which will be furnished. Certain adjustments will, therefore, be made and the ,otal increase will be re - duced the necessary amount. These rates will be lower than the average existing rates on exchanges of this size furnishing commensurate service, because of close economy of management. Citizens of Orleans at the hearing complained of cross-talk, of too many grounded wires on the main leads which should be in cable, and of lack of working force in the central office. They insisted that the qual - ity of service received by them was not equal to that at Alma and that the demand for equal rates was not justified. The Orleans exchange is largely grounded. Metallic rates are not justified. The Alma exchange is almost entirely metallic and metallic rates are fully justified. A Sread will be made between the rates in Orleans and Alma due to this ct. As soon as applicant's finances permit it will proceed with the </seg>
            <seg id="p219">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 219 improvement of the Orleans exchange and when that improvement has reached a sufficient stage of advancement metallic rates will be au - thorized. Cross-talk will continue to a certain digree until that time. The complaint as to inadequate working forces at Orleans appears to be somewhat justified. The testimony of the chief operator was that delays occurred when the single operator at work at a particular moment is required to receive payment of bills. On a system of the pretensions of the FarmersA Merchants Telephone company of Alma bills should be rendered to subscribers and arrange - ments should be made for payment of these bills at banks. The revenues herein provided will be sufficient to provide extra expense of postage and stationery. No other expense will be involved, as the bills are now made out by the secretary at Alma for all subscribers. This order will provide that monthly bills will be rendered to subscribers in the exchange area and quarterly bills to farm line subscribers. If arrangements can - not be made to have these bills paid at banks, then additional help should be provided at Orleans during the first ten days of the month. It would be well for applicant to put on a campaign of education to have sub - scribers authorize their banks to pay their telephone bills when properly rendered and to carry the bill with the cancelled checks of the subscribers as warrant for payment. This practice is a matter of evolution. A ten-cent charge for night calls after 10:30 p. m- is still in effect, having come down through the years from the time when the various exchanges were in their infancy. The Commission believes that there is sufficient operating force at both Alma and Orleans to warrant the abolition of the ten-cent charge and it will be made a condition of the order. At the other exchanges the operating force is not sufficient to warrant throwing down the bars to night calls. Objection was raised at both Orleans and Alma to the proposed extra charge for desk sets. The practice of an extra charge for desk sets has so frequently received the approval of the Commission that it will not be disturbed. While the cost of installation and maintenance of desk stations is higher than of other equipment, that is not the chief con - sideration. Companies are still amply supplied with wall sets and if no obstacle existed to the establishment of desk sets much of the wall equipment would be scrapped due to demand for desk sets and an economic waste would result, which is not warranted particularly in this time of high operating costs. No extra charge for installing desk sets shall be made. A mild complaint was registered from Republican City as to the rule of ten cents for general calls. General calls do not belong to the regu - lar service of telephone companies. They are put through for the ad - vantage of individuals- They cause considerable inconvenience to the operating force and temporarily tie up a line. Generally speaking, they take the place of advertising. The Commission does not think the pro - tests well founded and will not interfere with the general call rate. </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4047 In the Matter of the Application of the Surprise Telephone Company for Authority to re-ad - just its Rental Rates at Surprise and Rising City. Appearances : For applicant — D. L. Sylvester, secretary and manager, OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Chairman: The Surprise Telephone company at the present time consists of two exchanges, viz., Surprise and Rising City. The company serves ap - proximately 530 subscribers- To a portion of these subscribers who pay an added rate therefor, it gives service to both exchanges. It proposes by the present application to extend this service to all subscribers, in - creasing the rate on city residence subscribers from $1.00 to $1.25 and to farm subscribers from $1.00 to $1.50. In addition to the service as described, the company has a free exchange of service with the Ulysses telephone company. Certain farmers on its lines living close to the towns of Gresham and Shelby also have connection with the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph exchanges at those points. Subscribers also have connection with David City upon the payment of additional exchange rates. It is manifest, therefore, that applicant is giving a more ex - tensive service than is usually furnished by companies of this size. The system is fully metallic. This system originally consisted of nine exchanges. In 1916, five of these exchanges, viz., Dwight, Brainard, Bruno, Garrison and David City, were sold to the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company. In 1918 two more exchanges, viz., Bellwood and Shelby, were sold to the same </seg>
            <seg id="p223">223 company. After the first sale the debts of the company were paiil and the remainder of the purchase price was distributed to the stockholders according to their holdings. The same policy was pursued following the second sale. As a result of these transactions, the company now has outstanding $37,300 of common stock. No valuation of the property was made by the Commission and applicant submits only a tentative valu - ation, showing the present value of the property to be $31,571. The plant value as shown by the books on January 31, 1920, was $40,352.79. All of the stock sold by the company was paid for in cash, and the business was operated in the early days on a very economical basis. It is uncertain whether the outstanding stock at the present time fairly reflects the value of the property, but no finding will be made as to that in this opinion. In view of the changes in the property that have taken place, and the necessary readjustment of capital obligations, it would seem wise to establish an accurate value and for this reason any order made herein will be for a comparatively short period, during which time a valuation can be made. On September 1, 1919, applicant installed under the direction of the Commission, an accounting system- Prior to that date the records of the company were more or less incomplete and did not reflect the actual results of operation. Applicant makes a very poor showing as to its operating expenses during the past year and the Commission is com - pelled to rely on the monthly reports submitted since the new account - ing system was installed. A summary of these reports, which cover a period of five months, with an extension to cover a period of a year, is The five months period covered by these figures very likely fairly reflects the operating revenues and expenses for a full year. They in - clude a number of increases that were experienced by the company and which will continue in effect for some time to come. The deficit of $1,251, as shown for the twelve months, therefore, will very likely be realized by the company unless relief is given by increasing the rates. as s follows: Five Months Twelve Month; lity subscribers service $1,229.55 $2,950.92 'arm subscribers service 2,254.26 5,410.20 •oil 433.60 1,016.64 liscellaneous revenue 20.00 48.00 'otal telephone operating revenue $3,927.40 $9,425.76 'otal telephone operating expense $3,03037 $7,272.84 otal operating income 897.03 2,152.92 axes 213.59 420.00 Hvidends declared 1,11900 2,984.00 Total deductions $1,332.59 $3,404.00 Deficit 435.56 1,251.08 </seg>
            <seg id="p224">224 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT As stated, the company desires to increase the residence rate from $1.00 to $1.25 per month. This will affect approximately 105 subscribers. The farm line rate will be increased from $1.00 to $1.60 per month and this change will affect 243 subscribers. It should be understood that at the present time farmers, at a rate of $1.50, secure service to both ex - changes. The rates proposed will produce an increase of $1773 per year. This is approximately $500 more than the deficit as shown by the figures- It should be borne in mind, however, that for the increased rates there will be an increased service, inasmuch as it is proposed to extend to all subscribers connection with the subscribers on both exchanges. Appli - cant urges, in addition to its claim for more revenue, that it is a practical impossibility to police the traffic as it is now handled and prevent the use of the system by subscribers who do not now pay for such service. In fact, it is claimed by applicant that a majority of the subscribers would not be affected by this rate, because they are already securing the bene - fits of the unified service without paying for it. It is probable, how - ever, that there will be a more free use of the service after it is thrown open to all subscribers. This may result in an increase in the traffic to an extent that may make necessary the addition of an operator at each exchange. It is also not unlikely that an additional trunk line may have to be built between the two exchanges. LAt the present time applicant has two operators at each exchange, at no time is there more than one operator on duty. With the amount of service given by this company, it would appear doubtful whether calls can be as promptly handled as good service demands. This matter should be given very careful consideration by applicant and the Commission may find it necessary to make a service test later to deter - mine whether the facilities are adequate. The Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the present revenue of applicant is insufficient to pay its operating expenses and a reasonable return upon the property and that the rates applied for are reasonable and necessary. We are of the further opinion, however, that a valuation of this property should be made so as to determine definitely the fair value of the property for rate purposes. For that reason and for the further reason that we desire to study the effect of the increase of the rates, the order will be made to cover a period of six months, at the end of which time applicant will be required to make further showing. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Surprise Telephone com - pany be and the same hereby is authorized to c harge and collect $1.25 for city residence service and $1.50 per month for farm service on its two exchanges at Surprise and Rising City, such rates to cover service to both of said exchanges. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant shall set up out of its </seg>
            <seg id="p225">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 225 revenues a sum equal to 10 per cent on $37,300 for the purpose of main - tenance and depreciation, which sum shall be used for this purpose and none other. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that any surplus remaining after the payment of all operating expenses, the allowance for maintenance and depreciation above referred to and a dividend of 8 per cent on $37,300 shall be held in the treasury of the company subject to the further order of the Commission. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the rates herein approved shall become effective on May 1, 1920, and remain in effect until November 1, 1920, on or before which time applicant shall make a further showing as to their reasonableness.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4047 In the Matter of the Application of the Surprise Telephone Company for Authority to Re - adjust its Rental Rates at Surprise and Rising City. SUPPLEMENTAL FINDING AND ORDER TAYLOR, Chairman: On March 29, 1920, the Commission issued an order, authorizing the Surprise Telephone company to increase its rate to certain resident sub - scribers from $1.00 to $1.25 per month and the rate to certain farm sub - scribers from $100 to $1.50 per month. The increase in these rates placed all subscribers of the company on the same basis, in so far as the furnishing of service between the two exchanges was concerned. The order provided that the rates, which were made effective on May 1, 1920, should continue in force until November 1, 1920, prior to which time ap - plicant was to make showing as to the effect of the increased earnings. Such showing has been made. For the six months period from May 1 to November 1, the gross revenue aggregated $5,697.35, while the total operating expenses, ex - clusive cf dividends, were $4,221.66. This leaves an operating income of $1,475.49. As stated in the original opinion, the present outstanding stock of the company probably is in excess of the actual fair value of the property, due to extensive sales of property and re-adjustment of out - standing capital. If we assume, however, that $30,000 represents the base for a rate of return, dividends for the six months period on the basis </seg>
            <seg id="p226">226 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT of 8 per cent would amount to $1200. This would indicate a small sur - plus from present operations. The surplus, however, is by no means excessive, and is not larger than is required to protect the company against unforeseen contingencies. The rates as approved, therefore, appear to be producing no more revenue than is required by the company and they will be continued. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the rates authorized for the Surprise Telephone company in the original order in this case, be and tne same are hereby continued from November 1, 1920, until the further order of this Commission. All of the conditions imposed in the original order shall remain in full force and effect. Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 17th day of November, NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION, H. G. Taylor, Chairman. Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4053 In the Matter of the Application of The Lynch k Telephone Company for Authority to In - crease Rates. HALL, Commissioner: IThe Lynch Telephone Company was organized and began operation the town of Lynch and the adjacent vicinity some years prior to 1910. The records do not give the exact date of its beginning. In 1910 a Mr. Binkerd, father of A. A. Binkerd, traded a farm for all the properties of the company. He took his son into partnership with him in the telephone business and immediately sold him a quarter interest for which the son paid him $2000 in money and stock. Later his son bought another quarter interest for $2000, which gave him a half interest for $4000- In 1915 the son purchased the other half interest of this stock for $5000, making a total capitalized outlay by the son, of $9,000. From the be - ginning of the company, to the present time, the books have not been kept in a manner that makes it possible to get a clear understanding of the operating revenues and the disbursements of them. The applicant, in its application, has filed an engineering study which was made by the Topping Valuation company of Kansas City. This company has placed the cost value of the property at $23,364.00, and the present value of $19,544. Many elements are included in this valuation, </seg>
            <seg id="p227">227 however, which the Commission cannot recognize for a basis of rate making, and the Commission has turned over to its engineering depart - ment the quantities of materials as furnished by the Topping Valuation company, to which our engineering department has applied its unit cost prices and made a general depreciation study of the properties, the Com - mission's department taking the same quantity of property that the Topping Valuation company furnished, and simply estimating the present valuation of the properties without having viewed the propeity. The department finds the original cost of the property to be $18,491, and the present value to be $11,374.95. The Commission cannot accept either one of these valuations as conclusive at this time. The Commission's en - gineering department has had no opportunity to examine the properties, which of course makes it impossible for them to say what the present conditions of the properties are. The applicant has not been able, in any reasonable degree, to furnish the Commission its operating revenues and the disbursements of the same, for past years. The applicant states that down to 1918 he mixed his own private funds with the telephone funds and did not attempt to make any separation between the two. Nor can the applicant tell how many phones were in service during particular years of the past, which of course makes it impossible for the Commission to give much of an idea as to its financial condition in past years. He has furnished a very fair statement for nine months of the year 1919, which shows that his total receipts for the nine months were $2,999.99. This extended for the full year would make total receipts of $3,999.86. The statement also shows that the entire expenditures for the nine months were $2,886.02. of which the direct operating expenses including taxes and insurance for the period, amounts to $1,090.45. This extended for the year amounted to $1587.27. This item, of course, does not include lineman's expenses, which should properly be counted in with maintenance and depreciation, which will be provided for in a separate item. In arriving at this figure we divide the lineman's and manager's salary, which is $1200 per year, into two parts — $600 for lineman, and $600 for manager. The 600, of course, to be taken care of out of the maintenance and depreciation charges. We then have, according to ths company's own statement, $1587.27 for direct operating expenses. Taking a tentative figure of $18,400 as the cost of the properties, as shown by our engineering depart - ment, and allowing 10 r 'r for maintenance and depreciation on that basis, we would have an annual expense of $1840, and then allowing %1r divi - dends upon a capitalization of $10,000 we would have a charge of $800 for dividends. We then have the following for operating expenses: Maintenance and depreciation $1840.00 Total $4227.27 Dividends on $10,000 8Vr 800.0&lt; Direct operating expenses, including taxes and insurance 1587.2' </seg>
            <seg id="p228">THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 228 As shown above the approximate operating income ac 3999.86 count is • Leaving a deficit of $ 227.41 Standing on these tentative figures for the present, it is clear to the Commission that there must be some rise in rates- The probabilities are that if the company could throw up its entire operating income for the past, and the disbursements of the same during the past years, and show how much had gone into operation of the properties, and how much for maintenance, depreciation and how much for extensions and better - ments, and how much the company had sacrificed for additions by reason of additions and betterments, there would be a valuation in the plant upon which the company is entitled to earn dividends somewhat higher than the $10,000; and we are taking the $10,000 and allowing 8&lt;7c upon it only tentatively; and until such time as a more comprehensive inven - tory, depreciation and accounting study can be made by the Commission. The company is now operating business and residence phones, and at prices as shown by the following tabulation : Rural phones 161 @ 1.00 making a total of _ 262 phones It then switches 46 phones at 25c per month It will be noted by the tabulation that 16 business phones pay $1.50, 10 — $1.75. This is due to the fact that the sixteen subscribers pay their rental one year in advance, while the ten pay monthly in advance; and ro with the other classes of phones. LThe Commission is of the opinion that the sixteen business sub - bers should be increased 25c per month, the 58 town residence sub - scribers should be increased 25c per month, and the rural 161 phones should be increased . 25c per month, and the switching charges should be increased to 50c per month. The Commission has not made a direct study and allocation of the cost for switching service made by the com - pany, but based upon many other studies the figure cannot be far from the proper one. This will give an increase of $3.00 per month on 235 phones, which amounts to $705. The increase on the switching rates will amount to $138, a total increase of $843. Everything else remain - ing the same, this would wipe out the deficit of $227.41, and leaving a surplus for the year of $615-59. The Commission is of the opinion that the company shou'd make monthly reports for at least six months, to the Commission of its entire operating income and the disbursements of the Business phones 10 Business phones 16 Town Residence phones 9 Town Residence phones 58 Rural phones 8 @ @ @ @ @ 11.75 1.50 1.25 1.00 1.25 </seg>

The Commission is also of the opinion that the company should charge all of its business subscribers the same rate and collect from them in advance, on or before the 10th of the current month, and that this should also apply to the town residence subscribers; that the farm subscribers should pay the same rate, and the company should collect from them quarterly on or before the end of the first month of the quarter. The Commission is further of the opinion that should the subscribers not pay their telephone rentals in accordance with the above, the com - pany should charge them 25c extra per month for the non-payment of their subscription when they are due.

Appearances: For applicant — Hall, Baird &amp; Williams, attorneys, OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: In an order effective August first, 1919, this Commission authorized the Western Union Telegraph company to continue in effect rates pre - viously ordered by the postmaster general which represented a 20 per cent increase above the rates effective in this state prior to the federal order. In that order the rates as approved were made to terminate on December 31, 1919. Because of a press of duties in December, the Commission issued a supplemental order extending the rates to April first, 1920. Because of the inability of the company to have representa - tives present for hearing prior to April first, the Commission, on March 22, 1920, again extended the rates to June first, 1920, but set the matter down for hearing for May 5, 1920, and on that date a hearing was had at which the company submitted evidence in support of its application for an indefinite continuation of the present rates. Prior to June first, the rates were again temporarily extended by the Commission to August first, 1920. The company in making application for an indefinite continuation of the present rates on intrastate traffic makes clear that in so doing it in no way desires to prejudice or abandon an application made several yean ago for authority to depart from the rates fixed in what is known as the Stebbins Act (Section 7408, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913). The company at this time is not prepared to furnish a valuation of its pro - perty in Nebraska, and for that reason cannot proceed to a hearing for a </seg>
            <seg id="p232">232 permanent modification of the rates fixed in the Stebbins Act. It ex - pects to have such a valuation available as soon as the Federal valuation of its property now in progress is completed. Because of its claim that the expenses of conducting the telegraph business in Nebraska exceed the present revenues, a valuation is not regarded as being essential. The company submits extensive data in support of its allegation that it is operating its intrastate business at a loss. According to the showing, applicant has not escaped substantial increases in cost of labor and materials. In its commercial department the salary advances have been as follows: Class of Employe Average Rate of Pay Jan. 1, 1915 Jan. 1, 1920. In the traffic department, which includes all operators, the increase on January first, 1920, over January first, 1915, averages over 61 per cent. Thirteen out of the twenty-one classes named show an increase of over 70 per cent, and six out of the thirteen show increases of from 104 to 127 per cent. Equally pronounced are the advances in the plant or main- tenance department. As against the average during a five year period from 1910 to 1914, the wages paid to linemen, groundmen and others employed in maintenance work in August, 1919, range from 75 per cent to 137 per cent higher. When subsistence for the gangs is taken into consideration and allowance is made for an eight hour day as against a ten hour day, the increases are much more striking. Figures submitted as to increased material cost bear out common knowledge as to present high price levels. There can be no question, therefore, that the company is subjected at the present time to greatly increased operating costs over its experience prior to the war and during the period immediately fol- lowing the passage of the Stebbins Act. In an attempt to allocate the revenues and expenses properly at - tributable to the Nebraska intrastate business, applicant employs a num - ber of methods, all more or less complicated and to some extent arbi - trary. With respect to revenues, only the receipts actually collected within the state are reported- That is to say, receipts are credited to the state from messages originating and paid for in Nebraska and from those messages terminated in the state for which collection is made at point of destination. It is assumed for the purpose of such a plan, that the receipts actually collected in the state will equal the receipts collected on Nebraska business outside the state. Such an assumption may not be far from the fact, although we can see that its accuracy might be materially affected by the preponderance of traffic originating and ter - minating at Omaha. This traffic represents a large part of the total in the state, and the location of Omaha on the eastern boundary of the anager , $71.48 perators 58 15 lerks 53.91 [essengers l 27.95 129.80 106.59 79.62 49.78 </seg>
            <seg id="p233">233 state serves to distort general averages for the state as a whole. This is well illustrated by the studies made by the company as to the average mileage of the various classes of messages. It was found that interstate messages travel an average distance of 107 miles in Nebraska, while intrastate messages have an average haul of 160 miles. The low average on interstate traffic is due to the fact that 75 per cent of the interstate business originating in Omaha goes eastward, and the distance from Omaha to the state line being practically nil, the average is very much reduced as a consequence. Because of this fact and for the further reason that there is a very heavy relay traffic at Omaha, the Commission is of the opinion that a more accurate and equitable result would be se - cured by segregating the Omaha business from that of the remainder of the state and subjecting it to separate analysis. We are also of the opinion that a more definite result would be secured if both the inbound and outbound traffic was reported instead of using only the cash collected within the state as the sole measure of the company's gross revenue. At least, such a method would render assumptions unnecessary and state the facts as they actually are. In arriving at a division of the expenses as between the trans-state business on the one hand and the interstate and intrastate on the other, the company uses two methods. To allocate the maintenance of plant expenses the mileage basis is used. That is, the total mileage of trans - state messages is ascertained and likewise the total mileage of interstate and intrastate messages- The ratio of the first to the second, which in this instance is 85.5 per cent trans-state and 14.5 per cent interstate and intrastate, is then used to divide the maintenance expenses. This ap - pears to be a reasonably fair method inasmuch as it takes into consider - ation to a large extent the use of the property by each class of traffic, and the use measures in a large degree the amount of repairs or main - tenance incurred. It probably would produce a more nearly accurate re ult if the average length of messages could also be ascertained and used as a factor as this would bear directly upon the time the circuits and other equipment are employed by the various classes of traffic. For the division of most of the traffic expenses, where the expense is not directly assignable, the message handlings basis is employed. A study was made to determine the number of transactions or physical handlings each message required. These handlings vary, of course, with the class of service involved. It was found in this manner that 18 per cent of the physical handlings were chargeable to the trans-state traffic in Nebraska and 82 per cent to the state and interstate traffic. Such traffic costs as could not be directly assigned to any particular class of message were thus apportioned on this ratio. The method seems to be equitable as it reflects the actual performance of employees and equip - ment occasioned by each class of traffic. When it cornea to a division of the interstate and intraatate expenses, </seg>
            <seg id="p234">THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 234 however, the company departs from the methods above outlined and adopts the revenue basis. That is, it uses the ratio of the intrastate revenue to the total inter and intrastate revenue, the intrastate revenue being in this case, 26-3 per cent of the total. Of those expenses not directly assignable to state traffic, therefore, 26.3 per cent are by this method charged to intrastate business. The record is not clear as to the company's reasons for using this method of division for intrastate business. It would seem that the same reasons that prompted the use of the mileage and message handlings bases in order to separate the trans - state business from the whole would apply with equal fairness to a division of the state and interstate business. The use of the revenue basis results in assigning to Nebraska a larger proportion of the ex - penses than would result from the other method. By the use of the methods outlined, applicant reaches the following conclusion with reference to the operating results in Nebraska for the year 1919: Operating Revenues $146,589 The increase of 20 per cent in rates became effective April first, 1919. Had the increase been effective during the full year, the additional re - venues would have amounted to $4,980. Substantial increases in labor cost were made effective August first, 1919, and January first, 1920. If these increases had been in effect throughout the year 1919 that would have increased the operating expense in the amount of $12,466. With these adjustments therefore, the total deficit for the year 1919 would have been $32,995. This statement makes no allowance whatever for interest on bonds or dividends on capital stock. As stated, the value of the property assignable to Nebraska intrastate traffic is not available and for that reason no attempt is made to show what a fair earning should be- As stated above, the Commission is of the opinion that it would have been more equitable to have followed the same method for the division of expenses for all the classes of traffic, but it is probable that even such a readjustment would not change the final result to a sufficient extent to overcome the deficit It is apparent therefore that the rates now in effect are not unreasonable and that they should be continued.

OPINION AND FINDING HALL, Commissioner The Nuckolls County Independent Telephone company was incor - porated in May, 1904, and issued stock which was paid for at par, as follows: For the year ending April 1, 1905 $ 8,582.50 For the year ending April 1, 1906 6,634.80 For the year ending April 1, 1907 4,792.50 For the year ending April 1, 1908 2,040.20 For the year ending April 1, 1909 417.60 For the year ending April 1, 1910 687.50 For the year ending April 1, 1911 137.50 For the year ending April 1, 1912 350.00 For the year ending April 1, 1913 75.00 For the year ending April 1, 1914 75.00 For the year ending April 1, 1915 100.00 For the year ending April 1, 1916 25.00 Making a total reciept from stock sales $23,917.50 This used in the construction of exchanges at Nelson, Nora, Angus, Ruskin, and Oak. As new phones were demanded the company used a large portion of its operating revenues in extending its properties to the extent that the dividends paid out were restricted to less than reasonable and the total original cost of the properties, according to the report of the en- gineering department of the Commission, amounted to $70,841.06. Thi» </seg>
            <seg id="p236">236 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT tie it impossible for the company to declare and pay reasonable divi - ds and properly maintain the properties because of the large ex - tensions that had been constructed. This resulted in the properties that cost $70,841.06 depreciating: to $41,796.01, the present or depreciated value as shown by the report of the engineers. The company now faces two propositions: 1. The stockholders have not, nor are they now receiving proper 2. A large re-construction which will call for much more money than that necessary for normal maintenance and depreciation. Lin short, these are the conditions upon which the company bases application for an increase in rates. The present rates are $1.60 for business and $1.00 for residence and farm phones. It asks to increase the business rate seventy-five cents per month and the residence and farm rates fifty cents per month. bThe company is operating 116 business and 1,094 residence and i phones. The increase asked for would make a total increase per of $7,608.00. If the operating revenues are insufficient to operate, maintain the plant, and pay dividends in a proper amount, the rates should be raised to make up the deficiency, of course, considering what the past revenues have done. But if the revenues have been used in building up large properties during the early years when the realized depreciation was small and the stockholders were receiving small divi - dends, then a complete check should be made of all revenues received and the disbursements of the same that the relative rights of the public and that of the company might be determined. Assuming that the company should have received seven per cent net dividends through all the years upon its investments, we will charge to the company all dividends received and credit it with the amount less than seven per cent that it received. We will then credit the company with seven per cent interest on the deferred dividends down to April 1, 1919. Likwise, when the company paid out more than seven per cent, we will charge it with the excess and seven per cent upon the excess down to April 1, 1919. The credits less the debits will be the sacrifice the com - pany has made in deferred dividends for the full period based upon a seven per cent net return. This will be shown by the following tabulation, which shows the amount of money paid in, when paid in, the rate of divi - dends paid, the amount of dividends, the amount of dividends deferred, the Kst on the deferred dividends, the amount in excess of seven per ■aid out as dividends, and the interest on the excess down to April »: </seg>

The studies of the department through a course of years, from a standpoint of the service to be rendered, show that telephone properties should be main - tained to at least seventy condition per cent.

The present value being $41,796.01, the value of the property falls short of the seventy condition per cent by the difference between the last two figures amounting to 17,792.69. It is the duty of the corporation to provide itself with suffi - cient capital to construct adequate facilities to furnish the service rea - sonably required and that of the public to pay rates sufficient to raise revenues to operate, maintain the plant, and pay a fair rate of dividends upon the investment by the company. The company did not get a fair rate of dividends and we are allowing, as shown above, $9,602.31 as a stock dividend to make up the deficit which brings the capital up to $33,519.81 and we are of the opinion that the company should sell ad - ditional stock in the amount of $7,980.19, which will make the total out - standing stock $41,500. It will be noted that the figure above of $7,792.69 would bring the properties up to the seventy condition per cent. The last figure of $7,980.19 is used not only to bring thq properties up to seventy condition per cent, but make an even amount in stock issue. The capital stock then outstanding will be as follows: Original stock $23,917.50 Total stock $41,500.00 When the $7,980.19 has been spent on the properties, the present value of $41,796.01 will have been increased to $49,776.20. This will show a value in the plant above the then outstanding stock of $8,276.20, or 11 plus per cent based on the original cost of the properties of $70,841.06 and will be available for capitalization should some unforeseen contin - gency arise making it necessary to secure funds for replacements or reconstruction. This amount should not be considered as a part of the value in the plant upon which the company should receive returns. Therefore, the Commission finds that the amount upon which the applicant should receive dividends, assuming that the company will spend on the properties the $7,980.19 as shown above, is $41,500, and rates will be made sufficient after all other expenditures are taken care of, to pay dividends upon that amount at seven per cent, making a total annual dividend of $2,905.00. The operating statement of the company for the year ending April I, 1919, shows a net profit for dividends of but $746.41. It asks for an increase of $7,608, based upon an estimated increase in expenses of $6,922. Upon this showing the increase in rates over the increase in the expenses amounts to $686. The net above expenses, according to the operating expenses for the last year, as shown above is $746.41, which would leave a net for dividends per year of $1,432.41. itock dividend Additional stock, the proceeds of which are to be spent on the properties 9,602.3 7,980.1 </seg>

The Commis- sion does not look with favor on deferring dividends when earned by the corporation to its stockholders and investing; the money in extensions to the properties because such a policy has a strong tendency to discredit the securities, resulting in many small stockholders selling their stock for less than what it is worth because they do not realize that their stock is worth a premium. The Commission is therefore of the opinion and so finds that all extensions and betterments constructed in the future shall be provided for out of the proceeds of sales of securities and that the company shall, when all of the above conditions are complied with, pay dividends at the end of each fiscal year at the rate of seven per cent on $41,500, amounting to $2,905.00.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4068 In the Matter of the Application of the Northern Telephone Company of Creighton, Nebraska, for authority to increase exchange rates. Appearances: For Applicant — J. A. C. Kennedy and Philip E. Horan, Attorneys, and E. C. Hunt, General Manager. TAYLOR, Commissioner: This company is owned by E. C. Hunt and wife, and Mr. H. A. Cheney, a banker at Creighton. The outstanding capital is $50,000. The </seg>
            <seg id="p244">244 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT property consists of two exchanges, one serving 595 subscribers at Creighton and the other serving 46 at Niobrara. It is a grounded sys - tem. Switching service is furnished from the Niobrara exchange to about 60 farmers who own and maintain their lines. While there is $50,000 of stock outstanding, applicant makes claim to the present invest - ment in the property of only $40,000. It is alleged that $50,000 was originally invested in the property, but in 1914 certain toll lines of the company were sold for a consideration of $10,000. This money was dis - tributed to the stockholders but the outstanding capital was not reduced in a corresponding amount. Since that time dividends have been com - puted on the $40,000 only. Applicant submitted figures intended to show the original cost of the physical property as disclosed by its books and records. The plant, according to those figures, has cost $38,137.54. Included in these properties is real estate upon which the value of $8, - 125.90 is placed. The Commission has been unable up to this time to make a valuation of this property For that reason we have no means of checking the accuracy of the figures submitted by applicant. For reasons which will be given later, it is essential, before any permanent rates are fixed, that the valuation of the property be determined. Ac - cordingly, any rates approved herein will be subject to the condition that the valuation shall be made. kThe Company now asks for a substantial increase in its rates, al - ig very large increases in wages and material costs. The rates in t at present, and those proposed, are as follows: Note: — A discount of 25c is allowed to farm subscribers who pai their rental by the 10th of the month, and 15c if they pay by the 15th of the month. The record supports the claim of applicant that operating ex - penses have materially increased in recent months. For example, prior to July 20, 1919, the salaries paid to operators were $30, $35, and $40 per month. Four of the same operators now receive $50 per month, and two receive $60 per month. One of the operators receiving $60 per month does a portion of the collecting for which she is allowed $5 per month. The srlary of the local manager is now $135 per month. Or - iginally it wv $80 per month, bat has steadily been increased during Business Telephone Present $2.00 1.75 Propose $2.50 2.25 Residence Telephones M 211 1.50 1.25 1.75 1.50 Farm Telephones 328 1.50 1.75 Niobrara Switching Rate about 60 .25 .50 </seg>
            <seg id="p245">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 245 the past two or three years. $5.00 of the manager's salary is charged to collection. No definite separation of the manager's salary as between maintenance work and executive work, was made by applicant. The Commission lacks conclusive information as to how this salary should be divided, but it is clear that some portion of it at least, should be charged against maintenance, as the manager undoubtedly is employed for a considerable portion of his time to such work. For the purpose of the present case, and basing our conclusion on the experience of other companies, we will allocate $100 to his work as manager, and the re - maining $35 to his work as lineman. Mr. Hunt, president ami general manager of the company, has in the past received $75 a month for his services. Mr. Hunt operates another telephone system with headquar - ters at Malmo, Nebraska. He resides at Malmo and visits Creighton only three or four times a year. His local manager furnishes him with a daily report of the revenues and expenses and from these, Mr. Hunt keeps the permanent records of the company. He asks for an increase of $50 per month in his salary. The Commission has given careful con - sideration to this matter and has reached the conclusion that such an increase is hardly justified under the circumstances. The company has a competent local manager who is paid a sufficient salary to call for all of his time in connection with the operation of the plant. Mr. Hunt has only a general supervision of the company's affairs and as stated, visits the property only three or four times annually. Mr. Cheney, who is heavily interested in the company, lives at Creighton and is in a position to be consulted by the local manager in cases of emergency. Mr. Hunt gives practically his undivided attention to the affairs of the other tele - phone company at Malmo, which consists of four exchanges. It does not seem reasonable to the Commission, therefore, that his services can be worth $125 per month to applicant company, and we are of the opinion that his former salary of $75 per month is sufficient. In its statement of operating expenses, applicant makes a claim for maintenance of $519.57 per month, which presumably is intended to cover all costs* of material, auto expenses, and livery hire, and extra labor. In addition to that a regular lineman is hired at a salary of $100 per month, to which should be added $35 per month of the salary of the local manager. This makes a total of $654.57 per month for maintenance ex - penses, or $7,854.00 per year. Such an allowance for this purpose is un - doubtedly excessive. It amounts to approximately 21 per cent of the value of the physical property as claimed by applicant. If we eliminate the real estate, upon which there is but a slight depreciation, the amount claimed would represent over 25 per cent of the physical valuation of the plant. For the past year the Commission has, in practically every case involving telephone maintenance, made an allowance of 10 per cent of the physical valuation of the property. This is varied of course to meet conditions. The amount claimed by applicant is approximately doable its average expenditures for the past nine and a half years, and in the opinion of the Commission these expenditures have been unusually </seg>
            <seg id="p246">246 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT high. For the nine and a half year period from 1910 to 1918 inclusive. the company shows a total expenditure for maintenance of $36,675, or an average of $3800 per year. It will be noted that in the nine and a half years the company has expended within $1500 of the total value of its physical plant. Notwithstanding the statement of Mr. Hunt, that none of these expenditures have covered new construction or additions to the property, it is very probable that a portion of the funds have gone for these purposes. Mr. Hunt states that the property has been visited by at least four destructive sleet storms during this period. This would of course increase the maintenance cost, but not to the extent shown. There appear to be no unusual condition in this property which warrants such excessive maintenance costs. The farm lines are not longer on the average than on many other companies of similar size. The country served is somewhat rough and broken, but not unusually so. It is rec- ognized of course, that the present increased costs of labor and mater- ial necessitates greater allowance for maintenance and depreciation, but in the opinion of the Commission, the 10 per cent set aside for other companies should be sufficient for applicant. It will be adopted in this case, for the present. If the final valuation of the property, and a fur- ther study of the expenditures justifies a larger amount, it will be al- lowed. With adjustments in the operating statement to correspond with the charges we have just discussed, the operating revenues and expenses for the month of July, 1919, would have been as follows: REVENUES: Subscriber Stations $ 846.75 Switching Stations ' 15.00 Rent from Building 26.90 Installation 20.00 Tolls 135.00 Miscellaneous 25.00 Total $1,068.65 $1,068.65 EXPENSES: Operation— 6-4 at $50, 2 at $60 $ 320.00 Stationary and Advertising 19.75 light, Heat, Water 30.00 Incidentals 10.25 Total $ 380.00 $380.00 GENERAL: .__$ 100.00 Manager President and General Manager 76.00 5.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p247">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 247 Traveling Expenses . 12.50 The monthly deficit just shown, if extended for the period of a year, would amount to $1510. In this connection the Commission desires to point out that the investment of $40,000 appears to be somewhat ex - cessive. The fact as to this cannot be determined by this record. It should be noted, however, that the amount claimed exceeds the original cost of the property by approximately $2000. Dividends on $40,000 have been paid since 1910, averaging 6.7 per cent. Prior to that time, ac - cording to the testimony of Mr. Hunt, no dividends were ever received by the owners. The Commission makes no finding as to the fair value of the property in this case, reserving that matter for further investi - gation. The rates proposed by applicant would produce an increased revenue of approximately $2200. It is apparent from the showing made that such an increase is not justified. The following schedule appears to the Commission to be much more reasonable under the circumstances. $2.50 per month. Business ( Desk i Business ( Wall ) 2.25 per month. 2.00 per month.

Switching Service This schedule would produce added revenue in the amount of $1073-40 per year. This lacks approximately $450 of covering the deficit shown, but the Commission is of the opinion that the revenues thus produced will be sufficient to protect the company for the time being. The net surplus thus remaining will amount to 6.86 per cent on the $40,000 of capital. The schedule as we have outlined it, therefore, will be approved, subject to certain conditions.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4C68 In the Matter of the Application of the Northern Telephone Company of Creighton, Nebraska, for Authority to Increase Exchange Rates. Appearances: Chas. F. McLaughlin, attorney; E. C. Hunt, manager, SUPPLEMENTAL FINDING AND ORDER TAYLOR, Chairman: The original order in this case approved certain increases in rates for exchange service that were to be in effect for a period of six months, or until August 1, 1920. These rates were less than those applied for by the company at that time. Prior to that date the company renewed its application asking for the rates as originally applied for. The Com - mission was unable to set the matter down for hearing prior to August 1, so that by motion the original rates were extended until September Pursuant to the original order the company has filed monthly state - ments cf its operating revenues and expenses. In the meantime the Commission's engineering department made an inventory and valuation of the property of applicant, thus providing a basis for a determination of the fair value of the property. This valuation shows the original ■:ost of the entire property to be $51,218.48. The present or depreciated cost is $36,710.52. Applicant offers no objection to the valuation as fixed by the engineers. As stated in the original order, the outstanding stock of the company at the present time is $50,000, but due to a sale of $10,000 worth of property several years ago, dividends when paid have been computed upon only $40,000 of this amount. The Commission is of the opinion that the present fair value of the property will not exceed $37, - 000. We increase the present depreciated value as found by the engi - neers a few hundred dollars in order to cover the installation of a new switchboard at the Niobrara exchange, which improvement has been made since the inventory was completed by the engineers. Thirty-seven thousand dollars, therefore, will be used as a basis for determining the return in this case. The Commission devoted considerable attention in the previous opin - ion to the expenditures for maintenance and depreciation. It was as - sumed that the expenditures were somewhat excessive when they were considered in relation to the value of the property as shown by the books </seg>
            <seg id="p250">250 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT of the company. The original cost, as shown by the books, was approxi- mately $38,000. An inventory of the property, however, discloses considerably larger original cost than waa shown by the books. It is necessary, therefore, to readjust the allowances for maintenance and de- preciation. For the six months period covered by the reports, actual expenditures amounted to $3,608.01. It is conceded by applicant that these expenditures are somewhat abnormal for the reason that the in- stallation of the new switchboard at Niobrara is included in the figures as well as very substantial replacements that were occasioned by a heavy sleet storm in the spring. In the former opinion the Commission made an allowance of ten per cent on the book value for maintenance and de- preciation, but after a study of the actual expenditures made by this com- pany we are of the opinion that this allowance should be increased to eleven per cent, which, when applied to the increased original cost, pro- duces an allowance of $5633.98 per year, or $2816.99 for the six months period. It will be observed that this will be considerably less than the experience of the company, but for the reason stated we are of the opin- ion that these figures were somewhat abnormal. A' summary of the revenues and expenses as shown by the monthly reports for the six months ending July 31, 1920, is as follows: SUMMARY OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES For Six Months Ending July 31, 1920. REVENUES Subscription rentals $6,036.10 Toll 948.90 Switching and toll — 304.75 Rent of buildin.gs 161.40 Installation and connection charges 224.00 Miscellaneous 234.44 Total $7,909.59 EXPENSES Operating Operators . $1,930.00 Stationery and Advertising 246.26 Light, heat and water 127.05 Incidentals 185.01 Messenger . 49.26 Total $2,537.57 General : Officers - $ 765.00 Insurance - 75.00 Clerks . 320.00 ToUl 1,160.06 </seg>
            <seg id="p251">251 It will be noticed that we have computed maintenance and depre - ciation at ten per cent on $51,218. Readjustment of this amount to com - ply with our previous finding would increase the expenditure for the per - iod in the amount of $256.09. In the revenue as shown for this six months period, appears the receipts for switching and added exchange service. The larger portion of this revenue is paid by the switching companies on the first of March. The revenue as shown, therefore, exceeds the pro rata for the period by at least $100. Deducting this from the revenue and adding the additional allowance for maintenance and depreciation of $256.09 for the six months period, we have a deficit for the period of $389.12. For the year this would amount to $778.24. Since the first hearing the company has found it necessary, in order to retain the man - ager at Creighton, to increase his salary from $135 per month to $175 per month. A portion of this increase is reflected in the six months showing. If the increase had become effective on February 1, the deficit as shown would have been somewhat increased. The original schedule of rates, which is now asked for would pro - duce added revenue in the amount of approximately $1200 per year. Using the six months experience as a basis, it would appear that the rates as proposed would produce a surplus of between $400 and $500 after all operating expenses and dividends are paid. This surplus, in the opin - ion of the Commission, is not more than is necessary to provide for unforeseen contingencies. It should be used by the company for benefit of the service and should not be paid out in dividends in excess of the eight per cent upon the $37,000. The Commission has required the company to give six months trial to the rates previously authorized and it now finds them to be inadequate. The rates as proposed appear to be reasonable and will be approved.

The rates at the present time are $1.75 for individual business, $1.25 for individual residence, $1.50 for party business and $1.00 for party residence and farm service. No metallic service is being provided at this time. Ap - plication is made to increase the individual grounded business rates from $1.75 to $2.75, individual grounded residence from $1.25 to $2.00, party line grounded residence from $1.00 to $1.75, and grounded farm line service from $1.00 to $1.75, a discount of twenty-five cents per month to be made from these rates for prompt payment.

This company was organized in 1902 with headquarters at Shelton. There were four incorporators of the company, but stock was sold at once to others and within the first three years the number of stockholders reached one hundred. Ten thousand dollars worth of stock was sold within this period and none has been sold by the corporation since that time. The history of the company is very similar to that of other in - dependent companies organized at that time. It came into life at the beginning of the period of telephone development in Nebraska as a result of a vigorous demand for service by the people of that community. Such was the demand for telephones that it taxed the finances and the ener - gies of the backers of the enterprise to keep pace with the development. At the outset the chief aim was to secure telephone service and not to make profits. For that reason the business was conducted at the lowest possible minimum cost. Officers served without compensation, or for nominal salaries. The first manager and lineman was paid $65 per month, for which he gave all of his time and the service of a team and wagon. There were no other paid officers for the first few years of the company's existence. Stockho'ders united in soliciting the sale of stock and in build - ing the lines, so that very little actual cash had to be paid for labor in the construction of the plant. No dividends were paid by the company for the first five years and no dividends have been paid for 1918 and 1919. Dividends ranging from five per cent to forty-five per cent have been paid by the company in other years, the average, based on the out - standing capital stock of $10,000, being fifteen per cent. The books of the company do not reflect any of the costs of the property that came through donations of labor and services. Manifestly, it is impossible for this Commission to go back over a period of eighteen years and de - termine accurately the amount of these contributed services. Consequent- </seg>
            <seg id="p254">254 ly it is impossible to reach a definite determination as to the actual sac - rifices made by the stockholders in the construction of this property. The officers of the company submitted an exhibit which purports to compute in detail the value of the services referred to. This statement covers commissions which should have been allowed to stockholders for the sale of stock, extra salary of $60 per month for the first manager and lineman, compensation for an extra team and wagon furnished for the use of the lineman by a stockholder, services of stockholders in mak - ing collections for the company, labor of stockholders in hauling poles, digging holes and doing other construction work during the first three years of the life of the plant, cost of team and auto furnished by the manager at Gibbon, and dividends on the cash capital and on the value of the services as thus detailed. By this method, sacrifices in the amount of $54,997.34 are determined. Following the hearing in this case the Commission, through its en - gineering department, made a physical valuation of the property and found an original cost of $53,595.15, and a present or depreciated cost of $31,841.52. Counsel for protestants directs criticism at the accuracy of this valuation, but further checking of the points criticized and com - parison of the figures with many other valuations made for companies of similar character indicate the correctness of the valuation as made. It shows an average value per station, original cost, of $50.00, which is conservative where two exchanges are involved, as in this case. It is claimed by counsel that applicant returned this property for assessment purposes at $14,000, and that this figure should le used as an indication of the value for rate-making purposes. Such a figure barely reflects the cost of the telephone instruments and labor to put them in place. It is manifestly low and cannot be accepted as any criterion for the real value of the plant. Protestants likewise make vigorous objection to any allowance for past services. The Commission, however, is confronted with the fact that there has been brought into existence a telephone plant costing originally at least $50,000 and the present value of which is now approx - imately $31,000. This plant came from somewhere. If the rates charged by the company during the period of its existence had been high, when compared with the rates charged by other telephone companies for such service, there might be a strong presumption that a considerable portion of the property came from surplus earnings. The rates, however, have been low. For several years the rate was uniformly $1.00 per month for all classes of service. Later the business rate was increased to $1.75 per month, but even at the present time over eight hundred subscribers secure service for $12.00 per year. Without most economical manage - ment and without the contribution of considerable labor and services, the present plant could not have been built. We are of the opinion that the claim made by the company for the value of these services is higher </seg>
            <seg id="p255">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 255 than the facts warrant. It is not unlikely, however, that the stockholders of the company have contributed in money and services somewhere be - tween $20,000 and $25,000. In arriving at a figure upon which to base a rate of return, this Commission cannot be unmindful of the overwhelming weight of court opinion with reference to what constitutes a present fair value. In The Lincoln Traction Company vs. City of Lincoln, et al., 171 N. W., 192 (104 Neb. — report not yet published), the supreme court of this state said: "That the rates should be based upon the present value of the property is thoroughly established by the decisions of the fed- eral courts and other courts." In this connection the court cites the celebrated case of Smyth vs. Ames, 169 U. S. 466. In that case the supreme court of the United States sets forth the various factors composing "Fair value" as follows: "the original cost of construction, the amount ex- pended in permanent improvements, the amount and market value of its bonds and stock, the present as compared with the original cost of construction, the probable earning capacity of the property under particular rates prescribed by statute, and the sum required to meet operating expenses." The court suggests that these are all matters for consideration and are to be given such weight as may be just and right in each case. The decision of the Nebraska supreme court in The Lincoln Traction company case is significant for two reasons; first, it is one of the latest declara - tions by the court on the question of value; and second, it dealt with a case in which the sacrifice theory was strongly stressed. The court in the same case ventures the comment that "it is not always easy to fix accurately the present value of such a property," the full force of which the Commission appreciates thoroughly in connection with the case under consideration. We have given considerable study to the issue as it is presented in this application and upon consideration of all of the factors and elements presented have reached the conclusion that $25,000 represents the present fair value of applicant's property for rate making purposes. This is $6,000 less than the present value of the phy - sical property as found by the engineers, but the Commission is of the opinion that the surplus of property ir. this amount may be very prop - erly required for the protection of the property and depreciation reserve. In support of its application for increased revenue, the company submitted a statement covering the operating revenues and expenses for the year ending July 31, 1919. Since the hearing, which was on Novem - ber 6, 1919, the report for the calendar year has become available and we have used the figures therein as being more reflective of present con - ditions. The revenue from subscribers' rentals is based on the actual </seg>
            <seg id="p256">256 X J% X X XI Lj j\ I JCrjX*^\J K I number of subscribers in service. The toll for 1919 reflects a substantial increase over that for the previous year, due largely to the cancellation of free service between Gibbon and Kearney. The statement for 1919 is as follows: REVENUES Sub. stations (gross) $13,263.00 Toll 2,025.75 Sundry sales 131.21 Other miscellaneous revenue 739.43 Total $16,159.39 $16,159.39 EXPENSES Maintenance and depreciation, (10 per cent on $53,595) $ 5,359.50 $5,359.50 Traffic : Operators $ 3,402.22 Power expense 28.20 3,430.42 Officers $ 3,660.00 Clerks 1,040.00 Rents 421.71 Stationery and printing 356.38 Office supplies and expenses 369.37 Other general expenses 607.51 $6,454.97 $15,244.89 Operating income $ 914.50 Deductions : I Taxes $ 318.00 Dividends 800.00 Total $ 1,118.00 $ 1,118.00 Deficit $ 203.50 It will be noted that in this statement we have computed dividends at eight per cent upon $10,000. Upon this basis a deficit of $203.50 is shown for the year. This deficit would be increased to $1403.50 if divi- dends were computed on the present fair value of $25,000. At the time of the hearing applicant was paying $50 per month to its operators, of which there are seven. It was predicted that these sal- </seg>
            <seg id="p257">257 aries would have to be increased to 060 per month. Since the hearing, however, the company has found it necessary to make a uniform increase of |15.00 per month, so that at the present time the salaries are $65.00 per month. It will be noted that the average monthly salary to operators in 1919 was only slightly more than $40 per month, so that the company has experienced an increase in this item alone of $175 per month. Upon the order of the Commission, it recently installed the standard accounting system prescribed by the Commission and has found it necessary to in - crease the salary of its chief bookkeeper to $90 per month, making an increase of $540 per year. Claim is made for the increase of the salary of another clerk in the amount of $15.00 per month, and because of the installation of the new accounting system an addition of $45.00 per month to the salary of the manager at Gibbon is asked for. The Commission feels constrained to question these increases. Indeed, we are of the opinion that the salaries paid to officers are larger than are necessary for a company of this sire. The manager at Gibbon receives $130 per month and the manager at Shelton $125 per month. In the past these men have assisted with the maintenance work to some extent, but with the addition of another line - man they will be relieved of such duties. It is prcbably nccersary that there be a manager at each exchange, but those holding those positions should put in their full time at managerial and clerical duties, so as to render unnecessary the employment cf additional bookkeepers and clerks. The present bookkeeper is a capable acccuntart and should be able to handle the clerical work without assistance. The manager at Gibbon, notwithstanding the bookkeeping has been centralized at that point, should not find his work materially increased by that fact, and his claim for additional salary appears to be unjustified. Nor does there appear 10 be any reason for employing a second clerk. Such an employee will be all the more unnecessary with the addition of two more operators, as will be provided for in this order. These girls should have time to per - form such incidental clerical duties as are required at each exchange. At I he present time the company pays a salary of $55.00 per month to its treasurer. So far as this record discloses this officer performs only nominal duties. As stated, all the accounts are kept at Gibbon and there is left but little for the treasurer, who resides at Shelton. It is suspected that the fact that he is one of the heavy stockholders in the company prompts the payment of his salary. He will receive dividerds on his investment, however, and there appears to be no good reason for allowing him more than $10 per month for the small service he performs. The combined salaries paid to the two managers amounts to $3060 at present. With the increased number of employees already referred to and to be discussed later the Commission is of the opinion that this amount should be reduced to not exceed $2500 per year. The general salaries of officers and clerks would thus be as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p258">258 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Managers $2500.00 Clerks 1080.00 $3580.00 At the time of the hearing considerable testimony was submitted tending to show that the service is not as good as it should be. The Commission can well believe that this may be true for the reason that the company has but one operator on the board at either exchange at one time. There are over 500 subscribers on each exchange. It is the ex - perience of other telephone companies that one operator cannot handle that many subscribers in addition to the toll traffic and give the best service. In this connection it should be stated that there is considerable toll traffic between Kearney and Gibbon which must be handled by the one operator in addition to her other duties. Certain farm subscribers on the Gibbon exchange have connection with the Shelton exchange and vice versa. This naturally increases the traffic handled by the operators. In the opinion of the Commission the company should employ at least two more operators, one for each exchange. At Gibbon this will probably necessitate the purchase of a new switchboard. This should not prevent the company, however, from putting on the added operator. If the sal - aries of the new operators are estimated at $60 per month, the added expense would amount to $1,440 for the year. Heretofore the maintenance work of the company has been handled by one lineman, except wh»re extensive construction or replacements made necessary the hiring of added labor. The company is now of the opinion that one man can not do the work and with this, conclusion we concur. Prompt repairs and quick attention to complaints are almost impossible where one rran attempts to cover a system consisting of two exchanges with over a thousand subscribers. The new lineman will be paid a sal - ary of at least $1500 per year. This salary will be charged against the maintenance and depreciation allowance. In view of this substantial in - crease in the labor expense together with the other large increases in material r.nd labor items the Commission is of the opinion that the al - lowance for this purpose should be increased from 10 per cent to 11 per cent cf the original cost of the property. This will amount to $535.95. Recasting the operating expenses to cover the reductions and in - tes as above discussed we have the following: Increase to operators, 7 at $25- $2100.00 Two additional operators at $60 1440.00 Increase to bookkeeper $45 540.00 Increase for maintenance and depreciation 535.95 </seg>

This is somewhat more than appears to be re - quired. The schedule as prayed for is rather out of line with reference to the rates asked for for residence service. The company asks that a net rate of $1.75 be granted for individual line residence service, $1.50 for party line residence service, and $2.00 for residence telephones with - in a radius of one mile of the city limits. In our opinion these rates should be reduced twenty-five cents per month, making the net individual res - idence rate $1.50, the party residence rate $1.25, and the residence rate within one mile of the city limits $1.75. This reduces the anticipated increase in the amount of $1176 and leaves a prospective increase of $4924. On this basis the increase in revenue will leave a surplus of ap - proximately $400, as shown by the statement we have detailed, not tak - ing into account loss from any uncollectible accounts. In the opinion of the Commission the rates suggested are reasonable and should be ap - proved. Applicant makes request for authority to file rates for metallic ser - vice. It has no metallic service at this time, but contemplates rebuilding its exchange to that basis as soon as possblie. At the present time it has a few farm lines that are paralleled by an electric transmission line, the induction from which causes considerable interference with the ser - vice. It will be necessary to make these lines metallic at once. The Commission believes that the company should not make a charge for metallic service unti- a considerable portion of the plant at each exchange is rebuilt. It is not likely that the work of reconstruction can be ac - complished for some time to come and for that reason a metallic schedule will not be approved at this time except as to the farm line rates where it becomes necessary to rebuild the lines in order to protect against elec - tric interference. Applicant asks for an increase of 25 cents per month on this class of service but inasmuch as only a partial metallic service can be rendered for the time being an increase of 15c per month will be approved, making a rate of $1.65.

At the hearing in that case representatives of the patrons at Gibbon appeared and objected. The Commission found at that time that the application was reasonable and should be allowed. At the hearing in this case the patrons protested the discontinuance of this service and asked that it be reinstated . The Commission has given careful consideration to their demands, but reaches the conclusion that for the best interest of the service and in view of the operating revenues of the company it is not considered advisable or equitable to restore this service. It may be stated frankly that the re - duction of twenty-five cents per month on residence telephone service is made possible through the discontinuance of the free service. The company desires to establish a discount system in connection with its collection of monthly rentals, a gross rate being stated from which a discount of twenty-five cents per month will be given for prompt pay - ment. This practice is practically universal in the state and will be ap - proved in this instance.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4074 In the matter of the Application of the Crownover Telephone Company of Sargent, for Authority to Issue $3,455.77 of Stock. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: Applicant herein has outstanding at the present time common stock in the amount of $22,165.20. It makes application for authority to issue additional stock in the amount of $3,455.77. The affairs of this company have been reviewed by the Commission in a number of rate and stock applications, so that it is unnecessary to detail them here. The application in this instance is intended to cover additions and bet - terments made to the physical property between July 1, 1916, and Jan - uary 1, 1920, in the amount of $3,682.27. From this should be de - ducted $226.50, which covers property sold and surplus earned and re - invested in the plant. No dividends have been paid by the company since July 1, 1918, all of the money which might properly have been paid out for this pur - pose having been reinvested in the additions and betterments referred to. These dividends at 7 per cent, plus interest on the deferred pay - ments, amount to $2,408.79. The remaining $1,046.98 represents mon - ey taken from the depreciation reserve and invested in improvements in the property. It is proposed to issue stock to the stockholders in lieu of the unpaid dividends, the remaining stock to be sold and the pro - ceeds used to replenish the depreciation reserve. Information in great detail is submitted by applicant in support of the figures covering the additions and betterments to the plant. The books and accounts of this company are kept according to a system prescribed by the Commission and there appears to be no reason to question any of the figures submitted. The total assets of the company, as shown by its annual report on December 31, 1919, were $32,070, so </seg>
            <seg id="p262">262 it is manifest there would be an ample margin in the property over and above the stock that will be outstanding, if this issue is approved. Upon consideration of all the facts submitted, the Commission is of the opinion that the amount of stock asked for by the company is rea - sonably necessary and should be approved. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Crownover Telephone com - pany be and the same hereby is authorized to issue and sell its com - mon stock in the amount of (3,455.77; such stock to be sold at par and no less; the proceeds from the sale of same to be used to pay the ac - crued dividends of the company to January 1, 1920, with interest there - on and to reimburse the depreciation reserve fund in the amount as shown in the foregoing findings. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant shall, within sixty days of the date of this order, report to the Commission the sales of all stock herein authorized, to whom sold and the amount received for same, together with report as to disposition of the proceeds of the same. If all the stock herein authorized is not sold within sixty days reports shall be made to the Commission every 60 days until all of the issue is disposed of.

Appearances: For Applicant — O. R. Thompson, President J. W. Richmond, Secretary; H. E. Leisy, Treasurer. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Chairman This company was organized as a mutual concern in 1902. At the outset it was operated as a strictly mutual concern, all users of the ser - vice being required to purchase stock. Later, however, as the business grew, the company began to rent telephones and to enter the commer - cial field until it finally became an ordinary commercial company. It is ■till owned very largely by fanners and has 290 stockholders. </seg>
            <seg id="p263">263 The property consists of two exchanges, one at Wisner, which is the headquarters of the company, and the other at Beemer. It served at the time of the hearing in this case 938 subscribers from the two ex - changes, service being universal as between any part of the system. The plant is entirely metallic with a central energy system at Wisner. The history of the company from 1902 until 1912 is more or less ob - scure because of the lack of authentic records. The books show, how - ever, up to that time stock in the amount of $15,594 had been issued. Officers and stockholders connected with the company testified that this stock represented either actual cash contributions or deferred dividends. Two dividends of five per cent each were declared during this period and paid in stock. Two dividends of five per cent each were also issued and paid in cash, these being the only dividends paid by the company for the period from 1902 to 1912. Since that date an accurate record of all stock issues has been kept and a careful accounting made of the additions and betterments to the property since that time. In 1912 competing plants at Wisner and Beemer owned by the Nebraska Tele - phone company were purchased by applicant and consolidated with its exchanges. The price paid for the Nebraska Telephone company's prop - erty was $15,500 and the cost of consolidation and improvements to the consolidated plant made at that time brought the total expenditure up to $17,662, for which cash was paid in by the stockholders and stock is - sued. The stock outstanding at the present time amounts to $51,782. Since 1913 dividends at the rate of seven per cent have been paid upon the outstanding stock. It is apparent that stock outstanding today rep - resents an actual investment in the property. A valuation made by the engineers of this department shows the original cost of the property to be $93,201.44. The depreciated or pres - ent value was found to be $63,848.77. The original cost at this figure represents an average cost per station of $95.20. It is manifest from this figure that the property is of a high class of construction. As a matter of fact, the management of the company has maintained the policy for the past ten years of installing only the best equipment re - gardless of its initial cost. The result is a plant equal in engineering standard of construction, selection of equipment, and operating condition to the best telephone plants in Nebraska. It follows that the service rendered by the company is considerably above the average. The company applies for increased rates because of constantly in - creasing costs of operation. Its rates at the present time are as follows: Beemer : Individual business — $2.50 per mo. Two-party business 2.00 per mo. Individual residence 2.00 per mo. Four-party residence 1.50 per mo. Farm 1.60 per mo. </seg>
            <seg id="p264">264 Wiraer: Individual business $2.50 per mo. Two-party business 2.00 per mo. Individual residence 2.00 per mo. Two-party residence 1.75 per mo. Four-party residence 1.50 per mo. Farm 1.50 per mo. The company now proposes to increase its individual business rate from $2.50 per month to $3.00 per month, its two-party business rate from $2.00 per month to $2.50 per month, and its farm line rate from $1.50 per month to $2.00 per month. It also asks authority to make a charge of $1.00 per issue for the extra listing of a name in its di- rectory and for an additional charge of twenty-five cents per month for residence service and $1.00 per month for business service where two parties make use of the same telephone. In common with all other telephone companies operating in this state, applicant is experiencing very substantial increases in its operating expenses. Some of these increases have been realized and are reflected in its operating statement for the past year. Other increases are neces- sary if efficient employees are to be secured and retained. At the time of the hearing in this case, the operating revenues and expenses for the year 1919 were available for only the first six months. At the pres- ent time, however, the figures are at hand covering: the full year. Re- adjusting the statement, in so far as the allowance for maintenance and depreciation is concerned, by using ten per cent of the original cost of the property, as found by the Commission's engineers, instead of the figures submitted by the company, we have the following showing for the twelve months of 1919: .RESULTS OF OPERATION FOR 1919 Revenue Subscribers' Station $17,847.00 Toll revenue 1,549.73 Miscellaneous 713.75 Total $20,110.48 $20,110.48 Expenses Operators $ 3,846.03 Other traffic expenses 45.05 Total $ 3391.08 $ 3,891.08 General Salaries of officers $ 1,338.45 Salaries of clerks 900.00 Rent« 120.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p265">265 Other general expenses 1,880.09 Total $ Maintenance and depreciation 4,238.54 $ 4,238.54 ( 10 per cent on $93,201 )__$ 9,320.10 $ 9,320.10 Among the increased expenses anticipated by applicant are substan - tial additions to the wages paid operators. Great difficulty has been ex - perienced in the past eighteen months in securing operators at the wages paid. These range from $25 per month to beginners to $45 per month for regular opera tcrs. It is proposed to change this scale to a basis of $40 per month for inexperienced operators to $60 per month for ex - perienced operators, with a salary of $75.00 per month for one of the operators at Beemer who has certain managerial duties. It is alse proposed to increase the salary of the chief clerk and chief operator from $75 to $90 per month. In support of these increases applicant calls attention to the fact that salaries in other classes of work in Wis - ner and Beemer and neighboring towns range from $50 to $75 per month. School teachers receive $80 to $100 per month in these communities. With such competition it is impossible to retain experienced operators and without experienced operators it is impossible to render the best cf service. The wages as proposed appear to the Commission not to be unreasonable and to be fully warranted by the nature of the work and living conditions at the present time. The increases will amount to $130 per month, or a total of $1,560 per year If this is added to the deficit, as shown in the statement for 1919, there will be a total def - icit of $3,203.39. Substantial increases in the salaries of linemen are proposed by applicant, but these will be taken care of in the allowance made for maintenance and depreciation. It is also proposed to in - crease the salary of the general manager of the company from $175 per month to $200 per month. In the next three years the company is faced with an extensive rebuilding program covering its farm lines. It does not have at the present time a depreciation reserve in cash sufficient to cover the cost of this reconstruction. It is estimated that the material for this work will cost at least $10,000. The labor will be additional. In all prob- Total I 117,449."; 72 117,449.7: Net operating income $ 2,660.7i Paxes 634.12 nterest 140.40 Dividends 3,529.63 Total $ 4,304.15 4,304.1! Deficit S 1,643.3! 1,643.31 </seg>
            <seg id="p266">266 ability, therefore, an expenditure of at least $15,000 will be necessary daring the period referred to. The management proposes to issue and sell stock to replenish the depreciation reserve to this extent. With - out question this is the proper method to pursue. The valuation made by the Commission shows that a surplus exists in the property over and above the investment of the stockholders and that a considerable por - tion of this surplus belongs to the depreciation reserve. The proper method for turning it into cash is to issue and sell stock. As stated, the dividend rate for the past ten years has been seven per cent. In the opinion of the general manager of the company this rate is not ■sufficiently large to attract the necessary capital into the company. Mr. Thompson, the president of the company and a successful farmer and business man, is reluctant to have the dividend rate increased, although he admits that it will be very difficult to sell the necessary stock with which to finance the rebuilding and improvement of the property. In the past the company has resorted to advertising in local newspapers, personal solicitation by the officers, and to other means for selling the stock of the company. By such methods a small amount of stock has been disposed of, but four or five stockholders have always had to come to the rescue and take the bulk of the offerings. These stockholders insist that their holdings are now large enough and it is not anticipated Ethey will absorb but a very small part of any new issue. It is ed that more attractive inducements will be necessary before other investors can be pursuaded to buy. The question of the stock issue is not before us now, however. When it is presented we can give further consideration to the increase in the rate of return. We may say at this time, however, that we be - lieve applicant should utilize every method possible to dispose of its stock before resorting to the more expensive plan of paying larger dividends. The farm rate, as proposed by applicant, is somewhat higher than is in effect on exchanges of similar size, although there are a number of exchanges in the state giving about the same class of service where the farm rate is $2.00 per month. Mr. Richmond, general manager of the company, has made studies calculated to show the cost of fur - nishing farm line service. From these he draws a rather positive opin - ion that such service costs much more than residence service furnished to city subscribers. The Commission is not prepared at this time to thoroughly analyze his studies, but there appears to be good reason for believing that the term line rate on this system should be at least as high as the individual city residence rate. I The rates as proposed by applicant will produce increased revenue the amount of $3,972. The deficit, as indicated, will be not less n $3,200. In this connection it should be stated that the revenues •i shown for the year 1919 are the gross revenues and no allowance </seg>
            <seg id="p267">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 267 is made for uncollectible accounts. Undoubtedly some deduction should be made from the gross revenue for this purpose. It follows that the deficit would be increased by the amount of such deduction. In the light of present and anticipated operating costs in view of the possible difficulties that may be experienced by this company in further financ - ing, and of the necessity that may arise for an increase in the rate of return, the Commission is of the opinion that the rates as proposed are reasonable. This company is most excellently managed. Its officers have shown a very commendable regard for the public interest and are en - titled to a considerable latitude in shaping the policies for the future. The excellent record established gives the Commission confidence in the ability and integrity of the management and we are convinced that they can be trusted to use the best of judgment in the handling of any surplus that may accrue. The rates, therefore, will be approved, sub - ject to the condition that a showing be made on January 1, 1921, at which time a readjustment can be made if the facts warrant.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4080. tthe Matter of the Application of the Law - rence Telephone Company for Authority to issue Stock in the Amount of $5000. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Chairman: Applicant operates an exchange at Lawrence serving 392 subscrib - ers. It makes application for permission to issue $5,000 of its com - mon stock for the purpose of retiring $3,900 of notes and to cover ex - penditures for certain additions and betterments. The company now has outstanding $10,000 of capital stock, all of which, according to the record in Application No. 3758, was paid for in cash and the proceeds used in the construction of the plant. In addition to the $10,000 thus realized, the company borrowed $5,000 early in the history of the com - pany, this indebtedness being reduced at one time to $3,000 through pay - ments made out of surplus from the earnings. In 1916 the company erected a central office building and borrowed an additional $900 at that time. There is outstanding at this time therefore, $3,900, which ap - plicant desires to retire from the proceeds derived from the sale of com - mon stock. Since January 1, 1919. the company has completed addi - tions and betterments to the property costing $728.90. It is not clear from what source this money was derived, but we assume it to have been taken from a surplus that should have been set aside as a depre - ciation reserve. This would leave $373.10 of the proposed issue to cover additions and betterments to be made in the future. A valuation of the property, made in the year 1912, showed a cost </seg>
            <seg id="p269">269 of reproduction value of $19,000. The depreciation value at that time was shown to be $12,000. Mr. Gillsdorf, president of the company, test - ifying in behalf of the company, as to the present value, says that the property is worth considerably in excess of the figure found at that lime. This would appear to be true in view of the fact that the com - pany now has real estate and land valued at $1,597.73, which it did not have at the time of the valuation. In addition it has added improve - ments to the amount of $726.90. This would make a total present value, using the 1912 figure as a basis, of $14,324. If to this we add the $373, which it is proposed to add to the property in the way of further im - provements, and $1,155.70 for materials and supplies as shown in the annual report to this Commission for December 31, 1919, we would have a total of $15353- It would appear, therefore, that the proposed issue will leave the outstanding capital within the present value of the pro - perty. As stated above, it is assumed that the $726.00 expended for addi - tions and betterments during 1919 was taken from the depreciation re - serve fund. Upon the sale of the stock, therefore, money to this amount should be restored to that fund. The application appears to be reasonable and the proceeds to be derived from the sale of these securities to be necessary for the require - ments of the company. The issuance of the stock will therefore be authorized. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Lawrence Telephone com - pany be and the same hereby is authorized to issue and sell its common stock in the amount of $5,000; such stock to be sold at par and no less, the proceeds from the sale of same to be used to retire notes of the com - pany in the amount of $3,900, to reimburse the depreciation reserve fund to the extent of $736.90, and to pay the cost of additions and better - ments to the property in the amount of $373.10. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant shall restore to its de - preciation reserve fund the amount of $726.90 from the proceeds of the sale of the stock herein authorized. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant shall, within sixty days from the date of this order, report to the Commission all sales herein authorized, to whom sold and the amount received for same, together with report as to disposition of the proceeds of same. If all of the stock herein authorized is not sold within sixty days, report shall be made to the Commission every sixty days until all of the issue is dis - posed of. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this order shall not be construed </seg>

In the Matter of the Application of the Cen- Itral Telephone Company of Greeley for Authority to Issue Stock. APPEARANCES: For Applicant — James M. Lanigan, attorney. For Respondents — none. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This matter has been before the Commission a very considerable time, having been filed September 1, 1919, and hearing having been held on October 30, 1919. At the request of applicant, conclusion of this matter was postponed, but it now comes up for determination as a mat - ter supplemental to the application for authority to increase rates. (Ap - plication No. 4340.) Applicant company purchased the telephone properties at Greeley in April, 1908, from the Greeley County Telephone company, which has since disposer! of all its holdings in that section of the country. There are thirteen stockholders, most of whom live at Greeley. The purchase price was $26,927.08. Half was paid in cash, viz., $13,463.54. A credit was immediately given on the remainder in amount of $2,216.84, representing rentals collected in advance and retained by the Greeley County Telephone company. Hence, the actual amount paid in cash, or equivalent, was $15,680.38. _ Very shortly thereafter the company paid $247.00 additional, reducing the indebtedness to an even $11,000, which was represented in notes payable at eight per cent interest. Through some rather faulty logic, the company issued stock in the amount of $25,000 at this time. Its indebtedness was $11,000 and, on the assumption that it paid a fair price for the property at the time of its purchase, it was obviously over-capitalized in the neighborhood of $10,000. No serious invasion of the rights of the public occurred in consequence. The rates remained the same as they had been theretofore and all earned surpluses, including proper dividends, were either put </seg>
            <seg id="p271">271 back into the property in needed improvements and extensions, or were used in reducing the amount of the indebtedness. For several years all net earnings went into the property itself. Beginning with 1916 the company began to reduce its notes payable, which, at the time of the hearing, remained at $5,000.00. An inventory and valuation was made by the Commission as of date July 15, 1919, on the basis of original cost. On this particular property, this original cost represented in the main pre-war price levels. War - time price levels were reflected only in those parts of the property built or renewed during the period of higher levels. The original construc - tion cost was found to be $43,285.87 and the depreciated value, based oh average life consideration, was found to be $30,691.59. In so far as these figures reflected existing property and the units reflected original cost, they were not attacked by applicant at the hearing. We are now confronted with the task of determining a fair value of this property for earning purposes, taking into account "all relevant facts." Obviously such relevant facts include not only the original con - struction cost and present condition of the property, but a reasonable consideration of advanced levels of property values and also considera - tion of the investment of the stockholders themselves. We have, there - fore, a series of different values where the principle applied is different, all of which differing values must be taken into account in arriving at a fair value at this time and for considerable period in the future for earning purposes. 1. Money actually paid in by the stockholders, plus simple interest at eight per cent from that date until October 11, 1920, represents an investment of $31,360. 2. The amount of money actually paid in by the stockholders in the 1908 transaction, plus compound interest at seven per cent from that date until October 11, 1920, would amount to $36,531. 3. The actual value of the property, based on original cost, due con - sideration being given to depreciated condition, was found by the engin - eers to be $30,692. 4. Present worth of the properties, based on conservative present day construction costs, would probably reach $47,000.00. 5. On the basis used by us and found to give reasonable considera - tion to advanced unit values in the Pawnee Telephone case, the value of the properties at this time would be, on that basis alone, $36,500.00. From consideration of all these factors, keeping in mind all the time that the best interests of the stockholders themselves will be conserved by carefully guarding against a stock dividend based on present property values, which would be, when values have been readjusted, considerably </seg>
            <seg id="p272">272 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT in excess of the property underlying, we find that the fair value of this property at this time for earning purposes is $35,000.00. The rate case of this applicant (Application No. 4340) will be considered on this fair value. The company will be authorized in this order to issue stock as a stock dividend up to $35,000, provided that it eliminates the $5,000 of long term indebtedness, or notes payable. If this indebtedness is not eliminated, then the legitimate outstanding stock shall not exceed the difference between $35,000 and the indebtedness until farther order of this Commission. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Central Telephone Company of Greeley be, and it hereby is authorized and empowered, at its discretion, to issue additional stock and distribute it as a stock dividend on the basis of a fair value of $35,000 for its telephone properties, which issue of stock, together with the outstanding stock, is not to exceed the difference between the fair value, as found in this order, and the indebtedness other than current bills shown in its liability statement. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this fair value shall be considered as of date July 1, 1920, any investment thereafter made, either from contributions of stockholders direct, or through dividends earned and not paid, to be considered as additional value, against which, on proper ap - plication, stock nr.ay be issued and on which earnings may be had. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that within thirty days of any read - justment of stock, as per the terms of this order, report thereof under oath shall be made to the Commission.

Smith, Warren Telephone company, Lew - ellen. ORDER AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: Application for this increase was made by a former owner of the properties about six months ago. Shortly thereafter negotiations for sale to the present owners were begun and the application languished until after the completion of negotiations when it was again pushed. Hearing was held at Oshkosh on January 28, 1920. This system occupies the North Platte Valley from Broadwater to Lewellen, a distance of approximately forty-five miles. It has an iron toll circuit extending from Bridgeport to Ogallala, a distance of almost ninety miles. The property was built originally by J. H. Wehn, a bank - er, with interests up and down the valley. It started as a toll line between the banks of the builder and later developed as exchange prop - erties in the four towns. The early construction was made before the extension of the Union Pacific up the valley and was in consequence ex - pensive. Investment was in an unknown amount. In 1916 Mr. Wehn filed an application for an increase in rates, alleging his inability to meet his expenses and as a witness in that case he testified that to the best of his knowledge and belief he had invested more than $25,000 in the properties and had in consequence issued $25,000 of stock. His testi - mony and the investigation of the Commission's accountants indicated that this was more or less a matter of estimate as the bookkeeping had never properly reflected the financial development. An inventory was taken in 1916 by the Commission's engineers, which showed an original cost of $21,640, based on pre-war units and a present worth of $16,074. Of this the toll properties were worth fully fifty per cent. The rate structure is the same now as for many years past. The application in 1916 and estimate presented thereon indicated that the company had never made a financial success out of the properties and that there was need for a relief at that time. Before the conclusion of the case, however, the company dropped it, due to the vigorous op - position of the subscribers, who alleged very poor service. Mr. Wehn was not a telephone man. He was operating under adverse conditions and the service was never good. Following the partial hearing in 1916, an active reconstruction program was undertaken, in the course of which |15,000 of indebtedness was incurred. Much of this was a replacement </seg>
            <seg id="p274">274 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT program and a proper charge againrt a depreciation reserve which did not exist. It is probable that the properties at the end of the recon - struction period did not represent an original cost much in excess of $30,000 if pre-war units were used. However, the reconstruction pro - gram was in a period of abnormal prices and when proper allowance is made would represent a heavier investment. The company now receives for Business service Residence service Farm line service Switching service $1.75 per month 1.25 per month ._(1.00 to $1.50 per month .35 per month With this goes certain free interchange between the company's exchanges and with two adjacent towns to certain farm lines. One farm line has service to both Bridgeport and Broadwater and the company pays switching charges to the Bridgeport company. In like manner, other farm lines have service both to Lewellen and Ogallala and the company pays like switching charges at Ogallala. Extensive farm lines of the Lewellen-Big Springs company were leased by applicant, the lines pay - ing seventy-five cents per month and the company undertaking certain maintenance obligations. The four exchanges of applicant are Broadwater, Lisco, Lewellen and Oshkosh. They are all small exchanges, Lisco being too small to warrant the maintenance of an exchange and all of them of insuffi - cient size for economical operation. The territory is scattered, which has accounted in part for poor service in the past, and the poor service has prevented maximum development of the territory already avail - able. Besides the switched subscribers, Broadwater has seventy-three subscribers ; Lewellen, eighty-five; Lisco, twenty-seven; ar.d Oshkosh, two hundred fifty-six. The present owners found a grounded property not capable of rend - ering as efficient service as the people of the community desired. They have incurred bills for labor and material in amount approximately $24,000 to render all the town properties metallic, to make the exchange at Oshkosh common battery, and to change the iron toll circuit into a copper commercial circuit of high type. No rates which the traffic will bear on present development warrants the expenditures undertaken. The present owners are well aware of this and are basing the invest - ment wholly on their confidence in the rapid development of the valley and adjacent table lands as irrigation and wheat growing territory. They are good telephone men and are able to render high class service. Whether they can continue to do so, will depend on the accuracy of their judgment and that the country will develop with considerable rap - idity. The immediate situation is that they cannot hope for a proper return on their investment. </seg>
            <seg id="p275">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 275 The rates asked by them are sharp advances over the present scale, which has been unusually low. At Broadwater, Lewellen and Lisco they are asking net rates as follows: Business phones $3.00 per month One-party residence phones 2.00 per month 1.50 per month Four-party residence phones Farm lines _ 2.00 per month _ 6.20 per annum Switching service They are asking for rates for common battery service at Oshkosh: Business $3.50 per month net One-party residence 2.00 per month net Four-party residence 1.75 per month net Farm lines . 2.00 per month net Switching service the same as at other exchanges. Gross rates 25 cents per month higher with discount provisions. They desire to eliminate the free interchange between exchanges and to separate a farm line connected both at Oshkosh and Lewellen at a convenient point making half of it tributary to each exchange. The farm lines will continue grounded, all other service to be made metallic. The application does not mention switching rates at Lewellen although switching service is rendered. No different rate for farm line service is asked where Bridgeport is an added exchange from Broadwater, and Ogal- lala is an added exchange for farm lines connected at Lewellen, although such service is the cause of a direct outlay in payments by the company to the exchanges at Ogallala and Bridgeport. Certain farm lines owned by the company in the neighborhood of Lemoyne and switched at Ogallala are to have the same rates as all other farm line service. The record does not show how many subscribers are on these three lines. For the five months ending March 31, 1920, during which this com- pany has owned the property, the accounts have been kept according to the practices of the Nebraska Telephone company, whose accounting rules are generally followed by applicant. The first three months of 1920 reflect the company's operating expense experience. This shows as follows: Supervision of maintenance $ 34.74 Repairs of aerial plant 345.06 Repairs of C- O. equipment 27.03 Repairs of station equipment 66.44 Total ordinary repairs 1473.27 Station rem's and Ch'ng's 7.70 Total current maintenance $480.97 Depreciation of plant and equipment 567.45 Total maintenance $1,048.42 </seg>

The maintenance expense for the three months and the allocation for depreciation taken as a whole are not too large. In fact, they will have to be increased to represent the additional investment now taking place. Under traffic expense, the pay station expenses, totalling about twelve per cent of the total toll revenues, appear high. It may, however, be a purely temporary situation and will not be disturbed. Revenue accounting and revenue collecting, under commercial expense, are both unusually high, but inasmuch as revenue collecting is an alloca- tion of operator's wastes and these operators' wages are not too high, no objection can be made to such allocation. Revenue accounting for the three months totals twenty rents per station per month. This is ex- cessive. It may be due to the rebuilding program, but if so is not a proper reflex of an average accounting expense. This item is an allo- cation between applicant and the Platte Valley Telephone company, re- presenting in a considerable degree central office accounting expenses- The total commercial expense is fifty-six cents per station per month. The experience of the Nebraska Telephone company for the commercial expense is as high as any well managed company of the state. At this time that expense totals about thirty-eight cents per station per month. It ought not to be appreciably higher on this system, but for safety we are placing it at forty-eight cents per station per month. The com- pany's experience is general and miscellaneous expenses for the three months is 31.2 cents per station per month, of which a large percentage is central office supplies anl expenses. Well managed companies of the state find the expenses under this heading totalling less than fifteen cents per station per month. We think the allocations have been too heavy on the applicant property. In figuring the expenses, we place the general and miscellaneous expenses at $60 per month in place of the </seg>
            <seg id="p277">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 277 experience of three months of $107 per month. This is after proper allowance is made for general expenses properly chargeable to new con - struction. The company's March experience was only $25. We have thus the followi-i* estimate of expenses per month, which is not in any degree mandatory, but merely illustrative of the Commis - sion's method in arriving at proper expenditures on which to base rates: Per Month Maintenance and depreciation account $450.00 Traffic expenses 330.00 Commercial expense 165.00 Total additional expenditures 391.67 Total expenditures and allocations except dividends $1,39667 The general miscellaneous, insurance, supplies, etc. are $20.00 per month and thus placed because the company is allocating $20.00 per month for directory expense, a figure out of line of any other experience of which we know. The rates proposed by the company will bring in better than $12,000 per annum on present development from subscribers service and switch - ing service. Total toll, as per the three months' experience, will be $3,300 per annum, miscellaneous earnings $200 per annum, to which will be added whatever revenue will accrue from eliminating free interchange on inter-town messages. On the present development this will furnish slightly more money than the operating expenses and fixed charges. The Commission has given very careful consideration to the matter and is forced to the conclusion that the schedule of rates asked for in the light of the previous experience of the territory is so sharp an ad - vance as to seriously interfere with the future development of the terri - tory, absolutely essential to the success of the enterprise. The com - pany is banking on development, and not without reason. At the time of the hearing the system served 656 subscribers, of whom more than half were switched subscribers. As of April 30, this development had increased to 741. In the continued development lies the answer to the problem. The rates which the Commission will authorize will not quite pay, under present development situation, proper operating expenses, f xed charges and set aside a reasonable amount for depreciation reserve. These rates will not give the company any return on whatever invest - ment in properties is beyond $40,000 representing bills payable. That General expense 60.00 Total operating expenses Dther expenditures: Pax accruals $ 50.00 ftent, plus proper share of general office rental 55.00 General miscellaneous, insurance, supplies, etc. 20.00 nterest on $40,000 bills payable 266.67 $l,005.0&lt; </seg>
            <seg id="p278">THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 278 return must come from the development of the territory. If this devel - opment takes place, revenues will appreciably increase without a cor - responding increase in expenditures. The company will be entitled, as operating costs approach more normal figures in the future, to continue the higher rates long enough to make up for losses in the intermediate period. The Commission is unanimously of the opinion that the rates authorized below are all the traffic at this time will bear, even though the results may not be all that in law the company can demand. If the experience of the next few months does not bear out the anticipated in - crease in business, further consideration to the problem will have to be given. LAt the time of the hearing a number of subscribers appeared to pro - against the class of service rendered. In the main, these pro - testants were from switched lines- All took a very fair attitude con - cerning the necessities of the company for added revenues, but desired to feel assured that good service would be rendered. We think there can be no question but what the program will result in much im - proved service. However, on some of the farm lines this result will not show. It will be largely the fault of the farm line companies. For in - stance, line No. 5, switched at Lewellen, has twenty-five subscribers on grounded wire. It is impossible that such a number can receive proper service and until the farm line company divides and runs two wires to the exchange they cannot hope to have this corrected. The same is true of lines Nos. 4 and 5, connected at Lisco, each with eighteen subscribers on the line. And No. 11, connected at Lewellen, with fifteen subscribers and an unusually long line. While these people will be asked to pay higher switching charges, they will not get the best results from their semi-annual expense unless they proceed to improve their own properties by reducing the number of subscribers on a line. The results will be immediately apparent thereafter. The question was raised at the hearing as to the manner of collect - ing from farm line companies. The switching rates here authorized presuppose that the officers of the switched lines do their own collecting and pay in a lump sum, bills for toll service being rendered prior to the usual period of collection by the toll company to the officers of the switched lines. Where such officers desire that the company do the collecting, arrangements can be made by private agreement to meet the expense of this added burden on the company. The Commission is in hope that the prospective rapid development in the lower valley occupied by applicant will enable it to continue its ambitious program, which will result in a class of service which the territory has long desired and which has been denied to it. Regarding the program of the company to install common battery service at Oshkosh as a part of the anticipated development of that ter - ritory, the Commission is still very much in doubt as to the wisdom of such a courae. It ia a matter for the business judgment of the company, </seg>
            <seg id="p279">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 279 however, if it desires to take the risk. The Commission will in this order authorize magneto rates at Oshkosh. It is our understanding that the people of Oshkosh would prefer to pay heavier rates and secure the common battery service. If, following this order, the company will file a petition with the Commission, signed by a majority of both business and residence subscribers at Oshkosh, expressing their willingness to pay the higher schedule indicated below in return for the heavier investment and expense of common battery service, these higher rates will be im - mediately authorized and the higher class of service may be charged for.

            <seg id="p281">281 Appearances: For applicant — Edgar M. Morsman, attorney. J. £. Baggstrom, general manager. For respondents — None. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: Applicant operates exchanges in the cities of Bloomfiekl, Wausa and Crofton, serving also practically all of the surrounding territory. It had at the time of the hearing on this case, which occurred in Lincoln, January 8, 1920, 1327 subscribers, of whom a large majority received .grounded service. Due to extensive improvements and reconstruction, the company has incurred indebtedness of more than $25,000, a portion of which it desires to liquidate by the sale of additional stock- At the present time the company is under-capitalized, due to its business meth - ods. As a part of its application it asks authority to issue $32,500 as a stock dividend, to represent accumulated properties not capitalized in order that the book value of the stock of the present stockholders may somewhere near represent the value of the stock which it is purposed to sell at this time at par. A brief history of the company: Organized at Bloomfield in 1902 by five local citizens for the purpose of purchasing existing telephone pro - perties in Bloomfield and surrounding territory. These properties were purchased for $12,500 cash. The acquisition was just in the beginning of the phenomenal growth of the telephone industry in the state. The company was at once confronted with extensive demands for service, which the owners attempted to meet. Practically all of the labor except the most technical parts of the building program was performed by three of the five owners who devoted practically all their time to the business. Extra funds were secured in one instance by the sale of stock below par with which to buy materials. Additional cash from time to time was put in by stockholders. By the latter part of 1907 the cash invested from outside sources amounted to $19,500 less the discount on $2,500 sold below par. No dividends had ever been paid and very little in wages to the active managers. At this time $10,000 was issued as a stock dividend. Exchanges were built at Crofton and Wausa. Some toll lines were purchased and others were constructed. The first cash dividend was paid in 1910 at ten per cent on the outstanding stock and thereafter dividends ranging from ten to thirty per cent and averaging fifteen per cent have been paid on this outstanding stock, the company justifying the high rate paid by the statement that the outstanding stock in no wise reflected the fair value of the property for dividend purposes. Only in the last three or four years has the wages scale, allowed to the active </seg>
            <seg id="p282">282 stockholders, been commensurate with the duties performed. At the present time these salaries are liberal. The company began operation in 1902 with a business rate of $1.75 net, and residence and farm rates of $1.25 net. These rates are still in existence. These rates, if averaged through the years, cannot be called abnormal as compared with the experience of other companies similarly situated. The company has developed its present properties by close economy, by services not properly compensated for and by surpluses earned and put back into the properties. In 1912 the company buiii a very excellent exchange building at Wausa. This is a brick structure of substantial quality, with a full basement. Only about two-fifths of the land and buildings are devoted to the telephone purpose. The lower floor is rented on long time lease to the federal government for a postoffice. The fixtures belong to the telephone company. A portion of the second floor is rented for offices. In 1914 a brick building was constructed at Crofton. Half of this structure is not used for telephone purposes. In 1919 a very excellent brick building was constructed at Bloomfield, modern in every particular. Half of the building and approximately one-fifth of the land is not used for telephone purposes. It will have to be considered that these invest - ments of company funds in fixed properties not used and useful for cor - porate purposes are investments of depreciation reserve funds rather than having such funds in cash, securities or in other telephone properties. Whether the revenues from these investments properly maintain them - selves is a question for a rate case rather than the present problem. In measuring the fair value of the properties for capitalization purposes, the Commission is governed by the heavy weight of court authorities and will consider all relevant facts, investment, the sources of funds invested, present values, present prices, and present condition of the physical properties. In 1919 the company embarked on extensive improvement of the Bloomfield properties to make the service and equipment conform to the needs of the city. It constructed the exchange building and ad - ditional structures mentioned heretofore. It made the entire exchange metallic and cabled a large portion of it, putting part of the cable in underground ducts and part of it overhead. At the time of the hearing the indebtedness caused by this extensive program amounted to more than $22,000 and a considerable amount of labor was yet to be per - formed. In fact, that labor is not yet all completed. To liquidate this indebtedness the company had a liquid depreciation reserve of $4,000 in liberty bonds and a lot in Bloomfield readily salable at $1,500. The use oi this fund is legitimate to take care of the loss, due to displacements in in the rebuilding program. The company desires to sell additional stock to cover the remainder of the betterments or a major portion thereof in the sum of $17,500. The Bale of this stock at par would still leave the company somewhat in debt </seg>
            <seg id="p283">283 The physical valuation by the Commission's engineers has just been completed. Due to the active reconstruction program of the last five or six years and the construction of substantial central office properties, it is estimated that about half of the total physical properties, including that part which does not represent property used and useful in a tele - phone business, was constructed at prices above the normal. The re - mainder of the properties was constructed at normal or below normal costs. In making the physical valuation the engineers took these facts into account and found a total construction cost of $123,273.24 and a present value, due to condition per cent of the entire system, of $95,794.87- We have, therefore, a financial statement of the condition of the company as follows: Against this surplus the company desires to issue stock as a stock dividend. At the time of the hearing the company's books showed a total in - vestment of $87,075.89, but since that time it has put a considerable amount of money into the properties- The testimony was that up to 1915 it was the practice of the company to shrink its assets annually to represent an estimated depreciation. Thereafter it did not shrink its assets, but set up a depreciation reserve liability, which at the time of the application amounted to $12,645.82. Hence, the company's book statement of assets will have to be disregarded because it does not re - present gross assets. Applicant presented a very careful history of the company, secured from those who had been closely connected with it throughout its ex - istence. It is obviously impossible at this time to state what are the values of the services rendered by the manager-stockholders and other officers during the first ten or twelve years of the existence of the com - pany. The company's valuation of the properties is bottomed on labor and material costs of a large number of companies constructed approx - imately at the same time and cannot of course reflect any economies which this company may have practiced by securing greater efficiency from labor or lower labor costs than the average company. Estimating Gross Assets fixed assets in telephone properties $102,644.77 Dther fixed investments 17,592.00 Stores and supplies (May 25) 4,128.47 3ash and accounts receivable (estimated) 3,500.00 Total $127,865.24 Liabilities :apital stock outstanding $ 25,000.00 ndebtedness (approximate) 25,000.00 Depreciation reserve 27,478.57 Surplus 49,386.67 Total $127,865.24 </seg>
            <seg id="p284">284 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT wages conservatively and dividends at eight per cent where earned and paid and not compounding these accrued rights, it is safe to conclude that not less than $40,000 of actual sacrifices in cash, dividends, and labor services, went into the properties. To this has been added the $25,000 of indebtedness, all in building program. The difference between this investment of $65,000 and the present worth of the properties of ?96,000 represents investments of surpluses earned beyond the necessities of the company, advantages from economies practiced over those of the ordinary telephone experiences, shrewd management, and possible donations impossible to estimate. We know of no way by which it could be ascertained what portion of this accrual resulted from rates higher than were necessary during certain periods of the company's existence, when measured by revenues and proper expenditures. In the light of all the facts here discussed, it appears entirely reasonable that the company be authorized to issue a stock dividend of one hundred per cent On the basis of existing property, using the Commissioner's engineer's findings, there will still remain a surplus of approximately $25,000 in the properties. The Commission is not called on at this time to pass on whether this surplus is a proper basis for earnings over and above the authorized securities. It does appear, how - ever, that such a stock dividend will in a large measure adjust the pro - perty rights of present owners as compared with those who will purchase stock in the future and will at the same time leave the company in a happy condition financially under any probable financial and industrial conditions in the future- Much of this property was built under ab - normal price conditions, which reflects in the valuation. The surplus will more than take care of any shrinkage in property values and the company will under any imaginable future conditions have plenty of property to protect its liabilities. The investment by the company in property not used and useful in the telephone business is unusually high. In so far as it might have been made out of funds now needed in order to keep the properties in proper serviceable condition, such investment would be frowned upon. Our engineers have found, however, the properties in excellent condition. Thus much of an investment of depreciation reserve is, therefore, merely a protection to the property. Whether it would have been better to have used the funds to make more of the system metallic and thus invest its depreciation reserve in telephone properties, is a matter which we do not at this time pass on. There is no complaint from the territory re - garding the class of service furnished. In setting up a financial state - ment the Commission has ignored the possible investment of depreciation reserve funds in liberty bonds because it had no information as to whether these bonds had been sold and the proceeds used in the rebuilding pro - gram at the time the valuation was taken. The company has indebtedness which it can properly reduce by the sale of stock, thus transferring bills payable to capital stock. It asks </seg>
            <seg id="p285">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 285 for authority to so issue and sell at not less than par $17,500 of stock, additional to the disposition of the stock dividend. The indebtedness has run higher than was anticipated at the time the application was made. It appears that the sale of at least $20,000 of stock to secure funds with which to reduce bills payable indebtedness would be proper if a market can be found and the Commission will authorize the sale of all or any part of the $20,000 of stock. If all this stock is sold at par, the financial statement of the company following such financing would approximate as follows, ignoring bills receivable, liberty bonds, and other incidental assets, the amounts of which we do not now know: IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Union Telephone company of Bloomfield be, and it hereby is, authorized to issue a stock dividend of $25,000, a proper record of such issue to be made in the stock ledger and proper adjustments of the financial statement to reflect such issue. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the company shall sell for cash, at not less than par, all or any reasonable portion measured by market con - ditions, $20,000 additional stock with the proceeds of which to reduce bills payable outstanding, provided that whenever $5,000 of such stock, or multiple thereof, shall have been sold and the proceeds expended, re - port shall be made to the Commission in detail, showing the receipts from such sale and the expenditure thereof. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the company shall set aside an - nually not less than nine per cent of the original cost of the depreciable properties, as shown by the valuation of the Commission's engineers, copy of which will be furnished the company, out of which set-up shall ba paid all maintenance expenses and charges against depreciation re - serve as per the accounting rules of the Commission and the remainder be carried in depreciation reserve.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4093 In the Matter of the Application of the Table Rock Telephone Company for Authority to Increase Rates. </seg>
            <seg id="p287">287 Appearances: For applicant — Powell &amp; Wilson. For protestants — E. L. McCrea. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This matter came on for hearing at Table Rock, Nebraska, on De - cember 3, 1919, on application of the company for authority to publish a schedule of rates on whatever basis the Commission deems necessary to meet increased operating costs as presented by applicant. The pres - ent rates of the company, which have not been changed since higher cost levels appeared, are: Business $2.00 per month Residence, both metallic and grounded 1.00 per month Farm line, metallic 1.25 per month Farm line, grounded 1.00 per month The company has 325 subscribers divided as follows: business, metallic, 23; residence, metallic, 92; residence, grounded, 27; farm line, metallic, 99; farm line, grounded, 84. The company paid no dividend in 1919 and was unable to increase the wages of its operators, lineman and manager, although their com - pensation was far below the average in the country. The plant serious- ly needs attention as its operating condition is well below normal, and it must also meet competitive conditions in the matter of labor. The company was organized locally in 1899 with a considerable num- ber of stockholders. During the next six years all net earnings were put into the plant as the demands for extensions were great. Operation was on an extremely economical basis as shown by the reports of the treasurer. No dividends were paid. However, in 1905, a stock dividend of $740 was declared, which approximated 20 c /c of the outstanding stock. The next year dividends amounting to $1600 were declared in stock, and in 1907 a 100f dividend of $675 in stock. No dividends or cash were paid until 1910 thereafter. From 1910 to 1919, inclusive, average cash dividends on outstanding stock amounted to 994 per annum. Com - putations on dividends pa'd during the life of the company for interest en deferred dividends, or interest on excessive dividends, show that the company slightly overpaid an SVc basis. If 8% is taken as the proper rate, the stockholders actually put into the property an investment be- tween $13,500 and $14,000. The Commission made a rather hasty survey of the property through its engineering department, and found an original cost of $20,000, such funds having come both from depreciation reserve invested in additions end from actual money put in by stockholders. This survey by the engineering department showed a present worth, based on original cost, of only $8,500. </seg>
            <seg id="p288">288 Exhibits filed by the company, as taken from a careful survey of the books, checked the engineer's figure on original cost of $20,000, but the company's witnesses challenged the low estimated condition made by the Commission's engineer. Taking into account all necessary factors, including original cost, reasonable accretions in unit values at the present time, present condition and investments by stockholders, the Commission is of the opinion that a fair value for earning purposes on the property at this time is $12,500. Inasmuch, however, as the rates in the past have not kept the invest - ment whole, the Commission will provide an organization scheme, whereby out of the rates enough additional property can be constructed in a period of three or four years to make good this original investment by stockholders, in order that they may lose none of that investment. The only way in which the company is to blame for the present situation is that it continued to take its dividends at the expense of good service, and when not sufficient funds were provided from the rates for main - tenance and dividends, it allowed the property to languish in place of asking for a rate adjustment. It appears only proper that, in a moder - ate degree, the rates in the future shall make up a deficiency to $14,000 value. At the time of the hearing the company was paying its operators $26 a month, each, although the average rate for similar companies over the state was at least $40 at that time. Its manager who was at once lineman, manager and secretary, was paid $90 a month, and furnished his own automobile. The company was very anxious to adjust these wages in order to retain efficient labor, but did not make the adjust - ment that might have been made had dividends been temporarily de - ferred. The Commission finds it necessary to increase the revenues sufficient to add $1,000 or $1,200 to the labor expense- Other items of expense justify an increase in gross revenues of approximately $1,500 per annum. The company now earns from existing rates approximately $6,000 per annum of which between $1,200 and $1,500 represents toll earnings, as shown by the exhibits filed at the hearing. Were it not for the favor - able location of the exchange in the matter of toll business, much higher rates would be necessary than are found essential in this order. From a careful investigation of the situation of applicant company at the time of the hearing, the following estimates of expenditures per month for 1920 is made: aintenance and depreciation $200.00 •affic, including operators' wages 180.00 immercial expense, including an allocated portion of the manager's time representing not less than $35 per month 130.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p289">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 289 Taxes 25.00 Dividends 85.00 Margin of safety 40.00 If $1,500 additional revenue is provided, the company will be able to finance itself. The property is, as stated before, not in good oper - ating- condition. As a condition of this order, the Commission will re - quire that the company finance itself to the extent of $3,000 additional investment through sales of stock or bonds, and use this money in re - placements and betterments where most expedient. This will include rejuvenation of the switchboard, or installation of a new board; replace - ment of certain old types of sub-station sets now well exhausted, and rather extensive replacement in certain pole lines. This improvement should be pushed during the 1920 season with all vigor. The rate structure herein provided will be for a period of three months. Within sixty days of date hereof the company will file such afsurance with the Commission as to the additional financing plan as is satisfactory and when such assurance is given the rate structure pro - vided in this order will automatically extend indefinitely. Out of the $2,400 per annum for maintenance tho company will spend $400 on the properties and in its books credit this to amortization, so that within the proper length of time the value of the property for earning purposes may bridge the difference between $12,500 and $14,000. Each year the company may add the $400 to the amount on which it is entitled to earn dividends at % r A . It will also pay dividends at its discretion on all additional cash investments, making up $5,000 herein estimated for proper service. At its option the company may invest as a portion of the additional capital the dividends of 1920 and by that much reduce the additional cash invested. It can issue a stock dividend in such case, representing the dividend earned and put into the property. If the revenues appear inadequate to care for the scheme herein ad - vised, the Commission will not hesitate to provide additional revenues, in order that the investment may remain intact, proper dividends be paid and maintenance be kept at good service point. This exchange is happily located, and there is no good reason why it should not prove a substantial investment to its owners. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission! that the Table Reck Telephone company be and it hereby is authorized, effective May 1, an emergency existing, to publish and collect the following schedule of rates: Business service $2.25 per month Residence, metallic service 1.50 per month Residence, grounded service 1.25 per month lural, metallic 1.50 per month lural, grounded 1.25 per month </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4099 In the Matter of the Application of the Omaha &amp; Southern Interurban Rail - way Company for Authority to In - crease Interurban Passenger Fares. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This applicant operates on its own tracks interurban service extend - ing from Albright to Ft. Crook, a distance of approximately seven miles. It also operates its cars for a distance of a mile and a half on track - age rented from the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway company to a terminal at 24th and N streets in South Omaha. For this service since the organization of the company it has made charges of five cents </seg>
            <seg id="p292">292 for the first zone, extending from 24th and N streets, South Omaha, to Hillcrest station; ten cents cash fare, or seven and one-half cents commutation fare, from South Omaha to Bellevue; and fifteen cents cash fare, or seven and one-half cents commutation fare, from South Omaha to Ft Crook. It makes application herein for authority to increase its fares in the first zone named from five cents to seven cents cash, or four tokens for twenty-five cents; in the second zone, to leave unchanged the cash fare and eliminate the sale of commutation tickets; in the third zone, similar action to that in»the second zone. LThe Omaha &amp; Southern Interurban Railway company was organ - in 1909 by the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway company and built the properties in that year. The organization was under the railroad law of the state because street railway companies at that time did not have the right of eminent domain. It still operates under its original charter. First consideration must be given to the question of the jurisdiction of the Commission. The statutes of the state pro - vides that railroad fares shall not exceed two cents per mile with a minimum of five cents per passage. The Commission is not authorized to increase passenger fares of railroad companies above that amount (State ex rel M. P. R. R. Co. vs. Henry T. Clarke, et al). The fares asked for do not violate the railroad law when considered from zone end to zone end. For example: Fare Miles 7c 3.72 First zore First and second zone 10c 6.66 First, second and third zones , — 15c 8.66 The company alleges that it sells fares from zone end to zone end with the privilege to any passenger to get off at intermediate wayside stops, fixed for convenience of such passengers. This appears to the Com - mission to be a reasonable rule. However, there is certain traffic be - tween Hillcrest and Bellevue, a distance of 2.94 miles, and Bellevue and Ft. Crook, a distance of two miles, where the proposed seven cents cash rate would exceed two cents per mile. To meet this objection on the part of the Commission, the company amended its application to provide a continuation of the five cent fare on these intermediate passages. Thua the application appears to be made to conform entirely with the state law. The construction of the properties of the Omaha &amp; Southern In - terurban Railway company thirteen years ago was done by the Omaha A Council Bluffs Street Railway company at a cost of $153,761 without any charges therein for superintendence, engineering, legal expense, cost of sale of securities, or contractor's profit. It represents the "bare bones" original cost. There was issued $300,000 common stock, </seg>
            <seg id="p293">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 293 which was taken by the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway com - pany to represent the investment it had made in the properties. Later there was added in improvements $29,310, making the total "bare bones" cost $183,071, against which there is outstanding the $300,000 of securities. The Omaha &amp; Southern company owns its own roadway, intermed - iate stations, terminal at Ft. Crook, and cars. It has no power sta - tion or barns. It buys current from the parent company and rents stable room and stable labor. There is one written contract whereby the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway company furnishes all electrical current used in operating the interurban cars between Albright and Ft. Crook, rents space in the Vinton street car house, and furnishes all labor of supervising and clean - ing, etc., for which it is paid $10 per car day. An exhibit was filed charging up against the applicant all direct expenses involved in the $10 item and allocations of other expenses between the parent company and the applicant, showing a total actual cost of $9.94 for which the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway company receives $10. This ir.cludes a charge for current of 1.14 cents per kilowatt hour, the actual power house cost, with no additions for profit or to cover loss in trans - mission to the point of use. A verbal contract also exists, covering the use of a mile and a half of double track of the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway company on a paved street between 24th and N streets, South Omaha, and Albright, together with loop, turnouts, and other terminal facilities. For this use the parent company receives three cents for each passenger carried by the Omaha &amp; Southern company, regardless whether such passenger rides entirely on the rental trackage or entirely on the tracks of applicant. An exhibit was filed by applicant at the hearing in Omaha, attempt - ing to show the cost of the service to the parent company for which it receives three cents per passenger. September was taken as a typical month, reflecting the 1919 expenses, which will be somewhat below the 1920 expenses. In this exhibit there was allocated to the applicant a proper share of maintenance of way and structures incurred by the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs company; an allocated part of the cur - rent charged at the power house, an expense of 1.14 cents per kilowatt hour; interest on an allocated portion of the value of the facilities joint - ly used; and an allocated portion of the general expenses of the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway company, amounting to eighty-six one hundredths of one per cent of that total item. Thrown up in this man - ner, the total cost of the service, rendered applicant by the parent com - pany in September was $465.31 and the revenue derived at three cents per mile was $1150.65. The net profit for September was, therefore, $685.34, or at the rate of $8,200 per annum. </seg>
            <seg id="p294">294 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Applicant is charged interest on an allocated portion of the value of the facilities jointly used, being eight per cent on $26,257. The question at once arises whether this is a proper share of the value of the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs company, return on which! should be paid by the applicant. In this particular case it is not necessary to reach a determination of that question, as will be shown later. t Total earnings of applicant in 1918 from all sources were $38,336.50, I total expenses, ex dividends, $41,101.49, which includes the amount d for the use of rental roadway properties. The net loss of appli - cant was, therefore, $3,873 and dividends. In 1919 for ten months the total earnings from all sources approximate $30,000, and total expen - rres, ex dividends, were $36,074.98. The net loss was, therefore, for ten months $6366 plus proper dividends. Applying the proposed rates to the business actually done in 1918, the net loss would have been turned into a net income of $6,399 before the dividends. For the ten months of 1919 the net income would have been $1,628 before dividends. The gross revenue for ten months of 1919 at the proposed rates, measured by the actual traffic, would have been $8,649 more than was collected. These exhibits contain an error in figuring the revenue under the proposed rates, in that traffic in the first zone is figured as all using token fares. Actual experience of the parent company since the adop - tion of a similar fare schedule shows that fifteen per cent of the total traffic pays cash. Adjustment for this error would add approximately $200 to the gross revenue per annum. In reaching conclusions on the application, two chief questions re - main for consideration: (a) The value of applicant's properties for earning purposes. (b) The proper value of facilities jointly used for which applicant pays the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs company interest included in its pay - ment of three cents per passenger carried. On neither of these points were engineering studies made and no other evidence was introduced than the method following in making the allocations on the second point above. We will, therefore, consider the two points from the most adverse view possible. The "bare bones" cost of the properties between 1906 and 0 was $183,071. If to this were added fifteen per cent to cover all overheads mentioned above but not included heretofore, the original cost would be $210,460. No evidence was offered as to present per cent condition, although the company's set-up shows $63,000 in round num - bers in depreciation reserve as a bookkeeping entry. Let it be assumed, therefore, for purposes of this discussion, that the present worth, based </seg>
            <seg id="p295">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 295 on original cost on which the company would be entitled to earn divi - dends, is $150,000. (b) It cannot be said $26,257 is a proper share of the value of the jointly used roadway facilities, interest on which should be paid by ap - plicant. For the moment it will be considered that no interest on such jointly used property should be paid by applicant, thus increasing the net profit from the verbal contract to the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway company $2,100. Under such hypothesis the net profits from the operation of applicant's properties under the proposed rates would be as follows, based on the volume of traffic of the first ten months of 1919: Profit on three cent charge $ 8,200 Net income under increase 1,660 Interest on allocated part of value of jointly used roadbed 2,100 Total $11,960 This net corporate income will be sufficient to pay eight per cent on the valuation of $150,000, if the company retained such net earnings. But this hypothesis is subject to attack. The hypothetical net return must logically be reduced by an amount out of the above total which could without question be demanded by the parent company for services performed which the company says would practically wipe out all net corporate income of applicant. The Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway company is entitled to an interest charge on whatever value lies in the allocated portion of its roadway and terminals between Albright and 24th and N streets in South Omaha whether this value be $26,000 or a much smaller figure. Under the charges made against the revenue derived from the three cents from each passenger of the Omaha &amp; Southern company, the cur - rent furnished for operating Omaha &amp; Southern cars on the jointly used tracks is figured at 1.14 cents per kilowatt hour, which is the cost of manufacture at the switchboard at the power house. Under the hold - ings of the supreme court of Nebraska (The Lincoln Traction Co. vs. The City of Lincoln), the Omaha 4-Cpuncil Bluffs Street Railway com - pany is entitled to a profit from the sale of this current to another cor - poration. It is also entitled to figure' the loss in transmission between the power house and point of delivery to the Omaha &amp; Southern cars, and also to a return on the proper share chargeable to it for special conduit equipment for high tension electrical lines. It cannot be said that the figure of $150,000 is a proper value of the Omaha &amp; Southern properties on which it can rightly claim the right to earn dividends. Various factors not before the Commission, how - ever, are to be taken into consideration in reaching a determination and the Commission is not prepared to pass on such valuation. In the </seg>
            <seg id="p296">296 1 JllltX riri^i X Jl A^lMUAlj KuxAsxtX hypothesis it has taken what appeared to be a minimum figure. kThus it will be seen that the rates asked for will not supply appli - t with more revenues than are necessary. In fact, applicant's tes - ony was that it could not hope to make this a profitable line; that had the law been otherwise, the line would have been constructed as a portion of the parent system and would today simply be an unprofitable limb; and that the purpose of the application is to reduce deficits from operation to a minimum. The Commission does not agree with appli - cant that it operates its system at a deficit because it appears very proper that a portion of the net profit paid to the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway company under the verbal three cent contract would, un - der a proper contract, remain to offset, in part or in whole, the deficits in the past. It appears essential that the Commission authorize the minimum raise asked for by applicant with one exception. Since its organization the company has operated its line to Ft. Crook, a distance of 8.66 miles from the terminal at South Omaha, at a commutation rate of seven and one-half cents per ticket. This same rate has been charged between Belle vue and the terminal in South Omaha. On the commutation tickets applicant has received no reve - nue for rides between Bellevue and Ft. Crook By this application it proposes five cents additional for the two miles between Ft. Crook and Bellevue, which has the effect of doubling the rate commuters have here - tofore enjoyed. For two reasons the Commission does not look with favor on this portion of the application; first, that in relation to the other zones it appears to be too high a rate; and second, the company has itself been responsible for the previous low rate and one hundred per cent increase appears inadvisable. It is true such an increase, if it pro - duced additional revenue, would not be producing more revenue than the company needs. As a matter of relationship only it seems proper that the company offer to the public commutation tickets between Ft. Crook and the terminal of the line in South Omaha at a rate of twenty tickets for $2.50; cash fares to remain at fifteen cents per ride. It also appears from the record that an emergency exists, inasmuch as between South Omaha and Albright two rates' of fare are charged for passage over the same tracks, the longer haul of the applicant company costing five cents, while the shorter haul of the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs company is at a rate of six and one-fourth cents per passage. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that, an emergency existing, the Omaha &amp; Southern Inter - urban Railway company be, and it hereby is authorized, effective April 10, 1920, to publish and collect the following schedule of rates: Between 24th and N streets, South Omaha and Hillcrest. 7c cash, or four tokens for 25c. </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4100 In the Matter of the Application of the Tilden Telephone Company for Auth - ority to Increase Rates. APPEARANCES: For Applicant — A. B. Warnke, secretary and manager OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Chairman: The Tilden Telephone company, a corporation, which is owned by A. B. Warnke and wife, operates an exchange at Tilden, serving 54 business subscribers, 204 residence subscribers, 100 farm subscribers and performs switching service for 215 farmers who own their own lines. The company was organized in 1902 by local residents in the community who were desirous of securing for themselves telephone ser - vice. The record as to the history of the plant is somewhat obscure, although it appears that $5,000 of stock was issued and paid for in the development period of the company and that $5,000 of stock was later issued in the form of a dividend, to compensate the stockholders for dividends earned and not paid. The record shows that the com - pany, during this period, was very economically managed and it is very probable that $10,000 represents the sacrifice made by the stock- letween 24th and N streets, South Omaha and Ft. Crook- 15c cash, or twenty tokens for $2.50 ietween Hillcrest and 27th street in Bellevue 6c letween 16th street in Bellevue and Ft. Crook 5c </seg>
            <seg id="p298">THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 298 holders. Mr. Warnke and his wife purchased the property in 1912, paying at that time $12,000. No valuation was made at this time by either party, it being assumed that the plant was worth the purchase price. Since purchasing the plant, Mr. Warnke has materially im - proved it, placing all the main leads within the town in underground cable at a probable cost of $3,000. In addition . he purchased four farm lines in 1917 and made certain additions thereto at a total cost of $2,325. The plant at the present time is part grounded and part metallic, all of the business telephones being on metallic lines and about one third of the residence telephones, the remainder being ground - ed. Mr. Warnke is changing the town lines as rapidly as possible from the grounded to the metallic type. The valuation made by the engineering department of the Commis - sion shows an original cost of the property of $25,335 and a present or depreciated cost of $16,155. While Mr. Warnke appears to have kept the physical property in good operating condition, he has been very lax in his bookkeeping and it is impossible to ascertain from his records even an approximation of his total investment at this time. Taking into consideration, however, the present physical value of the proper - ty, the amount he paid at the time of the purchase in 1912 and the additions and betterments made to the property since that time, the Commission is of the opinion that the present fair value of the pro - perty is not less than $14,000. Mr. Warnke testifies that he has put back into the property not only all of the earnings on his investment, but that he has likewise returned a considerable portion of his own salary. In fact, he has taken out of the revenue only actual living expenses for himself and family. The operating revenues and expen - ses, partly actual and partly estimated, for the year 1919, are as follows: $5,294.70 $5,294.70 Operating income $1,300.30 Revenues 54 Business subscribers @ $18.00 $ 972.00 204 Residence subscribers @ $12.00 2,448.00 100 Farm subscribers @ $15.00 1,500.00 215 Switching subscribers @ $5.00 1,07500 Toll (estimated) 600.00 $6,595.00 $6,595. 0i Expenses Maintenance and depreciation (10% on $25^35 ) $2,533.50 Operation 1,500.00 General officers 900.00 Office supplies, etc. 331.20 Insurance 30.00 </seg>

Mrs. Warnke and the girl divide the time during the day and Mr. Warnke handles the board at night. As has been noted, 573 patrons are connected to this ex- change. In addition, free service is given to the exchange at Meadow Grove and also to an inland exchange at Closter. The traffic to the latter point is very heavy and is difficult to handle on account of there being many long farm lines. Some twelve or fifteen hundred patrons may be reached, therefore, from the Tilden switchboard. It is ap- parent that one operator at the board at a time cannot handle to the best advantage so heavy a traffic. In the opinion of the Commission at least one more operator should be employed. At a salary of $45 per month, this would add $540 to the annual expenses as shown above, and make a total deficit of $560 for the year. Applicant has rates at the present time as follows Business service $1.50 per month Residence service 1.00 per month Farm service 1.25 per month At present no distinction is made between individual and party line service, although of the 204 residence subscribers, 123 are on individ- ual lines. Applicant proposes to increase the business rate 50c per month and make an additional charge of 25c per month to individual residence subscribers. These increased rates would produce added revenue in the amount of about $690 per year. This is but little more than the deficit shown, which indicates that the proposed rates will not be unreasonable. In the opinion of the Commission, Mr. Warnke is attempting to do too much of the work himself. At the present time he is manager, bookkeeper, lineman, and night operator. The result is that his books and accounts are very poorly kept. He should make arrangements to insure a better bookkeeping system. The Commission has already in- stalled its accounting system and Mr. Warnke will be expected to keep his accounts according to the rules therein set forth. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Tilden Telephone com- pany be and the same hereby is authorized to charge and collect the following schedule of rates, the same to become effective May 1, 1920. </seg>
            <seg id="p300">300 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant set apart annually for t purpose of maintenance and depreciation, a sum equal to 10 per t of $25,335, which sum shall cover the salary of lineman, auto or liv - ery expenses, cost of material for repairs and replacements and such other costs as are properly chargeable to maintenance and replacements. No part of this sum, however, shall be expended for new construction or additions and betterments. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, that as a condition of the approval of the rates herein applicant shall at once secure at least one addition - al operator to assist at the switchboard during the day. Notice of the acceptance of this condition and of the others imposed herein shall be filed by applicant with the Commission within ten days of the re - ceipt hereof.

            <seg id="p301">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 301 plication for authority to make a general increase in rates. In brief the rates applied for were: A general increase of twenty-five cents per month for bills paid promptly by definite date. Certain readjustments additional there - to were asked, and approval of the Commission was sought by appli - cant for a rule of sending no bills to subscribers covering the regular rental charges; a rule holding the company liable for only one set of batteries per magneto subscriber per annum, the subscriber to furnish any batteries in excess thereof; a rule approving the practice of the company in requiring an advance payment of three months for all new installations; and a rule requiring the subscriber to pay for changes in wiring and new wiring. Testimony during the hearing brought forth the fact that there are other service rules against which respondents complained; the tes - timony resulting in an investigation on the motion of the Commission and an order known as Resolution No. 53, which removed from con - sideration in this case certain of the points raised. In its original application applicant set forth necessity of an an - nual revenue of $48,141 and included in this the following: (a) $5,000 to cover deferred maintenance now needing attention. (b) The liquid reserve and working fund of $5,000. (c) Dividends on $100,000 investment at eight per cent, which in - vestment included $26,000 sacrifices. The rates proposed by applicant were said by it to fall $6,202 short of these requirements. PRESENT REVENUES The company exhibits as to its present earnings show $33,815 per annum, including revenues collected under the installation rules of the federal government. The Commission figures earnings from present rates at $34,145, not including increases in business, and earn - ings as a result of the proposed gross and net rates. EXPENDITURES OF 1919 At the time of the hearing applicant's showing was fragmentary and inconclusive. Much of the time at the hearing was taken up with testimony of the respondents in opposition to operating rules of the company. The Commission required the company to supplement its showing by a number of exhibits and hearing was held on these ex - hibits a month later in the offices of the Commission. Applicant has been doing a considerable amount of rebuilding and improvement and the Commission found that the accounts of expenditure for these pur - poses were very irregular and subject to much criticism. It was im - possible to ascertain either from the testimony of applicant or from the exhibits filed how much money was actually spent on current main- </seg>
            <seg id="p302">302 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT tenance, how much required for replacements due to deferred main - tenance, and how much for new construction, properly chargeable to new capital. Applicant attempted by a series of exhibits to relieve this embarrassing situation, but failed in part to do so. The tabu - lations were contradictory. They showed on their face that a con - siderable amount of the separation of expenditures was mere estima - tion and further that applicant had made erroneous charges against funds. No doubt arises that applicant spent all the money alleged. It was simply a case of inaccurate public utility accounting. The re - placement items for 1919 were based on a percentage of the total ex - penditures for maintenance and depreciation and not on any accurate knowledge. The charges to new construction showed items that could hardly have been anything other than repairs and replacements and vice versa. It was the company's practice when buying new materials to charge them immediately on an estimated basis to the purpose which at the moment it appeared they would be used for. No storehouse account was kept, or at least a very inadequate one. In fact, the testimony showed that at the very time the reconstruction and improvement pro - gram was at its height, the company ceased requiring from its line - men even the inadequate work reports previously required and all sep - aration of expenditures on plant had to be arrived at by separating items of expenditures showing on the general ledger at the time the exhibits were made. The general manager relied on his memory al - most entirely for this purpose. Late in the fall the Commission established an accounting system for applicant and, assuming that it will be carefully followed in the future, it will be possible to ascertain with great accuracy at a future date the results of the operation of this company. Daily work reports from maintenance and new construction men are required which reports will form the basis of division of expenditures into the proper accounts. The Commission's accountants will some time during this year check a considerable number of these daily work reports to ascertain how well they have been kept. The exhibits as to expenditures on plant for maintenance, replace - ments, and new construction are entirely too deficient to tie to, even in arriving at a temporary rate basis. It is necessary for the Com - mission to measure the needs of applicant by the experience of other companies as shown in a large number of cases which have been care - fully presented heretofore. No physical valuation of applicant's pro - perties has yet been made. Such a valuation is desired by applicant and is necessary in order that the Commission may act positively on rate and capitalization questions. This valuation will be made during the coming summer, but as a preliminary thereto applicant will be re - quired to make a complete invoice of its property for use in such val- </seg>
            <seg id="p303">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 303 uation studies. Fortunately the records furnish a fairly reliable es - timate as to the classes of property and its extent and on this, by ap - plying a percentage to cover normal maintenance and normal depre - ciation, a reasonably adequate temporary figure for these purposes can be made. Basing its conclusions on its knowledge of the company's property and previous findings of the Commission relative thereto, and on definite knowledge of a number of other plants of a similar charac - ter, it will be assumed for the purpose of this temporary case that the original cost of the property is $130,000. The Commission is accus - tomed on property of this size and class to allow annually ten per cent of the original cost to cover normal maintenance, normal replacements and average depreciation accrued but not realized. As stated heretofore, applicant based its need for additional reve - nues in part on three large items, one of which represented dividends at eight per cent on $100,000. During the hearing applicant withdrew from its temporary case its demand for the right to earn on $100,000 and asked that the case be considered on the basis of interest on the indebtedness and eight per cent on outstanding stock. It served no - tice that in the permanent case to follow it would itemize and develop its right to a higher valuation for earning purposes. It asked for $10,000 for: (a) $5,000 for replacements to cover deferred maintenance necessary for attention for which no funds are now available; and (b) To establish a depreciation reserve which is now exhausted. The rule of the Commission is that current revenues cannot be relied on to supply funds for replacements accrued during prior period, if previous earnings have supplied sufficient revenues to take care of de - preciation as it occurs. The question now arises as to whether such depreciation reserve was created in the past by the rates then in use for the purpose for which applicant now desires additional revenues. While the Commission has no adequate information at this time on present worth of applicant's property, whether on a basis of orig - inal cost, or of present prices, it is quite evident that the capital liabil - ities are below the present worth of the property on an original cost basis. It had from outside sources at the time of hearing put into the property less than $75,000. It is necessary at this time to discuss other legitimate sources from which the property has been created, tem - porarily excluding from consideration the claims of applicant for do - nated service and proper dividend earnings not paid but invested in plant. The company has properties which cost from $40,000 to $60,000 more than the invested capital. There can be no doubt that a consider - able percentage of this is depreciation reserve borrowed by the com- </seg>
            <seg id="p304">304 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT pany temporarily from the purpose for which it was set aside and in- vested for betterments and additions. Illustrating this by the finances of applicant for the last four years: At the hearing in November, 1915, the company had outstanding 138,250 in stock and $7,150 in notes and other indebtedness. Compar- ing these capital figures with those presented in the hearing as of No- vember 1, 1919, we have the following results: Date Stock Notes, Etc. November 1, 1919 $53,875 $18,300 November 1, 1915 38,250 7,150 Increase in 4 years $15,625 $11,150 There also has been added to the plant from cash contributions of stockholders and creditors $26,775 in four years. Of this amount $15,- 000 represented indebtedness incurred in the purchase of certain prop- erties from the Nebraska Telephone company. There was therefore added to the plant from investments aside from this purchase $11,775. The annual reports of the company made to the Commission from year to year show the following additions to plant, exclusive of the pur- chase of the properties of the Nebraska Telephone company: Year ending June 30, 1916 $11,296.62 Year ending June 30, 1917 13,870.96 $11,296.62 Year ending June 30, 1917 Last half of 1917 (estimated from report of the ex- penditures of the entire year) 5,608.50 ndar year 1918 2,900.00 __ 5,608.50 Calendar year 1918 To November 1, 1919 (from company's exhibit) 8,617.00 Total $42,293.08 Correction for the half of the report year 1916 already past at the time of the 1915 hearing 5,648.32 Net additions to plant in four years 36,644.76 Added from capital 11,775.00 Additions to plant from revenues $24,869-76 By the order of March, 1916, the Commission permitted applicant to earn at the rate of eight per cent on a valuation of $76,000 out of which the company paid dividends only on its outstanding stock, and an interest of six and seven per cent on notes and other indebtedness. The difference between what was actually paid out and what was authorised by the Commission undoubtedly went into the plant as in- vestment. Allowing for this factor, there still remains invested in plant during the four years between $16,000 and $17,000. This may be depreciation reserve temporarily borrowed from the proper fund, or both depreciation reserve and surplus earned. In so far as it was necessary that it be depreciation reserve, it must be counted, as belong- ing to that fund. </seg>
            <seg id="p305">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 305 This money is invested in property. It is not available for the purposes which applicant now desires. It is the duty of the appli - cant, however, having borrowed this money from a fund sacred to the property and thereby having temporarily escaped the capitalization of numerous improvements and extensions, to bring such portion of the borrowed depreciation reserve back into liquid form, as the necessity of the property requires. There remains but one way to do this and that is to capitalize the extensions made to the property out of depre - ciation reserve funds, to replace the depreciation reserve from the pro - ceeds of such sales of capital and use the money for the "re - placements which applicant now says are imperative. After this is done to the extent of $10,000 applicant does not need the second and third items heretofore mentioned as a part of the application as an in - tegral part of its rate application. It should proceed on a more vig - orous campaign for disposition of securities. It cannot hope to con - tinue to construct property out of revenues, thereby increasing its book values for the benefit of stockholders and at the expense of those who ere- merely buying service. This is a rule of the Commission from which it does not vary. We come now to discussion of the needs of the applicant which are proper charges against current revenues. Fortunately the expen - ditures for other purposes than on plant are available. From the tes - timony the following is gathered: Maintenance and depreciation: Ten per cent on estimated original cost of $130,000, less power traffic expense $12,500.00 Traffic Operators, allowing ten per cent to fifteen per cent in - crease over scale in latter part of 1919, depending on the number of operators used 10,300.00 Central office power and maintenance, depreciation, and return on storage batteries 500.00 Total traffic expenses Commercial $10300.00 iookkeeper $ 1,020.00 Cashier 900.00 5eneral manager 2,000.00 Directors 180.00 ients 660.00 Seat and light 400.00 Blank books, advertising, stationery, directories, etc 700.00 Collections 50000 insurance 250.00 Miscellaneous and deficits 600.00 Total commercial $ 7,210.00 Cotal present revenues , 34,000.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p306">306 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Net deficit $ 2,765. 00 This deficit must be overcome from additional revenues and sufficient revenue be provided thereafter to protect the company against un - foreseen demands which may be made during the temporary period this order will be in force. Respondents vigorously criticized the salary of $2,400 per annum paid to the general manager and counsel combined. They alleged that he did not devote enough time to the business of the company to war - rant such a salary. The results of the hearing indicated that some grounds existed for this criticism. The general manager did not have the details of the business well in hand. His service had not been so efficient as to enable him to present the affairs of the company prop - erly in the hearing. It will be noted that in the suggested tabulation oi expenditures which are not binding as to items, the salary of the general manager is placed at $2,000 per annum. It is suggested that the board of directors consider the criticism carefully. No conclu - sions are reached by the Commission in the matter at this time, but it will again be considered at the time of the permanent rate hearing iater in the year. The increase as asked by the company will yield $5,200 additional revenue per annum, not counting the earnings which may come from the application of gross rates to delinquents nor to increases in busi - ness. On these two matters only guesses can be made. This is more than the company requires on the present data at hand. Ap - plicant will be allowed sufficient increase to give it an estimated ad - ditional revenue of $3,765 per annum, plus the incidental earnings from application of gross and net rates, from charges for added mileage on individual line service outside exchange limits, and from such increase as may come from growing business. This additional revenue will provide a margin of safety of $1,000 per annum or more which will be sufficient to provide returns on any stock which may be sold to secure funds for rebuilding, or interest on notes issued to secure funds for these same purposes, and to defray unforeseen expenses. This order will provide against the use of any part of these funds for betterments during the existence of this order. It will provide also that very careful record be kept of any of the maintenance fund provided herein which may be used for deferred replacements which, it has been pointed out, should be cared for by the release of depre - ciation reserve funds now fixed in property.

            <seg id="p307">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 307 The company is engaged at this time on a rather extensive pro - gram of rebuilding and improvements. It is a laudable purpose which will benefit the users of the service. A considerable portion of the expenditures now in progress have been made necessary by action of city authorities. Such betterments and resulting improvements in service will directly reflect ir. the rates charged for service. Public utilities cannot be required to invest their funds without being assured of proper returns on such investment and proper protection of the in - vestment by depreciation reserve. Very likely the permanent rate case which will follow the valua - tion of the company's property will indicate the right of the company to earn on a higher property value than is provided in this order. Should this prove to be the case it will require certain other adjust - ments of rates. Rules Proposed Applicant takes strong position against any provision in the order tequiring it to furnish bills to patrons. The present practice cf the company is to leave the burden on the patron to remember the pay - ment dates. The general rule of the Commission is that when gross and net rates are provided in order to reduce uncollectible accounts every convenience should be given the subscriber to avoid the payment of the gross rate and still fall within the rule. Gross and net rates are not for revenue purposes; but to prevent losses from bad accounts and to permit the company to have the full measure of the use of its earnings. In this case, where the toll business is done entirely by another company which renders its own toll statements, the need of monthly bills is greatly reduced, since in a majority of cases the bill will be identical month by month. The company hires in its commer - cial department two girls, both devoting full time to their duties. The experience of other companies would indicate that this force is ample to take care of the rendering of bills. Since the monthly bills will be more or less unchanged, both the labor of preparation and the postage can be had at a minimum expense. All things considered, the Com - mission deems it advisable for the company to render regular state - ments of bills- Failure to receive such bills will not abrogate the gross and net rule, but will merely be an accommodation to the telephone using public, the cost of which in turn is passed on to the public as an ex - pense item. The company has followed the practice of limiting the supply of batteries on magneto phones and it desires to publish a rule that if more than one set is required in a year, the subscriber must pay the extra charge. Such a rule has been proposed many times, but the Commission has never seen fit to approve it. Such a variation exists in the life of batteries, even where the test shows strong at the time of installation, as to make the operation of such rule unjust to the </seg>
            <seg id="p308">308 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT subscriber. The subscriber pays for service, and the company is pre- sumed to furnish all necessary equipment. If batteries are abused, it lies within the province of the company to require compensation for such abuses, but mere use in telephone service cannot be considered an abu 8 e. Applicant has for years held to a rule requiring new subscribers to pay three months in advance as a protection of investment in install ing the equipment. Such a rule was probably justified when no charge existed for installation. At the present time, however applicant is using the service connection charges inaugurated by the federal gov- ernment. These service connection charges take the place of all other protective rules and so long as they continue the company should not require other advances. The order will provide that the company elim- inate the rule requiring advance payments beyond the period governed by the gross and net rates.

In the Matter of the Application of the Stella Telephone company for Auth - ority to Increase Rates. </seg>
            <seg id="p310">310 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 1 i OPINION AND FINDING HALL, Commissioner: The application herein was filed following a complaint and hearing as to service rendered the patrons of the company, the company ad - mitting that its lines were in poor shape and inefficient to furnish prop - er service but they were unable to rehabilitate their plant because of a lack of sufficient revenues. I The report of the engineering department of the Commission as the physical condition of the properties, shows that the properties were greatly depreciated and that adequate service could not be rend - ered until large improvements were made. The central office equip - ment was in bad shape, making it necessary to install a new switch - board. A new switchboard has been installed at a cost, according to the report to the Commission, of $1600. The building has been worked over and a family employed to take charge of the central office busi - ness. The company has been rehabilitating its lines and the work is now being continued which will, if carried out according to the pro - gram outlined by the company, enable it to render adequate service to its patrons. It is impossible for the Commission to say at this time just what amount the company is entitled to receive dividends upon. The pres - ent value of the property is shown by the engineering department as of July 19, 1919, to be $15,546. Since that time the new switchboard has been installed and the general working over of the properties have taken place. The Commission does not have a full report as to the betterments that have taken place in the distribution system. The reproduction new on a cost basis shows a value of $29,250.24 The Commission is of the opinion that for the present the com - pany should not pay a greater amount than seven per cent on $20,000, not intending, however, to fix the $20,000 as a final figure. When the company gets all of its reports in as to the amount of money spent in rehabilitating the property the Commission will then determine the exact amount upon which the company will be allowed to pay dividends. The Commission is of the opinion that the rates should be charged and collected as prayed for. The Commission is also of the opinion that an emergency exists and that the rates should be put into effect on the first of August, 1920. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Stella Telephone company be and the same hereby is authorised to charge and collect the following schedule of rates subject to the conditions herein: </seg>

Farm rates shall be due and payable quarterly in advance; how - ever, if said rates are paid on or before the thirtieth day of the first month of the current quarter a discount of twenty-five cents per month will be made, making the net rate $125 per month. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the company shall not pay div - idends to exceed seven per cent on $20,000, until complete showings are made by the company to the Commission as to the amount of money spent in rehabilitating the property, so that the Commission may be able to finally determine upon the amount of money which the com - pany is entitled to pay dividends.

Heesacker, manager; Kennedy, Holland, De- Lacy &amp; Horan, attorneys. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This applicant operates a rather small grounded system at Hay Springs, serving 30 business subscribers and 82 residence subscribers. It does switching for 18!) subscribers on independently owned farm lines. Its rates for a number of years have been: </seg>
            <seg id="p312">312 bThis plant was begun about fifteen years ago by an individual ;r. More than one-half of its growth has taken place in the last t years. It has changed hands frequently. Each owner has put in an independent amount of his own capital and has put back into the plant, according to the testimony, such portions of wages and earnings as exceeded modest living expenses. The present owner, Mr. Heesacker, paid $4000 for the property about two years ago and thinks he bought at a conservative figure. In support of his valuation he has filed an inventory showing a reproduction cost on present prices of $6,520 and a present worth of $5679. In this valuation are cer - tain loading items which include $450 office rent and clerk hire during construction, insurance, taxes, engineering and superintendence, amount - ing to $300; interest during construction for three months; and $500 for cost of obtaining subscribers. The total of these loading items is $1325. It is not a normal figure. It does not represent actual ex - penditures, nor does it represent a theoretical allowance which can be recognized. The Commission has taken the inventory supplied by the company and has estimated the condition per cent from the age of the proper - ties without having seen them, has allowed a general expense on con - struction of ten per cent in place of figures used by applicant and finds that the original cost, using units of cost actually realized, approxi - mately $4,750. The Commission is unable to accept the condition per cent presented by applicant. It is higher than experience shows the condition of such plants to be in. One item alone itself adds to the suspicion of the correctness of the whole as the company has put its switchboard into the valuation one hundred per cent condition and yet within a few months of the time the inventory was taken, it was found necessary to displace the switchboard and install a new one. A man - ufacturing concern offered but $70 for the old board, indicating it was in a very bad condition. Applicant testified that he had purchased a new switchboard, which would cost him installed approximately $800, and that he had done some construction since purchasing the plant and had added several subscribers, all in all adding to the property pur - chased by him in the neighborhood of $1000, if no allowance is made for the displaced property. If, however, he purchased this property, including the old switchboard, on the basis of the inventory a very con - siderable amount of the purchase price would have to be written off Business service $1.60 per month Residence service 1.00 per month Switching service 5.00 per annum X asks authority to increase these rates to the following basis: Business service $3.25 per month Residence service 2.25 per month Switching service .75 per month </seg>
            <seg id="p313">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 313 It is obviously impossible for the Commission to arrive at an ac - curate valuation on which the company should be entitled to earn, either from a study of its history or through a knowledge of the prop - erty existing, until such time as the Commission's engineers can check the property on the ground. Temporarily the Commission will permit applicant to earn on a basis of $4,500, although this figure is not to be considered the valuation of a permanent nature. Applicant uses two operators and furnishes service between six p. m. and nine p. m. on week days and for seven hours on Sunday. Subscribers desire twenty-four hour service, which improvement in ser - vice applicant desires to render and makes the cost thereof a part of the application. He also asks that his rates b«j sufficient to allow him to pay himself $125 per month as manager and lineman. He pays one operator $85 per month and furnishes the room in which she lives, and pays the other operator $30 per month and furnishes board and lodging. The head operator does most of the bookkeeping and collecting. Applicant's properties are entirely too small to require the con - stant attention of a lineman. Without doubt applicant is entitled to earn $125 per month for his entire time, but when this expense is spread over the maintenance of a system of 120 phones, it is seen at cnce it is a prohibitive figure. Applicant has ample time to do other work and it is suggested that possibly arrangements could be made with the switched lines so that he could add to his revenue by furnish - ing the maintenance labor on these lines. The rates provided here ■will not provide in excess of $75 per month for the lineman and manager. Wages paid the chief operator are in excess of the average paid for that class of service. AH the evidence before the Commission indicates that the people of Hay Springs desire twenty-four hour service and are willing to pay substantial increases for this improvement in service. Very few plants of this size in Nebraska afford twenty-four hour service because of the expense involved. The Commission is unable to figure how it would De justified at Hay Springs unless a majority of the subscribers with full knowledge of the fact that it will cost more, indicate their willingness to pay the cost of the increased service. The evidence at hand is wholly from the business men and may not reflect the attitude cf the subscribers as a whole. In determining the rates the Commission is figuring on a period of service from six a. m. to 11:00 p. m., and a night bell at fifteen cents- per call thereafter. This amount of service can be furnished by two full-time operators and one part-time operator who can be either the manager himself or otherwise. To increase the service to a twen - ty-four hour basis will require an additional rate per month over those which will be here allowed for town service of at least twenty-five </seg>
            <seg id="p314">314 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT cents per subscriber and an increase in switching rates per station of 15c per month. If, subsequent to the putting into effect of the rates herein to be authorized, substantial showing is made to the Com- mission that the subscribers interested are willing to pay this higher rate for twenty-four hour service, it will be authorized. By figuring the wages of the lineman at $75 per month and the wages of the opera- tors at $1,480 per annum plus $200 additional for bookkeeping to be paid to an operator or the manager, dependent on who does the work, and providing a depreciation reserve of $275 per annum, the Commiss- ion believes that rates which will produce $4100 per year will take care of the present needs of the company including eight per cent re- turn on a valuation of $4500. An estimate of these expenses is as follows as shown by applicant's testimony and from other company experience: Batteries for station sets and central office $ 250.00 Rates will be approved which will produce that amount of revenue. These rates will be for a six months period, at the close of which time any readjustments will be made as are warranted by the showing at that time.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4113 In the Matter of the Application of the Blair Telephone Company for Author - ity to Increase Its Capital Stock in Amount to be Determined by the Commission. APPEARANCES: For Applicant — Clark O'Hanlon, attorney; J. H. Christensen, mana ger. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Chairman: The Blair Telephone company was organized in 1902 as a corpor - ation, the purpose being to furnish telephone service in Blair and vicin - ity as nearly at cost as possible. The company grew rapidly from the start until today it has exchanges at Blair, Ft. Calhoun and Kennard, and serves approximately 1200 subscribers. Stock was issued and sold at the outset to finance the construction of the plant. Shares or - iginally had a par value of $30 each. In its financing, however, the company pursued a different policy than that usually followed by tele - phone companies of similar character. After disposing of $8,56C worth of stock, it made assessments upon the stockholders for the money necessary to finance the additions and betterments. There were six of these assessments, the amounts and dates being as follows: anuary 12, 1904 anuary 1, 1905 )ctober 7, 1905 -? 2,070.1 3,135.1 </seg>
            <seg id="p316">316 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT tThe record is clear that all of the money derived from the sale the stock and from the assessments was used in the construction of plant and that none of it was used for operation or maintenance. At the present time the company has outstanding common stock in the amount of $10300. It asks authority to issue stock to cover the actual investment in the property plus the dividends thereon, leaving the exact amount of such issue to the judgment of the Commission. On April 1, 1919, the engineering staff of the Commission made a val - uation of applicant's property for the purpose of the accounting system to be installed upon our order. This valuation shows the original cost of the property to be $68,62592 and the present value on this basis to be $41,401.04. This valuation was made by the engineers largely from an inventory furnished by the company and the physical condi - tion was ascertained from an inspection of the property. Because of the purpose for which it was made the valuation was not quite as thorough as is usually made, although it probably represents a very fair approximation. The company in addition to the physical proper - ty has liquid assets of approximately $6,000. It will be seen, there - fore, that the present value of the physical property plus the working assets give a figure of $47,401. Applicant has computed dividends on the stock and on the assess - ments from the dates when the money was actually paid by the stock - holders, on the basis of compound interest at seven per cent. By this method a grand total investment, including stock, assessments, and in - terest compounded at seven per cent, of $77,359.27 is produced. From this figure should be deducted the dividends actually paid, amounting to $13,232, which leaves the sum of $64,127.27. It is manifest that the present value of the assets of the company will not justify a cap - italization to this amount. Evidently the rates have not been suffi - cient to pay reasonable dividends and at the same time maintain the property at its original cost. If we compute dividends on the basis of seven per cent simple interest and deduct the dividends actually paid, we have a figure of $47,676.64. This approaches very closely the pres - ent value of the assets as shown above. The history of this company discloses that it has always been eco - nomically managed. For many years the officers received no salaries whatever. There is much that can be said in favor of the proposition that the dividends reinvested in the property are entitled to an earning in the same manner and to the same extent as any other money belong - ing to the stockholder that is invested in the business. It is the under - standing of the Commission, however, that applicant is not insistent April 1, 1906 2,110.00 February 1, 1907 3,705.00 January 15, 1908 9,807.00 Total $23,414.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p317">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 317 upon its claim, having made the computation in order to furnish one of the measures for determining what the capital should be. In view of the history of the company and of the actual invest - ment in cash, reinvested dividends and services, the Commission is of the opinion that capital stock to the amount of $47,500 may be issued by the company without doing injury to the rate-paying public and with - out being unfair to the stockholders. The company already have out - standing stock in the amount of $10,800. Upon the basis of the capital - ization of $47,500, therefore, it would be justified in issuing new stock to the amount of $36,700. The Commission is of the opinion that such an issue of stock is reasonably necessary and should be approved. The company may select its own method for the distribution of this stock among the existing stockholders. Its issuance, however, should be accepted by all stockholders as full payment for all claims against the company. The present authorized capital stock of the company is only $40, - 000. The increase of capital beyond that amount will necessitate an amendment to the articles of incorporation. The order issued herein, therefore, will be made subject to the condition that such amendment to the articles is made and notice of the same furnished to the Commission. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Blair Telephone company be and the same hereby is authorized to issue its common stock in the amount of $36,700, the same to be issued to stockholders in lieu of cash paid into the treasury of the company in the form of assess - ments and in lieu of dividends earned but not paid, such distribution of stock to be on such equitable basis as the board of directors may determine. Notice of such distribution and the method employed shall be filed with the Commission when such distribution takes place. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the approval, as above granted, i.s made subject to the condition that applicant amend its articles of incorporation to conform with this order, notice of such amendment to be filed with the Commission.

            <seg id="p318">318 APPLICATION NO. 4126 In the Matter of the Application of the Citizens Telephone Company of Mal - mo for Authority to Increase Its Ex - change Rates. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Chairman This company operates four exchanges, vir., Malmo, Weston, Morse Bluff and Prague. Its headquarters are at Malmo. It serves ap - proximately 800 subscribers on the four exchanges. Its rates at the present time are as follows: The affairs of the company and its financial history were considered and reviewed by the Commission in an opinion and order issued on May 10, 1916. At that time a valuation of the property was made by the engineering department of the Commission. It was shown by that record, which is made a part of the record of this case, that the con - struction of the property of this company commenced in 1901. Later the property was purchased by Mr. H. H. Cheney, who in turn sold a half interest to Mr. E. C. Hunt and wife, the latter paying $22,000. The financial history of the company prior to that time was found to be incomplete by the Commission. The valuation made for the purpose of that case showed a reproduction value now of $47,281.91 and a present or depreciated value of $32,030.47. It was found at that time that the property was too greatly depreciated to give ade - quate service and before increased rates were approved applicant was required to do considerable rebuilding. Among other things, it was required to install a new switchboard at Malmo, construct metallic trunk lines between Malmo and Prague, Malmo and Morse Bluff, Mal - mo and Colon, and to reconstruct the farm lines so as to have not more than twelve subscribers to the line. All of the farm houses were to be re-wired and many telephones were to be replaced by new. The report of the Commission's engineer, who made an inspection of the property, state that practically all of the requirements of the Com - mission were complied with. In fact it was stated that the owner of the property had done more than he had agreed to db at the hearing, Business service $2.00 per month Individual residence service 1-25 per month Two-party residence service 1.00 per month Farm service 1.25 per month pplication is nude to increase these rates as follows: Business service $2.60 per month Individual residence service 1.60 per month Two-party residence service 1.25 per month Farm service .._ 1.50 per month </seg>
            <seg id="p319">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 319 It was anticipated by the Commission and by Mr. Hunt, general manager, that the proposed improvements would cost not to exceed $7,000. After the work started, however, Mr. Hunt found it neces - sary to make more extensive improvements than he had intended so that the cost was considerably more than estimated. In addition to the improvements stated, further additions and betterments have been made to the property so that the total additions since 1916 amount to $10,250. Mr. Hunt states that he has been careful to differentiate between maintenance and new construction and he states further that all of the $10,250 of new money put into the property came from the pockets of the three stockholders and none of it from surplus revenues. The Commission appears to have made no finding in its previous order with reference to the fair value of the property, although for the purposes of that case it computed dividends on the basis of $44,000. This figure exceeded the depreciated physical value of the property at that time. It is unnecessary for the purposes of this case to deter - mine definitely the present fair value of the property as of this date. If we add, however, the $10,250 of additional capital that has been put into the property since 1916 to the depreciated value of the property as existed at that time, we have a figure of $42,280. Without a final determination as to the accuracy of this figure it will be used for the purpose of computing dividends in this proceeding. Adding the $10, - 250 to the reproduction new value of the property in 1916, we have $57,747, as representing the reproduction new value of the property at this time. This figure will be used as a basis for determining the allowance for maintenance and depreciation. The plant of applicant is entirely grounded, although it is con - tended by Mr. Hunt that the standard of construction is better than that in the average grounded plant for the reason that he has followed the plan of limiting the parallel of circuits for not more than a dis - tance of five miles. This he claims materially reduces induction and consequent cross talk. Such construction requires more pole mileage than might otherwise be necessary. As the company owns buildings at each of its exchanges, the real estate item in this property consti - tutes a larger factor than in the average company. All of the main - tenance work is handled from Malmo and two linemen are kept con - stantly employed. In addition Mr. Hunt directs this work and assists with it. Mr. Hunt makes a point of the fact that he endeavors to handle service complaints as soon as they are reported and that he does not wait for such complaints to be "bunched" before giving them attention. Under the rates as now applied, a business subscriber at Malmo has free connection with two exchanges in addition to his local ex - change. Residence and farm subscribers at that point have two ex - changes by the payment of the flat rate and if they pay a year in ad - vance they are given the choice of a third exchange. This rule, with </seg>
            <seg id="p320">320 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT some variation as to the choice of towns, applies to all of the four exchanges. Some of the exchanges have the choice of Wahoo, which is the county seat of the county. During the past year the company has met with some very sharp increases in operating expenses. Prior to August 1, 1919, the salary paid to the operator at each exchange ranged from $35 to $40. Upon threat of a strike at that time these salaries were increased to $60, making an increase of at least $25 per month at each exchange, or $100 for the four exchanges. It is anticipated by Mr. Hunt that he will have to increase these salaries to $65 per month if he retains efficient operators. The salary of his first lineman was increased from $85 to $125 per month and of the second lineman from $65 to $125 per month. The salary of his bookkeeper was increased from $35 to $55 per month He was able to retain neither of these men at the increased salary. and the latter amount proved insufficient to hold this employe. An increase in the revenues of the company is asked to cover these and other expenses realized during the past \ear and anticipated for the immediate future. The revenues and expenses for 1919, adjusted by us to meet our requirements with reference to maintenance and depie - ciation, and to include the increases to operators and clerks, as re - ferred to, are as follows: Revenues Toll $ 1,199.95 Subscribers service 12,565.05 $13,969.40 $13,969.40 Expenses Maintenance and depreciation (10 per cent on $57,747, $ 5,744.70 Operators Operators 2,880.00 Stationery and advertising 138.88 Light, heat and water 144.44 Incidentals 34.76 Messenger service 31.05 $ 3,229.13 3,229.13 General : Officers salaries Clerks _$ 1,225.00 695.00 Expense of collections Legal expense 208.36 12.50 Traveling expense 67.05 44.55 Sundry sales Miscellaneous earnings Connection charges nstallation charges 1.4i 80.5i 31.51 91.01 </seg>
            <seg id="p321">321 It will be seen that applicant is operating at a substantial deficit. The rates as proposed will produce added revenue in the amount of approximately $2600 per year. This will produce a surplus of seven or eight hundred dollars in addition to the immediate requirements, although this would be reduced to five or six hundred dollars in the event the operators' salaries are increased as anticipated. Under the circumstances we are of the opinion that such a surplus will not be excessive, but the company will be required to make a showing as of March 1, 1921, as to the sufficiency of its revenues at that time. Any surplus over and above operating expenses and dividends should be held in the treasury, pending the further order of the Commission.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4129 la the Matter of the Application of the Gage County Independent Telephone Company for an Increase in Rates and for Authority to Issue a Stock Divi- OPINION AND FINDING HALL, Commissioner Applicant company was organized and incorporated in 1902, the purpose being to construct and operate a telephone system on a mu - tual basis by requiring every telephone user to take one share of stock for each phone subscribed for. The stockholders were charged $25 a share for the stock and the money was used in constructing an exchange in Blue Springs and all of the main leads for the country lines. The stockholders also furnished their own instruments and hauled and set the poles for all of the stub lines and drops, for which they received no stock. They were charged twenty cents a month for telephone service for the purpose of defraying actual operating ex - penses. This continued until 1906, when the company began to take on a few renters who were not stockholders. The renters v.-ere charged $1.00 per month, for which all services were furnished to the renter by the company, they having no investment in the properties or &gt;lock whatever. The two systems of rates continued until Jan - uary 1, 1910. During the year 1909 the company made arrangement with all of its stockholders to take over all of the instruments, drops and leads that were owned individually by the stockholders and took up all of the shares of stock outstanding,, the par value of which was $25, and in lieu thereof issued stock at $50 per share par value. Be - ginning with January 1, 1910, new rates were established and all parties were charged alike for the same class of service, the rates being $1.50 per month for business phones and $1.00 per month for residence and farm phones. Prior to 1910 there had been some assessments made upon the stockholders above the twenty cents per month, which, of course, was all merged into the stock that was issued at J50 per </seg>
            <seg id="p323">323 share par value, the new issue operating as a complete settlement, between the company and its stockholders. Up to this tinm the com - pany had never paid any dividends, the shareholder? having received service in lieu of dividends by reason of the twenty cent rate that ih«-y had paid. Beginning with 1911 down to the close of 1918, the com - pany paid on the average approximately seven per cent dividends an - nually. In the year 1919 only a three per cent dividend wa- paid. The company now applies to the Commission for ar increase ir. rates, and also a stock dividend of one hundred fifty per cent. The application for the stock dividend, however, was abandoned during the progress of the hearing and the company proceeded with its applica - tion for an increase in rates. The books of the company thiough all of the years from 1902 to January 1, 1919, have been so kept that it is absolutely impossible to get an adequate idea as to how much of the revenues went into the maintenance of the plant and how much into extensions, betterments and replacements. About the only adequate data that can be gotten from the books is the amount of money received and the amount of money expended. Exhibit 1, furnished by applicant, is a tentative valuation, which was taken from the books after opening accounts under the system of bookkeeping which was installed Janu - ary 1, 1919. The tabulation of figures is not supported by competent testimony, nor is it adequate for the Commission to come to any con - clusion whatever as to the value of the properties, nor does the entire record enable the Commission to come to any reasonable conclusion as to the value of the properties to be used as a basis for rate-making. The evidence does show that there is now outstanding in stock $12,150 of the par value of $50 per share and that the company has in its treasury thirteen shares of the old $25 stock and twenty shares of the $50 stock which was bought up from the stockholders. The evidence pi so shows that it is necessary for the company to expend from $2500 to $3,000 for replacements, reconstruction and betterments in order to bring the properties up to a proper standard of efficiency. The Commission is of the opinion that the first stock that should be sold to the public is that which it now holds in its treasury, and that the thirteen shares, having a par value of $25, should be converted into stock having a par value of $50. This would amount to six and one-half shares with a par value of $50, amounting to $325, and the twenty shares, having a par value of $50, should also be sold, making a total sale of $1325. This would make total stock outstanding $13, - 475. The company should issue and sell new stock in the amount of $1,525, having a par value of $50 per share. This will make an out - standing capitalization of $15,000 and will put into the treasury $2850, which should be spent in reconstruction, replacements and betterments. The testimony of the stockholders is to the effect that they can sell stock to raise the necesssary funds for reconstruction, replacements </seg>
            <seg id="p324">324 and betterments if they are assured they will get seven per cent an - nually on their investment. The testimony also shows that the great drawback in placing their securities among their own stockholders is the feeling that dividends are uncertain. We think there will be no question about the certainty of dividends if the orders of the Com - mission are carried out. After the dividends are provided for and all operation, maintenance and depreciation taken care of out of the oper - ating revenues, the Commission is of the opinion that a surplus should be created so as to settle all doubt as to dividends. Investors in stock or other securities of public utilities, where the rate of dividends or interest is limited by a regulating body, should be assured that th« rate of return on such stock or securities, fixed by such regulating body, will be taken care of as nearly as possible out of the operating income of the company. This, of course, the Commission will under - take to do. The operating expenses, as shown by the report for 1919, in all probability will be increased to some extent for the year 1920. There is no testimony in the record directly upon this point, but the Commission has been informed by Mr. F. F. Roderick, general man - rger of the company's affairs, that the operating expenses for 1920 are now running between $50 and $75 per month above what they were in the year 1919. Some leeway will be given in the rates to cover such contingencies- The Commission will take the figure of $15,000 as a basis for a return in dividends, at the rate of seven per cent, until a proper valua - tion of the properties can be made, that the Commission may determine just what value is in the properties upon which the company is entitl - ed to earn dividends. k Under the new system of bookkeeping the Commission is well ised as to what has taken place during the year 1919. The report ws that the total revenues from all sources for the year were $8, - 284.54; that there was spent for maintenance $2,846.76; and that it has set aside: in the depreciation reserve fund $515.29, making a total for maintenance and depreciation of $3,362.05. The amount of money actually spent for maintenance in all probability is not correct because the testimony shows that the company in rebuilding its lines is re - placing sixteen foot poles with twenty foot ones, and that it has spent on its central office equipment $895.45, while the value, as placed upon the central office equipment is only $1,015. The report shows that the traffic expenses for the year were $2, - 348.50; commercial expenses, $1,720.12, making a total actual expense of $6,915.38. The company paid three per cent dividends, amounting to for the year, $372.00. It set aside for maintenance and deprecia - tion above that which was actually spent, $515.29, leaving a net bal - ance, after paying taxes, of $269.73. This makes a total of $1,157.02 which was available for dividends. Dividends at seven per cent upon $13,475 (the amount of stock outstanding, including that which was in </seg>
            <seg id="p325">325 the treasury) amount to $943.25. This deducted from $1,157.02 leaves a net balance of $213.77. When the stock has been increased to $15,000.00 as provided herein, and the proceeds of the increase spent in rehabilitating the properties, the dividends at seven per cent annually will amount to $1,050.00. Ac- tual operating expense for 1919, including money spent for mainte- nance and depreciation, $6,915.38, making a total based on 1919 exper- ience of $7,965.38. Taxes, $212.14; total expenses, $8,177.52; total op- erating revenue for 1919, $8,284.54. This would leave a balance of $107.02, which, in the opinion of the Commission, should be increased at least $1500. The company is operating 612 phones, made up of the following tabulated classes of service and at the schedule of rates therein con- tained : Number Rate subscribers per month Individual business 15 $1.50 Individual residence 4 1.50 Two-party (approximately) 4 1.25 Three and four-party (approximately) 144 1.00 Farm residence, metallic 27 1.00 Farm residence, grounded 418 1.00 Total phones 612 The Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the rates as shown above should be increased in accordance with the following tab- ulation: Amount of Number Increase increase of phones Rate per month per year Individual business 15 $2.00 $ .50 $ 99M 15 $2.00 $ .50 $ 99.00 Individual residence 4 1.50 Two, three and four- party residence 148 125 .25 444.00 Farmers, metallic 27 1.40 .40 129.60 Farmers, grounded 418 1.20 .20 1,003.20 Total increase per year $1,666.80 The Commission is of the opinion that the company should pay div- idends at the rate of seven per cent upon $15,000 at the end of each year and if the operating revenues under the new rates prove to be too much or too little, rates will be lowered or raised by the Commission in accordance with the facts as they are developed. The Commission is of the opinion that the company should set up upon its books month- ly $250, amounting to $3000 per year, as a maintenance and depre- ciation fund, which shall be used for no other purpose. This also may have to be varied in the future as the actual facts as to necessi- ties are developed.

OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Chairman: This Commission issued an order on November 22, 1919, (Applica - tion No. 4107), approving the consolidation of the Ord Independent Tele - phone company with the Farmers Mutual Telephone company, and ap - proving an issue of stock in the amount of $20,000 by the latter com - pany to cover the purchase of the other property and to pay for neces - sary additions and betterments. The history of the Ord Independent company is quite fully recited in that opinion. In Application No. 3509 the affairs of the Farmers Mutual Telephone company were con - sidered and an issue of stock approved on June 24, 1919. It is un - necessary, therefore, to repeal our discussion of the financial affairs of these two companies. It is sufficient to say that the Farmers Mu - tual Telephone company absorbed the property and the business of the Ord Telephone company and will hereafter conduct the consolidated business. Following the consolidation, the Farmers Mutual company made application to the Commission for authority to charge and collect a new schedule of rates for exchange service at Ord. The Farmers Mu - tual company originally owned no farm lines, but in consolidation ac - quired a number of farm subscribers from the Ord Independent com - pany. Having no farm rate filed, it is now at some disadvantage in not being able to assess a legal rate for such service. At this time it makes no application to change the rates on its Burwell exchange except the rate applying to farm service. The schedule of rates, u applied for, is as follows: Monthly Rates — Main Station, Ord, Nebraska Business phone, metallic circuit $3.50 lusiness phone, grounded circuit 300 Residence phone, metallic circuit 1.75 Residence phone, grounded circuit 1.50 Residence phone, two-party, metallic circuit 1.50 Resilience phone, two-party, grounded circuit 1.25 lusiness extension phone, wall 1.00 lusiness extension phone, wall with bell 1.25 lusiness extension phone, desk 1.00 lusiness extension phone, desk with bell 1.25 Residence extension phone, wall : .50 </seg>
            <seg id="p328">328 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Residence extension phone, wall with bell . .75 Residence extension phone, desk .76 Residence extension phone, desk with bell 1.00 No hearing was had upon this application as the affairs of ap - plicant have been very thoroughly investigated and inquired into in the previous hearings. Applicant submits considerable data as to its costs of operation, both before and since consolidation, together with an estimate of such costs for the year 1920. It has experienced sub - stantial increases in operating expenses, due quite largely to the prev - alent high standard of wages and material costs and also in a lesser degree to the added expense resulting from consolidation of the two properties. The unification of the two plants resulted in the removal of 144 duplicate telephones in the city of Ord, 94 of which were busi - ness phones paying $2.00 per month, 34 residence phones paying $1.25 per month, and 16 rural phones paying $13.00 per year. The removal of these duplicate telephones means a loss in revenue to the company of $2,974 per year. The company now gives service to about six hun - dred subscribers. In addition it switches over six hundred fanners who own and maintain their lines. This makes a total of twelve hundred receiving service at Ord, in addition to which free connection is fur - nished to Burwell and North Loup. At the time of the hearing upon the application for authority to consolidate, it was impossible to determine the value of the consolidated plant for the reason that the company was uncertain at that time just how much of the two properties could be utilized and how much the cost of consolidating the plants would amount to. This matter is still undetermined. The company is engaged in consolidating the two plants and in making extensive improvements. For the purposes of this case and in order to make an approximate estimate of an allow - ance for maintenance and depreciation, the Commission will use the Extension bell 2b Extension gong 26 Alphabetical listing in directory of additional names (business phone) 1.00 Alphabetical listing in directory of additional names (residence phone) 25 Mileage charge, per one-fourth mile or fraction, (this ap- plies to subscribers receiving full service outside cor- porate limits) .25 Kvate exchanges: tion phones.

            <seg id="p329">329 combined original cost of the two properties in Ord. These costs were ascertained by the Commission's engineering department in the previous proceedings. The combined original cost of the two sys - tems was $56,252.87. Deducting from this the original cost of the exchange at Burwell, amounting to $11,680.20, we have $44,572.67. It is altogether probable that after the work of consolidation has been completed the value of the Ord exchange will be considerably less than this. Both plants, however, were in a run-down condition and current maintenance during the period of reconstruction will be materially higher than after a normal condition is reached. For that reason an allowance of ten per cent on the combined original cost, as thus stated, will probably not produce an excessive amount for maintenance and de - preciation. It should be stated in this connection that the company is now paying its chief lineman $2100 per year and has another em - ploye engaged in maintenance and construction work on the basis of sixty cents per hour. While these men will undoubtedly be engaged in some new construction, the bulk of the work for the next few months will be in working the two properties over into an efficient operating unit. Slightly less than $5000 of new stock was authorized by the Commission for the purpose of defraying a portion of such cost and the company is making proper charges against this fund. The total outstanding stock of applicant company, as approved by the Commission, is $35,700. From this should be deducted the stock covering the Burwell exchange. If we make a deduction on the basis of the present value of the Burwell exchange, as found by the engineers, we have $32,770 remaining to cover the Ord exchange. The estimated earnings and expenses for the year 1920, as sub - mitted by the company, is as follows, with the exception that we have readjusted the allowance for maintenance and depreciation to the basis of ten per cent on $44,572: Earnings 382 residence @ $1.25 $ 5,730.00 116 business @ $2.00 2,784.00 $ 5,730.00 116 business @ $2.00. 72 farm @ $1.08% 936.00 653 switched phones @ 50c 3,918.00 Tolls 1300.00 Miscellaneous 100.00 Maintenance and depreciation (10 per cent on $44,572) 4,457.20 $4,46720 Operation: 3 operators @ $60 1300.00 5 operators @ $43 2,700.00 1 night operator @ $60 W0.00 flO,OOO.UU 1300.00 100.00 $15,268.00 $15,268.1 </seg>

It is suggested by applicant, however, that fur - ther increases in the salaries of operators may be experienced so that the excess in the items mentioned may be offset by the increase referred to. It should be stated that a major portion of the items in operating expenses is actual and is certain to be realized by the company. The salaries paid to general officers appear to be high when compared to compensation for similar services paid by other companies. During the period of readjustment and consolidation, however, ill of the time of Mr. Bailey, secretary and manager, and a considerable portion of the time of Mr- Blessing, president, will be occupied with the affairs of the company. By fall this work should be well in hand and at that time it can be definitely determined what a reasonable general expense should be. From this showing a probable deficit of $2,269 will be re - alized by the company if the present rates are continued. It is im - possible to determine definitely how much increased revenue will be produced by the rates asked for by applicant, due to the fact that the number of subscribers taking metallic and grounded service is not giv - en, nor is it possible at this time to determine how many of the sub - scribers will take individual or party line service. On the assumption that two-thirds of the residence subscribers were to take party line service, and one-third individual line service on the grounded rates, and the 116 business subscribers were to take individual line metallic ser - vice, and the 72 farm Subscribers be increased from $13 to $18 per year, the increase in revenue would amount to $2730.

            <seg id="p331">331 the rates proposed will produce added income between $2500 and $3000. The rates proposed for extension sets, bells and other accessories will not in all probability produce a large amount of revenue as some of such service is already in effect and charged for. Because of the more or less disorganized condition of this company, due to the consolidation, the Commission is of the opinion that no per - manent rates should be approved at this time. Within a period of six or seven months the subscribers will have adjusted themselves to the various classes of service and it will be possible to ascertain definitely the exact amount of revenue derived from the rates. Moreover, by the end of such a period the operating expenses will have approached the normal and it will be possible to more accurately determine a nor - mal operating cost. It may be shown at the end of such a period that the rates asked for herein are too high and that lower rates should be assessed. For these reasons, the Commission is of the opinion that the rates as applied for should be approved subject to the condition that the company make further showing at the end of seven months as to their reasonableness. In this connection it should be stated that the company is making application to establish a rate of $18 per year for farm line service on its Burwell exchange. No showing has as yet been made as to the operating costs on that exchange, but the company proposes to make such showing within a short time. Permission will be given to make such a rate, subject to the condition that it may be changed by the Commission upon showing by the company. Applicant represents that its farm lines at Burwell cover an extended territory and that the cost of maintenance of such service is above the normal. In connection with applicant's schedule, it asks for installation charges for extension phones and other accessories. Inasmuch as the Commission has under consideration the whole question of installation charges and plans to issue a general order in the near future covering such charges, we think it best not to approve these rates at this time. We are of the opinion also that the discontinuance of free service to Burwell and North Loup should not be approved at this time.

            <seg id="p333">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 333 APPLICATION NO. 4130 In the Matter of the Application of the Farmers Mutual Telephone company for Authority to Increase Its Ex - change Rates. SUPPLEMENTAL FINDING AND ORDER TAYLOR, Chairman: Effective April 1, 1920, rates approved by the Commission were es - tablished by applicant covering consolidated service resulting from the combination of the Farmers Mutual Telephone company of Ord and the Ord Telephone company. These rates, under the terms of the order of the Commission, were to remain in effect until November 1, 1920, prior to which time applicant was to make further showing as to their effect. Such showing has been made in the form of a report cover - ing not only the six months period since April 1, but the nine months period from January 1 to October 1. When the original order was made it was impossible to determine just what the operating expenses would be and almost as difficult to predict the revenue that would accrue from the consolidated exchange- It is apparent from an analysis of the figures for the nine months per - ioci that conditions are still more or less abnormal and that it will be several months before the company emerges from the influences of the consolidation. A summary of the revenues and expenses for the nine months period is submitted herewith. As a matter of interest we have placed in a parallel column the estimated revenues and expenses as determined by the Commission in the original order. Earnings $11,450.97 $12,832.08 $12332.08 Expenses Maintenance and depreciation (10 per cent on $44,572) $ 3,342.87 $ 5,050.64 Operators 3,825.00 3,736.25 Power 31.50 369.65 Stationery and printing 225.00 161.16 Office supplies and expenses 270.00 263.03 Rents 180.00 131.72 Other general expenses 184.50 259.97 Salaries of officers 1,802.50 Estimated Actual Rentals % 7,087.50 Switching 2,938.50 Toll 1,350.00 Miscellaneous 74.97 $ 8,094.25 2,910.00 1,329.55 498.28 </seg>
            <seg id="p334">334 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT It will be observed that the company has expended during the period $5,050.64 for maintenance and depreciation. This exceeds by 1,707.77 the allowance of ten per cent upon the original cost made by the Commission. It is difficult to determine exactly whether the amounts made by the Commission will in the course of time prove suf - ficient, but there is good reason to believe that the work of consolidation, which has called for extensive reconstruction, is responsible for a large portion of the excessive expenditures. In the tabulation this excess - ive amount has been deducted from the operating expense and the net deficit, as shown, takes that into consideration. The statement dis - closes that the company is operating at a deficit even under existing rates, and there can be no question but that the rates should be con - tinued. In the opinion of the Commission it will be a year before nor - mal operating conditions can be established and the needs of the com - pany require that the rate structure be not disturbed during that ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the rates prescribed for the Farmers Mutual Telephone company in the original order herein be, and the same are hereby extended from November 1, 1920, to Novem - ber 1, 1921, subject to all of the conditions specified in the original order.

APPEARANCES: For Applicant — L. E. Hurtz, general manager; W. L. Lemon, audi- tor. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This application was originally for authority to issue and sell $250, - 000 common stock at not less than par to secure funds with which to conduct an extensive building and improvement campaign during 1920. Hearing on the cause was held in the offices of the Commission on February 17, 1920, and a complete budget plan for 1920 was submitted as evidence of the need of the additional capital. Orally the com - pany was authorized to proceed with the sale of the stock and the use of the proceeds and this order must necessarily be in the nature of a nunc pro tune proceeding. At the time of the application the company had in its treasury unsold common stock authorized in Application No. 1292 in the amount of $15,108.33, and preferred stock authorized in Application No. 755, in the amount of $51,469. Subsequent to these orders, the compan; was authorized in Application No. 3435 to issue and sell $500,000 of additional common stock. The preferred stock is not to be considered at this time because the market affords no sale at the interest rate which it bears. Under date of October 31, 1919, the company reported expenditures properly chargeable against fixed capital of $187,395.41 in excess of all com - mon stock authorizations to that date. Under date of April 30, 1920, the company's report to the Commission shows accounts payable ag - gregating $196,187.64, to liquidate which no authorizations of stock had at that time been made. The company's complete budget for 1920, representing its proposed improvements for that year, may be tabulated briefly as follows: 324,615 135,498 70,472 85,026 203,210 lines Grots Cost Original cost of displaced plant plus cost of removing Salvage value Net charges to depre- ciation reserve Net capital additions .ands &amp; bldgs. $ 197,750 Vdditions to exchange lines 787,768 improvement toll $ $ 537,317 93331 I 443,486 $197,750 297,389 </seg>
            <seg id="p336">336 Additional thereto the company estimates a probable expenditure of $35,000 for improvements unforeseen at the time the budget was made, making a total budget estimation for 1920 as proper charge against fixed property of $527,140. Whether this budget in any degree overlaps the report of October 31, 1919, is not shown of record and is not necessary to consider at this time because the proposed improvements for 1920 are far in ex - cess of the proposed capital stock issued. Nor is it necessary at this time to consider the question yet undetermined as to what shall be proper charges against fixed capital where improvements are made necessitating the displacement of property and charges against the accumulated depreciation reserve account. That matter will be dealt with in a separate case and whatever adjustment of accounts is there required will not interfere with the proper safeguarding of the ex - penditures from the proceeds of this stock issue. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company be and it hereby is authorized to issue and sell at not less than par $250,000 of its common stock, with the proceeds of which to carry out whatever tof the improvement program of 1920 is possible from the funds secured. LIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the company shall make reports receipts and disbursements whenever $100,000, or multiple thereof, been sold and the proceeds expended, the report of expenditures to be in sufficient detail to show the localities in which the funds have been expended, the class of property affected, and the amounts in each locality; the report of receipts at the option of the company not to include the names of the purchasers of the stock.

            <seg id="p338">338 APPEARANCES: For Applicant — John E. Jacobson, treasurer; T. P. Crawford, vice- pres:dent; A. C. Leflang. SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This matter came on for hearing originally on the application of the company for authority to sell $100,000 of preferred stock, of which $60,000 was to be used in retiring bills payable and $40,000 for new construction. In the development of that case it was found that in 1917 the company had, under the name of the Lexington Mill and Elevator Company, doing partly a common carrier business, issued $50,000 of common stock which had not been approved. When the successor in interest, present applicant, acquired the common carrier portion of the property, the previous stock was called in and new stock was issued. tThe Commission was of the opinion that $50,000 of common stock I been illegally issued and in the original finding in this case re - red the applicant to proceed with a showing as to the property back of the $50,000 of common stock as a preliminary to consideration of the validation thereof. Hearing was held in the office of the Commis - sion on February 23, regarding the property and the finances of the company. In the original finding, dated December 13, 1919, the Commission authorized issuance and sale of $50,000 of preferred stock. Subse - quently the company submitted application asking for the cancellation of the order mentioned and in lieu thereof to authorize the issuance and sale of bonds in like amount, the stock not having been issued. The Commission was also asked to authorize an additional sale of $40,000 of bonds for the purpose of making certain improvements. amendments and the validation of the common stock issue arc up for consideration. In as much as the Commission found it proper to issue and sell $60,000 of preferred stock from the proceeds of which to retire bills payable properly incurred it appears perfectly proper that at the com - pany's request this order be cancelled and an issue of six per cent bonds be authorized in lieu thereof. This will be done. If the mar - ket makes it necessary that these bonds be sold at a discount, the Commission will require that the company file statement as to the Ce at which the bonds will be sold and what provisions will be e for amortizing the discount. • In the original order, the company wag denied the right to sell $40,000 of additional preferred stock for the reason that it was not </seg>
            <seg id="p339">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 339 able to present definitely the purposes for which the funds were to be used. This appeared to be a requirement of the law. The com - pany now desires to sell the additional $40,000 to secure funds with which to install certain improvements, chiefly a 1,000 K- W. turbine as a substitute for a less economical cross-compound engine and to use a 500 K.W. turbine now installed as stand-by equipment. This ad - ditional issue will also be approved with the provision that at any time $10,000 or a multiple thereof of the amount has been sold and the funds expended, report be made to the Commission in detail thereof, and in case any portion of the funds is used to buy equipment to displace present fixed property, the statement also shall show how the displaced property has been charged off the property account. The journal entries will suffice to show this. We come now to the consideration of the issue of $50,000 of com - mon stock in March 1917. The history of the company and its finan - ces were set forth in detail in the original order herein showing a total present capitalization of $100,000 and bills payable in the amount of $60,000. The history of the development of the electrical proper - ties which now include a considerable power plant at Lexington, dis - tribution plants at Lexington, Cozad, Overtoil and Elm Creek together with transmission lines connecting the power plant at these various outside towns, is so interwoven in the past twenty years with a pros - perous and growing mill business as to be quite impossible of separa - tion. Separate books were kept for the electric properties and the mill properties, but no very close segregation of the costs of pro - duction were made. It was the practice of the company from time to time to borrow money from stockholders for the construction and de - velopment of electric business. Testimony shows that the method of doing this was, to pay for the new construction) out of any cash on hand, keeping account of the construction costs and at the end of the year money was borrowed from stockholders on one year notes to re - place the cash in order to have the earnings intact. These notes were never paid and constitute the $60,000 bills payable now standing against the properties. The testimony showed that while construction material costs were carefully kept and distinguished from maintenance costs, no such care was taken in the matter of labor costs. Hence it is difficult to follow the investments to their source. The company started in 1900 with $50,000 capital, almost entirely devoted to the mill business. It developed its electric business slowly. It borrowed money in large amounts, both for mill business and elec - tric facility construction. In 1917 it sold the additional common stock and retired bills payable therewith. In the later part of the same year valuable mill properties were separated into another corporation and while there was no reduction in the capitalization which remained with the electric utility, a very considerable amount of other liabili - ties went with the mill properties. </seg>
            <seg id="p340">340 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT tBy keeping the electric accounts in the manner indicated above, company showed as of date August 31, 1917, electric physical prop - es of book cost $123,490. In the fall of the same year when the properties were separated then were added to the assets of the elec - tric company $9,639 cash and book accounts and in the meantime about $5,000 had been added in new construction. This made book assets; of approximately $138,000 less accrued depreciation. During the next year considerable construction was entered upon and a transmission line was built between Lexington and Cozad. As of date September 1, 1919, the electric properties were purchased by the present owners, who paid par for the stock and assumed notes payable amounting to $60,000. At that time the book cost of the properties was $164,000. There was in depreciation reserve $21,000 invested in working capital and other liquid assets which went with the properties. The book accounts of the company, still showing original cost and in no way readjusted to increase unit values, as of date January 1, 1920, carried fixed assets of $170,200 and certain liquid assets representing the investment of approximately $21,000 depreciation resent. The question arises as to whether this depreciation reserve actually represents the depreciation of the physical properties. There is some doubt concerning this. Much of the property is relatively new. The distribution plants in the outlying towns were rebuilt all during the war price period. Certain transmission lines were also constructed. The distribution system in Lexington is not old. The steam turbine installed at a cost of almost $16,000 was put in during early war period. If the depreciation reserve that went with the properties at the time of their sale in September, 1919 represented actual depreciation, the new owners did not pay more than the property was worth. If not, a proper depreciation reserve had been set up this fact is prob - ably offset by reasonable allowance for advancing values of physical properties, even in their depreciated condition. It, therefore, appears that the Commission is warranted in validat - ing the issue of $50,000 of common stock. The method by which this i-tock came into existence is in no wise excused. The company was in haste to readjust its stock issue to avoid paying certain excess profits taxes to the government and endeavored by subterfuges to so bring the matter to pass as to increase the capitalization without subjecting the company to the supervision required by law. There is every reason to believe that the owners at that time were aware that they were not complying with the law. However, the present owners were not the guilty parties. They bought the properties and paid for them in a clear business transaction and are confident that they made a good pur - chase and the Commission's check of the book accounts as presented in testimony does not warrant a challenge to that conclusion. That the properties are reasonably worth the outstanding obliga- </seg>
            <seg id="p341">341 tiont can be checked in another way. A careful physical valuation by competent engineers was made in the fall of 1919 which showed a value of $217,000 original cost based on units reflecting at least in part war time prices. There was omitted from this valuation approximately $10,000 of property when due allowance is made for the fact that a very considerable amount of property was buijt at war time prices and adjustments are made to meet original cost, it appears that the book cost of $164,000 is not out of line. In validating the common stock issue and in authorizing the issu - ance and sale of bonds, the Commission will require that the company, before paying dividends, set up 7 per cent of the book cost of depre - ciable physical properties annually for maintenance and depreciation reserve, which amount shall in no wise be used for other purposes than the set up. This causes no financial embarrassment as the earnings of the company in 1919 at present rates for electric current indicate that said dividends on the stock can be paid after all operating ex - penses and fixed charges have been met and the depreciation reserve properly cared for. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the United Electric Company of Lexington, Neb - raska, be and it hereby is authorized to issue and sell as the market warrants $100,000 of six per cent bonds, interest payable semi-annually, from the proceeds of the sale of which to retire $60,000 of outstanding unsecured obligations, the remainder to be used for additions and bet - terments. If the market requires that any of these bonds be sold at a discount, the company will notify the Commission prior to the sale of the bonds as to the price at which the securities can be sold, and the provisions which will be made for amortizing the discount. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that where any of the proceeds of the sale of these securities is used in betterments requiring the retire - ment of any of the present fixed property, the company shall file with the Commission the journal entries showing the method of charging off from property account the displaced items. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that before any dividends shall be declared, the company shall have set up on a monthly basis no less than seven per cent of the book cost of the depreciable properties as a maintenance and depreciation reserve account, out of which shall be paid all proper charges for maintenance and replacements, the remain - der to be held in depreciation reserve account and used temporarily as good business practice warrants. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the issue of $50,000 of common stock in 1917 be and it hereby is validated. </seg>

All efforts to establish an electric lighting system at Pilger through the voting of municipal bonds having failed, these citizens are undertaking, regardless of whether a profit will accrue from the business, to furnish this facility- to the in - habitants of the city. They ask authority under the law to issue and sell $20,000 of stock, par value $100 per share, for the purpose of se - curing funds with which to finance the enterprise. Assurances are ample, according to applicants, that the money can be locally secured with the full understanding as to possibilities that the venture may not pay any considerable rate of return. LIii support of the petition, applicants filed a complete estimate of terials to be used and costs thereof, amounting to $16,987. These estimates have been checked by the engineering department of the Commission and are found to be reasonable present day prices. They are merely the "bare bone" construction costs. In the main, organiza - tion expenses have been furnished gratis. Applicant proposes also to engage in general electric mercantile business. It will open a store at which electric supplies and appli - ances will be offered for sale. This store will be in charge of the electrician who will also be the company's lineman and general mana - ger.

Bellamy, secretary; George Williams, chair' man board of directors; R. H. Rankin. treasurer. For Respondents — none. </seg>
            <seg id="p344">344 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This matter came on for hearing at Cambridge on November 6, 1919, on application for the validation of rates illegally put into effect in October, 1918, under the mistaken notion on the part of the officials that inasmuch as the new telephone company had just been organi - sed to take over the properties of the previous association no applica - tion was necessary in order to inaugurate a new schedule of rates. The previous telephone company, known as the Cambridge Tele - phone association, practically a mutual organization, had operated for several years on rates of $1.00 per month for all classes of service with a considerable amount of free interchange. Its system was grounded and of rather poor quality. Ultimately it was discovered by the officers of the association that their property was in a badly depreciated condition and that there were no funds with which to re - construct. A corporation was formed and stock was subscribed in the amount of $7,000, in payment of which all previous stockholders turned in their holdings in the old association and took stock in the new con - cern. The stockholders are practically identical with those of the old association and almost all of the subscribers are stockholders. The matter of the issue of this stock was fully handled in finding oa Application No. 4190, order dated February 10, 1920, and will not again be referred to here. The rates illegally put into effect the latter part of 1918 were $2.00 per month business service; $1.50 per month residence service; and 59c per month for switching service. No protest was filed against this increase and the Commission was unaware it had occurred until the company's records were checked by the Commission's accountants. The application and the hearing resulted. It appeared from the tes - timony there was no intentional wrong doing on the part of the officers of the company. They regretted exceedingly that they had not pur - sued the legal course. Testimony given by the officers indicated that the scale of rates was not more than was necessary for the proper op - eration of the plant. This plant has been entirely rebuilt and made metallic with a considerable amount of cable. A new switchboard was installed. For these improvements an indebtedness of about $4,000 was incurred, the money having been borrowed at local banks. At the time of the validation of tne first issue of $7,000 of stoc* the com - pany wa; authorized *j sell an additional $5,000. Of this amount, $3,000 has l«en sold anj there arj still bills payable in the neighbor - hood of $1 000. The company was verbally instructed to continue its schedule of rates of $2.00 per month business and $1.50 per month for residence service, pending decision on the case. Careful examinction of the </seg>
            <seg id="p345">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 345 record indicates that a vunc pro tune order should be issue-l validating the schedule of rates illegally put into effect. Under that schedule of rates the revenue ilerived is approximately $500 per month. Revenue for exchange service ::mounts to $475 per month, including a very con - siderable revenue from the switching of more than 340 farm line sub - scribers independently owned. The records are not entirely accurate or plain as to the earnings from toll business, but it appears that these earnings ;:re in the neighborhood of $300 per year. Statement of receipts and expenditures for one month is about as follows: Maintenance and depreciation _$180.00 The maintenance and depreciation allowance here mace is rather high, due to the fact that the company hires a lineman at {125 per month whereas the plant is not large enough to keep him constantly employed after the reconstruction work has been completed. It would be highly advisable if the company could make arrangements for this lineman to do at least a portion of the maintenance work en the inde - pendent farm lines, thereby adding to the gross revenue and giving the lineman enough work to keep him busy. If this could bo accom - plished it would Le possible to increase his wages somewhat and still the company would be considerably ahead by the arrangement. Whether this can be done is a matter that must be left with the officials of the company who are vitally interested in the success of the system. The amount paid the secretary is above the average paid for the *-ork done, but the company'^ experience with secretaries at a lower salary has rot been happy, and it is to be presumed that this is as cheaply as they can lure the work efficiently done. Supplemental application was filed by the company on May 13, 1920, asking for an increase in business rates to $3.00 per month in order to take care of the deficiency.

            <seg id="p346">346 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT May added 42 subscribers. Cambridge is one of the most flourishing towns in the western portion of the Republican Valley and still has considerable room to grow. It is to be assumed that the growth will continue for some time yet to come under the impetus of very excellent service now being furnished on a plant that is thoroughly modern. The Commission will assume that this growth will aid to make up the deficit even though the company is unable to make ar - rangement to earn some revenue by maintaining a portion of the farm line companies. This order will provide for a business rate of $2.50 per month; residence rate, $1.50 per month; switching rates as now, 50c per station per month. It is the Commission's intention to supply sufficient revenues that the company can pay an annual dividend on the $10,000 of stock outstanding. If, after further experience, the Ppany is unable to do so by following the suggestions herein made, Commission will again consider the case. will be provided in this order that the company shall set aside ithly $180, out of which to pay that portion of the lineman's salary resenting the time spent by him for all work except in new con - lction and betterments; also to pay livery cost, cost of batteries, maintenance material cost, and all material and labor for replacement of existing properties. Any surplus then remaining shall be carried as a credit to depreciation reserve account and until such depreciation reserve account shows a proper amount in ready assets for contin - gencies and unforeseen disasters, no portion shall be borrowed by the company to pay for new extensions and betterments. Extensions and betterments, which add value to the property, must be financed by the addition of new capital. This will not be difficult if the company - follows a consistent policy of paying dividends on the stock annually or semi-annually. The accounting system installed by the Commission will enable the company to keep accurate record of the cost of betterments, which add to the value of the plant, in order that these may be financed by additional sales of securities. bThe company now offers its subscribers a considerable amount of service to adjacent towns . At the time of the hearing the offi - of the company, who were all business men of Cambridge, were unwilling that the free service should be curtailed. If additional rev - enues over and above those herein provided are found necessary, the attention of the company is called to the question of curtailing the free service rather than to increase the rates further. The question may be brought up by the company at any future time it sees fit. The rates which will be authorized in this order are very consid - erably in advance of the rates which the company's predecessor oper - ated on for many years, but the costs of operation are entirely out of line with previous experience and the officers of the company are now </seg>

            <seg id="p348">348 OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Chairman Applicant operates a telephone exchange at Leigh which serves that town and surrounding territory. It has 331 subscribers of its own and switches 186 farmers who own and maintain their own lines. The company was organized in 1904 with a paid up capital of |7,6OO. All of the stock was paid for in cash and the amount has never been in - creased. No dividends were paid thereon until the year 1913, since which time dividends in the amount of $6,156 have been paid, mak - ing an average of slightly over five per cent since the organization of E company. If an allowance for dividends were made on the basis eight per cent, the stockholders would have deferred dividends in - ted in the property to the amount of approximately $2900. The company has been very conservatively managed from the beginning, the officers serving for portions of the time without salaries and even at the present time for nominal compensation. There is no doubt of the fact that the stockholders have an investment in the property of not less than $10,500. LThe original cost of the property is not definitely known either by company or the Commission, no valuation having been made for the purposes of this case. For the same reason neither the present value of the physical property, nor its condition have been ascertained. Officers of the company, who are familiar with the plant, estimate its value at between $15,000 and $20,000. On a basis of $50 per station, which is a fair average for properties where both metallic and ground - ed service is furnished, as in this case, the value would be approxi - mately $17,000. No finding is made with respect to this, however, at this time. The company was without a regular lineman during most of the war period, and as a result the maintenance of the property was some - what neglected. It is proposed, however, to maintain a lineman per - manently from now on and to reconstruct the property as need may arise. At the time of the application, the present lineman was being paid $90 per month, but it was anticipated his salary would have to be increased. It is possible that the company may be able to secure a competent lineman for $100 per month, although it is not improbable that a larger salary will have to be paid. In a property of this size and condition an allowance of $200 per month to cover labor, material, auto expense or livery hire, and all repairs and replacements to the property it not unreasonable. The company employs two operators at the present time, but, because of the traffic, believes a third opera - tor should be secured. With this conclusion the Commission agrees. One operator at the present time is being paid $60 per month and the other $55 per month. It is probable that the third operator can be secured for $40 to $45 per month. </seg>
            <seg id="p349">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 349 The company's total operating- expense, based on the experience of 1919, was $5] 34.27. The revenue for that period was $0064.81. With respect to this amount, we have made an estimate as to the mis - cellaneous revenues, since the amount shown for 1919 appears to be abnormally high when compared with the average for the previous three years. It is evident that the company in 1919 sold a considerable am - ount of material, the proceeds of which were counted as revenue. We have made an allowance of $100 for this purpose, which is consider - ably in excess of the average for the three years previous. On this basis the company had an operating income of $930.54 after deducting the operating expenses from the revenue. If from this item we deduct $500 for taxes and $840 for dividends, computed at eight per cent per annum on $10,500, we have a deficit of $209.46. If to this were added $480 as the expense for an additional operator, and $36 for an increase in rent which the company anticipates, we have a total deficit of $725.46 that may be anticipated for the year 1920. The company asks for a uniform increase of twenty-five cents per month on all classes of service, and ten cents per month to its switch- ing subscribers. This would make rates as follows Such an increase would produce added revenue to the amount of approximately $1200, basing the estimate on the number of subscribers now receiving service. This would leave a surplus to cover emergency conditions not now anticipated and as a safety reserve of less than $500 for the year. In the opinion of the Commission such revenue is nec - essary for the purposes of the company and the rates as asked for are reasonable and should be approved. It has been the policy of the company, and it appears to be its intention from statements made by officers, to construct additions and betterments to the plant out of surplus earnings. The Commission does not look with favor on such a plan. Rather the company should adopt a policy of financing its additions and betterments from the pro - ceeds of the sale of additional stock or other securities. In this con - nection it should be stated that of the allowance of $2400 made for maintenance and depreciation no part should be expended for new prop - erty. Any surplus remaining after the repairs and replacements are provided for annually should be held in a reserve fund to take care of deferred deterioration in the property. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Leigh Telephone company be and the same hereby is authorized to charge and collect the follow - ing scale of rates effective June 1, 1920, for exchange service. lusiness service $2.25 per montl Residence service 1.25 per montl service 1.50 per montl Iwitching service .50 per montl </seg>
            <seg id="p350">350 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant shall set aside for the purpose of maintenance and depreciation the sum of $200 per month, out of which shall be paid the salary of the lineman and the cost of such other labor as is employed in the repair and replacements of the property and the cost of such material as may be used in main - tenance. No part of this sum shall be expended for additions and betterments to the property. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that any surplus remaining after all operating expenses have been paid, including the allowance for main - tenance and depreciation, as herein fixed, and dividends at the rate of eight per cent on $10,500, shall be held in trust, pending further order of this Commission. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the rates herein authorized shall be approved for a period of six months, thirty days prior to the expira - tion of which time applicant shall make further showing as to its rev - enues and expenses.

Williams, secretary; O. S. Housei, manager. For Neligh Commercial Club — Lyle E. Jackson, attorney; D. M. Murphy, attorney. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: Applicant operates a telephone exchange, with headquarters at Ne - ligh, serving approximately 472 subscribers and switching 179 farmers who own their own lines. Most of its own subscribers are located within the town of Neligh, it having but 41 farm patrons. The company has connections with a number of other exchanges, more particularly with lusiness service $2-25 per month lesidence service 1.25 per month ''arm service 1.60 per month Iwitching service .50 per month </seg>
            <seg id="p351">351 all the exchanges of the Northern Antelope Telephone company. With ita own subscribers and through the connections referred to, it gives a service to approximately 1900 telephones. The company was organized in 1901 and has been a close corpor - ation from the beginning. At the present time the stock is owned by four people, all members of the same family. There is outstanding at the present time $10,000 of capital stock and the record shows that this stock was paid for at par, either in cash or services. During the life of the company dividends have been paid averaging ten per cent. The plant is about half metallic, the remainder being a grounded ■-&gt; s - tem with common return wires. All subscribers are served by individ - ual lines. The cost of the property, as shown by the books, is $19, - 738.21. While the books of the company have been well kept, it is the opinion of Secretary Williams that, because of the difficulty of dif - ferentiating between expenditures for maintenance and new construc - tion, during the past years considerable new property has been added to the plant out of the maintenance account. This supposition is borne out by the valuation made by the Commission's engineers, which shows the original cost of the property to be $26,448.13. The present or depreciated value, as found by the engineers, is $16,816.07. Thi. - indicates the property is in about sixty-four per cent condition, which is somewhat less than is necessary for good operation. Applicant now asks for an increase of its exchange rate. , making the usual allegation of increased costs of labor and material. It asked for rate? that would produce added revenue in the amount of appio.ii - mately f.2800. At the hearing ihe operating expenses for the tir.-t eleven months of the year 1019 were submitted is support of the appli - cation. Since the hearing the annus! report of the company has been filed with the Commission for the entire calendar year. This report shows the total revenue for 1919 to have been $8,065.80, of which *7, - 287.20 was derived from city and farm subscribers service, $540 from switching service, $221.10 from toll service, and $17.50 from miscellan - eous sources. The company expended in 1919 $2,387.56 for current maintenance. This is less than the Commission is requiring to be set aside for this purpose in companies of a similar size and character. We have found ten per cent of the original cost of the property to be neces - sary for maintenance and depreciation and will require that amount to be set up by applicant. This would make the sum of $2,644.80 for this purpose. Applicant paid operators $2,703.87. Its commercial and general expenses amounted to $2,005.14, making a total operating ex - pense (using our figures for maintenance and depreciation) of $7,353.81. Deducting this from the gross revenue of $8,065.80, leaves an operating income of $711.99. From this should be deducted taxes in the amount of $493.65, interest of $100.98, and dividends of $800, making a total of $1,394.63. On this basis the company had a deficit for the year 1919 of $082.64. </seg>
            <seg id="p352">352 t Since the hearing on the application the company had a strike of operators and was required to increase their salaries $5.00 per month h, making a total increase of $30.00 per month. It anticipates a further increase of salaries in the near future. At the time of the hearing it was paying four operators $40 per month, one $35 and one S32.50. The night man received $15 per month. These salaries are somewhat less than are being paid by other companies under similar circumstances and it is not improbable that $50 per month may have to be paid to the better operators employed. If the increase to operators is estimated on a basis of $60 per moBth there would be $720 to be added to the deficit, making a total of $1,402.64. As stated, the company asks rates which would produce a total increase of approximately $2,800 per year. Such an increase appears to be unnecessary at this time. The company asks authority to increase its business rates from $2.00 per month to a net rate of $2."0, and its residence rates from $1.00 to $1.50. It also asks authority to increase business extension sets from Afty cents to seventy-five cents. A charge of fifteen cents per month ex - tra on desk sets is also asked for. If the residence rate is changed to $1.25 instead of $1.50, the increase in revenue, based upon the num - ber of subscribers now in service, would be $1,760.40- On this show - ing, the company would have a surplus of approximately $350 per year. At the time of the hearing, considerable complaint was offered as to the service furnished by the company, most of which was charged to the condition of the switchboard. It was admitted by applicant that the switchboard was in poor condition and needed to be replaced. As a matter of fact an order had already been placed and it was anticipated that this board would be installed by the middle of March. It was thought by all concerned that the installation of a new board would cor - rect all the difficulties complained of and that the service would be brought up to a proper standard as a consequence. The new board will cost approximately $3200. Under the conditions, as we have outlined them above, we are of the opinion that the company is entitled to additional revenue and that the rates as applied for, with the exception of the residence rate as discussed, should be approved. Applicant asks permission to charge a gross rate of twenty- five cents in excess of the rates as applied for, the added twenty-five cents to be deducted for the prompt payment of bills. This practice is in effect in many companies in the state and has proved uniformly satis - factory and will be approved in this case. In its schedule, as applied for, applicant also asked for certain installation charges. In view of the fact that the Commission has the whole question of installation and removal charges under investigation at the present time, it will make no finding with respect to the rates asked for by applicant. At the time of the finding in the general order, the rates as therein approved will be authorized for applicant company. </seg>

            <seg id="p354">354 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT business service and $12.00 per annum for residence and farm service. Applicant alleges total inability to meet its obligations on these rates. The financial condition of the company has been developed in so far as possible by correspondence. This correspondence shows the chief items of expenditures as follows: If modest allowance is made for maintenance expenses which will in - clude the cost of batteries furnished, materials for current repairs, and freight and drayage, it is evident that applicant does not at this time find the revenues sufficient, even if no dividends are paid on the in - vestment. The exchange was purchased in 1916 for $2,200. It was at that time serving approximately 100 subscribers, although the distribution system was so constructed as to enable the company to serve twice as many subscribers with very little additional expense. The owner of the company, a telephone man, inventoried the property before purchas - ing it and was satisfied it was worth more than what he paid for it. The Commission has no means at this time of checking that conclusion. Since the purchase date there has been added to the plant in accrued replacements and extensions $1250. The company made a good pur - chase of the property in 1916 and if its previous history warrants it no doubt it is entitled to dividends on more than the actual investment in 1916 and since. The Commission is without sufficient information to rh a conclusion, and for the purpose of this temporary rate will fig - dividends on the actual investment of applicant. The owner of this exchange is manager of the Farmers Union Tele - phone company at Winnetoon. He hires all the work done on the ex - change under consideration. His wife acts as one of the operators and cne operator is hired. The amount paid for operation is not at all excessive, and the amount paid to the lineman and manager not more than is necessary to retain such a workman. The maintenance expense on an exchange of this size is bound to be high because of the necessity of retaining a lineman, paying him such wages as will enable him to live and spreading that wages expense over so small a number of sub - scribers. This lineman could no doubt take care of fifty per cent more telephones without being too busy and for an exchange that much larger the expense of operating per station would be very much reduced. We will consider the situation as it exists, however. Analyzing applicant's situation and using the experience of many other companies similarly situated, it is apparent that it will require a gross revenue of not less than $2500 per annum to meet the company'.' operating ex - penses and to pay an eight per cent dividend on its actual investment. .ineman and manager $1,140.00 per annum Operators 610.00 per annum lent and fuel . 128.00 per annum 'ostage, stationery, blanks, books, etc 72.80 per annum 'axes 43.44 per annum </seg>
            <seg id="p355">355 The net rates should be increased suffciently to meet that requirement. Because of the rather meager financial showing of applicant, the Com - mission will grant merely a temporary rate and will require the com - pany to file a complete statement each three months showing earnings divided into their various sources and all expenditures in considerable detail.

FINAL ORDER BROWNE, Commissioner: Under date of January 2, 1920, the Commission authorized this ap - plicant to make certain increases in rates to meet the constantly in - creasing cost of operation. The order was temporary in nature and terminates July 31, 1920, unless sooner extended. The Commission now has the advantage of monthly reports from the company more or less accurately made, in conformity to the uniform rules of accounting, which showed that the company is now making under the new rates very little over and above the operating expenses and legitimate deductions from net income. For the months of Feb - ruary to June, inclusive, net returns available for dividends and for depreciation reserve, which during the months has not been adequate, amounted to $120.72. This is approximately enough to pay 8 per cent dividends, but probably does not adequately take care of accruing de - preciation. It appears advisable that the present rates shall continue for some time longer, with leave to the company to file application for increases in rates if showing continues adverse.

Collins Respondents not represented. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: Applicant company operates an exchange at St. Edward, Nebraska, serving 475 subscribers, of which a majority are on rural lines. It has more than 160 stockholders. The company was organized in 1903, at first serving only rural subscribers and gradually invading town territory until at this time it operates in competition with another telephone com - pany in the general territory of St. Edward and vicinity. Its rates since 1909 or 1910 have been $1.00 per month for all classes of service. Its exchange is almost entirely of grounded construction, although it is the immediate intention of the company to make a large part of its town exchange metallic, as well as putting in a considerable amount of cable. It asks authority to establish the following schedule of rates: Per Month Hearing on this case was held in the offices of the Commission on December 23, at which time the Commission had the benefit of the month - ly statements under the uniform accounting system of the Commission for a period of ten months, February to November inclusive. It also had an inventory and valuation of property taken by the Commission's engineering department in February, 1919, which showed an original cost of $23,110, and a present worth, based on original cost, of $15,186. Since the inventory the company has completed certain improvements which has added somewhat to the value of its properties. It had out - standing at the time of the hearing $10,650 of stock and had been author - ized to issue and sell $4,000 additional to complete certain improvements. Its indebtedness at the end of the year in bills secured and unsecured amounted to approximately $7,500. It had, therefore, outstanding capital liabilities somewhat in excess of the depreciated original cost of the properties. lingle party business, metallic $2.00 iingle party residence, metallic 1.75 Vo-party business, metallic 1.75 lingle party business, grounded 1.50 iingle party residence, grounded 1.26 'wo to three party residence 100 'arm line, grounded 1.35 'arm line, metallic 1.75 </seg>
            <seg id="p358">358 The company began operation on a very inadequate scale, at first, serving only stockholders and charging thirty cents per month. There was very little maintenance labor expense as each stockholder took care of the property in his immediate vicinity and each stockholder paid for all maintenance of his telephone instrument and drop line. Later the rate for stockholders was raised to fifty cents per month and a few renters were taken on at one dollar per month. The stockholders fur - nished their own batteries during these years. In 1909 or 1910, at the direction of the Commission, the company ceased its rebating to stock - holders, although it did not immediately cease the plan whereby stock - holders bought their own batteries. Since 1909 or 1910, the charge has been one dollar per month to every one and during this period, ex - clusive of the rebate period, only two dividends at six per cent have ever been paid. There is apparently no surplus in the properties- A certain'amount of depreciation reserve funds were invested in additional properties in order that the company could develop a property originally costing $23,000. Since no reserve has been created it is evident no dividends were earned on the rates which the company has charged. Stockholders have not complained, but the company has now grown to a size where considerably more than half of its subscribers are renters and the di - rectors feel that in equity these stockholders should be entitled to a seven per cent dividend on their stock. In 1919, as shown by the annual report filed subsequent to the hear - ing, the company's total revenues amounted to approximately $5,640. Its total operating expenses were $4,600. Other expenses, such as in - terest accrued, taxes, and miscellaneous expenditures reduced the net operating income to $362.69 for the year without dividends. This record for 1919 is subject to certain changes for 1920, as ad - duced from the testimony. Allowance for maintenance and depreciation is about $250 below necessary requirements to provide a sufficient reserve. In the early part of the year operators were hired for $57 per month plus a small amount paid for extra help. In May the payments for operators were advanced $20 per month and in October again $20 per month. The total amount paid for operators in 1919 was $1,104. It is the company's purpose, in place of hiring an extra operator occasionally, to hire an additional operator in order to use two positions in peak load periods in the forenoon and to extend somewhat the hours of operation. It is estimated that the cost of operators for 1920 will not be less than $1,525. The company has a considerable item of interest, which will in part disappear when the remaining authorized stock has been sold and the funds used to decrease floating indebtedness. There will remain, how - ever, approximately $3,000 in outstanding obligations, on which interest will have to be paid. </seg>
            <seg id="p359">359 From the testimony and from the monthly reports filed with the Commission, the following estimated tabulation of 1920 expenditures is made up: The rates asked for by the company will produce a maximum of #8,000, including the small amount of tolls earned. It will thus be seen that the company does not require the amount of revenue asked for. It appears to be the purpose of the company to take care of certain deferred maintenance by increased rates, such as the entire cost of installing a new switchboard of three positions and certain other im - provements, including making metallic the farm lines. Inasmuch as depreciation reserve in the past has been used to extend properties rather than financing through sales of stock, the company has the option at this time of disposing of additional stock, after making proper ap - plication to the Commission, for a reasonable amount of replacement work and for betterments which may be found necessary- It is the Commission's purpose to authorize rates which will earn dividends on the stock and in the interest of efficient financial management it should be the company's purpose hereafter to pay dividends annually or semi - annually with regularity. No stockholder should be required to invest funds and secure no returns. This has been done in the past, the return being an indirect one in the low charge for service. However, under that plan the "non - stockholder benefitted equally with the stockholder although having no investment. This is inequitable. The company indicates that it has not yet made its town properties metallic and it has asked for certain rates for service which it cannot now offer. It has approximately seventy business subscribers and ex - pects that fifty of these will elect to be served with metallic lines. While the Commission will authorize metallic business rates, it will re - quire that the company's building operations reach such a point that one-half of the business service in town be on metallic lines before the metallic rates are applied to those subscribers. Rates for service for which there is no immediate prospect will not at this time be authorized. The company may make supplemental application when occasion arises. In authorizing the increase, the company will follow the plan of Maintenance and depreciation, including labor and ma- terials for normal replacements, maintenance labor and materials, batteries, livery, etc $2,500.00 Operators 1,525.00 General commercial expense 1,000.00 Officers' salaries 475.00 Taxes 315.00 Dividends and interest 1,265.00 Margin of safety, or surplus 400.00 Total $7,480.00 </seg>

OPINION AND FINDING HALL, Commissioner The matter herein came on for hearing at Jansen, Nebraska, on Jan - uary 13, 1920. The company was represented by Mr. John P. Thiessen, president, and the other members of the board of directors. No one appeared as remonstrators or respondents. There has been no inventory, valuation or depreciation studies made of the properties. It developed, however, at the hearing that the tele - phone facilities in the vicinity of Jansen had been owned by two com - panies, one of which operated an exchange in the town of Jansen and switched the farm lines for the other company. Later they combined the : r properties and issued stock on the basis of the money that had been paid in by all the stockholders, which amounted to $13,600. The company has 19 business and approximately 243 town residence and farm phones. The plant is constructed of metallic circuit with the exception of 28 farm phones which are grounded. The company owns a lot and residence in the town of Jans?n in which is located the central office. A general survey of the properties would indicate that they are well worth the $13,600 of outstanding stock. The company made a complete showing as to its operating expense.s for 1919, which shows an expenditure of approximately $1,347 for direct operation. The company asks to increase the pay for operators $10-00 a month and that for bookkeeper $10*00 per month, which will make an annual increase of $240. This will bring the direct operating expenses up to approximately $1,587. The Commission is of the opinion that the company should set up $2,000 per year for maintenance and depreciation, one-twelfth of which should be set up each month during thet current calendar year. The Commission is further of the opinion that an allowance for dividends should be made at seven per cent upon the $13,600, which will amount to an annual dividend of $952. This will make the total dis - bursements $4,539. At the present rates the operating income is approximately as fol - lows: </seg>
            <seg id="p362">362 Phone rentals $3,930.00 Net toll 160.00 Making a total revenue of_ 14,090.00 This leaves a deficit per year of $449.00. The company is charging $1.26 for all classes of phone service. The Commission is of the opinion that the business rate should be much higher than the residence and farm rates in accordance with like charges made by practically all companies in the state; also that the metallic circuit service should be h-gher than that of the grounded circuit service- The 19 business phones at $1.75 per month will bring an annual revenue of $ 399.00 216 farm and residence phones at $1.40 3,628.80 27 farm grounded phones at $1.26 405.00 This will take care of the deficit and leave a little surplus balance. Referring to the maintenance and depreciation charges to be set up upon the books, this item is high because of the fact that the company is so small that the maintenance charges run much higher than on larger properties. This may be illustrated by the fact that the lineman will receive approximately $1,200 per year and his time will be spread over the maintenance of properties operating only 262 phones. From an operating standpoint, it can be readily seen that the switchboard, operat - ing-room, fuel, light and taxes could take care of many more phones than they are now doing. This increases the cost per station above a system operating considerably more phones. The Commission is of the opinion that the above schedule of rates should be collected, subject to conditions in the order herein. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Farmers Co-operative Telephone company of Jansen, Nebraska, be authorised, and the same is hereby directed, to charge and collect the following schedule of rates: Gross Net Business phone rentals $2.00 $1.75 Residence and farm phone rentals, metallic 1.66 1.40 Residence and farm phone rentals, grounded 1.50 1.25 Business and town residence phone rentals shall be due and payable one month in advance on the first day of each current month.

The notices to business and town residence subscribers shall also contain sustantially the following: "That if your bill is paid by the tenth of the (state current month), a discount of twenty-five cents per month per phone will be made." Likewise the notices to rural subscribers shall state that if the bill is paid quarterly in advance by the end of the first month of the quarter (state quarter in months), a discount on the gross bill for the quarter of twenty-five cents per month per phone will be made. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the above schedule of rates shall become effective on March 1, 1920. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the rate of dividends to be paid in the future shall not exceed seven per cent per annum on $13,600 unless specifically authorized by the Commission. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all extensions and betterments to the properties in the future shall be provided for out of the sales of securities and that the company shall, when all of the above conditions are complied with, pay dividends at the end of each fiscal year at the rate of seven per cent on $13,600, amounting to $952. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the company shall set up as a maintenance and depreciation reserve fund monthly one-twelfth of $2,000, out of which shall be paid the lineman for that portion of his time de - voted to maintenance and replacement work, the cost of batteries and all maintenance materials, livery hire and freight expense. That portion of his time devoted to new construction should be definitely allocated and charged to capital account. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that should a surplus accrue after the above enumerated items are provided for, said surplus shall stand in a surplus account for the use and benefit of the properties in the future, subject, however, to the order of the Commission.

CURTISS, Secretary, (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4166 In the Mutter of the Application of the Ulysses Independent Telephone Com - pany for Authority to Increase Rates- </seg>
            <seg id="p364">364 Appearances For complainant— A. B. Andrew, secretary. P. W. Ward, Director. For respondents — None. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: Hearing on this case was had at Lincoln, in the offices of the Com - mission on February 12, 1920, on the application of the company for authority to increase rates for telephone service from $1.00 per month for all classes of service to f 1.50 per month for business service and |1.25 per month net for residence and farm line service. This company has been operating for eighteen years as an inde - pendent organisation, first at rates of $1.00 per month for stockholders and $1.50 per month for non-stockholders and after 1909 reduced the rates fur all classes of service to $1.00 per month- The development of the plant was without the usual complicating factor of donated labor. Stock was sold at par and all the construction work was hired. At the present time there is outstanding $13,075 of stock. There is also an indebted - ness of $2,000 in notes payable, amply secured by treasury stock pur - chased by the company at slightly above par and now held as an invest - ment of depreciation reserve and as security for the indebtedness which was incurred in making the purchase. The early history of the company in financial matters is involved in considerable obscurity. The officers in the early day did not realize the importance of keeping accounts and the information at hand is entirely fragmentary. In so far as the record is available, it appears that there has been an average of approximately 10 per cent paid in dividends. While no physical valuation of the property has been made, it is quite evident that there has been no surplus accumulated. There is also very little liquid depreciation reserve as the investment in treasury stock is largely offset by notes payable. The annual reports of the company for ten years would point to a depreciated property. The company is facing a rebuilding program and in fact has already embarked somewhat there - on and desires the increased rates to secure the funds. Inasmuch a.s ♦he property originally cost, conservatively speaking, $20,000, it is evi - dent that the money for such construction over and above tho»outstanding stock came out of depreciation reserve. The company should consider seriously the advisability of issuing a reasonable amount of additional stock to secure funds for rebuilding purposes. Each dollar thus ex- Cided will add to the present value of the plant and will in no sense resent a bad business venture dividends paid have been above those which the Commission iiders reasonable, but the testimony of the company's officers was . in spite of the 10 per cent dividends, the stock has only on one oc - on sold above par and many times below par. </seg>
            <seg id="p365">365 The property of applicant is entirely grounded and as such repre - sents the poorer type of service. The per station investment is low. It would be hard to find a company whose history shows more economical management, or which is operating at a lower per station expense than this company is today. Economy of operation was the icason the company was able to pay dividends as high as were paid and at the same time operate on low rates. At the same time the company was tempted to pay dividends with cash on hand rather tha'n to look into the future and see necessities that were bound to arise. This is not an unusual situation with companies of this class. At the present time and under present rates, the company's gross revenue is slightly under $5,500 per annum of which more than $800 is derived from toll business. Under the proposed rates the company will earn $1,280 more money. The Commission has the benefit of seven months' experience of the company under the uniform accounting system, which is being installed throughout the state. It is very evident from scrutiny of those accounts and from the testimony of applicants as to their labor costs that the monthly set up of $138.68 for maintenance and depreciation reserve is inadequate. The company will be authorized to make a monthly set up fct the rate of $2,500 per r.nnum, which fund will be used in accordance with the Commission's accounting rules, to pay the cost of maintenance including lineman's salary and to create a depreciation reserve, against future contingencies- Other known and estimated expenses are as follows: Operators $1,260 per annum Rents 276 Taxes 200 Officers salarss, manager, etc 500 Office supplies, postage, light and heat, insur - ance, and other miscellaneous 200 Traveling expenses and legal expense 26 This makes a total expense of slightly under $5,000, exclusive of dividends and of a margin of safety to take care of unforeseen exigencies and to pay dividends on any additional stock that may be sold. No allowance is made in this connection for interest on the indebtedness as that will be more than offset by dividends on the treasury stock. These estimates check readily against the monthly reports of the company when due adjustment is made for the maintenance and depre - ciation reserve account and proper weight given to the lack of showing of certain commercial expense items which would reflect in an annual showing, but which do not show in the several monthly statements. It would appear, therefore, that the company needs eight hundred to nine hundred dollars more revenue. If the business rate is placed at $1.50 per month and residence and farm line rate at $1.20 per month </seg>
            <seg id="p366">366 tthe increase in revenue would be approximately $1,050. These rates be authorized. This company has put in a new switchboard of two positions. It operates this considerable exchange with two operators. Evidently not more than one works at a time. The toll earnings indicate a very con - siderable toll business. The Commission doubts very much whether proper promptness and efficiency can be maintained with the present operating force, no matter how skilled the operators may be. No com - plaint has been made as to the service and the conclusions are based on general knowledge of telephone business. The attention of the com - pany is invited to the advisability of hiring a part time additional opera - tor so that during the peak period twice a day, two operators may work at the same t me If, after due consideration, the company feels that this suggestion is well taken, the Commission will stand ready to adjust rates to provide the revenues for the additional operator. It may be that the conclusions are erroneous. In the absence of complaints no service tests have been made and the recommendations are made for what they are worth. The testimony indicates sufficient emergency to warrant making the rates effective forthwith. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Ulysses Independent Telephone Company be and it hereby is authorized, effective June 1, 1920, to publish and collect the following schedule of rates: Business service $1.50 per month Residence and farm line service 1.20 per month IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the company shall limit its divi - dend payments to not more than 8 per cent on the present outstanding i-tnck and on any future issues properly authorized. After all proper operating expenses have been paid, and not less than $2,600 per annum allocated for maintenance and depreciation reserve, and dividends not to exceed 8 per cent have been paid, surpluses then resulting shall be car - ried as an accumulation to meet future exigencies.

            <seg id="p367">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 367 APPLICATION NO. 4167 In the Matter of the Application of the Hamilton County Farmers Telephone Association for Authority to Increase Rates. Appearances : For applicant — E. D. Snider, president T. M. Scott, vice president J. L. Evans, general manager G. E. Funk, secretary For protestants — None. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This applicant operates exchanges at Aurora, Doniphan, Giltner, Hampton, Hordville, Marquette, Phillips, Stockham and Trumbull, serv - ing approximately 2,700 subscribers- It desires authority of the Com - mission to increase all classes of rates twenty-five cents per month for the purpose of securing additional revenue to meet the constantly ex - panding expenses. It is at the present time operating on rates which were in use before the war. Hearing on this case was held at Aurora en February 5, 1920, at which a careful discussion of its finances and its accounting methods was had and the existing problems: thoroughly in - vestigated. Applicant is one of two relatively large telephone companies in the state to operate on a non-dividend basis. It began as a farmers' mutual telephone company, serving only stockholders. Shares of stock were s-old at $15.00 each with two shares requisite for service. All stock - holders at the present time own their own instruments, drop wire and inside wire, and maintain this portion of the equipment, including pur - chase of all necessary batteries. In lieu of dividends stockholders are granted a rate twenty-five cents per month lower than non-stockholder subscribers, with the exception that business stockholders in towns out - side of Aurora, which is a common battery plant, are given a spread of fifty cents per month. There is at present outstanding $45,225 of stock, all having been issued for cash at par, or its equivalent in property. The testimony showed that there is in the property also a very considerable amount of donated work. The common practice in the construction of rural lines during the period the company was making its greatest expansion was for groups of farmers to organize roughly, subscribe equally to a gener - al fund, buy the necessary material with the cash thus secured, hire a supervisor, donate most of the work, construct the line and then knock at the door for admission to the association. In some instances the </seg>
            <seg id="p368">368 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT r:k issued by those fanners lines represented only the cash outlay and occasional instances represented something extra for labor. The general manager of the company, familiar with its history from its inception, a very conservative witness, testified that no less than $10,000 of donated construction service was put into the property in a day when labor was cheap. No recent physical valuation of the properties has been made. The company carries an original cost record of $115,000 for these properties, but this does not include the donated work heretofore mentioned. The company's auditors, who are not engineers, figured at the end of 1919 that the present worth of the properties was $63,120. Speaking from no other knowledge than rather complete general information as to the character of the properties, it is the Commission's opinion that both the original cost figure and the depreciated original cost figure carried by the company are conservative. Operating on its non-dividend principle and with relatively light overhead expenses, the company was in pre-war time able, under existing rates, to invest in new properties not only the equivalent of a partial dividend, but some surplus funds. Just how much surplus was thus invested as distinguished from the investment of depreciation re - serve cannot be stated because the company did not itself clearly distinguish between an expenditure which should have come from de - preciation reserve and one that was entirely a new construction charge. It is not necessary in this case so to determine for the r?ason that no iequest is made to fix a fair value for dividend purposes. In 1919 the company's annual report showed a net operating income cf $4,076. The company was, however, startled by the fact that its csish reserve was seriously depleted during the same time. This was brought about, as the evidence showed, from an expenditure in con - struction of $7,750. Some of which, however, should have been charged against depreciation reserve, but was not so handled because the com - pany did not figure it had any such reserve. The reserve is, however, ample. It is invested in additional properties and is available at any time for reconstruction purposes if released by the sale of preferred stock against the additional properties. Labor costs during the latter part of 1919 increased very rapidly The company was even reluctant in this respect, so much so that a strike of operators resulted. Rather positive increases were granted by the board of directors after the labor troubles, both to operators and other employes, but the scale presented at the hearing was by no means out of line with the experience of other companies. The revenues for 1919, less discounts, amounted to $40,639. This included about $1,000 collected for service connections. The company eliminated the service connection charges on its own motion toward the </seg>
            <seg id="p369">369 last of the year and does not desire to continue that source of revenue. The right of the company so to discontinue the collection of the federally inaugurated rates is questioned but is not handled in this matter Eliminating the service connection charges for the 1920 business, the company's prospective revenue at present rates would fall below $40,000 The scale of wages for operators at the time of the hearing was about $14,000 per annum and the company's estimates were that fhis would in - crease by something less than $1,000 during 1920. Under the Commission's method of ascertaining maintenance and depreciation reserve, the company should allocate from its revenues at the rate of about $13,500 per annum and out of this to pay linemen for the time devoted to maintenance and repairs, extra labor for the same purposes, cost of batteries, livery hire, and similar items, the remainder to be set aside as an accruing reserve to protect unrealized deterioration. This company, however, occupies a peculiar position. Its exchanges are widely scattered. In order to take care of repair work promptly, the company has located linemen at most of its exchanges and in con - sequence does not have maximum property for each lineman to take care of. For salaries alone the company is now paying more than $11,000, most of which is a proper charge against the maintenance ac - count. However, in so far as these linemen are engaged on new con - struction, it is a charge against betterments and would reduce somewhat the labor charge against depreciation and reserve fund. The Commission has no suggestion, in the light of the company's experience, how to reduce on the number of linemen- The situation n&gt;akes it necessary to allow more than the annual amount for maintenance and depreciation reserve. This extra allowance, however, is offset by low general expense. It appears not at all unreasonable that the com - pany set aside $15,000 per annum, or approximately eleven per cent of an estimated cost of the properties for maintenance and depreciation reserve. All charges, which under the Commission's accounting rules, shall be made against maintenance funds and all charges against accrued depreciation reserve, should come from this fund and the remainder be carried for similar purposes as exigencies arise. From the testimony and from the conclusions deduced by the reason above, we have the following tabulation of proper expenditures: Maintenance and depreciation reserve $15,000 Operators $1 15,1 'ommercial expense: Officers $330 Clerks 1300 Insurance 600 Rents i 500 Heat, light and power 500 Legal expense 100 Stationery, postage, books 500 Board of directors Der diem 300 </seg>

The com - pany has considerable property on which it is entitled to earn a return and inasmuch as it does not declare dividends, such return should be available for investment. No showing was made on this point and until the company raises the question for adjudication, it will be limited to an earning available for dividend or investment in additional property of $2,000 per annum. It is proposed also to sell preferred stock for •-ertain betterments and to replace depreciation reserve. Return on this p.*eferr«d stock must be provided. Such dividend earning must, how - ever, be carried in surplus until needed for the purposes for which earned. If these computations are approximately the experience of the com - pany for 1920, the revenues asked for will produce almost $3,000 above the estimated expenditures- This is, however, an uncertain time and a period of constantly expanding expenses. The Commission feels that it is better to permit the company to earn on the safe side of the balance and it will authorize the increase of twenty-five cents per month on all classes oj" service. I To this a condition will be applied that new construction which adds the fixed assets of the company must not be made from the revenues over and above the arbitrary allowance of $2,000 heretofore mentioned. Improvements and extensions, as distinguished from repair and replace - ment work, must be provided by additional capital either through the sale of preferred stock, common stock, notes, or by borrowings. This restriction will impose no hardship on the company as it has already seen that it must cease its previous methods of financing and has arranged for an issue of preferred stock out of which to secure the funds for additions and betterments. This order will be temporary in l.ature, extending to the end of the year 1920 unless sooner modified. The company will make a report to the Commission, as of date August 1, on the summary sheets provided in the Commission's accounting system, showing completely the results of the three months operation under the provisional rates. In case it proves that the revenues are more or less than are required, adjustment will be made following this report. . ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway </seg>

CURTISS, Secretary (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4167 In the Matter of the Application of the Hamilton County Farmers Telephone Association for Authority to Increase Rates. SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER BROWNE, Commissioner: Originally this case was considered in the early part of 1920, hear - ing having been held at Aurora on February 5, 1920, and order having been entered effective May 1, 1920, authorizing an increase of twenty - five cents per month on all classes of services for a temporary period ending December 31, 1920, unless extended. Applicant now asks for an extension through the year 1921, and submits its financial experience of 1920 in justification thereof. In the original opinion we estimated gross revenues of $47,000, or an increase in gross revenues as a result of the order of approximately </seg>
            <seg id="p372">372 $7,000 per annum. It was estimated from the testimony that this would leave a surplus of between $3,000 and $4,000 per annum when account was taken of the fact no dividends were being asked by the company on the $45,250 common stock outstanding. In the estimate of the expenditures in that opinion $2,000 was fixed arbitrarily as an amount which the company was entitled to consider as earnings on this common stock for such use as it desired to make, with leave to ask for adjudication to show the actual amount to which it was entitled, which consideration was not an element in the original case. tThe experience of eleven months, four of which were under pre - rates and seven under present rates, indicates that the revenues somewhat higher than had been estimated and that the expendi- tures had exceeded the estimate. Total revenue for eleven months was__ Total expenditures for eleven months $45,730.43 37,597.83 Operating income for eleven months $ 8,132.60 Deductions for taxes and interest for eleven months.. 1,307.86 Profit and loss $ 6,824.74 It is necessary to examine this statement rather critically at this time. If during the first four months of the year the higher rates had been in effect, the profit and loss account would show materially higher than at present and might indicate rates in excess of necessities. How - ever, the record shows the company's expenses have increased very materially as the year 1920 progressed. For instance, in November, where the accounts show no abnormal expenditures, the profit and loss was $400-39. In the $6,824.74 of profit and loss are no declared dividends. The company has outstanding $3,300 of preferred stock and is, under the original order, entitled to take out $2,000 for any cor - porate purposes representing a minimum dividend on the common stock rler the method of operation whereby a certain rebate, or lower rate, given to stockholders. Allowances for these two items will reduce the profit and loss to approximately $4,500. In the original order the Commission authorized the company to set aside $15,000 per annum for maintenance, current replacements and reserve against unrealized depreciation. Under that experience the company's books show no reserve accrued, but rather that current maintenance and current replacements have absorbed all of the set up, leiving the account in the red for eleven months $1,013.09. We have not checked the company's books to ascertain that the accounting rules have been carefully followed, but the company's statement is emphatic that the rules have been followed and that the only expenditure which would be a proper charge against accrued depreciation was $1,000 of atorm damage in March last. Hence, an adjustment is necessary as a proper protection to the </seg>
            <seg id="p373">373 property, so that for the year 1920 there shall show an accrued de - preciation reserve on the physical plant under account No. 630. Such rdjustment should be made from the profit and loss account that will properly reflect sufficient credit to the depreciation reserve account and charge against the profit and loss account. When this has been done, the profit and loss account will have been reduced to such point as would indicate that it is not safe to adjust the rate schedules down - ward at this time. The company has as yet experienced no particular decrease in operating expenses. It is impossible to tell at this time how soon such an experience will take place. Following its practice at this time, the Commission will extend the existing rates for a period of six months from the terminating date. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Hamilton County Farmers Telephone association be and it hereby is authorized to continue the present schedule of charges for telephone service on its system, same to terminate at mid - night June 30, 1921, unless otherwise ordered- The company will make application on or before June 1, 1921, such application to reflect the company's judgment as to the future, based on the experience at the time the application is filed. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all the terms and conditions of the original prder, not in conflict with this supplemental order, shall continue in full force and effect except whatever adjustment of the set-up for maintenance and depreciation, informally approved by the Commission between now and the first of January, 1921, shall be con - tinued in the company's accounts during the life of this order.

For respondents — None. OPINION AND FINDING EROWNE, Commissioner: This matter came on for hearing before the Commission on May </seg>
            <seg id="p374">374 20, 1920, on application which was filed December 19, 1919. The com - pany operates exchanges at Anselmo and Merna with toll lines radiat - ing from the two towns. It furnishes free service to all subscribers between the two exchanges, to Arnold and certain interior parts. Its rates are those established years ago, viz., $1.50 per month, business service; $1.00 per month for residence service; fifty cents per month for switching. It desires to publish the following rates: The company began business in 1903 as two mutual concerns which later consolidated. All subscribers bought their own telephone instru - ments and the country line subscribers to the number of four hundred or more took care of the maintenance of the farm lines. The early rate was twenty-five cents per month which was used generally to pay central office expenses. This was soon raised to fifty cents per month and about 1912 was again increased to $1-00 per month. Some time thereafter the business rate was increased to $1.50. At all times sub - scribers have owned their instruments and have purchased their own batteries. At the present moment not more than twelve or fifteen of the total number of subscribers use telephones owned by the company or are supplied with batteries by the company. For this additional service there has been an extra charge of twenty-five cents a month which does not show in the authorized rate schedule. As time went on, the company found it increasingly difficult to operate on a sound financial basis because of the sparsely settled coun - try territory served in the neighborhood of Anselmo. After consulta - tion with the Commission, the stockholders finally agreed to take all farm lines out of the corporation property, maintaining them by line associations and paying switching charges at fifty cents a month to the parent company. That practice has been followed since. Hence, the corporation has now one hundred eighty-one subscribers, approxi - mately sixty miles of pole line, for the most part metallic, and two ex - changes with central office real estate owned by the company. It is impossible to tell what the fair value of this property is for earning purposes. No physical valuation has been made by the Com - mission's engineers and no proper inventory ever taken by the com - pany. Its books have been loosely kept and serve as no adequate guide. No dividends were ever paid, the stockholders paid in a sum total of $5,390, first for stock at $10 per share for which par was paid, and later stock paid for at $15 per share. Since the articles of in - corporation provide only for stock par value $10 per share, any stock bearing face value of $15 per share is no doubt illegal and it will be assumed that all stock bears a face value of $10, for some of which a Gross Business service $1.90 Residence, individual sen-ice 1.65 Residence, two to four party 1.40 switching service .90 Net $165 1.40 1.15 .65 </seg>
            <seg id="p375">375 premium was paid. When the farm lines- were surrendered by the company to various groups of stockholders, the country stockholders paid a cash amount of $7-00 which paid switching charges for six months, the remainder going to help liquidate an indebtedness. Hence, since immediately the switching rate became fifty cents a month by the Commission's order, it can readily be assumed that each country stock- holder paid |4.00 for a portion of the country property. This did not pay proper compensation for the property surrendered and unless there was additional property remaining over and above that paid for in cish sales of stock, it left the company overcapitalized. On the other hand it is quite possible that the failure to pay dividends for the entire life of the company is properly reflected in the value of the remaining property. A physical valuation only will determine this. Such valu- ation will be made at the Commission's early convenience and an ad- justment of fair value will be made. In the meantime the company will be limited to dividends on the present outstanding stock. The present earning power of the company is a maximum of $5,750 made up as follows: 55 business subscribers at $18 per annum $ 900 126 residence subscribers at $12 per annum 1,512 Switching, 425 ai $6 per annum 2,550 Net toll earnings 700 The estimated expenditures for 1920 will run between $6,700 and $7,000, made up as follows: Maintenance and Depreciation reserve $3,400 Traffic Expense 5 operators at $175 per month 2,100 Commercial Expense Salary of manager, secretary and bookkeeper 780 Other officers and directors 230 Rent, secretary's office 24 Printing, postage, blank books, stationery 90 Light and central office power 120 Traveling expenses of officers 100 Insurance 10 Total $5,854 This leaves the present situation as follows: Earnings $5,752 Operating expenses 5354 Net operating income (deficit) $ 102 Deductions Interest ($1200 at 8 1 *) 96 Taxes 150 Dividends (8% on $5,390) 431.20 Total deductions $ 677.20 Net deficit $ 779.20 In estimating maintenance and depreciation reserve at $2,400, the </seg>
            <seg id="p376">376 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Commission is governed entirely by the circumstances surrounding the company. Its two exchanges are rather widely separated, its toll lines are long, and toll business not heavy. Its total property is re - latively small in valuation- It must, however, maintain a lineman on full time and is confronted with the necessity of paying $150 per month for such lineman who furnishes his own automobile. It pays on an average from $150 to $200 per annum for extra maintenance labor. The lineman lives at Anselmo, but must spend considerable time at Merna and in adjacent territory. The company is required to pay bis subsistence while away from home- While central office ringing current is supplied from an electric light plant, it must provide a re - serve of dry cells which is also used on Sundays when the electric light plant is not operatir &lt;?. This entails an expense of approximately $100 at the two exchanges. Inasmuch as the 1920 program cf the company does not contemplate any particular amount of new con - struction there appears to be no way in which this maintenance ex - pense can be reduced. The deficit of $779.20 is not figured on the basis of a probable in - crease in traffic expense. The company pays $80 and house rent at each of its two main exchanges, and $15 per month for an inland switchboard which by readjustment of traffic is becoming unimportant the building at each exchange, furnishes the heat. The company be - lieves it will be necessary to increase the wages $20 per month at each exchange. It hopes however, to be able to eliminate the small inland switchboard which by readjustment of traffic is becoming unimportant from a service standpoint. When allowance is made for this probable inciease, the net deficit at present rates will be at least a thousand dollars. The proposed net rates with certain adjustments to be mentioned later, will provide approximately $6,900 of revenue or an increase of $1,150 over present earnings. This increase appears necessary and will be authorized, with certain exceptions. The company desires to increase the switching charges from $6.00 per annum per station to $7.80 per annum per station- About thirty lines or associations are switched. Through custom the company is required to bear the burden of collecting from each of the switched subscribers on twenty-six of the thirty lines, the officers of the com - pany disliking to assume this burden which is properly theirs. The actual expense of switching does not exceed the fifty cents and th&lt;» Commission will not increase the charge for switching on the four lines which pay their charges as companies. It will add fifteen cents per month per subscriber as collection expense on the remaining twenty-six lines. This will somewhat reduce the estimated revenues and for that reason the Commission will increase the business rate which is relatively low to $2.00 per month, gross, and $1.75 per month, </seg>
            <seg id="p377">377 net. All the rates are on the assumption that the subscriber pays for his own batteries, this practice being so universal in this company that the Commission will not interfere with it. In the few instances, where at the request of the subscribers the company furnishes the batteries and owns the subscriber's set, an additional charge of twenty - five cents per month may be assessed and collected. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Milburn and Anselmo.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the company shall set aside from gross earnings $200 per month out of which shall be paid all proper maintenance expenses, as per the accounting rules of the Com - mission, in the hands of the applicant. Any surplus remaining there - after shall accrue as a depreciation reserve to be used for proper pur - poses.

            <seg id="p378">378 Appearances: J. R. Rhodes, Secretary OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This matter came on for hearing March 3, 1920, on allegations by applicant company that rates authorized by the Commission December 2, 1918, were no longer sufficient under constantly increasing costs of labor and materials to provide the funds with which to carry on ade - quate service. In the order of a year and a half ago, above referred to, the com - pany was authorized to increase its business rate from $1.50 per month to $2.00 per month, one party residence rate from $1.00 to $1.50, two party residence rate from $1.00 to $1.25, farm rate from $1.00 to $1.25, and desk sets from 15c to 25c per month additional to above rates. The company had asked for a rate for town service and rural service 25c per month higher than was authorized by the Commission, the rhowing made not being such as would warrant the amount of revenue which the proposed rates would bring in. Since that time, however, there have been decided increases in operating expenses with which the general public is well familiar as these expenses affect all business equally. Iln the original order the Commission found a valuation of $21,900 which the company was entitled to earn returns, this being slightly less than the value of the properties at the time of the original hear - ing- The Commission will not disturb this valuation at this time. The company now asks for rates as follows: The company also desires to establish certain installation and move charges Bet forth in the application. Lin support of the application, the company points out that for en months of 1919, under the rates authorized, the revenues were $10,225.16, the operating expenditures $9,926.23. It points out that if 8 per cent is set aside for depreciation and 8 per cent for dividends, the tpany is in arrears $4,000 per annum. The company's showing in application has some obvious errors. In considering the present application, the Commission has not only the benefit of the testimony of Mr. Rhodes, secretary, as to the Net Business service $2.50 per month Business and residence service combined $4.00 per month One party residence 1.75 per month Two party residence 1.50 per month Rural service 1.50 per month Switching service .75 per month ] per statio </seg>
            <seg id="p379">379 expenditures for various purposes, but also has the actual experiences of the company, according to the books which have been kept as per the accounting rules installed for this company by the Nebraska State Railway Commission. While there are some errors in the books, it is not difficult to ascertain the actual operating conditions. In the original order the Commission authorized the company to tot aside $340 per month for maintenance and depreciation reserve, out of which all labor and material costs for maintenance and replacements were to be paid, the remainder to accrue for the protection of the pro- perty against unrealized depreciation. The hearing did not develop that this amount needs increasing. Under present rates, basing net toll earnings on 1919 experience, the earned revenue of the company amounts to $10,986 per annum. The necessary expenditures as compiled from the testimony at the time of the hearing may be summarized as follows Per annum Maintenance and depreciation $4,000.00 Traffic expense: Operators $3,360-00 Central office power 65.00 3,425.00 Commercial Expense: Manager (portion of salary repre - senting general duties) $ 300.00 Directors 130.00 Bookkeeper (doing part of the work) 240.00 Secretary (doing part bookkeeping). 400.00 Rent 180.00 Postage, stationery, office incidentals, insurance, miscellaneous of all kinds 550.00 1,800.00 9,225.00 Total revenues $10,986.00 Total expenditures 9,225.00 Net operating income $ 1,761.00 Deductions from net income: Taxes $ 30000 Dividends 1,760.00 Interest 200.00 Surplus for exigencies 250.00 Total deductions $2,510.00 $ 2,510.00 Net deficit $ 749.00 A study of the monthly summaries of the company's actual ex- perience for the first five months of 1920 shows net income of $558, from which deductions properly allocated for five months, of $946.68 </seg>
            <seg id="p380">380 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT must be taken. The deficit for five months is therefore 1388.68 or at the rate of $933 per annum. It will thus be seen that the testimony of the secretary was very close tc the actual experience of the company. The rates asked for will provide increased revenues in amount of |2,100. This is more than the company requires when it is considered that all betterments and extensions wherever made must be provided for by new capital injected into the concern. The Commission will provide rates which will give added revenue of approximately $1,000 per annum and also give the company the advantage of such developing business as may occur in the meantime. The records in the office of the Commission do not indicate that the company is growing, with any particular rapidity, but it is understood that the company has cer - tain plans for economizing expenditures by a readjustment of exchange lines, to which the Commission will give consideration when the neces - sary data is submitted by applicant. The company also desired certain readjustments in short toll rates, evidence is too obscure to pass upon this part of the question out additional information from the company. That portion of the application relating to charges for service con - nection is not decided at this time, pending decision on hearing already had as to the general principle involved in service connection charges for the state as a whole. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Ansley Telephone company be and it hereby is, effective August 1, 1920, on account of an emergency existing, author - ized to publish and collect the following rates: Rates for town service, business and residence, shall be payable monthly in advance on or before the 10th day of the month in which service is rendered; rural service shall be payable quarterly in advance during the first month of the quarter; switching service shall be payable six months in advance during the first month of the quarter.

Curtiss, Secretary (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4175 In the Matter of the Application of the Hershey Telephone Company for Authority to Increase its Exchange Rates and to Issue Additional Com - mon Stock. Appearances: For applicant — W. H. Jenkins, president and manager. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Chairman: Applicant is a corporation with headquarters at Hershey, Nebraska. It owns the telephone system at that point and serves approximately 226 subscribers. In addition it performs switching service for about 16 farmers who furnish their own lines to the switchboard. The present company was organized in February, 1909, and at that time preferred stock in the amount of $1,000 was issued and common stock in the amount of $2,299. The preferred stock was to pay dividends at the rate of seven per cent and dividends in this amount have been paid each year since that time. No dividends, however, have been paid upon the com - mon stock. Mr. W. H. Jenkins is principal owner of the stock of the company. During the ten years that he has been connected with the same he has been actively engaged as its manager and during that period has drawn a total of only $3,035 as compensation. He asks that an allowance of an average of $50 per month for the period be made to him and that the same be paid by an issuance of common stock in the amount of $2,965. The records show that all of the outstanding stock was paid for in cash. The book value of the property is $8,137. This is approximately $36 per station, which indicates that the value as shown by the books is conservative. In view of the fact that Mr. Jenkins has never received any dividends on hi; investment in the property and that he has re - ceived only a moderate salary, it would appear that his application for stock is reasonable and should be approved. Authority will be given, therefore, to issue common stock in the amount of $2,965. </seg>
            <seg id="p382">382 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The gross rates of the company at the present time are as follows: Business $1.75 per month Residence 1.25 per month Farm 1.50 per month Switching .35 per month Application is now made to increase these rates to the following basis: Business metallic $2.25 per month Business grounded 2.00 per month Business extension 1.00 per month Residence 1.50 per month Residence extension .50 per month Farm grounded 1.75 per month Switching .50 per month A discount of 25c per month is made from all existing rates for prompt payment and the same discount except as to extension service, bells and switching rate, is desired to be made from the rates as applied for. In support of the application for an increase it is alleged that there has been a substantial advance in the cost of labor and material entering into the operation and maintenance of the plant. These costs have reached such a plane that but little, if any, margin remains for the pro- tection of emergencies and unexpected contingencies. The city plant is being reconstructed as material can be secured from grounded to a metallic system. This will increase somewhat the cost of maintenance and to a slight degree the cost of operation. The annual report for 1919 filed with the Commission shows figures for revenues and expenses for that year. From these figures and from other deductions from the testimony at the time of the hearing the Commission has constructed the following estimate of revenues and expenses that may be reasonably anticipated for the next year. In these figures we have made an al- lowance of $1,200 a year for maintenance and depreciation. This is in- tended to include all that portion of Mr. Jenkins' salary which should cover repairs and reconstruction work. He makes claim to a salary of $110 a month and of this amount we have apportioned $60 per month to his services as lineman. Out of the allowance of $1,200 should also come the expenses for maintaining the automobile furnished by Mr. Jenkins, the cost of all batteries furnished to subscribers, the cost of all materials used in repairs and replacements and the cost of all additional labor used in maintenance work. The estimate in detail is as follows: Revenues 135 Farm @ $15.00 $2,025.00 68 Residence @ $12.00 81600 7 Metallic Business &lt;5&gt; $18.00 126.00 16 Grounded Business @ $18.00 288.00 16 Switching @ $4.20 67.20 $2,025.00 16 Switching @ $4.20 Total rentals $3,322.20 </seg>

It does not appear that such an amount is necessary. By increasing the residence from $1.00 to $1.25 net and metallic business from $1.50 to $2.00 net and grounded business from $1.50 to $1.75 net and switching rate from 35c to 50c per month, there would be an increased revenue of about $325 per year. On the state - ment as shown this would afford a surplus of $350 or $400 which does not appear to be excessive under the circumstances surrounding this company at this time. It is not unlikely that some of the expenses as shown may have to be increased. We shall approve, therefore, rates on residence, business and switching service as indicated. Applicant also desires to make rates for extension service, $1.00 per month for business and 50c per month for residence- Such rates are standard for such service and will be approved in this instance. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Hershey Telephone company be, and the same is, hereby authorized to issue at not less than par $2,965 of its common stock, the same to be in full payment of all services and all claims for dividends rendered by or due to the present stockholders of said company. </seg>

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that out of the revenues of the com - pany as herein provided for, applicant shall set up for the purposes of maintenance and a reserve for depreciation not less than $100 per month, out of which sum the apportioned salary of (he lineman shall be paid, the cost of automobile or livery service incurred in maintenance work, the cost of materials used for repairs or replacements and the cost of all batteries used in the operation of the plant. Any surplus remaining in this fund shall be held in trust for further replacements and shall not be used for extensions and betterments. Separate account should be tt of funds expended for extensions and betterments so that such ex - ditures may later be capitalized. tIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that any surplus remaining after all ating expenses have been paid, including the allowance for main - nee and depreciation as above provided for and dividends at the rate of seven per cent on $1,000 of preferred stock and eight per cent on $5,264 of co imon stock, shall be held in trust pending the further order of the Commission.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4175 In the Matter of the Application of the Hershey Telephone Company for Au - thority to Increase Its Exchange Rates and to Issue Additional Corn - mo. Stock. </seg>
            <seg id="p385">385 SUPPLEMENTAL FINDING AND ORDER TAYLOR, Chairman: Applicant prays for a re-opening of this case on the ground that at the previous hearing all of the evidence supporting the application for an increase of rates was not submitted. Mr. Jenkins, manager of the company, appears in person and support of the modification of the order. He alleges that at the present time the bookkeeping, which is being done efficiently under the system prescribed by this Commission, is handled by his daughter, who is likewise day operator. She works at the board from 8:00 in the morning until 5:00 in the evening and the bookkeeping has to be attended to at other hours. As an operator she leceives $50 per month. No provision was made in the previous order for this expense. It is probable that $25 per month for this service is not unreasonale. In the original order an allowance of $1,200 per year was made for maintenance and a reserve foi depreciation. Further evidence sub - mitted by Mr. Jenkins convinces the Commission that such an allowance is too low. At the present time Mr. Jenkins devotes a considerable portion of his time to maintenance work and he has a lineman employed for a considerable portion of the time. Their joint salaries on this work averages $100 per month. Under the allowance by the Commission nothing is left for cost of batteries which will be approximately $225 per year, cost of batteries and electric current in the central office and cost of material used and necessary in repairing and replacing the plant. It seems probable, therefore, that not less than $1,800 per year should be set aside for this purpose. The increased expenses thus referred to will amount to $900 per year. As shown in the original order, the sur - plus under the rates as therein approved would be approximately $400 per year. An increase of 25c per month in the rate for farm service would produce about $400. The increase in th2 farm line rate, together with the surplus as previously shown, would about equal the expendi - tures as now proposed. It appears, therefore, that the increase in the farm lines as prayed for is necessary and that it should be approved. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the original order in this case be and the same hereby is modified so as to provide for a gross farm rate of $1.75 per month with a discount of 25c per month, providing pay - ment is made on or before the 15th of the month in which rental is due. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the fourth paragraph of the original order herein be modified so as to provide that the company shall set up for the purposes of maintenance and reserve for depreciation not less than $150 per month, the same to be expended as provided for therein. This order to be effective as of August 1, 1920. </seg>

OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner- Applicant company serving only stockholders has a demand for ad - ditional service. It desires to sell $3,000 of stock, par value $36 per (share, for the purpose of securing funds from time to time with which to make such extensions and improvements as the needs of the service demand. The articles of incorporation were amended at the request of the Commission to allow the additional stock and application is now made to the Commission under the law for authority to issue and sell. The purpose is legitimate. The only care the company must exer - cise is that the funds must be used in improvements of the property, and not for maintenance and operation. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Burneston Mutual Telephone Company be and here - by is authorized to issue and sell $3,000 additional stock, par value $35 per share, for the purpose of securing funds with which to improve and extend existing property as the needs of the service demand. Said stock shall be sold for no less than par and for cash or its equivalent in property or labor. Funds shall be used for extensions and betterments only. The company shall make report to the Commission whenever $400 of stock has been sold and the proceeds expended, showing in necessary detail the purpose for which the funds have been used.

            <seg id="p387">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 387 APPLICATION NO. 4177 In the Matter of the Application of the Odell Independent Telephone Com - pany for Authority to Increase Ex - change Rates. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Chairman: The Odell Independent Telephone company has a uniform charge of $1.00 per month for all classes of subscribers to whom it furnishes ex - change service. It now makes application for such increases in these rates as the Commission may find to be justified upon the showing pre - sented by the company. The history of this' company and the circum - stances in which it is now situated are set forth in some detail in Ap - plication No. 3914, an order which is being considered and issued con - current with the one herein. It is sufficent to say that applicant com - pany is the result of a consolidation of two companies operating in the Odell territory- The rates of both companies were the same, having been $1.00 per month per year for all classes of service. It is eon - tended by the company that with the very large increase in costs of labor and materials that it is impossible to operate within the present revenues. In Application No. 3914 the CommisEion finds the present fair value of the consolidated property to be $19,000- The engineers report the original cost of the consolidated property to be approximately $32,000. These figures will be used as the basis for the rate of return and for the computation of the allowance for maintenance and depre - ciation. The company submits a showing of its revenues and operating expenses for the year ending February 29, 1920. We have recast this statement in some particulars, the main changes being the elimination of expenditures for an automobile and for furniture, which are not properly expense items, and we have also substituted an allowance of 10 per cent of the $32,000 for maintenance and depreciation instead of the figures submitted by the company. The figures as reported by the company are more or less involved with other items and apparently do not reflect proper and actual charges to the maintenance and depreciation accounts. This revised estimate is as follows: $5,906.12 Expenses Maintenance and depreciation (10% on $82,000) $3,200.00 $3,200.00 Earnings iubscribers station $5,045.75 'oil service 776.37 liscellaneous and advertising 84.00 </seg>

The acquisition of the practically new plant of the Farmers Independent Telephone company and its consolidation with the old plant will materially raise the average physical condition of the property. However, a considerable amount of extra labor will be required in merg - ing the two plants and it will be two or three years perhaps before the new property acquired can be used to its greatest efficiency. We are of the opinion, therefore, that our allowance for maintenance and depre - ciation, which is the amount 'found by the Commission to be necessary in other plants of similar character, is not too high. The other expense items as shown by the company are very reasonable. The salaries paid to general officers are normal and it appears to be the policy of the com - pany to operate as economically as is consistent with adequate s-srvice. It is apparent, however, that the company on the present revenues is operating at a deficit. If to this deficit we add an allowance for divi - dends of 8 per cent on $19,000, we have a total deficit of $1,847.88. This leads us to the conclusion that the present rates are not adequate and should be increased- should be said in this connection that a uniform rat3 of $1.00 per th represented the minimum rate which might be charged with safety even in the years when costs of operation were much less than now. In the opinion of the Commission the company should adopt the universal practice of making a different rate for business service. If we apply a rate of $2.00 per month to business telephones and $1.25 per month to residence and farm phones, the company would have an in - creased revenue of approximately $1,600. We are unable to determine this definitely for the reason that the number of subscribers in service at this time is not available and we are using the figures shown for </seg>
            <seg id="p389">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 389 the year 1918 for that purpose. It is likely that the figures are con - servative for the reason that the 1918 figures probably contain some duplicate telephones. On this showing the company would be some - what short of the gross deficit as shown, but not in a sufficient amount to cause any serious embarrassment. The rates proposed are by no means excessive when compared with the rates charged by the other companies. The Commission finds further that an emergency exists and that these rates should be made effective May 1, 1920. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Odell Independent Tele - phone company be, and the same hereby is, authorized to charge and collect the following schedule of rates, and an emergency existing, that the same be made effective May 1, 1920: Business service Residence service Farm service $2.00 per month 1-25 per month 1.25 per month The above rates to be subject to all the rules and regulations of the company now on file with the Commission- IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the revenue derived from the rates thus approved shall be subject to all the conditions set out in the order in Application No. 3914. * IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the company shall, on November 1, 1920, submit to the Commission a complete statement as to its operat - ing revenues and expenses for the purpose of disclosing the results ex - perienced in the application of the new rates.

FINDING AND ORDER The Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company in its ap- </seg>
            <seg id="p390">390 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT plication asks to eat its passenger train which now runs from Nebraska City to Holdrege by way of Beatrice and DeWitt so that Beatrice will b* the terminus of the train from Nebraska City. Instead of the Ne - braska City train No. 97 running straight through from Nebraska City to Holdrege, it proposes to make Beatrice the terminus of 97 and start a new train west from Beatrice about two hours earlier. The company has made a showing: for four months that the average number of passengers originating east of Beatrice and terminating to points west is about three per day. In breaking the train at Beatrice ot course that number of passengers will be discommoded. The difficulty, however, arises in the fact that the train schedule from Beatrice to Holdrege is such that it is practically impossible for it to make its con - nections at DeWitt, Strang, Edgar and Tobias. The company repre - sents to the Commission that on account of the character of the roadbed, it being constructed of but 66-pound steel west of Shickley, and the amount of traffic the train has to handle, it cannot maintain its schedule with safety, that in order to maintain the present schedule the train has to make a speed of between forty-five and fifty miles per hour between stations on all runs when the traffic is heavy, which frequently occurs. If the train is broken at Beatrice and run according to the proposed schedule, the average speed of the train will be reduced and it will be possible to make the above connections referred to with greater regu - larity. While no tabulation has been made as to the number of pas - sengers to be transferred at those junction points, the Commission knows in a general way that those junction points are important ones and that it is very necessary that the connections be made. L After a careful consideration of the matter the Commission is of opinion that the application should be granted, but as the matter has been handled entirely informally and no hearing held, the order will be granted subject to future complaints.

            <seg id="p391">391 OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This applicant desires to issue stock in the amount of $10,000, for sale at par, for the purpose of securing funds with which to do a re - building: and improvement program set out by applicant as costing the following amounts: The company has now outstanding $2,250 of stock and has a system supplying service to 135 subscribers approximately. It has been found necessary to improve the system on account of inductive interference from an electric light plant. From the showing made by the company it is apparent that a por - tion of the building program should be paid for out of depreciation re - serve and a portion from new capital. The company has no liquid depreciation reserve. It is apparent from the size of the plant that considerable depreciation reserve has been invested in the property as it would be impossible to build a plant of this size with the capital now outstanding. It is permissible for the company to sell stock with which to reimburse the depreciation reserve and to use that fund for rebuilding, and to sell stock for new capital for the improvements, for instance changing from grounded to metallic service. Hence, the sale of stock will provide funds for the entire improvement program. Unfortunately the company has made no proper showing which would warrant the authorization of an issue of $10,000 of stock. The Commission will at this time authorize the sale of $3,000 of stock with permission to the company to complete its showing for the need of additional funds at any time it sees fit. The company will keep a care - ful record of the material used and the cost both of material and labor. It will also keep a record of the property taken down and junked, to - gether with an estimate of its original cost. This partial issue of stock will enable the company to begin its re - construction program and as soon as proper details are received by the Commission as to the specifications for construction the Commission will promptly authorize such additional stock as may be warranted by the circumstances.

Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 8th day of March, 1920- NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION H. G. Taylor, Chairman. Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4190 la the Matter of the Application of the of the Cambridge Telephone Com - pany for the validation of an issue of $7,000 of stock and for Authority to itcne and sell 15,000 Additional Stock. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: Applicant company was organized in the fall of 1918 for the purpose of conducting a telephone business and the owning of, such properties as were necessary for the conducting of such business. It acquired all the properties of the Cambridge Telephone Association, an organization which had been in existence for many years, operating on almost a mutual plan. Practically all the stockholders of the original association have become stockholders in the corporation. Under the mistaken notion that they were operating under the blue .-■ky law and a further mistaken idea that they fell under an exemption of that act, the corporation issued $7,000 in stock payment of all the properties acquired. The stock outstanding against the original pro - perties was cancelled. This application is in part a result of the failure of the company to comply with the plain terms with the Nebraska Statutes. At the time of the hearing on a rate application held in Cambridge, November 6, 1919, the evidence of the officers of the com - pany indicated clearly that there was no deliberate attempt to violate the law- The Commission has never been insistent that the technical requirements of the law be complied with to the extent that the penalties tthe act should be imposed for violations where the violations were ntentional. </seg>
            <seg id="p393">393 Hence, the question to be determined here is whether the amount of stock issued by the new company reasonably represented the property required. • The stock of the original association represented $20 per share, cash paid into the treasury. The properties were wholly in the city of Cambridge. Each stockholder owned his own instrument, drop wiring: and inside wiring. The original investment plus the privately owned property, making altogether approximately $35 invested out in property by each stockholder, was represented in the formation of the new company by an issue of $50 in stock. If the company had earned reasonable returns on the investment, each stockholder would have in - vested more than the $50 stock, which was issued to him. No dividends wore ever paid. The scrutiny of the property, however, by the Com - mission's engineers indicated that not $7,000 worth of property passed to the new company because the returns imposed by the old association did not earn a reasonable return on the original investment. It is impossible to tell how much property was actually acquired by the new corporation. An inventory was made and prices were attached to show approximately $6,500 in property, which was turned over to the r.ew corporation. Subsequently a substantial new re-building program was entared upon. The entire town distribution plant was made metallic, and an amount of cable was put under ground. The cost of this work was $4,000, which is at present owed. With the $7,000 of stock outstanding and the indebtedness, the liabilities amount to $11,000- The physical valuation of the property made by the Commission's engi - neers shows an original cost of $11,923 and a present value of $9,281. The assets, therefore, based on the original cost, are about $1,700 less than the liabilities. Part of this difference arose from the fact that in the reconstruction program a portion of the original properties were displaced and no depreciation reserve fund was available, out of which to charge off the displaced property. Almost half of the total plant was figured in the engineer's report at the original cost. It is only fair that a moderate leeway be allowed the new owners for the advancing prices of materials which make up a telephone plant and a portion of the deficit in property as compared with liabilities may reasonably be written off because of that factor. The Commission finds, however, that when such allowance is made the assets of the company are about $1,000 below the present liabilities. Ordinarily the Commission hesitates to pass on to the future a burden which has not been borne in the past. In the present instance, however, practically the same people who, in the past, secured service for less than it cost, will be the subscribers and stockholders in the future. It is essential that the property be built up to a point where the assets are equal to the liabilities. This can best be done in the present instance by the creation of a sinkir-j fund to be invested in the properties, such sinking fund to be set aside as a special item on the books annually </seg>
            <seg id="p394">394 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT until the deficit has been wiped out. The sinking fund itself may be invested as economy dictates in plant. An indebtedness of $4,000 has been incurred in a manner recognized by law as proper and sale of securities to pay that debt will be author - ized. The company's switchboard is in very poor condition and it is necessary to replace it at once. Such replacement of the swtchboard must be made from an expenditure of capital inasmuch as depreciation reserve was never set aside for this purpose. The replacement will cause a further deficit in assets of $100 or more- An additional $1,000 of stock is desired for the purpose of paying for the new switchboard. This also will be authorized. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Cambridge Telephone company be and it hereby is authorized to issue and sell at not less than par $5,000 of its capital stock, out of the proceeds of which to pay the indebtedness now owing for reconstruction of its system and such further cost of reconstruction as may be needed. When the sale of the stock has been completed and the proceeds have been expended, report shall be made to the Commission showing the expenditures in sufficient detail to acquaint the Commission with the facts. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the present outstanding stock in the amount of $7,000 be and it hereby is validated. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, after all operating expenses have been paid and proper maintenance provided for, together with such de - preciation reserve as shall be indicated in the order on the company's rate application, not yet issued, the company shall set aside 2 per cent per annum on a valuation of $12,000 and carry such amount as a sink - ing fund until such sinking fund shall amount to $1,100. This sinking fund shall be set aside before any dividends are paid. The money so set aside shall be spent in betterments or additions to the plant as economy dictates, but shall appear in the books of the account as a special item until its accumulations have wiped out the deficit indicated above.

OPINION AND FINDIIG HALL, Commissioner The matter herein came on for hearing at the offices of the Com - mission on the 26th day of April, 1920. The hearing was continued until September 13, 1920, for the purpose of having a physical valuation made of the properties by the engineering department of the Commis - sion; also for the purpose of giving the company an opportunity to amend its articles of incorporation so that it would have an authorized capital in an amount sufficient to cover the proposed issue of new securities. The applicant asks authority to issue $10,000 additional stock. The present outstanding stock amounts to $9,425. The additional $10,000 is for the following purpose: Three thousand dollars to be issued to the present stockholders as stock dividends. The company has shown to the Commission that it has reinvested in its properties at least $3,000 in lieu of dividends. The balance of $7,000 is to be expended for add tons and betterments to the plant. A detailed inventory of the properties and the valuation placed upon the same by the engi - neering department of the Commission shows that a reproduction new, on the cost basis of the properties, amounts to $18,540.02, and that the present, or depreciated value, is $13,648.43. If $3,000 is allowed the stockholders as a stock dividend, the stock outstanding will amount to $12,425. This would leave an equity in the properties above the stock of $1,223.43. If $7,000 is expended on the properties for extensions and betterments, the total present or depreciated value would be $20,648- 43 and the stock outstanding would amount to $19,425. The Commission is of the opinion that the $3,000 for stock dividends should be authorized and an additional amount to cover all of the money necessary for extensions and betterments.

The stockholders and directors of the said Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company, at a meeting duly and legally held in its offices at 1 incoln, Nebraska, passed resolutions authorizing the sale of said bonds at the price named- The proceeds from the sale of this issue of bonds are to be used to pay a part of the cost of additions and betterments to the property necessary to be constructed in the year 1920. The princi - pal items of the proposed budget will be one new fire proof building and automatic switches for Lincoln, estimated cost $250,000; one new fire proof building and equipment at Nebraska City, $75,000; one new fire proof building and equipment at Superior, $30,000; one new fire proof building and equipment at David City, $30,000, together with the cost of new central office equipment, instruments, cable and long distance lines in various parts of its territory. The total amount of the improvements has been carefully estimated to be $1,200,000.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the said Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company shall file with the Commission verified statements showing the proceeds derived from the sale of said securities and the purposes in detail to which such proceeds have been applied, said state - ments to be filed to cover expenditures made from time to time as soon as the same amount to the sum of $10,000. The company shall also keep itemized accounts of all expenditures which shall be at all times rubject to the inspection of the Commission.

D- Snider, President. J. L. Evans, general manager. G. E. Funk, secretary. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This matter came on for hearing at Aurora, Nebraska, on February 6, 1920, at 1:30 p. m., on the application of the company for authority to issue and sell as occasion demanded not to exceed $10,000 of pre - rl stock, par value $100 per share, for the purpose of securing funds which to make certain betterments now in the company's program. Applicant has heretofore secured its construction revenues from the sale of non-dividend common stock and from surpluses earned. It has no desire to change the plan for the sale of this common stock. It has, however, reached a point where it is no longer practicable to finance in this manner. One hundred shares of common stock at $15 par value will not furnish funds enough to build to additional stockholders. The Commission is requiring the company in a contemporaneous order to cease new constructon as distinguished from replacements out of its operating revenues and to finance such construction by the addition of new capital- It is the company's purpose also, with the Commission's approval, to secure funds from the sale of preferred stock to replace de - preciation reserve now investd in properties as occasion demands in order that this fund may be available for replacing switchboards and other properties needing attention. It is the company's purpose also, in case negotiations are completed, to secure the funds for the purchase of the Hampton exchange of the Lincoln Telephone and Telephone company by the sale of preferred </seg>
            <seg id="p399">399 stock. These purposes are all legitimate. The sale of stock will be authorized with the restriction that before the company has expended any of the proceeds from the sale of this preferred stock for the pur - chase of any exchange that the purchase price be submitted to the Commission for its consideration.

Beginning with 1910 the company paid increasing dividends, never less than 10 per cent, and for three years 20 per cent on the original invest - ment. These large dividends in recent years are justified by the com - pany on the ground that the stock does not reflect the investment and that in reality the dividends, measured by the property, was not too large. j Part of this justification can be concurred in by the Commission. It is extremely doubtful if the company has a value in the property as large as its officers think. No sufficient attention has been paid to upkeep, the directors apparently being more interested in dividends. The plant has arrived at a period in its life when repairs are abnormal. Much expense will be necessary to keep it in operating condition. The company has no money on hand. It has not looked into the future enough to prepare for the emergencies it is now facing. The dividends paid throughout the life of the company have not been excessive. Th&lt;» rates have not been high at any time- Operation has been economical. It is, however, hard for the average person to realize that any company with full knowledge that the time of rebuild - ing was approaching should proceed to deplete its cash in making up dividends deferred in an early day. The proper method should have been to cover lost dividends by a stock dividend, and to have retained the cash for use at this time. The company has properties which may be said safely to have cost $12,000 or more.. The present condition of those properties can hardly be so low that some depreciation reserve is not now invested therein. Th ; .s is subject to capitalization by the sale of stock, the proceeds to be used to restore the borrowed deprecation reserve, and to be used in the rebuilding program. The company can hardly ask the public to assume a'l this cbligaticn at this time after they have already paid in consider - able money for depreciation reserve, which the company has used in extending its lines to meet demands, rather than to increase the out - standing capital. tThe company should ask the Commission for authority under the to issue and sell more stock, and to use the proceeds from the sales bettering the properties at this time. The complaint is made that not enough money is being set up for maintenance and depreciation reserve. This appears true. In the light of the experience of the company it would appear that not less than $1,620 per annum should be set aside for maintenance purposes, out of which half the $150 per month paid for operation and line work should be paid, all the extra labor used in normal maintenance, the cost of batteries, and the purchase of materials for ordinary repairs. Any </seg>
            <seg id="p401">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 401 remainder should be set aside in accruing reserve for future replace - ments, or should be used for the immediate situation. Present rates produce about $3,300 a year in revenue. The Com - mission estimates the 1920 expenses at $3,600 including taxes, dividends at 8 per cent on present outstanding stock, and not less than $1,620 for maintenance ami depreciation reserve.

            <seg id="p402">402 APPLICATION NO. 4214 In the Matter of the Application of the Wilcox Telephone Company for Au - thority to Increase Rates. SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER BROWNE, Commissioner: The original order herein, dated June 1, 1920, denied the increase in rates for grounded business service and on residence service, and authorised increases for metallic business service and for farm line serv - ice on the ground that the company would secure revenue enough on such a basis. company is now faced with two difficulties which have subse - tly been presented to the Commission. First. It is found necessary to increase the pay for line work and operation, all of which is done through the lineman. The lineman is paid $150 a month, out of which he maintains his own automobile for such use as is necessary and furnishes his own gasoline and repairs. He hires one operator at $8 a month, who, together with the lineman's wife and the lineman himself, operate the board and furnish twenty-four hour service- Free house rent and fuel are furnished, the exchange being in the residence. - The company Ands it necessary to increase the lineman's pay, which is, relatively speaking, low. The lineman in turn has found it necessary to increase the wages of his operator $2 per week. These increases were not figured in the original order because the evi - dence was not presented. Second. The company has some forty or fifty subscribers in town who are on party lines, ranging from four to seventeen per line. It has, as before stated, twenty-eight single party lines. The rates as author - ised are the same for the individual service and for the party line service. Party line subscribers find their rate the same as individual line sub - scribers and are demanding individual service, but the company will not permit the enlargement of the number of lines going onto the board until it has purchased a larger switchboard. Replacements on distribution system are at this time more important than a change in the switch - board. The Commission will authorize an increase of 26c a month to the grounded business service and 25c per month on the individual residence service, making the grounded business service $1.75 per month net and the individual residence service $1-50 per month net. This will furnish approximately $130 per annum additional revenue, which will all be necessary to meet the increased necessary operating expenses. </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4224 1b the Matter of the Application of the Eagle Independent Telephone Com - pany of Eagle, Nebraska, for Au - thority to Increase Rates. OPINION AND FINDING HALL, Commissioner The applicant company applied to the Commission for an increase in rates on January 17, 1918, it being Application No. 3414. After a careful investigation and analysis of operating revenues and the dis - bursements of same, the application was denied and the company ordered to defer dividends for the years 1918, 1919, 1920, 1921 and thereafter not more than 7 per cent upon the outstanding stock, which amounts to $4,860. The order further provided that the company should make special reports to the Commission on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, 1919, said reports to show the amount of money that was being received and actually spent in rehabilitating its pro - perties. The present application for an increase in rates is based upon the results of operation as shown by the reports. A hearing was held April 9, 1920, upon the present application, which is now pending, it being No. 4224. The reports show that the total operating revenues from all sources for the year 1919 amounted to $3,546.21 and that the operating expenses were $2,953.57, leaving a balance of $592.64 out of which taxes and other miscellaneous charges for the year, amounting to $166.60, will have to be paid. The testimony shows that the money spent for maintenance has been only sufficient to take care of the ordinary maintenance and that it will be necessary </seg>

The Commission is of the opinion, and so finds that it will be necessary to increase the rates in order to take care of operation, main - tenance and depreciation and create sufficient reserves to take care of the future, and also to take care of dividends in the future, which will be paid after 1921, at the rate of 7 per cent.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4227 fthe Matter of the Application of the Tri-County Telephone Company for Authority to Increase Exchange and Toll Rates. Appearances: For Applicant — W. V. Hoagland, attorney. For Respondents — Henry E. Dress, attorney OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: Applicant herein operates an exchange at Stapleton, Nebraska, with an additional very small exchange at Tryon. The company owns metallic toll lines between Stapleton and Gandy, Stapleton and Arnold and Stapleton and North Platte. It owns grounded toll line from Stapleton to Tryon. It serves approximately 70 subscribers at Stapleton </seg>
            <seg id="p405">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 405 and a few at Tryon. It switches under various contracts for subscribers who own more or less of their properties for approximately 115 addi - tional stations- Hearing was held at Stapleton, Nebraska, on April 27, on an ap - plication, the prayer of which was to have a fair value placed upon the properties and to have such rate readjustments, not named, as would provide operating expenses, fixed charges, and a fair return on a proper valuation. During the hearing the company was directed to file a com - plete inventory of all property, showing the age by averages of the various units. It was also required to file statement of receipts and expenditures for two months, viz., March and April. 1920, as supple - mental to the 1919 showing of receipts and expenditures. Much of the testimony of applicant consisted of a review of the history of the development of the company and a discussion of receipts and expenditures for the last seven years of its operation. The testi - mony of the manager and owner and of his wife, relative to these re - reipts and expenditures, was not detailed as it was based very much on memory of circumstances, the books which had been kept being entirely inadequate to show the needed data. Respondents contented themselves with the presentation of complaints against the service and offered a considerable number of witnesses in support of their charges that the service is so poor as not to warrant an increase in rates commensurate with the increasing and increased cost of operation. The company failed to file the inventory of properties required by ♦ he Commiss:on, and hence that portion of the application will not be passed upon at this time. No fair value on which the company is entitled to earn can be fixed until the Commission has inventoried the property and passed upon that inventory. It is difficult to act with certainty on the application for rate in - crease on account of the fragmentary nature of the testimony relative to receipts and expenditures. The books of the company do tell the amount of money taken in during each of the recent years and the amount of money expended, but no proper effort was ever made, probably due to lack of experience on the part of the bookkeeper, to keep separate those items of expenditure which represent operating costs and other proper charges against revenues and those representing improvements cf ths properties. Considerable testimony was presented concerning the amount of property owned and from that testimony the Commission is= able to reach the conclusion that the additions and betterments in the last seven years have represented very little more than increased lia - bilities and that the betterments out of revenues have been meager. The annual reports of the company for seven years show rather conclusively that even during periods of normal costs the properties have been far from a bonanza. The rates in effect are the same as those in existence prior to war time increased costs of operation. What these increased costs have been, both as to labor and material is well </seg>
            <seg id="p406">406 known to the Commission from consideration of hundreds of similar situations in the past two years. The company is not making: the proper effort to line up its account - ing: system with the Commission's method, and is, therefore, handicapped in securing a full measure of the consideration of its needs. The Com - mission sent its accountant to Stapleton to aid in straightening out tangles, but the expense and effort on the part of the Commission, solely for the benefit of the company, was not properly appreciated. We are giving consideration to this case more because the public needs pro - tection to its service than any other factor. The company is entitled to a fair return above operating expenses, but can hardly ask the Com - mission to develop the facts without the best possible co-operation on the part of the company itself. kThis lack of coherent case, presented by the company has made it ossible to ascertain accurately the needs of the company. We do w, however, that with $4,000 gross revenues and with toll lines as long as those owned by this company, it is impossible to meet the cost t operation and to give the class of service which a growing community ; Stapleton demands and is entitled to. Operation of the switchboard at the time of the hearing was secured for less than at some previous periods and for less than other companies pay. The operator is efficient as per all the testimony. In estimating the company's needs an increase to $75 per month is anticipated. Manager Loudon figures his time as manager and lineman worth 8200 a month. Even if his estimate were correct the company cannot bear so heavy a burden. The Commission does not ordinarily attempt to fix wages, but does indicate what figures it uses in arriving at reasonable expenditures for rate purposes. In this temporary case we estimate the proper amount for main - tenance and depreciation at $2,500 per annum. The company will set {•side this amount on a monthly basis, and out of it shall pay, (1) that portion of the manager's salary representing line-work, but not exceeding $90 per month; (2) the cost of extra labor on lines in repairs and re - placements; (3) auto expense and upkeep; (4) material for repairs and replacements; (5) cost of batteries; (6) labor and expense of upkeep of switchboard and buildings. We have estimated additional salary to the manager for his general duties in amount of $50 per month. It is doubtful if the temporary rates under these estimates will pro - duce a full proper return on the investment, but the temporary period will determine that. Certain readjustments of toll and exchange rates will be made for a temporary period of four months. What action will then be taken by the Commission will depend upon the ability and the inclination of </seg>
            <seg id="p407">407 the company to present a proper record of expenditures in accordance with the accounting system of the Commission. Respondents presented considerable evidence in regard to poor serv - ice. Some of this, on analysis, is shown to be matters which the com - pany can correct. Certain phone instruments within the town arc out of order and should be replaced with other instruments and thoroughly repaired before again being put into use. Business men complained as to the toH service, and as to inadequate service over farm lines. Toll service between Stapleton and Tryon will not be good except under favorable weather conditions, for the grounded line is too long for that class of service. There is no reason why the service to Arnold and to North Platte should not be good except when weather conditions are particularly adverse. The testimony does not indicate that this toll service is worse than toll service over iron wire is generally. The farm line service will be improved mostly through the efforts of the inde - pendently owned farmers lines themselves. These lines are long and are not well constructed. There are too many subscribers on some of the lines. Such conditions make poor service on any company's pro - perties. In order that these farm line companies may get full value for the switching charges which they pay, they should see to it that their own lines are up in good condition, that the insulation is proper and that as good rules as can be enforced be put into effect to prevent too many listening on the line at one time. The manager of the Tri-County Tele - phone company is only responsible for that portion of the property which he owns. The Commission has always found it very difficult to ascertain the cause of trouble where messages pass over property of more than one company or association. It is our purpose, in the near future, to send a telephone engineer to make service tests at Stapleton without the knowledge of either subscribers or company for the purpose of ascertain - ing whether every effort consistent with the nature of the properties is being made to render service. At the same time this engineer will take an inventory of the physical properties, for use in the consideration of the case at the close of the temporary period herein provided for. Patrons of this company must bear in mind that telephone service in a country as new as that around Stapleton, where rural subscribers are relatively far apart, and where many roads are sandy and hard to traverse, can only be rendered at a disadvantage. Telephone companies in the sandier territory to the north find existence very difficult. If this company did not have toll lines with considerable business to bear i. portion of the costs, it would be impossible to operate a telephone ex - change at Stapleton and give any service which might be called com - mercial service. Stapleton is ambitions and is growing. Good tele - phone service will be one of its assets. This good telephone service can only come by co-operation between the patrons and the company a.id by the elimination of the personalities, which have to date prevented best results. </seg>

The rates over the lines owned by applicant are higher than the general schedules in Nebraska. In this it does not differ from toll lines throughout the section of the state where applicant operates. Maintenance is high and the volume of business is low. It is deemed advisable, as a revenue producer, to increase the present charges 5c per message, with certain exceptions, for station to station calls and 10c where person to person calls are used. The company will be expected to inquire, when there is any doubt, as to whether the message is person to person or station to station, and to give its patrons the benefit of the lower class of service, if they desire it. The present toll rates on file are as follows From Stapleton to — North Platte $.35 Ringgold .20 Tryon .30 Arnold .20 Hoagland .15 Logan .15 Garfield .20 Bakewell's 15 These rates will be increased 5c for station to station calls and 10c for person to person calls with the exception that messages between Stapleton and Ringgold, Stapleton and Tryon, Stapleton and Garfield, Stapleton and Bakewell's will be increased none for station to station calls and 5c for person to person calls.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4227 In the Matter of the Application of the Tri-County Telephone Company for Authority to Increase Exchange and Toll Rate*. SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER BROWNE, Commissioner: In the original order herein, dated August 30, 1920, temporary rates were granted for a period ending January 1, 1921. In the interim the company was to brine: its accounts up to date on the uniform system of accounting and was to supply an inventory of its properties and the ap - proximate ages. His inventories have not been furnished. The Com - mission has filled the gap by having an inventory taken by its engineer - ing staff- The company has not observed the requirement to file report, showing the results of the increased rates. However, the Commission will take notice from the experience of other companies that the temporary rates are as yet not producing more revenue than is essential and we will, therefore, extend existing rates for a period of three months during which time conclusions will be reached relative to the fair value of the property on which the company is entitled to earn a return. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Tri-County Telephone company be and it hereby is authorized to continue in force and effect the rates promulgated in the order August 30, 1920, to the period ending April 1, 1921, if no action by the Commission is taken in the meantime. </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4230 In the Matter of the Application of the Dawson-Nemaha Telephone Company for Authority to Increase Rates. Appearances: F. P. Page, Secretary. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This matter came on for hearing on May 27, 1920, in the offices of the Commission on application of the company for authority to increase farm and residence rates to $1.50 per month and business rates to $200 per month. Present rates are $1.25 per month for residence and farm service and $1.50 per month for business service. That schedule of rates was approved by the Commission in order dated April 18, 1918. Applicant operates an exchange largely metallic, consisting of ap - proximately 270 subscribers. Its revenues in 1919 were $4,736 under present rates and its expenditures for operation alone $3,613, leaving net income $1,123. Out of this taxes in amount $158.52, interest $150 and dividends on outstanding stock at 6%, in amount of $454.50, were paid. Profit and loss was, therefore, $360. The expenditures included more than a normal amount for maintenance and average replacements but not more than should have been set up for maintenance, replacements and reserve against unrealized depreciation. Operators were paid $65 per month, lineman $100 per month and the secretary about $15 per month- Wage conditions alone so far in 1920 make it impossible for the company to continue on this gross revenue. Operators now cost $100 per month, lineman $125 per month and the secretary is paid $40 per month — this latter increase partly due to more careful bookkeeping in - sisted upon by the Commission. Wages increase, therefore, at the present time are about $85 a month more than was the experience of 1919. When allowance is made for the profit and loss of the company in 1919, it will require $600 additional revenue over and above that of 1919 in order for the company to break even at this time. The order of 1918 limited the company to six per cent dividends. This rate of return, under present conditions, is inadequate to attract addi - tional capital into the enterprise for the wiping out of bills payable. The </seg>
            <seg id="p412">412 I Commission will authorize a more liberal dividend allowance which will call for approximately $200 additional revenue. LThe Commission has on file monthly summary statements, compiled per the accounting system inaugurated by the Commission, for the six months of 1920, which fairly reflect the company's experience. The summary for six months shows as follows: In this summary certain corrections have been madt to off-set accrued expenditures paid in January for officers and for rents, and includes the operators for January and February at the rate that has since prevailed. It is obvious that the allowance for maintenance, replacements and reserve to protect the property was altogether insufficient. Apparently no more was spent for maintenance than the pay of the lineman and the purchase of batteries- The reserve to take care of replacements as was accrued amounted to only $65 for the six months, whereas this fund should not have been less than $800. If the earnings had permitted of this set up for depreciation, the company would have been fully "justified in paying for normal replacements as they occurred out of current revenues rather than to have the plant slowly deteriorate. It was not the fault of the company that this revenue was not set pside. When the Commission opened the accounts, its accountants pro - vided for a monthly amount of $139.29 to cover maintenance and de - preciation. This is obviously insufficient as the company is paying 1 al - most that much out in wages. The lineman's time of this company is almost entirely devoted to maintenance and replacements, inasmuch as the plant is practically standing still in the matter of growth. The lineman could take care of 50 per cent more telephones, but the system has not that work to offer, hence the maintenance cost of each telephone will be higher than it would be if the plant were somewhat larger and the cost of service per phone correspondirvgly higher. In the judgment of the Commission there should be set aside monthly evenue earned Expenditures: aintenance and re] $2,474.2 placements $ 770.42 Reserve 65.32 "&gt;r»erators 60000 )fficers 240.00 ■lent 75.00 Xher expenses 114.00 Vet operating expenses $1364.74 1,864.7. *Jet operating income '.

            <seg id="p413">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 413 $197.50, out of which there shall be paid that portion of the lineman's salary representing the time devoted to replacements and ordinary re - pair work and general duties, the cost of all materials for repairs and replacing existing properties, all battery expenses, and the maintenance and operation of the automobile. Any surplus thereafter remaining should accrue in the accounts as a protection against unrealized depre - ciation. Briefly, therefore, we have the following statement of one month's revenue and reasonable expenditures at the present time: Monthly revenue (average) $ 412.37 Expenditures: Operators $ 100.00 Monthly replacements and depreciation reserve— 197-50 Rent 15.00 Light 1.50 Postage, printing, insurance and miscellaneous 25.00 1.50 Officers 40.00 Exigencies 20.00 T o i al ope-"&gt;tinfr expen&lt;l : ture^ Net operating income $ 398.00 $ 398.00 $ 1437 Deductions: Inter3st and taxes $ 30.00 Di-.-idends in present outstanding stock at 87» __- 50.50 Total deductions 80.50 Present deficit per month $ 66.13 Rates will be authorized which will produce this amount of money The company has outstanding $7,575 of stock. t Its system, how - ever, represents an expenditure of about $18,500. The extra amount over and above the invested capital has come from donated services in construction, donated services of officers and investment in additional properties of depreciation reserve during the eighteen years the com - pany has been in existence- No excessive dividends have been paid, when the whole life of the company is considered. At the present time there is an indebtedness of $3,300, made neces - sary by replacements and rebuilding program essential to continue good service. The company borrowed this $3,300 because it had in previous years invested its depreciation reserve in additional properties rather than hold such reserve in cash and do the building out of additional capital- The company must not expect to pay this indebtedness out of it? rates. The rates have already been enough to have taken up the present indebtedness, but the money, as stated above, is tied up in addi - tional properties. As soon as practicable the company should arran.^3, if it desires to pay off the indebtedness, to sell enough additional stock to retire the notes. It can at its option, the creditor being willing, con - tinue to carry the indebtedness, and the rates will provide the interest thereon. </seg>
            <seg id="p414">414 This order will provide that the unspent depreciation reserve, made possible by the amount which the company is authorised to set aside monthly, shall accrue until further order of the Commission and shall not be used to retire any existing capital liabilities. In 1918 present worth, based on original cost values, was slightly above $10,000. There has since been considerable money spent on re - placements. The Commission does not at this time find a fair value for the property as the company has not sought to earn on more than its present outstanding capital, plus interest on its notes payable. The rates for residence service will be quoted at metallic rates only. The company will at its early convenience make metallic the four or five grounded residence phones now existing.

            <seg id="p415">415 APPLICATION NO. 4232 In the Matter of Hie Application of the Farmers Telephone Company of Dodge County for Authority to Issue Stock. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This applicant asks for authority to issue $34,515 of additional stock, of which $26,515 is to be a stock dividend and $8,000 is to be sold for cash, for purposes of replacing monies borrowed from depreciation re - serve for construction purposes and now needed in rehabilitation of its properties. In an order issued on Application No. 3725, dated March 1, 1919, the Commission found that this applicant had sold for cash stock amounting to $22,885 among approximately eight hundred stockholders, for the most part located in the territory- It had during its existence paid but one div - idend, all remaining: earnings for dividends, as well as extra depreciation reserve revenues having been used in extensions of its property until it had constructed properties the original cost of which was more than $80,000 and, at the time valuation of the properties was made by the Commission's engineers, of a present worth of approximately $54,000. The company's testimony indicated that there had been a very considerable amount of donated work by the stockholders in the early days of the company, but these donations were not considered in the order. The Commission found that reasonable dividends earned and unpaid from the date of beginning the business to January 1, 1919, was $22,735. During 1919, under the terms of the order, the company paid no dividends but used the dividend earnings for replacement purposes, the plant at that time reeding considerable reconstruction. The order provided that the com - pany was entitled to earn at the rate of seven per cent per annum on $54,000, being the present value of the property. Because 1919 earnings amounting to $3780 were not paid but were used in improving the pro - perties, the stockholders are entitled to get stock dividends also for the unpaid 1919 earnings. We thus have the following recapitulation: The order of March 1, 1919, found that the company needed to spend approximately $10,000 in rehabilitation of properties. Up to this time Capital outstanding January 1, 1919 $22,88. Mvidends earned and unpaid 22,731 Mvidends accrued in 1919 and unpaid 3,781 Capital liabilities warranted $49,40 .•ess outstanding stock 22,881 Itock dividend due January 1, 1920 $26,51! </seg>
            <seg id="p416">416 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT it has secured none of such funds from the sale of securities against excess properties. It was, however, orally agreed by officers of the company that stock in the amount of $8,000 would be sold for cash in order to replenish the depreciation reserve and supply it with funds out of which to pay for a heavy reconstruction program outlined for 1920. This sale of stock is legitimate under the circumstances and relieves revenues to that extent. All the members of the board of directors have signed a stipulation by which they underwrite the sale of the $8,000 of stock for cash as one condition required orally by the Commission before the stock dividend nay be issued. The members of the board of directors are all sub - stantial farmers and their written agreement is considered amply suf - ficient by the Commission. The stock will be sold to those who are willing to buy and the board of directors stand back of the sale of the entire amount. It may be sold from time to time as the reconstruction program demands funds- If the program is carried out, approximately all the proceeds will be required before the end of 1920. Thereafter the plant should be in excellent operating condition and the outstanding stock will still remain several thousand dollars below the actual value of the property, using original cost units as the basis, rather than any advanced price units. In the opinion of the Commission it is conserva - tive financing. The stock dividend set out above, which was found proper in the preceding order mentioned, may be distributed in any equitable manner decided upon by the board of directors, or such portion of the entire stock dividend may be so distributed as in the judgment of the board of directors will be proper adjustment between the stockholders, who have allowed their monies to be used for these many years, and the new stockholder who will buy any part of the issue of stock that is to be sold for cash. The sale of $8,000 of stock for cash will provide the funds which the company has not heretofore had for reconstruction and will relieve it of the necessity of foregoing any dividends hereafter. That matter will be dealt with in a rate order to be issued during the month of March on Application No. 3725. It is recommended that the company pay dividends hereafter regularly at the rate provided in the rate order heretofore issued, as this careful attention to the payment of normal dividends gives value to the stork and puts the company on a sound basis for future financing as the needs of the company may require. The company will pay its outstanding indebtedness incurred for re - construction purposes from the proceeds of the sale of the stock for cash, the remainder to be used as economy may dictate in the improve - ment program.

Notice of such distribution and the method employed shall be filed with the Commission when such distribution takes place.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4233 In the Matter of the Application of the Bertrand Telephone Exchange for Au - thority to Increase Rates. OPINION AND FINDING HALL, Commissioner The matter herein came on for hearing May 6, 1920, and was con - tinued for the purpose of having a physical valuation of the properties and accounting studies made. The hearing was resumed and concluded on September 14. The applicant is operating a telephone system at Bertrand, consist - ing of 376 phones. It also renders free service to Loomis, Holdrege, Funk, Axtell and Atlanta. We understand the free service is being rendered because of competitive conditions. This will be discussed later in the opinion. The classification of phones in service at Bertrand and the rates for each particular class of service are as follows: </seg>

Toll revenues paid 1919- Miscellaneous revenue Total earnings for the year $8,421. 00 The balance sheet, as prepared by Accountant Johnson, data having been furnished to him by the officers and from the records of the com - pany, shows that the total operating revenues for the year 1919 was $7,309. This was based upon the average number of phones in service, while the tabulation above shows the actual number of phones in service January 1, 1920. The operating expenses for the year, as prepared by Mr. Johnson, amounting to $6,918.53, include an item of $4,000 for maintenance. This figure was purely an estimate, based upon the book account of $40,000. The engineering department shows that the original cost of the properties was $26,000. Ten per cent upon this amount would reduce the maintenance charges $1,400. The engineer's report also shows that the present or depreciated value of the properties an the original cost basis is $19,000. Maintenance and depreciation upon $26,000 at ten per cent 2,600.00 Total $5,650.11 Testimony shows that in this particular part of the state money rates are somewhat higher than in the eastern part of the state and that the prevailing rates are eight per cent. For the purpose of this case we will take eight per cent as an allowance for dividends upon $19,000. This will amount to $1,520.00, making a total expenditure of $7,170.11. This would leave a balance of $1,250.89. It may be for the year 1920 the operating expenses have increased; also it may be that the toll revenues have increased and the number of phones in use have increased. The Commission is not informed as to what has taken place during the current year- The testimony shows that the properties were sold by Mr. Bardshar to the present owners and at that time they were in a very much depreciated condition; that the present owners have re - constructed the plant, have installed new wire and new poles, and have increased the size of the poles from eighteen feet to twenty feet; that a general reconstruction program has been gone through with and that the properties have been made better generally.

            <seg id="p419">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 419 dition. The testimony also shows that there has been an abnormal amount of money spent "on the properties for maintenance, a part of which has in fact been a betterment. From all the testimony before the Commission we are of the opinion that the company does not need a rise in rates. However, if the company finds itself short of revenues we are of the opinion that its expenses should be reduced by discontinu - ing free service to the five towns that it is now serving. Certainly a telephone exchange of 376 phones should not be extending free service to five other towns and charge all parties a flat rate for that service. If by reason of increased expenses the company finds that it is short of sufficient revenues to operate and pay proper dividends, it should first retrench by making application to the Railway Commission for authority to discontinue the free service and for authority to charge a proper toll between its exchange and all other exchanges. The Commission under - stands that the free service referred to is being given because of com - petitive conditions with other companies serving in that territory. If tliat is true, it might be that should this company discontinue the free service discrimination would be created to its disadvantage- The appli - cant would certainly be within its rights if it should apply to the Com - mission to have all discrimination removed. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the application herein should be dismissed. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE CONSIDERED AND ORDERED that dividends be limited to eight per cent upon $19,000 until further order of the Com - mission. Any surplus remaining after the payment of expenses, taxes and dividends, as herein provided, shall be retained by the company and treated as part of its depreciation reserve fund until otherwise ordered by the Commission. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the application for an increase of rates, be and the same is hereby dismissed. Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 4th day of December, 1920.

            <seg id="p420">420 rthe Matter of the Application of the Pioneer Telephone Company for Au - thority to Sell Stock. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: Applicant is a corporation with an authorized capital of $5,000, or - ganized for the purpose of operating a telephone system at Enders, Nebraska, and in that vicinity. It desires authority to issue and sell $3,250 of stock for the purpose of acquiring property now owned by the Pioneer Mutual Telephone company, reconstructing the same, install - ing a new switchboard and extending into new territory. Inventory of existing properties shows an original cost of $1750 and a present value, based on original cost, of $1120. It ia desired to take over this property at that price and to expend the remainder of the funds for additions and betterments and reconstruction. The ap - plication is reasonable ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Pioneer Telephone company of Endera, Nebraska, hereby is authorized to issue and sell $3,250 of its common stock for the purposes set out in the finding above, said stock issue to be governed by the following restrictions: (a) The stock shall be sold for cash or its equivalent in property, at par. (b) In all replacement work, the company shall write out of its property account the sale price of the property displaced, less salvage and shall add to its property account the cost of the property which takes the place of old property. (c) When $1,000 of the stock shall have been sold or multiple there - of, report shall be made to the Commission as to the expendi - ture of the proceeds, showing in said report what adjustments in property account have been made, due to replacements, and what amounts have been expended for new construction.

            <seg id="p421">421 APPLICATION NO. 4244 In the Matter of the Application of the Callaway Telephone Company for Au - thority to Increase Rates. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This applicant operates an exchange confined wholly to the town of Callaway and serving 235 subscribers. It does considerable switch - ing business, receiving revenue from 318 independently owned farm line stations. This system is grounded except for business service. fta rates at present are: Authority is asked to increase rates 35c per month on business and residence service and to $5.00 per annum for switching service. In support of the application, the manager, H. H- Andrews, testi - fies that in addition to increasing costs of materials, well known to all, he has been compelled to raise his operators from $1200 per annum total to $1740 per annum and at that is paying lower wages than other com - panies similarly situated. He has, since July 1919, increased the sala - ry of the lineman from $80 per month to $100 per month and is faced with the probable necessity of a further increase. He alleges that his personal services, for which he was paid in 1919 $950, are worth $1500. He acts as manager, does some work as helper for his lineman, does all the collecting, and keeps the books. The company started in a very small way and has gradually built up to its present size with property the original cost of which was found by the engineering department of the Commission to be $14,494, with a present value of $11,102.31. The company has $12,000 of stock out - standing, which was issued in the spring of 1909. This stock is close - ly held. There are debts incurred for improvements and additions amounting to $1250. Before the physical valuation was made, the Commission, in an order on Application No. 3775, dated July 16, 1919, found from study of applicant's accounts and from testimony relative to donated labor, that a fair value of the property for dividend purposes was $10,000 or $2,000 less than the outstanding stock. The company did not pay a dividend as a result of the 1919 business, not having earned it. The physical valuation indicates that the estimated fair value for earning purposes was not far from accurate and the conclusion in that case is not modified. A peculiar switching arrangement exists at Callawty, to the det- lusinesa $24.00 per annul tesidence 12.00 per annu: iwitching service 3.00 per annu: </seg>
            <seg id="p422">422 riment of applicant. Very considerable farm line companies receive service at Arnold, as well as Callaway. By agreement an arbitrary point is named as the division line, Callaway receiving the switching charges on one side of such line and the other exchange involved switch - ing charges for the remainder. This situation results in all subscrib - ers on these farm line companies receiving unlimited service to two ex - changes while they pay switching charges to only one exchange. For purposes of inter-farm communication it is highly desirable that the lines be not cut in two but as a matter of equity the subscribers on these farm line companies should not ask for service onto the switch - board of the company to which they do not pay charges. The ironing out of this discrimination is left at this time to consideration of the companies and the subscribers involved. Careful estimates of costs of service entering into the switching of messages indicates that the cost to the Callaway company for perform - ing these services and for meeting the farm lines at the town limits of Callaway is between 40c and 45c per month per station. It will, there - fore, be provided that the switching rate shall be 45c per month per station, to be paid by the officers of the farm line companies receiving the switching service. Following the usual practice of the Commission these farm lines may pay quarterly in advance during the first month of the quarter or if agreeable to both these switched companies and the applicant may continue the present practice of paying monthly. From the annual report of 1919 and from considerable testimony given personally by the manager, it is estimated that the present cost of operating plus interest on the borrowed money and dividends on $10,000 at 8 per cent will be about $6400, divided as follows: Maintenance and depreciation reserve $2,160.00 Traffic expense Net loss under existing rates $1,285.00 Operators' 1,800.00 Central office light and power 50.00 Office supplies and heat 75.00 Commercial : Manager, secretary, bookkeeper and collector com- bined 750.00 Stationery and directory expense 50.00 Rents 50.00 Miscellaneous, including travelling expense, insurance— 250.00 Total $5,185.00 Total revenues 5,060.00 Deficit % 125.00 ructions: Taxes $260.00 Interest 100.00 Dividends 800.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p423">423 It is evident that the company needs a total revenue to meet its exist - ing circumstances, approximately $6400, and this revenue plus a small amount to cover unforeseen exigencies must be provided. The company has had in effect for several years a rate for night calls from 10:00 p. m. to 5:30 a. m. of 25c per call. The Commission always considered this rate excessive and will provide a rate of 15c per call. This revenue goes as additional revenue to the night opera - tor. The company also asks for an additional rate of 25c per month where desk sets are provided as the demand for these sets is very heavy and the cost for installing and maintaining them considerably higher than for wall sets. This additional rate has been approved by the Commission for a number of years last past wherever asked for ahd will be approved in this instance. The company also performs switch - ing service from one independent line with two subscribers thereon. Such service costs more than where there are five or more persons on the switched line and the company should receive higher revenue there - from. This will be provided. The company asks an allowance of $96 for rent, but inasmuch as this is rent for the manager's private of - fice, where other business is transacted, the Commission believes an allocation is necessary, and in its estimate set forth above as a $50 item. These estimates are, of course, not binding on the company and are used merely in arriving at fair estimate of total revenues necessary. In the order entered last July, maintenance and depreciation allow - ance was fixed at $1500. This was before the higher wage expenses were experienced and it now appears proper that not less than $2160 should be set aside annually for this purpose. The company may in its discretion increase this allowance from its other funds, but must not use this amount of revenue for any other purpose than maintaining its properties and providing a depreciation for replacement purposes. An allowance of $1500 to the manager appears entirely out of line. If it is found necessary under present wage conditions to pay a lineman $125 a month, and this is a common experience, this lineman should be able in addition to his maintenance work to undertake a large part of the work now done by the manager, Mr. Andrews. This is taken into account in making the allowance of $750 as a fair salary basis for this officer, to cover all his duties of collecting, bookkeeping and manage - ment.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4248 In the Matter of the Application of The Pullman Company for Authority to Increase Rates for Berth, Drawing Raea, Compartment, and Seat Space. APPEARANCES: For Applicant — W. Hough, Assistant Comptroller, and T. H. Ben- ton, Agent. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Chairman: In this application The Pullman Company asks for authority to in - crease its rates for berth, compartment, drawing room, and scat space. In the application it is alleged that the increases as proposed for berth, Cipartments and drawing rooms will amount approximately 20 per t The adjustment in the rates for seat space applies only to the </seg>
            <seg id="p425">425 minimum charge which is now 25c. This charge is to be increased to F'Oc, consequently all rates at the present time between 25c and 50c will be increased to the latter amount. The increase -with respect to the remainder of the service will be more nearly 25 per cent than 20 per cent. An analysis of the rates discloses no increase of less than 20 per cent, whereas there are some increases as large as 33 1-3 per cent. The average is very close to 25 per cent. During April The Pullman Company filed with the Interstate Com - merce Commission tariffs carrying the increased rates for interstate traffic as above outlined. The Interstate Commerce Commission is - sued an order which permitted The Pullman Company to file amenda - tory tariffs instead of filing complete new schedules. The company is given until October 31 to file the complete tariffs, and the new rates expire on that date, unless further extended by the Commission. This; order of the Commission has been interpreted in some quarters as an order for the approval of the rates, but such approval was not granted and this fact is explicitly explained by the Interstate Commerce Com - mission in a statement accompanying its order. No protest was filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, however, and that body did not suspend the rates. They became effective, therefore, on interstate traffic on June 1. In support of its application, The Pullman Company submits con - siderable data, tending to piove the large increase in the cost of opera - tion, due to the advance cost of labor and materials. It is -hown in this connection that the wages in 1919, for example, were $11,000,000 in excess of the wages for 1917 and that the cost of materials in 1919 were between three and four million dollars greater than for 1917. It is stated also that some of the wage increases did not become effective until the fall of 1919 and for that reason the total expenses of that year are less than they will be for 1920, assuming that the increased wages will continue throughout this year. During the period of the war the cars owned by the company were not maintained up to the pre - war standard, due to the fact that no new cars were constructed, and the traffic was so heavy that cars could not be withdrawn from service to permit of the usual repairs. Cars used for troop service were con - siderably damaged and many will have to be retired. The reduction in the number of passenger trains by the railroad administration dur - ing* the period of the war and the use of many cars for troop move - ments, resulted in a congestion on the Pullman cars that were operated. The restoration of passenger trains makes necessary the installation of a large number of additional sleepers and for this purpose the com - pany is now building 600 new cars. These will be completed by July 1, 1921. It is urged by the company that the installation and opera - tion of these new cars will not materially increase the revenue, but that the expense will be very greatly increased. The operating revenue of the company during 1919 was $69,071,548.25. Had the company </seg>
            <seg id="p426">426 been under private management, the net revenue, after making adjust - ments to the railroads under their contracts, would have been $59,971, - 548.25. The operating expenses and taxes for the year under govern - ment operation were $49,91 1,764.38. The company submits a detailed statement, showing what expenses it is necessary to add to this amount by reason of private operation. This includes income and profits, tax, and capital stock tax, amounting to $1,900,000, additional general ex - pense items of $250,000, charges from railroads, covering heat, light, lubricating and for water and ice furnished cars $1,500,000, increased maintenance of equipment $2,000,000 and increased wages $800,000. From the sum of these items is deducted $800,000 for the cost of elec - tric lighting of cars, which, under private control, would have been charged to the railroads. This makes a net increase in expenses of $5,650,000 or a total operating: expense under private operation of $55, - 561,764.38, leaving a net revenue for the payment of dividends of $4, - 409,783.87. From this should be deducted, according to the company's claim, the sum of $960,000, which is the additional annual depreciation that will be necessary to set aside for the 600 new cars now building. Capital stock of the company at the present time is $120,000,000. The assets of the company amount to $190,000,000. The company has al - ways paid cash dividends in the amount of 8 per cent on its capital stock. This amounts to $9,600,000 annually. It will be seen, there - fore, that the net income as shown above is only about one-half the amount required to pay the annual dividend. It is further contended by the company that the gross revenue for 1920 will be less by approxi - mately $3,000,000 than it was in 1919, on the assumption that the large revenue derived from troop movements during 1919 will not be received this year. There are no indications at this time, however, that the r»ffic has fallen off and the record is by no means conclusive that such shrinkage will be experienced. The showing submitted by the company by no means indicate:; that it is in a precarious financial condition. To be sure, it has realized verj substantial increases in operating expenses and it is probable that the company will experience still further increases of this nature. It has a very comfortable surplus of $20,000,000, which might readily be drawn upon at this time without injury to the credit of the company. Having no bonded debt, it could also borrow substantial Bums if necess - ity required. It has invested its depreciation reserve in new property from time to time and it is now proposing to invest upwards of $13, - 000,000, of this reserve in the 600 cars now building. Ultimately these improvements should be capitalized and the money returned to the depreciation reserve account. The company is not faced with that requirement at this time, however. It is apparent, therefore, that the company has sufficient liquid assets to provide for its financing prob - lems for the near future. Assuredly, a failure to pay dividends for a protracted period might seriously injure the credit of the company and prevent its financing necessary betterments. </seg>
            <seg id="p427">427 This prosperous condition of the company prompts us to say that if the business of The Pullman Company was limited to the state of Nebraska and all of it subject to the jurisdiction of this Commission, -we would be reluctant to grant an increa.se in the amount prayed for in this application. There are other factors, however, which bear upon the situation and to which we are compelled to give attention in reach - ing our conclusion in this case. The rates proposed are now in effect on interstate traffic. A passenger riding from Lincoln to Chicago pays the increased fare. A passenger riding from Omaha to Crawford, both points being in Nebraska, pays at the present time, the old rate, whereas a passenger going from Council Bluffs to Crawford must of necessity pay the increased fare. This presents at once a discrimina - tion as between the two classes of service, a discrimination which this Commission is powerless to prevent. Such instances might be multi - plied many times and the condition which they reflect would produce dissatisfaction and inconvience to the traveling public. The Pullman business originating and terminating wholly within the state of Nebraska amounts to a very small fraction of the total business of the company. Indeed, the total interstate traffic is but one-fifth of one per cent of the total revenue of applicant. At the time of preparing this opinion all but nine states in the United States have either approved or permitted the rates to become effective. Under these circumstances, therefore, the Commission feels it advisable to give its approval to the rates asked for. It is of the opinion, however, lhat the rates should be made effective only until October 31, 1920, the date upon which the Interstate Commerce Commission will be required to take further action on interstate rates, and the order herein win be made accordingly. On or before that date the company will be re - quired to make further showing before this Commission as to whether or not the increased rates should be continued. While the company has filed with the Commission a tariff cover - ing the interstate rates, it has not filed specific tariffs covering Nebras - ka intrastate traffic. The approval granted herein, therefore, will be upon condition that the company file proper tariffs within thirty days from the date of this order. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that The Pullman Company be, and the same hereby is authorized to file tariffs covering its rates and charges for berth, compartment, drawing room and seat space, which rates and charges shall conform to and be not in excess of the inter - state rates and charges filed with the application herein and concern - ing which findings have been made in the foregoing opinion. Such tariffs shall be filed with this Commission within thirty days from the date Hereof, and become effective upon one day's notice. , </seg>

OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This application is filed by The Pullman company requesting auth - ority to publish rates for Pullman service between Sioux City, Iowa, and stations on the Chicago A North Western railway west of Norfolk, Ne - braska, to and including Chadron, Nebraska. There has been no through service in cars of The Pullman company for this territory. However, the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; O - maha Railway company have advised that they are desirous of estab - lishing; at the earliest practicable date through sleeping cars between points in the above named territory. The Commission is of the opinion that the furnishing of Pullman service to this territory is highly desirable and that the request of ap - rsmt company to publish rates for such service should be granted, order will be entered accordingly. SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER tlT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway mission that The Pullman company be, and the same is hereby orized, effective on one day's notice, to publish and file intrastate I for Pullman service furnished between Sioux City, Iowa, and Chadron, Nebraska, the same being new territory served by applicant Chadron, Nebraska, the same being new territory served by said appli - cant company. </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4248 In the Matter of the Application of The Pullman company for Authority to Increase Rates for Berth, Drawing Room, Compartment and Seat Space. SUPPLEMENTAL ORDER TAYLOR, Chairman: On May 22, 1920, an order was issued in the above matter, approv - ing an increase in the rates of The Pullman Company for berth, draw - ing room, compartment and seat space. This increase amounted to approximately 25 per cent. The rates as approved were to remain in effect until October 31, 1920. Applicant now makes application for a continuation of the rates approved in that order and now in effect. One of the reasons for fixing October 31, 1920, as an expiration date for these rates was that the Interstate Commerce Commission, with which had been filed similar schedules, had provided that the tariffs thus filed should be effective until that date. It now appears from correspondence filed by the company with this Commission that the Interstate Commerce Commission has already given its permission for the filing of permanent tariffs covering the increased rates, effect - ive after October 31. All of the interstate rates will, therefore, re - main on the higher basis. Conditions with respect to the operation of The Pullman company, as described in the original order in this case, have not changed and the game reasons that supported the approval in the original instance still obtain. For that reason it is our opinion and we so find that the rates should be extended beyond October 31, 1920. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that The Pullman Company be and the same is hereby authorized to continue in effect the increased rates and charges for berth, compartment, drawing room and seat space. </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4250 In the Matter of the Application of The I Lincoln Traction Company for Auth - ority to Purchase Birney Safety Cars far Operation on Its Lines in the city of Lincoln. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Chairman By an order of the Commission, entered June 26, 1919, The Lincoln Traction company was authorized to purchase for use on its lines in and about the city of Lincoln fifteen Birney Safety cars. Pursuant to such order applicant purchased and put into operation ten such cars, and all of these can have been in operation since September, 1919. The company now appears with an application for permission l&gt; purchase ten additional cars, the purpose being to have a total of twent; - five of such cars in operation ultimately. As stated in the origirel finding herein, the purchase of the original cars was made partially for experimental purposes. The cars thus acquired have now been in operation for over six months and their performance has been under continual observation by the company and by the Commission. While there has been some criticism on the part of the patrons of the service, the public as a whole appears to be satisfied with their operation. There are two or three outstanding factors to the advantage of the Birney Safety cars which have been demonstrated during this ex - periment and which warrant their careful consideration during this cri - sis in the affairs of street railway companies. More important than all others is the factor of reduced operating expense. Supporting its application for permission to purchase additional cars, the company submits a statement showing the saving made in the operation of the ten cars for the six month's period, from. September 1, 1919, to Febru - ary 29, 1920. During this period the saving in wages paid to train - men amounts to $7,991.95. The saving in current amounts to $2,798. - 25, making a total saving in money of $10,790.20. These figures, in </seg>
            <seg id="p431">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 431 the opinion of General Manager Shaw, are conservative. In his opin - ion a more careful study, based on a longer period, will disclose a con - siderably larger saving. These figures do not take into account the economy in maintenance due to the light weight of the car. Definite data as to this point is not available, but it is manifest that the ex - pense of repair and replacement will be materially less than for the heavy cars. This saving will be noticeable not only in the mainte - nance of the cars themselves, but in the maintenance of the track- There is good reason to believe that the introduction of these cars upon the system of The Lincoln Traction company has resulted in a saving of not less than $2000 per month. With the addition of the fifteen new cars, the saving will be correspondingly increased and should amount ultimately to at least $5,000 per month. Careful records have been kept covering the accidents experienced by the new cars compared with the old cars. During the six months, the Birney cars were involved in seventy-seven accidents as against 343 accidents for the other cars. During this period the Birney cars travelled 205,008 miles as against 1,013,190 miles for the other can. The new cars were involved in eighteen per cent of the accidents while traveling seventeen per cent of the total car miles. It is manifest from these figures, therefore, that the new cars are fully as safe in their operation as are the old type of cars operated by two men. In other words, the new cars have not been involved in any more accidents than the cars of the other type. The cars are not unpopular with the trainmen, although there is somewhat more responsibility resting upon the operator. For the ad - ded work and responsibility ar allowance of five cents per hour above the regular scale is paid. At the annual convention of the Amalga - mated Association of Street and Electric Railway Employes of Ameri - ca, held in September, 1919, a resolution was adopted approving the use of one-man cars, provided that men employed on such cars receive more wages than are paid to the operators of two-men cars. This action reversed the position taken by the Association at its convention a year previous. It is proposed by the company, should the new purchase be ap - proved, to materially increase the frequency of service on several of its lines. It is realized that the Birney car is not as satisfactory in the "peak" hours as the larger car, but it is planned to overcome this disadvantage by operating a larger number of cars during congest - ed periods. With the addition of these cars, moreover, it is p'anned to give a more frequent service throughout other periods of the day. The operation of only ten cars has not permitted the company to real - ize to the fullest extent this advantage, but the addition of fifteen cars will make it possible. It may be well to observe at this point that the introduction of </seg>
            <seg id="p432">432 light, speedy, one-man cars promises to be a prime factor in the sclu - tion for the street railway problem. Nowhere in the country, appar - ently, is that problem more acute than it is in Lincoln. If prompt and frequent street railway service is to be maintained in this city, there - fore, it would appear that the introduction of the more economical ears should be accepted as a step in the direction of the solution if the problem, even though these cars may not furnish all of the com - forts of the larger and heavier equipment. The cars are being rapid - ly introduced in all of the cities of the country. In the opinion of the Commission, therefore, the experience of the company in the opera - tion of the ten cars for the past six months justifies their continued operation and warrants the purchase of additional cars of a similar type. Under the previous order, the company has authority to pur - chase five additional cars. In, this order permission will be given to purchase ten more cars, making a total of twenty-five cars authorized. Flat wheels have been one of the outstanding disappointments of the Birney cars. This can be eliminated in large part by substituting steel wheels at moderate expense. The company will be expected to make the substitution at the earliest practicable moment. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the application of The Lin - coln Traction company to purchase and operate on its lines in the city of Lincoln ten Birney safety cars be and the same hereby is approved, rM ears to be in addition to the purchase authorised by the Commission Application No. 3828. kIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that The Lincoln Traction company 1 file with the Commission a statement showing the total cost of individual car purchased under this order. kIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the applicant shall file with the mission a statement showing the cars retired and replaced by the ey safety cars herein authorised to be purchased.

            <seg id="p433">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 433 peculiar to this city. Electric railways of the United States are all seriously embarrassed by mounting cost of operation and constant cur - tailment of volume of traffic due to the automobile. The Birney safety car is not as comfortable for the passenger as the large double truck cars in use on some lines in Lincoln It is more comfortable than the old types of single truck cars still used in part in Lincoln. The Birney cars can be rendered more comfortable for the passengers as motormen become more versed in their use. These cars are equipped with powerful air-brakes and are able to stop on signal very quickly. It is the custom of some motormen to utilize this power to the utmost, even when not necessary, to the great dis - comfort of those passengers who may be getting ready to disembark. The opinion points out the very decided saving resulting from the bperation of these cars. During at least fourteen hours of each day the traffic is light and during about four hours the demand for space by the riding public is heavy. Under present operating costs, the double truck cars can only operate at a loss during this major part of each day and must rely on the four hours of peak load conditions to overcome that loss. The smaller cars, while not handling the peak load so readily unless plenty of them are used, are a means of great economy during at least three-fourths of the operating day. Trainmen employed by The Lincoln Traction company are among the poorly paid labor of the city. Some of them get as low wages per hour as any laborer, no matter how irresponsible and lower wage* per hour than the majority of such common laborers. Possibility of revising these wages scales to a more adequate figure lies more in the successful use of the one-man cars than in any other factor which appears to me to be available. APPLICATION NO. 42&amp;4 In the Matter of the Application of The Lincoln Traction Company for Auth - ority to Charge and Collect Increased Fares and to Increase Its Allowance for Maintenance and Depreciation. APPEARANCES: For Applicant — F. M. Hall and L. A. Ricketts, attorneys, For Protestants — C. Petrus Peterson, for City of Lincoln; G. E. Ha- ger, for City of University Place; Fred C. Foster, for Village of College View; C. E. Matson, for CTty of Havelock. TAYLOR, Chairman On December 29, 1919, this Commission issued an emergency order </seg>
            <seg id="p434">434 authorizing in substance The Lincoln Traction company to charge a fare of seven cents for each adult passenger within the city zone, or four tokens for twenty-five cents, a base fare of eight cents between Lincoln and certain suburbs and between these various suburbs. In the present application the company asks for a further increase of fare, to- wit: the changa in the price of the sale of tickets or tokens from four for twenty-five cents to three for twenty cents or six for forty cents. In addition it asks permission to increase the allowance for depreciation from 7.2 per cent to eight per cent At the time of the filing of the application, applicant alleged that it was confronted with the prospect of having to increase the wages of its trainmen in the amount of five cents per houi&lt; and to increase the wages of other employes in similar proportions. Prior to the hearing on this application, increases were actually made to the trainmen, being made effective on March 16, 1920. In- creases to other employes were also made effective April 1, 1920. The detail of the increases are reported by the company as follows Trainmen $25,000 per year Trackmen 2,000 per year Shopmen 4,200 per year Powerhouse employes 4,400 per year Other employes .1,000 per year Total 136,600 per year Since these increases were allowed, still others have been made, the amount of which has not been reported to the Commission. In support of its application the company submits statements of its revenues and expenses covering three different periods, viz.: For two months, November and December, 1919; for two months, January and February, 1920; and an estimate of the revenues and expenses for eight months, from January 1, 1920, to September 1, 1920. The first statements cover only the operations of street railway department and (to not include the results of operation of the electric light and heating departments of the company and the latter statement, covering '.he period from January 1 to September 1 is for the combined company. For the four months November, 1919, to February, 1920, inclusive, the - ho wing for the railway department is as follows: Gross revenue $264,938.26 Operating expenses 209,723.51 Operating income $55,214.75 Deductions, taxes, etc. 29,844.34 Net income Net income 25,366 41 Interest on 89% of bonds $ 20,736.27 Dividends on 89% of preferred stock 21,238.96 Total $ 41,975.23 41,975.23 Deficit $16,606.82 </seg>
            <seg id="p435">435 The statement for the period from January 1, 1920, to September 1, 1920, showing the result of operation of the entire company, is base-.l on the actual figures for January and Februray with an estimate of the revenues and expenses for the other six months. In this compu - tation is included the eight-tenths of one per cent increase for mainte - nance and depreciation asked for by the company. No consideration, however, is given to the increased wages as shown above. In this statement a loss of five per cent in passengers is predicted for the six months from March 1 to September 1. This calculation shows a net income of $88,733.13- After allowing for bond interest of $45,382.51 and preferred stock dividends of $47,728.00, a deficit of f4.377.38 is shown. A readjustment of the figures to include the increase in wages and eliminating the increase in maintenance and depreciation would show a deficit of approximately $7,500. A check made of these figures indicates that they are correct and that if anything they are conser - vative as to the probable experience of the company for the period es - timated. As stated, the company estimates a falling off in traffic of five per cent as compared with last year. At the time of the hearing the slump in the traffic had been in effect for only a couple of months and the Commission was of the opinion that the period was not long enough to determine whether the condition would be temporary or permanent. Since that time reports have been submitted showing the daily traffic, and the figures for March, April, May and June are now available. Unfortunately, the later reports show no improvement and give promise of no relief. Compared to the same months of 1919, the four month's ramed disclose a falling off in passengers carried of 260,226. This is in excess of six per cent. If continued throughout the year, the loss over last year will reach not less than 750,000 passengers. The aver - age revenue per passenger in January and February was 6.512 cents. The revenue loss to the company for the year, therefore, on this show - ing would be $48,840. It is rather bootless to speculate as to the cause of this failure of the public to ride the cars. From the standpoint of the company and from the standpoint of a portion of its patrons at least it is a painful fact. Various causes have been suggested, among them being the in - creasing use of the automobile, the increased fare now charged, infer - iority of service, etc. It is very generally agreed that of those named, the first is by far the most potent factor. The number of automobiles is constantly growing. According to incomplete totals furnished by the Department of Public Works there are at the present time between 11,000 and 12,000 automobiles in Lancaster county, Nebraska. By far the greater portion of these, of course, are within the city of Lincoln and its suburbs, the territory served by applicant. Not only are the owners of these cars withdrawn as patrons of the street railway, but through their generous willingness to accomodate their friends and </seg>
            <seg id="p436">436 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Kiors thousands of others find the automobile a convenient and economical method of transportation. This practice of picking •destrians or prospective street car riders is universal in Lincoln and is much more prevalent than in larger cities like Omaha, for ex - ample. While it is a splendid testimonial to the generosity of Lincoln automobile owners, it may be questioned whether in the end it is an accomodation to the people thus served, for it is not unlikely that a higher level of street railway fares is having to be maintained as a result of the practice. It promises to continue, however, and the con - dition thus created must be met, if street railway service is to be maintained. Higher fare. 1 - undoubtedly tend to reduce traffic although the ex - tent of such influence is difficult to measure and the figures sometimes disclose perplexing inconsistencies. The present seven cent fare basis, for example, became effective on January 1, 1920. The first twenty - seven days of that month showed a gain of 1000 passengers per day over the same period in 1919. On January 28, there was a slump of over 2000 and the falling off has been consistent ever since. It is the general experience that irritation over rate increase is greatest at the time the increase becomes effective and then gradually diminishes. Just what caused this sharp drop in traffic at the end of the twenty-seven days is hard to explain. Weather conditions doubtless had much to do with it. It is thought that the proposed increase of fares being; slight, and affecting ticket users only, it will not result in increasing the slump in traffic. That remains to be seen, however. In its estimate of revenues and expenses for the eight months from January 1 to September 1, the company took into consideration Rome of the saving anticipated from the operation of the one-man safety ears. Ten of these cars have been in operation for some time and the results of their use can be fairly well measured. They are much more economical than the large two-man cars. The company has pur - chased fifteen more of these cars and at the time of the preparation ui the estimate referred to it expected to have these cars in opera - tion in May or early in June. Owing to delays in delivery, however, these cars have not yet been put in service so that a portion of the saving included in the eight months' estimate has not been realized. It is expected that the remaining cars will be received and installed during July and August. The saving which they will accomplish, however, will not offset the increase in wages already in effect. The company has not paid any dividends on its preferred stock, nor on any of it* stock since November, 1917, and there is approximately f200,000 of such dividends now accrued. The most favorable pros - pects at this moment indicate that even under the proposed increase only a portion of the current preferred stock dividends will be earned It is estimated that the increase in the rate for tickets from 6 hi </seg>
            <seg id="p437">437 cents to 6 2-3 cents will produce about $40,000 additional revenue an - nually. This is but little more, if any, than the increased wages al - ready allowed. In this connection it should be stated that the exper - ience of the company shows that about eighty-five per cent of the pass - engers riding use tickets, the remainder paying cash. It is anticipated that a like proportion of ticket riders will continue even under the changed rates. On the ground that all labor and material costs entering into the maintenance and replacements of the property have continually advanc - ed, the company asks that this allowance for this purpose be increased from 7.2 per cent, as fixed by the Commission in its last order, to eight per cent. The depletion of the depreciation reserve is pointed to as showing the necessity for such an increase. A consideration of the operating experience of this company, as described above, indicates that increased wages and other direct operating expenses will consume any increase in revenue that may result from increase in fares. For ihat reason it seems unnecessary at this time to increase the allowance for maintenance and depreciation since it could not be set aside even if authorized. Thsre is still another reason. The policy of charging the increased maintenance cost, due to increased labor and material prices, to operating expenses is now before the Commission for general in - vestigation. It is urged by some that a portion or all of such increase is a proper charge to capital. The question is one which may be in - volved in the final determination of the application of this company for permanent rates now pending before the Commission. No finding on this point will therefore be made at this time. In the opinion of the Commission the present condition of The Lin - coin Traction Company warrants some increase in revenue and the plan proposed by the company appears to be as reasonable as any that might be devised. For that reason the application in that respect will be approved and an order will be issued accordingly. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that The Lincoln Traction com - pany be and it is hereby authorized and directed to establish the follow - ing fares for the transportation of passengers on its lines of street railway: 1.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4254 In the Matter of the Application of The Lincoln Traction Company for Author - ity to Charge and Collect Increased Fares and to Increase its Allowance for Maintenance and Depreciation. HALL, Commissioner (dissenting in part) Conceding that the applicant is in need of greater operating reve - nues in order to operate, maintain and pay reasonable returns upon the value of its property used and useful in the public service, I am of the opinion that an increase of fares for the short rider will result in loss of revenue to the company, because it drives traffic away. The fare provided in the order for the short rider is out of pro - portion to the fare paid by those riding to more remote points, such a&lt;= the Asylum, Penitentiary, College View, Normal, Bethany, Univer - sity Place and Havelock. As I stated in the former opinion, parties living in remote territories from the city should not expect the public service extended to them unless the traffic moving at a given rate war - rants the investment in such extensions. This, of course, means that the parties living in remote territories should pay a rate sufficient to pay the cost of operation, maintenance and depreciation and return upon the properties necessarily devoted to the territory served. Ex- </seg>
            <seg id="p439">439 tending transportation service to territories remote from the center of population at less than cost scatters the population of a city over vast areas, thereby increasing the cost of living in many other respects, such as extensions of pavement, gas, electric light service and telephone ser - vice over vast territories that are sparsely populated. I am aware of the difficulties that the company is confronted with in establishing proper zones for the basis of fares, but. certainly the first zone should include a territory that has a boundary of a reason - able walking distance. A minimum fare should then be made for that zone and then increased directly in proportion to the length of the haul. I am of the opinion that a five-cent straight fare for the walking zone would bring a greater revenue to the company from that zone than the fares authorized by the order herein. THOS. L.

There were about 15 addi - tional subscribers at the time of the hearing in July, 1920. Switching service is furnished 260 members of rural companies in addition. The type of plant is partly metallic and partly common return in town and partly metallic and partly grounded in the country.

            <seg id="p440">440 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The plant originated in 1903. The applicant purchased it in April 1, 1913, for a cash consideration of $13,000. The property then sup - plied 312 subscribers and was in fairly good condition. Fifteen thous - and dollars was demanded for the property and, in the opinion of the applicant, it was fully worth that amount. He based his opinion as to value upon his previous experience in building and operating a sim - ilar plant in Iowa. Considerable extensions and replacements were subsequently made to the property, including a new switchboard in Jan - uary, 1920, but strict account has not been kept of the cost of these improvements. An inventory and valuation of the property was offered in evi - dence prepared by the applicant and based on actual survey. The prices used were based partly on cost, partly on applicant's opinion as to present value, and partly on the prices used by the engineering de - partment of the Commission in valuing the Pawnee Telephone com - pany's properties in 1918. Department prices were applied to the out - side construction ,with certain small exceptions. LThe date of the inventory was December 31, 1919, and amounted $26,812.37 without depreciation. There should be added to this Mint $1,330.00 representing the additional cost of the new switch - board installed in January over the book value of the switchboard showr in the inventory, making the total figure $27,642.37. The property is in excellent operating condition according to the applicant. He contended that the depreciation did not exceed the amount shown as having been set aside for that purpose on December SI, 1919, in the amount of $2,829.37. The Commission's engineering department inspected the property in August, 1920, checked the inventory and applied unit prices thereto based on the construction cost of similar properties. It made a re - turn of $27,706-34, representing original construction cost, and $17,724.28 representing depreciated original cost.

Deducting the return of $2,000 withdrawn by the applicant, leaves $24,000 as fairly representing applicant's personal investment in the property. The record shows that expenses have increased considerably since 1919, particularly in operators' wages. Seven operators, of which one is a bookkeeper, are required. Twenty-four hour service is given. The present pay roll for this purpose amounts to $326.45 per month, which is at the rate of $3,917.40 per annum. The increase over 1919 is $1, - 247.90. A lineman is employed continuously at a cost of $1,200 per annum, and half of applicant's time is devoted to maintenance at a cost of $900 per annum, or one-half of his salary. The annual requirements, exclusive of maintenance and deprecia - tion and a return, are estimated as follows: Taking into consideration applicant's investment in the properties, the original cost of the properties, the present range of unit prices, and present condition as found by the engineers, the Commission i.« of the opinion that $24,000 as of date July 1, 1920, fairly represents the amount upon which applicant is entitled to a return. This amount includes working assets- Allowing a return thereon of 8% per annum, results in an annual requirement of $8,000, exclusive of maintenance and depreciation.

OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION : Carrier railroads engaged in the conduct of state and interstate trans - portation in the state of Nebraska applied on May 17, 1920, for author - ity to increase freight rates on intrastate traffic in Nebraska. Shortly prior thereto, a similar petition had been filed with the Interstate Com - merce Commission, praying for an order authorizing certain increases on interstate traffic. The petition filed with this Commission asked that the rates on state traffic be readjusted so as to bring the same into harmony with any increase of rates as might be made by the In - terstate Commerce Commission in the proceeding referred to. On July 20, 1920, the United States Labor Board made an award, increasing the pay of railroad employes, effective May 1, 1920, the effect of which, as nearly as could be estimated by the carriers, was to increase their operating expenses in the United States as a whole in the amount of $618,000,000 per annum and $234,840,000 in Western Classification ter - ritory, within which the state of Nebraska is situated. On July 17, 1920, in anticipation of the action of the Labor Board, petitioners herein filed a supplemental petition with this Commission, asking that in event such award be made that rates for the transportation of freight and switch - ing charges be further increased and asking for increase of passenger fares and baggage rates, for a surcharge on sleeping and parlor cars, and for an increase in rates for milk and cream transported by passenger or freight trains. It may be well to recite very briefly the events leading up to the application of the carriers herein. On December 28, 1917, by procla - mation of the President of the United States, all railroads in the United States were taken over by the Federal Government as a war measure. By subsequent act of Congress, the carriers were guaranteed a net return equal to the average rate of return during the years 1915, 1916 and 1917. Effective June 25, 1918, the Director General, acting for the President, ordered an increase in both freight and passenger rates, which increases were made effective on interstate and intrastate traffic. The rates thus ordered have been in effect since that time. Notwithstanding the additional revenue thus provided, the carriers as a whole never earned the average return guaranteed by the government and the deficit, amounting to well above one billion dollars, during the neriod of government control, has been or will be paid from the federal treasury. On February 28, 1920, Congress passed what is commonly </seg>
            <seg id="p444">444 known u the Transportation Act, which provided for the termination of federal control on March 1, 1920. As a protection to the carriers dar - ing the period of transition from federal control to private ownership, it was provided that the rates in effect on February 29, 1920, should continue in effect until September 1, 1920, and could not be reduced except upon the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission. On September 1, 1920, therefore, the carriers will be thrown upon their own resources and deficits which have hitherto resulted from operation will hive to be made up by the shippers and patrons rather than to be paid out of the public treasury. The application filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, heretofore referred to, was made at the suggestion of that Commission in order to assist it in complying with the provisions of Section 15-a of the Interstate Commerce Act. Hearings were held in Washington in May, June and July, the case being submitted on July 6, 1920. In ac - cordance with the provisions of paragraph 3 of section 13, of the Inter - state Commerce Act, the state commissions were invited to co-operate with the federal government in the proceeding and there were appointed three representatives of these commissions, Honorable William D. B. Ainey, chairman of the Public Service Commission of Pennsylvania; Honorable Royal C. Dunn, of the Railroad Commission of Florida; and Honorable John A. Guiher, of the Railroad Commission of Iowa; who sat throughout the hearings and during the argument and participated in the conferences of the Commission subsequent thereto. Following the issuance of the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, these rep - resentatives of the state commissions submitted a report, in which they stated that they agreed with the findings and order made by the federal body and recommended similar action by the state commissions. In its order, the Interstate Commerce Commission divides the United States into four traffic territories, viz.; Eastern, Southern, Western and Mountain-Pacific. Nebraska is placed in the Western group. The Commission found that the carriers were entitled to in - creases in freight rates of 40 per cent in the Eastern territory, 25 per cent in the Southern territory, 35 per cent in Western territory and 25 per cent in Mountain- Pacific territory, with increases of 33% per cent M traffic moving inter-territory. In addition, all passenger fares and charges were increased 20 per cent, excess baggage rates 20 per cent, milk and cream rates 20 per cent and a surcharge upon passengers in sleeping and parlor cars in the amount of 50 per cent of the charge for space in such cars, such charge accruing to the rail carrier and not to the sleeping car company. It was understood that the application of Nebraska carriers to this Commission would not be pressed to a con - clusion until action had been taken by the Interstate Commerce Com - mission. Hearing was finally assigned for August 3, 1920, at which time carriers and a considerable number of interested shippers appeared unore uic v^/mrniBatvii* onowing maae oy we earners consisvea 01 </seg>
            <seg id="p445">445 filing: a transcript of all the testimony taken in the hearing before the Interstate Commerce Commission, a discussion of some legal complica - tions particularly applicable in Nebraska and a statement of the general situation. Carriers promised that all necessary adjustments resulting from the increases in freight rates would be taken up in subsequent pro - ceedings and ironed out in an equitable manner. This statement on the part of the carriers caused a considerable number of shippers to with - draw contemplated opposition. Shippers of building materials alone presented objections to the proposed increases, basing their opposition largely on the fact that under General Order 28 specific increases were applied, which, on most shipments, resulted in much heavier increases than the general twenty-five per cent advance affecting most 'reight. This will be discussed later in the order. No effort was made by the carriers to present any data particularly applicable to Nebraska, either as to revenues or expenditures, or the affect on such revenues and expenditures of the proposed increases on Nebraska traffic. Their case was presented on the hypothesis, which we understand was followed by them in hearings before all the other state commissions, that the states were co-operating with the Inter - state Commerce Commission in carrying out the provisions of the federal transportation act of 1920 and that the same action would be taken by the various states on intrastate traffic, in so far as could legally be done, as had been taken by the Interstate Commerce Commission. With the consent of this Commission, the Union Stock Yards com - pany of South Omaha intervened, asking that it be considered a partici - pant in the main application to the same extent a.s other applicants on the kinds of traffic handled by it. The Nebraska Commission has, therefore, before it either of two alternatives. It must either consider that it is working in conjunction with the Interstate Commerce Commission to bring to pass the provisions of the transportation act that the carriers shall be allowed such revenues in the aggregate by districts as will provide a return of five and one-half or six per cent on ihe value of railway property used in the transportation business as shall have been found proper by the Interstate Commerce Commission; or it must follow the provisions of Nebraska law, which on all other matters governs its deliberations. If the first alternative is to be followed, the Nebraska Commission must, perforce, merely for - mally adopt the conclusions of the Interstate Commerce Commission without further consideration. No investigations made by the Inter - state Commerce Commission, and no testimony presented to it, took into account state boundaries or purely state traffic because the transportation act did not so provide. If the second alternative is to be followed, the Commission must consider the reasonableness of state rates in securing the results sought. If the Nebraska Commission is to be governed by Nebraska statutes it must use the rule of reasonableness. It appears that the Commission must give primary consideration to Nebraska law in </seg>
            <seg id="p446">446 case it has the data on which to work. If such data were unavailable the Commission would be compelled either to feel itself governed by the provisions of the federal law, or to reject the application in toto for lack of necessary information upon which to base a conclusion. kThe Commission has, however, not only all essential data concern - the western district, as named by the Interstate Commerce Commis - , on property investment and revenues and expenditures for the con - structive year ending October 31, 1919, but it also has the annual reports of the carriers operating in Nebraska showing mileage within the state, revenues properly creditable to state traffic and proportions of inter - state traffic, and expenditures either directly chargeable to Nebraska business or allocated on such basis as has been followed in making annual reports to the Nebraska Commission. The federal transportation act of 1920 provides for co-operation be - tween the Interstate Commerce Commission and state regulatory bodies in cases where there is likely to be conflict of jurisdiction. The Nebraska Commission is keenly alive to the importance of this co-operation, which in its judgment will solve many of the so-called conflicts between state and interstate business heretofore existing. The Nebraska Commission is, however, limited in its co-operation by the provisions of Nebraska The application of the carriers for an increase of passenger fares cannot be considered by the Commission for want of jurisdiction. Pas - senger fares are fixed in Nebraska by sections 141-144, article 8, chapter 67, of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska of 1913 (general numbers 6067 - 6069). The first section mentioned is as follows: "It shall be unlawful for any railroad corporation operating, or which shall hereafter operate, a railroad in this state to charge, collect, demand or receive for the transportation of any passenger over twelve years of age, with baggage not exceeding two hundred pounds in weight, on any train over its line of road in the State of Nebraska, a sum ex - ceeding two cents per mile: Provided, no railroad company shall be required to sell any ticket for less than five cents." The validity of the enactment just quoted was before the court in the case of State vs. U. P. R. R. Co., 87 Neb. 29, and after full consider - ation it was held constitutional. The power of the Commission to change or modify the legislative - made fares was considered by the court in State ex rel. Missouri P. R. R- Co. vs. Clarke, 98 Neb. 566. It was held that the Commission was not authorized to increase the fares provided by the statutes. The court uses this language: "The intention to withhold from the state railway commission authority to increase passenger rates is fairly disclosed by the legisla - tion specifically authorizing it to increase express and freight rates, though they had been fixed by statutes; by the fixing of passenger rates </seg>
            <seg id="p447">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 447 without thus authorizing' an increase; by the failure of the legislature to specifically amend the 'Two-cent Fare Act', while legislating generally at the same session on the subject of rates; by the conditions which prompted the lawmakers to remedy existing abuses;, and by the con - stitutional provisions conferring the rate-making power on the legislature and creating the state railway commission." The decision in State vs. Clarke was referred to with approval in Marshall vs. Bush, 102 Neb. 279. We cannot take the view that the fares put in force during the period of Federal control operated as a repeal of the statute or that the Commission was given any additional power by virtue of Federal legislation. We are sustained in this by the case of N- Y. Central R. R. Co. vs. Public Service Commission of the State of N. Y., second district, recently decided by the United States district court (case reported in Traffic World August 14, 1920.) In view of these authorities the Commission must dismiss that part of the application for want of jurisdiction. We realize the power of the Interstate Commerce Commission under the Shreveport decision and under the provisions of the Transportation Act of 1920 (sub-sections 3 and 4 of section 13 of the Interstate Commerce Act as amended, re - vision of April 1, 1920), but they cannot afford us any basis for as - suming jurisdiction where under the constitution and laws of this state, as interpreted by the supreme court, we have none. On the question as to whether the passenger rates fixed by Nebraska statute again become effective on September 1, or whether the trans - portation act of 1920 has, under war powers of Congress, indefinitely extended the rates inaugurated by the director general, is not passed upon at this time. Already the point has been raised in other states, and test cases are either before the Supreme Court of the United States, or are on their way to that court on appeal. This Commission will await the conclusions of the courts. No such legal barrier as exists to the consideration of the applica - tion to increase passenger rates exists relative to the consideration of rates to be applied to other services connected with passenger train service. The precedent was established years ago by the Commission that extra fares on certain trains within the state were not a rupture of the state passenger law, provided the option existed to patrons to secure reasonable service without paying the extra fare. Under this precedent the Commission feels itself at liberty to authorize a twenty per cent increase on extra fare trains within the state. Its conclusion is also that this class of service may well bear the increase. The same logic can be applied to that portion of the application asking for a fifty per cent surcharge on all Pullman and parlor car charges, the revenue therefrom to accrue to the railroads rather than to the Pullman com - pany. The Commission is unable to agree with the argument that such surcharge is indirectly a violation of the state passenger rate law- It it, oar opinion that this charge is for special services entirely at the </seg>
            <seg id="p448">448 option of the patron. The surcharge on Pullman rates and parlor car rates will be approved. The Commission will also approve a twenty per cent increase on excess baggage rates as now in effect on state traffic. It will also approve a twenty per cent increase in rates chargeable for special trains as now published and legally on file with the Commission. Ex - cursion rates in so far as the approval of the Commission is requisite must be limited as a maximum by Nebraska State law. Milk and cream is handled in high class service under rates that are not relatively high when the present value of the commodity is con - sidered. The Commission is of the opinion that the twenty per cent increase in existing rates on milk and cream should be approved for those applicants before us who do this class of business. The Commission is well aware that the carriers affected by its order are in need of substantial relief- In its consideration of the situation it has followed this plan: (a) Fair value of steam railway property of carriers within Ne - braska for this particular case: From carriers' Exhibit No. 1 in I. C. C. Ex parte 74 for railroads in western district (p. 9) it has taken the total property investment and mileage owned of the entire systems of carriers operating in Nebraska, and therefrom has secured the average property investment of those carriers per roadway mile owned. It has applied such averages per mile value to the total roadway mileage within the state of Nebraska, and has then reduced such result by the same percentage as the total property investment of carriers in the western district was reduced by the Interstate Commerce Commission in its order. (b) Revenues: These were taken from the reports of Nebraska carriers to the Commission for the calendar year 1919. These include revenues on purely state traffic, and the portion of interstate revenue credited to the state by formulas used in making annual reports to the Nebraska Commission. (c) Expenditures: These were taken from the carriers' reports for the calendar year 1919 to the Nebraska Commission, without change of the formulas used by them in allocating to the state traffic a proper share of inseparable expenditures. (d) Adjust menu : Both as to revenues and expenditures these were taken from page 2, Exhibit No. 1 of carriers in the western district in I. C. C. Ex parte 74, the identical method being followed by us as by the carriers and the Interstate Commerce Commission, due note having been made of the debit claim for $2,799,943 apparently disallowed by the Interstate Commerce Commission. (e) Deductions: These include (1) taxes reported to the Nebraska r— twin n for the calendar year 1919, adjusted as per the method used </seg>
            <seg id="p449">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 449 for the entire western district; (2) hire of equipment and miscellaneous rents taken from Nebraska reports and adjusted in the same manner; (3) a proper share of "other corporate adjustments" applied to Nebraska traffic. (f) Other Debit Adjustments: Expenditures for Nebraska traffic were burdened by a proper share of increased costs found in carriers' exhibit for the western district, covering wages of trainmen, maintenance of way employes and clerks, operation of refrigerator cars, a credit for increased mail pay, and a debit for increased fuel costs- The.se were arrived at by applying the percentages of freight revenues found in the carriers' exhibit to the gross 1919 freight revenue reported for Nebraska. (g) Labor Board Award of July 20, 1920: The percentage found by the relation of the total increase of wages estimated by the Inter - state Commerce Commission to be a burden on the western district roads, to their total adjusted expenditures (13.7%) was applied to the total adjusted expenditures charged by the carriers against Nebraska traffic. Following are the tabulated results: Mileage owned system (car - riers' exhibit) Corporate 64,782 Adjustments 395,405 $ 4,149,156 Hire of equipment and mis- cellaneous rents $ 1,932,734 iicia ejuiiuiij Property investment system (carriers' exhibit) Average investment per mile owned (carriers' exhibit).

That commission reduces the valuations claimed by the carriers in the western district by over $800,000,000 or 9.6 per cent. The reasons for this reduction are not given, nor is it stated which roads were affected. It is fair to assume, however, in the ab - sence of information to the contrary, that the reductions were applied more or less uniformly to the carriers as a whole, and that our method of applying the same ratio of reduction to the roads in Nebraska does not do violence to the intent of the Federal Commission. As heretofore stated, we accept the figures approved by that Commission in order that we may, as nearly as possible, reach comparable conclusions. Testing the values by such information as is available, it is manifest that the figures so far as they apply to Nebraska roads, are very fair to the carriers. The Bureau of Valuation of the Interstate Commerce Commis - sion has submitted but one tentative report covering its findings as to the value of the carriers operating in Nebraska, this report being as to the property of the Rock Island. This report, but recently filed with us, shows a cost of reproduction of $41,000 per mile, whereas the figure used by the Interstate Commerce Commission and accepted by us in this case represents a value of $46,140 per mile. As throwing further light tthis point, it is worth noting that in the suit brought by the Rock ,nd to enjoin the 2c fare law in Nebraska, it was stipulated by the tther corporate adjustments 16,382 Total deductions $ 5,854,030.00 Corporate income Nebraska carriers )ebit adjustments covering in- cidental wage awards, operation of refrigerators, mail pay (credit), increas- ed fuel costs, increased in- come taxes (2.838 per cent of freight revenue — $74,464,142) abor board award 1920 (13.7 per cent of adjusted oper- ating expenses) $ 2,113,292 11,289,050 $ 15,932,456 00 Total additional deduc- tions $ 13,402,342.00 idjusted corporate income iix per cent return on $331,846,206, estimated fair value $ 2,530,114.00 19,910,772.00 teficit 17,380,658.00 17,380,658.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p451">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 451 company and the state that a value as of June 30, 1915, averaging only $34,134 per mile be adopted. Similarly in the Missouri-Pacific two cent fare case, in which the special master has made a report, he finds a value of approximately $43,000 per mile. The value as used in this case is $49,700 per mile for the same road. The value found for the St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island, as representing its property investment, plus additions and betterments, allocated government property and materials and supplies, is approximately $66,896 per mile. This is higher than the figure of any other road in Nebraska with the exception of the Union Pacific and is manifestly excessive. The Union Pacific is the only ex - ception to the conclusions just stated by us. Its double track and very highly developed roadway in Nebraska give it a value much above that of the other lines operating in the state, but the increased value of that road is undoubtedly provided for in the method we have adopted. What we have said with reference to the valuation adopted for the purpose of this case applies with equal force to revenues and expenses. In other words, we have taken the revenues as reported by the carriers to us and used the figures without adjustment, notwithstanding the fact that the basis of division of these revenues to Nebraska is not uniform between the carriers and in some cases follows a method which in our opinion does not accord to the state full credit for the revenues to which it is entitled. The same applies to the apportionment of expenses ex - cept as these have been adjusted to meet the adjustments made by the carriers themselves in their case before the Interstate Commerce Com - mission, and to provide for the increase in wages provided for by the Labor Board. Various formulas for the division of expenses between state and interstate traffic have been from time to time adopted and wide variation is produced by their use. We do not question in this proceeding, however, any of the figures submitted by the carriers in their reports, though, for the reasons stated, there is ample ground for doubting their fairness. In compiling these results the Commission has used the tabulations presented by the western earners in their Exhibit No. 1 to the Interstate Commerce Commission and in the main accepted by that body, and in addition thereto the reports of Nebraska carriers to the Nebraska State Railway Commission for 1919. In making adjustments to meet con - ditions not known when the annual reports were filed we have followed the method, without deviation, used by the carriers in their main case, except that a Nebraska basis was used rather than one for the entire district. One exception exists: The Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company has not made its annual report to the Nebraska Commission for 1919 for the necessary segregation of income and ex - penditures to cover Nebraska traffic. To meet this deficiency the 1918 Nebraska revenues and expenditures of that road were increased by percentages experienced in 1919 by the Chicago &amp; Northwestern Rail- </seg>
            <seg id="p452">452 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT way company as compared with 1918. The result, while not accurate, is the best approximation possible of the 1919 experiences in Nebraska of the delinquent carrier. It is manifestly proper that state traffic within Nebraska shall bear its fair share of the charges necessary to give the carriers all operating costs, fixed charges and a return of six per cent on such fair value as will reflect in Nebraska the Interstate Commerce Commission's con - clusion of the western district as a whole. Such finding must neces - sarily, we believe, fall within the definition of reasonableness as meant in the limitation of Nebraska laws. This Commission's action can apply only to that minor fraction of the total Nebraska traffic as is wholly intrastate. If, in its wisdom, the Interstate Commerce Com - mission has seen fit to allow higher increases on such Nebraska traffic as may be part of interstate business, it is exercising a judgment which federal laws have given it. It has only applied a different definition of what is reasonable, or has felt itself bound by the directions of the Transportation Act of the congress. The carriers will be beneficiary of puch higher increases. This Commission has been forced by the court's interpretation of Nebraska law to deny jurisdiction to consider proposed increases in passenger fares intrastate. It must therefore find that portion of the necessary increases in revenues as are a just charge against Nebraska intrastate business from freight traffic and other miscellaneous intra - state sources as the Commission has jurisdiction to amend. In reaching it conclusion as to increased revenues necessary the Interstate Commerce Commission has assumed that the volume of traffic v.ill not be less in the year ending August 31, 1921, than it was in the constructive year ending October 31, 1919, shown in the western carriers' exhibits. In our computations we have made the same assumptions concerning Nebraska traffic for the year ending August 31, 1921, as compared with the calendar year of 1919. On such assumption as to volume of traffic, the increases asked for by the carriers and allowed by the Interstate Commerce Commission will add about $375,000 to the railroad revenues properly to be credited to Nebraska traffic from such miscellaneous sources as switching, stor - age, transit, weighing, diversion, reconsignment, excess baggage, special trains, Pullman surcharges, and milk and cream shipments under rail* road operation. The rate increases found reasonable by the Interstate Commerce Commission for the western district as a whole, exclusive of the Mountain- Pacific states, will, when applied to Nebraska traffic, on the 1919 volume, produce additional revenue in amount of $29,890,000. The Transportation Act provides that half of the excess earnings shall be taken by the federal goernment to be used as a revolving fund. We do not believe that any power exists in the Nebraska Commission to </seg>
            <seg id="p453">453 specificaiV provide an excess over this reasonable return on Nebraska pror ~icy, so far as intrastate rates are concerned. From the data set out heretofore we find that an increase of twenty - t nree per cent on the total Nebraska freight traffic, plus increases allowed on miscellaneous traffic, will overcome the deficit for the constructive year ending August 31, 1920, without an increase in passenger fares over present rates. With the higher rates on the interstate portion of this traffic we are not concerned in this finding. However, as the Commission will herein make reservations on cer - tain commodity traffic within the state, the effect of which on revenues is unknown, it is deemed advisable to provide an increase in general freight traffic of twenty-five per cent. These increases are temporary but for an indefinite period. The Commission will set the matter down for further consideration at an early date in order that carriers and shippers may have further oppor - tunity to present additional evidence in the light of these findings. INDIVIDUAL COMMODITIES Shippers of brick and sand file protest to the allowance of any in - creases in rates before a state-wide readjustment of rate schedules affect - ing these commodities is made, either upon order of the Commission or by voluntary action of the carriers. In support of their objections, shippers of brick and hollow tile, sand, crushed rock and gravel, assert that the rates on these commodities have already been increased an average exceeding sixty per cent over the rates in effect prior to June 25, 1918, as evidence of which they cite General Order No. 28, by Director General McAdoo, effective as of that date. While that order provided for a general advance of twenty-five per cent as to most commodities, it made specific increases as to certain building materials, including those named. On brick and hollow tile the increase was two cents per hundred pounds and on sand, crushed rock and gravel one cent per hundred pounds. Both of these classes of commodities in Nebraska move within a small radius from the producing points. It was estimated by one witness that the average haul on brick will not exceed seventy-five miles. It is less for sand. The rates for both have been practically the same and on the old basis ranged from two cents to four cents per hundred for the first seventy-five miles. The increase of two cents on brick, therefore, was equivalent to an average of approximately seventy per cent for this distance and of one cent on sand to approximately thirty-five per cent- It would require a thorough study of the traffic to determine the exact amount of the increase. The larger tonnage of sand moving within the short distances would make the percentage larger than we have stated it, while the more frequent movement of brick for longer hauls would somewhat reduce the figure </seg>
            <seg id="p454">454 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT we have given. It is manifest, however, that the increase «*, commodities was greatly in excess of twenty-five per cent and pn/^j would not fall far short of sixty per cent. It was generally understood, if not specifically stated at the time General Order No. 28 was issued, that the higher advances on building material were made for the pur - pose of discouraging domestic improvements and to conserve labor and material. Such necessity no longer exists and it does not now appear equitable that these commodities should be compelled to continue under the handicap thus imposed. The situation as to brick is further complained of by shippers because of the rather chaotic condition of rate schedules. In addition to varying commodity schedules, applying from each point of production, no two of which extend for similar distances, two class scales are in effect, viz.; General Order No. 19 and I. C. C. No. 3800, known as the Clark scale. The latter applies from the twelve jobbing points in the state, while the former affects traffic to and from all other points in the state. An effort has been made by shippers to have these conflicting schedules ironed out and a formal complaint was filed with this Commission at one time, which for good and sufficient reasons was never brought to a hearing. It appears, however, that early action should be taken in this direction. Any further increase of the rates at this time would not only add to the handicap already referred to, but would add to the dis - criminations and disparities now existing in the rates. For these reasons we are of the opinion that brick and hollow building tile in carloads should be excepted from the increase provided for in this order and that the whole matter should be set down for early investigation and adjustment. t While the conditions as to sand, crushed rock and gravel are much same as apply to brick, the disability imposed by General Order No. 28 i6 not so serious and the situation may be met by providing that the total increase over the rates as they existed on June 24, 1918, shall not exceed sixty per cent. Early consideration should be given to the question of a state-wide adjustment of sand rates. Representatives of the twelve so-called jobbing cities in Nebraska appeared at the hearing to ask that no increase in rates be approved in Nebraska until the present unsatisfactory condition, resulting from the application of one class rate schedule from the twelve jobbing points and another class rate scale between all other points in the state, can be remedied- While the Commission recognizes the disability created by this situation, we are of the opinion that the situation is altogether too complicated and too extensive for consideration in this proceeding. Such a readjustment would postpone action on this application for many months and defeat the very purposes for which it is filed. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway </seg>

OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: Applicant company, with exchanges at five towns, does switching at only the one town of Dodge. It has a rate of thirty-five cents per month for switching service, which rate was based on the cost of switching antedating the present high levels. The chief item going to make up the switching cost is the pay of operators and the necessary expense at the central office. From data submitted by applicant and checked by the Commission, the following summary of monthly expenses, which may be denoted cost of switching messages, is made up: These figures do not represent exactly those presented by the company as adjustments have been made- The company's expense at the central office for bookkeeping and collecting as allocated to Dodge is $22.00, but the amount of collecting and bookkeeping for each subscriber on a switched line is relatively small as compared with other subscribers and for the purpose of ascertaining a switching rate to be applied to the switched lines the tabulation is made on the basis of all subscribers being switched subscribers ana taking no more bookkeeping than the actual switched subscriber. Hence the reduction to $6.00 for the computation. There are at Dodge 322 subscribers who must equally bear the cost to the company of transferring messages from one person to another. These items are separated out from the total expense as shown above. Regular subscribers pay additional to the switching rate for return on the distribution plant and the upkeep of the distribution system, which includes lineman's salary, automobile expense, batteries and materials. It will be seen that at fifty cents per month as recompense to the com- Operators $105.00 Central office power 4.85 Heat and light 7.00 Maintenance and depreciation allowed, return on investment in central office equipment, real estate and building 58.00 Office supplies and incidentals 6.00 Bookkeeping, collecting, and supervision (ex- penses at the main office) 6.00 $186.85 Less average net toll per month 2300 Total $163.85 </seg>
            <seg id="p458">458 I pany for switching when applied on all subscribers would bring a revenue of $161. The cost is slightly more than that. These figures do not take into account the possibility of the company owning the wires and poles from the central office to the town limits for the purpose of taking on the switched lines at that point. If the company owns this additional property it would increase the amount rightly to be charged for switch - ing. The evidence is silent on this point and the item is omitted. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Farmers Telephone company of Dodge county be and it hereby is authorized, effective September 1, 1920, to publish and collect $6.00 per annum on each switched subscriber, said rate to be paid quarterly in advance during the first month of the quarter and to be paid by companies rather than by individuals- Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 16th day of August, 1920.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4340 In the Matter of the Application of the Central Telephone Company for Au - thority to Increase Rates. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This company operates an exchange at Greeley, Nebraska, and vicinity, serving 70 business patrons, 163 residence patrons, and 350 farm patrons. Its rates are $2.00 per month for business, $16.00 per annum for farm, and $1.00 per month for residence- Its town exchange is practically entirely metallic. The rates quoted above are those that have been in existence for at least the last decade. No hearing was held in this case as notices sent to various interested parties at Greeley, asking if they desired to be heard, did not receive response to that effect. The Commission has, under its method of ac - counting, a record of the company's financial condition during the first six months of 1920. This record shows that the company earned operat - ing expenses and fixed charges and had a surplus of $675.00. The six months, however, did not reflect certain higher expenses of operation, chiefly in wages, nor did it show the full extent of the cost of repairs and replacements. When these are taken into account the company would have had nothing left for dividends under existing rates. The replacements, which have been heavy, are a proper charge against ac - cruing depreciation reserve, which apparently the company has never created on the rates under which it has operated. Hence, temporarily a larger allowance for replacements must be made. The company asks an increase of fifty cents per month on business and residence phones and $2.00 per annum on farm phones- It also asks for gross and net rates and for a toll charge between Wolbach and Scotia, a roundabout service, which, as a free service, has hindered the </seg>
            <seg id="p460">THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 460 greatest efficiency of the local exchange. Applicant has pending an application to have a valuation fixed on which it should be allowed to earn dividends. The Commission has not as yet passed on this application and the increase in rates herein author - ized will be temporary pending a conclusion on the other application. It is deemed necessary to issue this temporary order for the company must have some relief at once. A discussion of the financial history of the company will be included in the order on the other application just mentioned. If in the finding in that case it is disclosed that the rates herein authorized are insufficient, further adjustments will be made. On the rates here authorized the company will have additional revenue of approximately $1,200 per annum. It is quite uncertain whether this will be a sufficient increase and the matter will be gone into more care - fully in the very near future. ORDER IT IS THERTFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Central Telephone company of Greeley be and it hereby is authorized, effective November 1, 1920, to charge and collect the following rates: Gross Net Business service $2.75 $2.50 per month Farm service 20.00 16.00 per annum Residence service 1.60 1.35 per month Toll charge between Scotia and Wolbach via Greeley .15 per message Note: Net rates for town service will be charged where bills are paid on or before the 10th of the month in which the service is rendered. {Net rate will be charged on farm service where bills are paid at lea^t quarterly in advance during the first month of the quarter in which the service is rendered. LIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the company shall pay dividends, ng the effectiveness of this order, not to exceed eight per cent per annum on the outstanding stock and the actual rate charged on all other obligations. If, after operating expenses and fixed charges have been paid and these dividends and requirements have been met, any surplus remains, it shall be either held intact or used to make up deficiencies in any departments.

            <seg id="p461">461 APPLICATION NO. 4342 In the Matter of the Application of the Citizens' Telephone Company of Malmo for Authority to Issue Addi - tional Stock in the Amount of $63,877. Appearances: E. C. Hunt, president. Chas. F. McLaughlin, attorney. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Chairman The financial affairs of this company have been under review by this Commission in several rate cases and it is unnecessary to go into detail with reference to its financial history. The application in this instance is for authority to increase its capital stock from $13,000, the amount now outstanding, to a total of £76,877. The amount applied for is determined by applicant by accepting the purchase price paid by the present owners in 1914 of $44,000 as a fair value of the property as of that date, and adding thereto deferred divi - dends of $15,177, additions and betterments to the amount of $10,250, bills payable in the amount of $2,450, and future additions and better - ments in the amount of $5,000. This makes a total of $76,877, which applicant contends represents the actual investment in the property. It exceeds the outstanding stock by $63,887. In Application No. 2405 the Commission found that in 1914 the property was purchased from a family named Jamison by Mr- H. A. Cheney. Mr. Cheney traded the property known as the Creighton Electric Light &amp; Power company, said to have had an original cost of $10,255 and paid in addition cash in the amount of $16,000 for the property of the Citizens Telephone company. A few months later Mr. Hunt, the present secretary and general manager of the company, pur - chased a half interest in the property for $22,000. As stated in the opinion in that case, the financial history of the company prior to the last change of ownership was obscure and it was impossible to determine the exact investment. In 1915, however, a valuation was made by the Commission's engineers, which showed a cost of reproduction of $47,281.91 and a depreciated value of $32,030-47. This valuation did not include all of the real estate owned by the company at that time. For the purposes of that case, dividends were computed by the Commission on the basis of $44,000. In the same order increased rates were approved, subject to the condition that the company should make extensive improve - irents in its property. These improvements were eventually completed at a cost of $10,250, all of which money was contributed by the owners and none of it came from the earnings. </seg>
            <seg id="p462">462 In Appication No- 4126 this Commission again approved an increase in rates, but as no valuation had been made no finding was made as to fair value. For the purposes of the case, however, dividends were computed on $42,280, which represented the depreciated value of the property as found in 1916, plus the $10,250 of additions and betterments. The Commission stated that a valuation would be necessary before a fair value could be determined. Prior to the hearing in this case, therefore, the engineers of the Commission made an inventory and valuation of the property and they found an original cost of $83,367.50, and a present or depreciated value of $57,619.16. Since 1914 dividends have been paid, amounting in the aggregate to $8,699.84, or an average of $1,739.96 a year. If we compute dividends at eight per cent on the basis of the depreciated value, as found in 1916, and add the cost of additions as made, we would have a total of $15,272 as the required net earnings of the company since 1914. Deducting from this the $8,69984 of dividends paid would leave a balance of $6,572.16 of dividends earned but not paid. The dividends actually paid, computed on the present value of the property in 1915 of approximately $32,000, would average about five and one-half per cent for the period. If computed on the $44,000, representing the purchase price of the present property, they would represent an average of 3.9 per cent a year for the period. As the Commission has stated in a previous opinion, it is in doubt as to whether or not the property was worth $44,000 at the time of the pur - chase in 1914. It is more than probable that the depreciated value of $32,030, as found in 1916, fairly reflected the fair value of the property at that time. If we start with that as a basis and add deferred divi - dends in the amount of $6,572.16, additions and betterments in the amount of $10,250, bills payable, which the testimony shows represent money expended in additions and betterments, of $2,450, and proposed additions of $5,000, we have a total of $56,302.16. In the opinion of the Commission, if stock is issued in the amount of $57,000, it will fairly reflect the fair value of the property and will do justice to the present owners. Adding to the present value of $57,619, as found by the engineers, the proposed additions of $5,000, we would have a depreciated value of $62,619- There would thus remain a fair margin of value in the property over and above the stock authorized. Should the request of the company for an additional issue of $63,877 be approved, the total outstanding stock would exceed the depreciated value of the property by approximately $11,000. The Commission will there - fore approve an issue of stock on the basis of a value of $57,000. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Citizens Telephone com - pany of Malmo be and the same hereby is authorized to issue and sell, tnot less than par, additional common stock in the amount of $44,000, king the total outstanding authorized issue of stock $57,000. </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO 4343 In the Matter of the Application of the American Railway Express Company for Authority to Increase Express Rates and to Change Classification. PRELIMINARY ORDER BROWNE, Commissioner: This matter came on for hearing before the Commission on Sep - tember 2, 1920. One portion of the application has local significance only. It is requested that applicant be permitted to amend item 50 of the terminal and switching charges tariff, I. C. C. No. A-2095, Nebraska Railway Commission No. 6, to read as follows: "Lincoln, Nebraska — Nebraska state fair grounds. "The rate for handling less than carload shipments to or from the Nebraska state fair grounds at Lincoln, Nebraska, is eleven scale num - bers more than the rates to or from Lincoln, Nebraska. The rate on live hogs or sheep is thirty-five cents per one hundred pounds more than the rate to or from Lincoln, Nebraska. "The rate on carload shipments between Nebraska state fair grounds and all points is $5.00 per car more than the Lincoln, Nebraska, rate." Evidence of the carriers was that it has been found necessary, be - cause of the temporary large volume of business due to the state fair, to contract for the handling of deliveries and pickups from the fair grounds to private delivery companies on which applicant is required to pay said private companies thirty cents per hundred pounds. The increase asked for on delivery of merchandise less than carload ranges from five to nine cents per hundred pounds, depending upon the length </seg>
            <seg id="p464">464 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT i &lt; of shipment. The present rate for handling crated hogs or sheep is fifty cents per crate regardless of weight. Evidence of the carriers, which is undisputed in the testimony, in - dicates that the merchandise handled to and from the fair grounds is almost entirely property of concessionaires and that practically no material placed on exhibit for educational purposes alone is thus handled. For the most part hogs and sheep are handled inbound carloads, and outbound, to a large extent, in crated express shipments. The board of managers of the state fair lodged objections to the increase not on the ground that it furnished unreasonable revenue for the service performed but that no proper advance notice could be furnished to those who have to pay, and on the further ground that the state fair is of such an educational nature as to warrant special features in the Tariffs- The Commission is not much impressed with the first contention on the part of the board of managers. As to the second contention, freight tariffs generally indicate that the educational feature of exhibits is to be measured by the fact whether such exhibits are returned to the original shipper or transfer ownership during the progress of the fair. Almost exclusively shipments of hogs and sheep outbound by express are to new owners and this appears to us to be entirely a commercial transaction. On the less than carload shipments, these appear to be, from the testimony, largely property of those who attend the state fair wholly for profit making. Such shipments cannot be considered in any other light than shipments to or from patrons of the express company in ordi - nory express transactions. The state fair grounds are outside of the free delivery limits. Any other resident of Lincoln outside the free delivery limits is required to pay the actual cost of delivery, such deliveries usually being made by private delivery firms under contract with the express company. We know of no reason why a different rule should apply to the same class of transaction during the state fair week. Applicant asks for five cents per hundred pounds more on crated animals to cover the extraordinary expense of a force of employes located on the fair grounds for the convenience of the shipper. All such ship - ments carry a terminal charge supposed to cover the cost of billing and handling outside of the extra expense of delivery. The extra force of men is compensated for by increased volume of traffic and the Commis - sion is unable to approve the five cent additional charge. The carload rate is of a similar nature to the charge for switching to industries in freight traffic and is not out of line with such charges in tiie city. With the exception of the modification of the rate on crated animals, the application will be approved and because of the emergency </seg>

On August 11, 1920, the Interstate Commerce Commission rendered a decision on the application pending before it, in which it allowed a uniform increase on all classes of traffic of twelve and one-half per cent, providing, however, that the entire increase thus allowed should accrue to the express company and none of it be paid to the railroad companies. The increase asked for by the express company was 25.16 per cent, but it was anticipated that, under the contracts between the express and the railroad companies, 50.25 per cent of this amount would accrue to the railroad carriers. The only exception to the uniform increase of twelve and one-half per cent applies to milk and cream upon which an increase of twenty per cent is to apply, that being the allowance on that commodity made in the freight case. The Interstate Commerce Commission found that a deficit in the operation of the express company for the year 1919, amounting to ap - proximately $23,000,000, had accrued and that without any increase in rates this deficit would be materially increased after 1920. In the hear - ing before this Commission the company stated that it was impossible for it to separate the revenues and expenses as between state and inter - state traffic, due to the fact that the company had been under govern - ment operation during the war period and during that period no separa - tion as to states had been attempted. A committee of state commis - sioners, representing the twelve states in express zone No. 3, appeared before the Interstate Commerce Commission in the proceeding before that body and submitted extensive exhibits covering several phases of express operation. The data thus prepared is available to this Com - mission for consideration in this proceeding. The deficit referred to above does not take into account the award of the United States labor board, which, as estimated, will increase the expenses of the express company approximately $44,000,000 annually. Perhaps the most striking phase of the showing as to expenses made by the company before the Interstate Commerce Commission was that involving the payments paid and accrued on account of loss and damage claims. In 1916 the aggregate amount covering this item for all of the </seg>
            <seg id="p467">467 companies operating in the United States was $4,828,688. This had increased in 1919 to $20,576,161. It was even higher in 1918, although a portion of the expense charged to that account for that year was due to losses incurred in previous years but paid in 1918. The amount of over $20,000,000 in 1919 represents over seven per cent of the total ETOss revenue collected by the express company. It represents practi - cally fourteen and one-half per cent of the revenue accruing to the ex - press company after its payments to the railroad carriers. Allowance should properly be made for the greatly increased value of the mer - chandise transported by the express company, but even after taking that into consideration the amounts paid out for this purpose are so large as to be appalling. It was charged by shippers and state commissions and admitted by the express company that much of the loss and damage to shipments was due to improper billing and receipting. Under JT5e practice as it obtained up until July 1, 1920, no receipt was given to the shipper and but one bill was made covering the shipment, this bill being pasted or attached to the package. Should the bill, which contained the name of the consignee and the destination, be torn or defaced, or should the package be lost, the company had absolutely no trace of the ship - ment. Not only did this result in thousands of shipments going astray and being lost, but it was an open invitation to theft and pilfering on the part of employes and others. It is significant that of the $20,000,000 paid by the company in 1919 on this account, over $15,000,000, or seventy - five per cent, was paid by the company for losses or for damage, con - cerning which the company had no information. In the opinion of this Commission the old method of billing and recording express shipments amounted to inexcusable inefficiency- A new system of billing and re - ceipting should have been installed long before the storm of protest arose on the part of shippers. The failure of the company to make such im - provements is to be accounted for only on the theory that the guarantee of the federal government protected it against all losses and it conse - quently lacked the necessary incentive to correct the practice, the evil effects of which were as manifest to itself as to the shippers who were compelled to suffer from it. During the progress of the hearing before the Interstate Commerce Commission, however, it was announced that an entirely new method of handling shipments would be installed on July 1, 1920. Among other changes, duplicate receipts are being issued and complete record kept of every shipment. Already the benefits of the new system have be - come manifest. Not only does it promise to greatly reduce the pay - ments for loss and damage, but it is equally certain that traffic will be greatly expedited. Supervising officials now have information as to the movement of all shipments and delays due to improper marking or misrouting may be readily discovered and corrected. It is not im - probable that the new system will reduce the amount paid out for loss and damage claims at least forty per cent, and possibly more. At the same time a much more prompt and efficient service is to be expected. </seg>
            <seg id="p468">468 THIRTKENTH ANNUAL REPORT Despite the saving to be expected from this change in the method of handling shipments, the company will suffer a substantial deficit if it does not get an increase in revenue. We are of the opinion, there - fore, that an increase of twelve and one-half per cent is well justified under the circumstances. The full amount of this increase should accrue tr the express company and none of it should be paid to the railroad companies. Shippers appearing at the hearing did not protest an in - crease of rates, but were insistent that there should be an improvement in the quality of the service- With respect to the application of the company for permission to cancel the commodity rate on live poultry, representatives of the poultry interests stated at the hearing that an agreement had been entered into with the express company providing for a satisfactory rate in the event of the cancellation of the commodity rate referred to. This statement was confirmed by the representative of the express company. The application in that respect will therefore be approved. Shippers of fresh fruits and ice cream were prepared to protest quite vigorously certain changes to be made in the classification. It was stated by counsel for applicant, however, that it was not desired at this time to have an order from this Commission approving the new classification inasmuch as the Interstate Commerce Commission has not (.&lt;" yet handed down an order in this matter. In view of this fact, and in view of the further fact that some shippers were in doubt as to whether or not the classification would be taken up or consideration at this hearing, the Commission will not pass on that matter at this time and it is probable that further hearing will be had to consider readjust - ment in the present classification. That portion of the application requesting an increase in the terminal rates between Lincoln and the Nebraska state fair grounds has been already disposed of in a separate preliminary order and need not be discussed here. In the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, express rates on milk and cream were increased twelve and one-half per cent except as between points where there is railroad competition and as to such points the increase of twenty per cent applying on milk and cream mov - ing by freight is allowed on express shipments. This Commission in Application No. 4299 approved an increase of twenty per cent on intra - state movements of milk and cream moving by freight. There appears to be good reason, therefore, in order to prevent discrimination, to grant a similar increase on milk and cream moving by express. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the American Railway Express company be and the same hereby is authorized to publish, charge and collect, after September 14, 1920, or as soon thereafter as tariffs can be rd, rates twelve and one-half per cent higher than the rates in effect state traffic at the present time; provided that the rates on milk and </seg>

It concerns an application of the American Rail - way Express company for authority to make an increase in its rates of thirteen and one-half per cent, which is additional to the increase of tvelve and one-half per cent authorized by this Commission in its. order issued on September 14, 1920. As .stated in the original order in this case, the Interstate Commerce Commission approved an increase on all classes of traffic of twelve and one-half per cent and provided that the full amount of such increase should accrue to the express company and none of it be paid to the rail- </seg>
            <seg id="p470">470 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT road companies. Subsequent to the submission of the evidence in that case, the United States Labor Board, in its decision No. 3 of August 10, 1920, and also in its decision No. 2 of July 20, 1920, ordered the Ameri - can Railway Express company to make increases in wages to its em - ployes aggregating $42,296,340 per year, or approximately $3,500,000 per month. Following this award of the Labor Board, the express com - pany made a supplemental application to the Interstate Commerce Com - mission for authority to increase its interstate rates to the extent of fifteen per cent. On September 21, 1920, that commission approved an increase of thirteen and one- half per cent on all classes of traffic with the exception of milk and cream, on which commodities a total increase of twenty per cent was allowed to conform to the increase made to the railroads in Ex Parte 74 on shipments of milk and cream moving by freight or baggage. As in the original order, it was provided that all revenue thus secured should accrue to the express company. At the time of our decision in the original order in this case, the award of the Labor Board had been made public and application had been made to the Interstate Commerce Commission for further relief, but that body had not as yet rendered its opinion. In considering the affairs of the express company at that time, the additional expense was not taken into consideration, as is shown by the following statement ap - pearing in our report: "The deficit referred to above does not take into account the award of the United States labor board, which, as estimated, will increase the expense of the express company approximately $44,000,000 annually." The figure used to cover the increase in wages at that time was an estimate submitted by the company. At the hearing on the instant application, this figure was somewhat modified by the actual experience and was reduced to approximately $43,000,000 Copies of the supplemental application filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission and of the testimony taken in that proceeding, and of the order of such commission, are a part of the record in this case. In its decision in that case the Interstate Commerce Commission stated on page 710: "Again recasting the 1919 operations, but upon the basis of a total increase of 26 per cent in the rates, in the manner before outlined, the results would be $365,427,969.97 in gross revenues and $220,903,869.11 in total operating expenses, exclusive of express privileges. Deducting from the difference between these amounts in 1919 express privileges, the net remainder would be $1,094,281.14. As before indicated, this would take no account of prospective further revenues from the pending class - ification changes, some of which have been agreed to by interested shippers and others of which have not been contested." It is manifest that, if the rates approved by this Commission in its previous order were reasonable, the award of the United States Labor Board, increasing wages in the amount stated, would produce a sub- </seg>
            <seg id="p471">471 stantial deficit without further provision for additional revenue. Since the submission of the evidence in this case, financial and industrial con - ditions have undergone a substantial change and the prospects for lower costs of material and labor in the future are very promising. It will be many months, however, before such reductions can be realized, during which time the express company will be compelled to operate at a sub - stantial deficit, unless, as stated, further relief is granted at this time. Refusal of this Commission to approve the increase applied for would certainly result in discrimination proceedings before the Interstate Com - merce Commission with, very probably, an order from that body ad - vancing the rates to the interstate level. Practically all the other states have approved the thirteen and one-half per cent advance and all of the states touching Nebraska have so acted. We are quite firmly of the opinion that ultimately a complete re - adjustment of the express rates, as between zones, must be effected. It is. conceded by the express company that the cost of handling the busi - ness in the eastern territory is out of proportion to the revenue received in that territory and this was found to be a fact by the Interstate Com - merce Commission in its original opinion. At the present time the basis of rates in Zone 3, in which Nebraska is situated, is materially higher than the basis in Zone 1, which covers largely the eastern section of the United States. A revision of rates, based on cost of handling the business, would undoubtedly justify a change in this relationship so as to remove some of the burden from Zone 3 and place it on the traffic in the zones where the cost is greater. It is impossible for the Nebraska Commission to make such an adjustment, however, nor can consideration b(- given to that question in this proceeding. When normal times are restored, an effort should be made, and will be made, to bring about a more equitable adjustment of rates throughout the country. A few shippers appeared at the hearing in this case, not so much to protest against the proposed increase as to complain of service con - ditions. It was conceded by some of them that the wage award made necessary some increase in rates. They were inclined to demand, how - ever, better service than has been and is now being given by the express company. With this demand this Commission is in full sympathy. The revenues accorded the company by the Interstate Commerce Commission and various state commissions should place the applicant in a position to render first-class service. It is to be hoped that the company will not relax its efforts to bring about a better service condition. Certain manufacturers and shippers of ice cream asked that that commodity be excepted from the proposed advance, in view of the detrimental effect of further advances upon the movement of that commodity. We have given consideration to this phase of the matter, but reach the conclusion it would not be proper at this time and in a proceeding of this character to exempt any particular commodity from the application of the advance. In this connection it should be stated that recent advances in freight </seg>
            <seg id="p472">472 rates have brought them, in some instances, very close to express rates. This has the tendency of shifting traffic that should move by freight to the express company and thus seriously interfering with the service that company should be able to give. It furnishes an added reason for ad - vancing the express rates so as to re-establish the relationship between the freight and express rates. tAs stated, the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission pro - 1 for a total increase on milk and cream shipments of twenty per This was to remove a discriminatory condition brought about by its previous order, wherein it was provided that where there was com - petition between the express and the railroad company in the carrying of milk and cream, the express company should have an advance of twenty per cent- This resulted in an anomalous situation, whereby competition had the effect of producing a substantial increase in rates. In other words, where a railroad company and the express company served the same town in the transportation of milk and cream, the in - crease in rates was made twenty per cent, whereas at the next point beyond on the express line the increase amounted only to twelve and one-half per cent The second order of the Interstate Commerce Com - mission cures this defect by making a uniform advance of twenty per cent. It will be noted that this results in a less advance on milk and cream than on other commodities, the total increase on other com - modities being twenty-six per cent. Upon consideration of all the elements involved in this proceeding, the Commission is of the opinion that the application of the express company is reasonable and that the advance of thirteen and one-half per cent on intrastate traffic in Nebraska should be approved. ORDER tIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the American Railway Express ipany be, and the same hereby is authorized to publish, charge and ect, after January 15, 1921, or as soon thereafter as tariffs can be filed, rates thirteen and one-half per cent higher than the rates in effect on intrastate traffic at the present time; provided that the rates on milk and cream be made equal to those contemporaneously applied by the railroad lines operating in Nebraska; and provided further that no part of such increase, as herein provided, shall be paid to the railroad carriers over which said company operates.

            <seg id="p473">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 473 APPLICATION NO. 4379 In the Matter of the Application of the Nebraska Carriers for Authority to Publish Minimum Weights on Grain and Grain Products. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: All Nebraska carriers have made application for authority to pub - lish miirmum weights on grain and grain products to conform to author - ization by the Interstate Commerce Commission recently issued. The rules desired read as follows: INCREASED MINIMUM WEIGHTS ON GRAIN AND GRAIN PRODUCTS On Grain, all kinds, minimum weight marked capacity of car, except where marked capacity is less than 40,000 pounds, in which case mini - mum weight will be 40,000 pounds per car (see note). Note: When grain is loaded at point of origin to within 24 inches of roof, at side walls of car, for the purpose of federal or state inspection, or for inspection by grain exchange at points where federal inspection is maintained (notation to that effect being inserted in the bill of lading by shippers) or when grain is loaded to proper grain line of cars s# marked, actual weight will apply. On Grain Products, namely: Barley, cracked, flaked, pearl, roasted, rolled, sprouts, dry. Bran. Brewers' cerealine, brewers' corn flakes, brewers' flake, brew - ers' grits, brewers' meal. Cerealine, other than brewers. Chops, grain (chopped feed). Cracked corn, corn flake, corn germs, com germ meal, com meal. Farina. Feed, chopped. Feed, gluten, hominy, nutrilene. Flour, buckwheat, barley, corn, ferita, kaffir com, milo maize, mixed grains, oat, pancake, potato, prepared, rye, spelt, wheat. Food preparations, cereal, not otherwise specifically provided for herein when subject to grain product (flour, meal, etc.) commodity rates: Grain products, not otherwise specifically provided herein when subject to grain product or grain by-product (flour, meal, etc.) commodity rates. Hominy, hominy flake, hominy pearl. Maizes. Malt, malt sprouts. Middlings. Mill feed. Grits. Groats. </seg>
            <seg id="p474">Oat feed, oat flake, oat meal. Oats, cracked, rolled. Rye, cracked, crushed, rolled. Ships tuff. Shorts. Wheat, cracked, crushed, flaked, granulated, rolled, in straight or mixed carloads, or in mixed carloads with other articles when tariffs provide that the grain, grain product or grain by-product (flour, meal, etc.) commodity rates apply on such mixture. Minimum weight 40,000 pounds per car (see Notes 1, 2, 3 and 4.) Note 1. When marked capacity of car is less than 45,000 pounds, the marked capacity, but not less than 40,000 pounds per car, will apply. Note 2. When the car is loaded to full space capacity, actual weight will apply. Note 3. Actual weight will apply upon molasses feeds or other stock feeds having liquid sweetening ingredients (not medicated or con - dimental) when cars are loaded at point of origin to within 24 inches of the roof at the side walls. Note 4- On grain and grain products handled under transit ar - rangements the minimum weight from transit point will be the same as the minimum weight into the transit point, except when a car of less capacity is furnished at transit point, in which case the minimum weight as applicable to such car of less capacity will apply, or where the ship - ment from transit point consists of grain products, the minimum weight on such grain products from transit point will be the same as provided on grain products into the transit point. Approval of this application will result in a reduction in the mini - mum weight on flour and other mill products of 12000 pounds from the present minimum, although it results in a minimum on such grain pro - ducts somewhat higher than existed prior to the war. This Commission has had various conferences with representatives of the Interstate Commerce Commission in regard to this minimum weight and certain concessions have been made by the Interstate Com - merce Commission as a result of representations by Nebraska and neighboring states as to the class of traffic most affected here. It is deemed advisable by the Commission that temporary approval of this application be issued. Between the date of this order and the date of its termination careful studies will be made as to the effect on the car - load traffic with a view to further hearing the latter part of the year. Since the interstate provisions terminate September 1, 1920, and the provisions relative to intrastate minimum weights are governed at the present moment by the provisions of the transportation act until such time as this Commission has acted, and since it is desired and highly advisable that publication of the reduced minima be made at the same time as state and interstate, it is declared that an emergency exists.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4379 In the Matter of the Application of Ne - braska Carriers for Authority to Pub - lish Minimum Weights on Grain and Grain Products. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: In August, 1920, all Nebraska carriers made application for author - ity to publish rules on minimum weights governing carload shipments &lt;n grain and grain products to conform to rules approved by the Inter - state Commerce Commission in I. C. C- special permission No. 50450, and under date of August 30, 1920, order was entered by this Commission upon that application authorizing rules and regulations in entire con - formity with those found reasonable by the Interstate Commerce Com - mission in the order designated above. The order of this Commissioi was to expire at the close of business December 31, 1920, "unless prior thereto, after proper hearing, orders in variance therewith shall have been issued." The temporary order referred to, conforming to the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, was entered after verbal consideration by this Commission with members of the Interstate Commerce Commis - sion and the minima there approved and the temporary nature of the order were agreed upon. At the time of this verbal understanding it was also agreed that before the termination of the temporary period conferences should be held, or, if deemed more advisable by the Inter - state Commerce Commission, a hearing, at which the question should be further considered in order that the Nebraska Commission and others interested might have an opportunity to discuss the reasonableness of the temporary provisions. In conformity with this understanding, the Interstate Commerce </seg>
            <seg id="p476">THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 476 Commission called a conference at St. Louis on November 15, 1920, be - tween W. V. Hardy, director of traffic, representing: the Interstate Com - merce Commission, and all state commissions who desired to attend, to which conference shippers and railroads were invited. The railroads asked for a continuation of 48,000 pounds as a minimum on grain pro - ducts. The shippers were in considerable disagreement, but in the main considered this minimum too high- Following an all day dis - cussion, conference was held between the Interstate Commerce Com - mission's representative and representatives of the various state com - missions present and rules and regulations were agreed upon to be pre - sented to the various state commissions and to the Interstate Commerce Commission for final action. The purpose of the conferences was to secure uniform rules and regulations, which, it was agreed by all, were very desirable if possible of attainment within the rule of reason. Under date of December 3, 1920, the Interstate Commerce Com - mission issued its special permission No. 51215, revising the rules and regulations in effect under temporary permission No. 50450, such re - vision being in substantial accord with the tentative agreement entered into at St. Louis. Nebraska was represented at such conference at St. rds and is in full accord with the reasonableness of the order entered the Interstate Commerce Commission. tBy the terms of the temporary order entered originally in this case, ;her action was to be taken before December 31, 1920, after proper ring. It does not appear that this hearing is essential because the terms of the order are satisfactory to most interested parties within Nebraska, as shown by their answers to questionnaires sent out by the request of the Nebraska Commission. The carriers are -entitled to a hearing in opposition to the changes proposed if this Commission issues its order in conformity with the order of the Interstate Commerce Com - mission and that opportunity will be afforded upon proper representation. The Commission will approve rules and regulations in accordance with tne St. Louis agreement and the order of the Interstate Commerce Com - mission, subject to hearing before the expiration date of the temporary order herein, if such hearing is desired. ORDER bIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway mission that all Nebraska carriers be and they hereby are author - and directed to publish, in proper supplements to their tariffs, the following rules and regulations in lieu of published rules and regulations under the temporary order of this Commission on intrastate business, tame to be effective January 1, 1921: tOS GRAIN, all kinds (except oats and ear corn, snapped corn or in the shuck), minimum weight marked capacity of car, except where red capacity is less than 60,000 pounds, in which case minimum </seg>

(b) When grain is loaded to proper grain line of cars so marked. (c) When car is loaded to full space capacity. When any of the provisions of this note are applicable, notation to that effect should be inserted in the bill of lading by shipper or agent of the carrier, but failure to make such notation shall not prevent the ap - plication of the terms of this note upon presentation of suitable proof. Such notations should be specific, indicating on which of the three grounds herein specified, actual weights should be protected. Note 3. When grain in transit is, for causes beyond the control of shipper or owner, transferred from one car to another of greater capacity (either direct or through elevators), the minimum weight applicable to the car from which transfer is made shall apply to the car into which the shipment is transferred. Note 4. When carrier cannot furnish car of capacity ordered by ship - per and for its own convenience furnishes a car of greater capacity than the one ordered, such car may be used on the basis of the minimum weight applicable to the car ordered by shipper, but in no case less than actual weight; the capacity of car ordered, number and date of the order to be shown in each instance upon the bill of lading and carrier's waybill. When actual weight is more than 10 per cent in excess of the marked capacity of the car ordered by shipper, the minimum weight shall be that applicable to the car in general service the capacity of which is next greater than the capacity of car ordered. When shipper orders a car of marked capacity less than 60,000 pounds and carrier furnishes a car of greater capacity, the minimum weight shall be 60,000 pounds but not greater than the marked capacity of car furnished.

            <seg id="p479">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 479 APPLICATION NO. 4383 In the Matter of the Application of the IMatte Valley Power Company of Ne - braska for Authority to Issue Stock. OPINION AND FINDING HALL, Commissioner: This matter came on for hearing October 2, 1920, and was then con - tinued to October 9, when the hearing was concluded. There are two Platte Valley Power companies. One is a Dela - ware corporation, which was organized and now owns and operates cer - tain transmission lines in Douglas and Saunders counties, and electric distribution systems in Mead, Yutan, Valley, Arlington, Waterloo, Elk - horn, and Bennington. It derives its power from its plant at Arling - ton, its plant at Valley, and by purchase from the Nebraska Power Com - pany. By reason of the expensive operation of the different power plants and the purchasing of current from the Nebraska Power Company, the company has become practically insolvent. The other company is a new corporation, known as the Platte Valley Power company of Ne - braska. This corporation is the applicant herein. The Platte Valley Power company of Nebraska proposes to con - struct certain connecting transmission lines and two sub-stations. The main connecting transmission line is to extend from Valley straight north to Arlington, where a sub-station is proposed to be installed. The other is a connecting line from the Nebraska Power company's lines at a point just south of Irvington. The latter connecting line will be approximately five miles in length. The new company pro - poses to take over all of the properties and facilities of the Delaware corporation and purchase its power from the Nebraska Power com - pany, thereby reducing the cost of operation of the entire system. In order to build a sub-station near Benson and another near Ar - lington, and for the purpose of erecting the connecting transmission lines, the company applies for authority to sell $70,000 of stock. The applicant company has also filed with the Commission a contract be - tween the two companies, by the terms of which the new company is to take over the properties of the Delaware corporation at a valua - tion to be determined by the Railway Commission. It then proposes to apply to the Commission to issue additional stock for the purpose of taking over these properties. The new corporation has filed with the Commission exhibits con - taining detailed inventories of the materials it proposes to use and the cost of labor for installation. Applicant represents that the ac - tual cost of labor and material will amount to something over $46, - 000; the balance of the $70,000 is made up of cost of financing, engin- </seg>

It is im - possible to determine definitely what the actual cost of labor and ma - terials will be on account of their varying prices, and also from the fact that it is impossible to determine in advance just what items of property will be required. It is entirely possible and practicable for the company to show to the Commission the exact cost of all materials and labor of installing the same as the work progresses. The Commission is therefore of the opinion that authority should not be granted for the sale of more than $50,000 of securities at the present time, and in any event, not more than the actual cost of labor and materials expended in the construction of the properties, and that the $50,000 should be authorised only because of the fact that the work should be prosecuted without delay. Authority for the sale of a max - imum of $50,000 will therefore be granted, subject to the conditions named in the order herein. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE CONSIDERED AND ORDERED and author - ity is hereby granted to the Platte Valley Power company of Nebraska to issue and sell not more than $50,000 of common stock at par, but in in any event not more than the actual cost of labor and materials ex - pended in the construction of the properties, the proceeds of which are to be invested in labor and materials used in constructing the prop - erties, as shown by the application on file with the Commission subject to the following conditions: 1. That the company shall make a detailed report to the Commis - sion of moneys expended for labor and materials whenever such ex - penditures amount to $5,000 and shall make such report for each $5,000 spent as the work progresses. 2. That the company shall take immediate steps to take over all the properties of the Platte Valley Power company of Delaware and shall make a detailed inventory and valuation of the same and file it with the Commission. 3. That none of the proceeds of the securities herein authorized to be issued shall be invested in any of the properties of the Platte Valley Power company of Delaware, nor shall any of such proceeds be expended in liquidating any of the outstanding liabilities of the Platte Valley Power company of Delaware. 4.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4391 In the Matter of the Application of AH Railroad Companies Operating in Ne - braska for Authority to Publish Re - consigning Rules to Govern All Traf - fic Transported in Open Cars and Coal and Coke in All Cars. OPINION AND FINDING HALL, Commissioner: The matter herein came on for hearing October 19, 1920. F. Mont - morency, general freight agent of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company, appeared for all railroads. The Lincoln Chamber of Commerce was represented by John J. Ledwith, attorney, W. S. Whitten, secretary, and Peter Gilbertson. The Omaha Chamber of Commerce was represented by C. E. Childe, commissioner; Nebraska Mineral Aggregate association by C. E. Walsh, secretary; National Stone company Jt&gt;y Thos. Sullivan, secretary; Lyman-Richey Sand com - pany by E. H. Palmquist; National Supply company, Lincoln, by R. W. Smiley; Nebraska Material company, Lincoln, by J. H. Allen; Western Brick &amp; Supply company, Lincoln, by J. H. Johnson; and Whitebreast Coal &amp; Lumber company, Lincoln, by W. Edgar Gates, treasurer. The proposed rules governing the reconsignment of all freight in open top cars and coal and coke in all cars are es follows: "Only one reconsignment will be permitted, namely: "1. If reconsignment order is receiv&lt;Hl in time to permit instructions to be given to yard employees prior to arrival of shipment at billed destination or if such billed destination is served by a terminal yard then prior to arrival at the terminal yard a charge of $2.00 per car will be made for this service. "2. When not reconsigned as above any order for reconsignment, diversion or reshipment will subject the freight traffic to the sum of local rates to and from points of reconsignment plus $6.00 per car. Mr. Montmorency stated that the purpose of the application was to bring about uniformity in reconsignment rules, and that as the In - terstate Commerce Commission had authorized the rules as applied for in this application and that several other states had likewise author- </seg>
            <seg id="p482">482 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT ixed such rules, he thought it proper for the Nebraska State Railway Commission to also authorize the rules. He stated that the under - lying purpose was conservation of equipment. He stated that the rule in effect today on interstate traffic has a tendency to discourage the reconsigmment of commodities owing to the increased transportation charge involved. On page 4 of the transcript he said: "There is no difference in the physical handling of the car to be reconsigned. The only thing is, with this rule in effect the reconsign - ment of these commodities is discouraged — too expensive." On page 5, question by Commissioner Hall: "Q. Dont you propose to produce any testimony as to the proposed new rules other than other states have put them in and the Interstate Commerce Commission has also authorized the rules? "A. No, sir, I have no testimony to offer. "Q. Well, if the Commission were to authorize the rules would you say we were to simply authorize the rules because the Interstate Com - merce Commission had and that certain states had also authorized the rules? "A. Well, if you care to do so. "Q. Well, is that your idea? "A. I have no testimony to offer here as to the details of the emergency that required this provision as to "Q. Well, what finding of fact do you expect the Commission to make? "A. All they will have to do will be to authorize the rule. "Q. Because the Interstate Commerce Commission did? "A. Well, I wouldn't care to make that as the controlling factor; of course, the fact that the Interstate Commerce Commission did authorize the rule after consideration of the matter and that the other states mentioned have adopted the rule." ••*•»* Page 6, question by Commissioner Hall: "Q. Well, dont you propose to introduce any testimony upon which the Commission could make a finding of fact and make its deductions as to the necessity of the authorizing of the rules asked for? "A. No, sir, we have no witnesses and I have no facts in shape to present as evidence. We have frequently obtained authority from the Commission to publish rates and rules without formal hearing, particu - larly where they involve reduction. There isn't any question about re - duction, so it seems to me as far as the Commission being in a position to pass on the question they can pass on it without the introduction of testimony by the carriers-" Thereupon Mr. Ledwith, representing the Lincoln Chamber of Commerce, asked to have the case dismissed for want of evidence to sustain the application. After consultation the respondents refused to irtroduce any testimony in the case. The Commission is of the opin - ion that the motion to dismiss should be sustained. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE CONSIDERED AND ORDERED that the ap - plication herein be and the same is hereby dismissed. </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4402 In the Matter of the Application of the Cozad Ditch Company for Authority to Issue and Sell Securities. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: Applicant company, comprising the owners of water rights on an irrigation project now existent in the neighborhood of Cozad, Nebras - ka, asks authority of this Ccmmission to issue and sell $30,000 of bonds and $150,000 of stock for the purpose of financing. This irrigation project was owned by a foreign coiporalion until some time during the present year, when it was purchased by those owning water rights under the ditch fur $10,000. It is proposed to issue and sell bonds, chiefly to those interested, in amount of the pur - chase price, and to issue and sell un additional $20,000 of bonds for improvements and extensions. It is also proposed to issue stock to the present owners of water rights, said stock to be of the par value of $15.00 per share, one share to be issued for each acre of land on which present water rights are owned. It is further proposed to sell additional water rights at $15.00 per acre and to issue one share of stock for each acre thus sold. The articles of incorporation provide that the stock thus issued shall be inseparable from the water right and shall pass with it. The water right itself is appurtenant to the land covered by it. No per - son, according to the articles, can own or vote a share of stock who is not the owner of a corresponding water right for an acre of land under the irrigation project in question. The articles also provide that none of the moneys collected under the annual charges foi maintenance shall be used in any degree to pay dividends on stock, but that if any dividends are paid on the stock they must come out of such surpluses as may be secured from the sale of additional water rights on land under the appropriation. The Commission is not in a position to say that the value of the physical property is represented by the purchase price. In fact, data in possession of the Commission would indicate that the present owners bought the property at a low figure. It cannot, however, be stated </seg>
            <seg id="p484">484 that a share of stock proposed to be issued in the sum of $15 for each acre on which water right is owned, represents $15 of value. Clearly it does not represent such value in. physical property. Whether or not any substantial value at all would exist in the proposed stock would depend entirely on the future development of the project and on the sale of additional water rights. It is quite clear to us that, under the decisions of the supreme court of this state (Pauline Burtless v. Mc- Cook Irrigation Co.), the disposition of moneys received from sale of additional water rights is not within the jurisdiction of the Commission. Very evidently, if sales of water rights continue and the bonds are paid off from such source, and if additional funds derived from sales of water rights are used for dividends, the time will come when no more water rights will be sold and the only value back of the stock will be the physical property then existing. Inasmuch as revenue from sales of water rights will then have been cut off and the company is forbidden to use any funds derived from maintenance for dividend purposes, the payment of dividends on any outstanding stock will cease and the value of such stock will be correspondingly reduced. This is well understood by the organizers of the company, who have indicated clearly that their chief purpose in issuing the stock is an equitable distribution of the voting power rather than a basis for profit-taking. The Commission informally refused to consider the pro - posal set forth in the articles of incorporation unless the public was properly protected in the matter of transfers of stock of uncertain value. For that reason the articles have been so drawn as to tie the stock up with the water rights and the land to which they are appurte - nant. In our opinion, this plan fully protects the users of the water from paying undue maintenance charges in order to derive dividends on stock which has a questionable value. The Commission sees no necessity at this time for approving the issue of the full amount of the capital stock. It will approve the issue and distribution of stock in the amount of one share for each of the 4044 acres on which water rights are now existent, and will approve an additional amount of stock to be held in the treasury and disposed of from time to time as additional water rights may be sold. The company will have the privilege of applying again, as conditions war - rant, for further approval of stock issues. It will be required to file proper reports with the Commission in order that it may keep in touch with the financial status of the company's affairs. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Cozad Ditch company be and it hereby is author - ized to issue and sell $30,000 of bonds in denominations of such size and dates of maturity as may, in the judgment of the company, be best suited to market conditions; provided, that such bonds shall be </seg>

Such stock shall at no time receive dividends in ex - cess of eight per cent per annum and no such dividends shall be paid from funds known as annual maintenance charges.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4406 In the Matter of the Application of the Nebraska Telephone Company for Au - thority to Make a Temporary Sur - charge for Exchange Service and to Make Certain Changes in Toll Rates.

Wolz, commissioner, C. E. Abbott, attorney, and B. McFadden. </seg>
            <seg id="p486">486 OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This applicant desires, because of temporary financial exigencies, to apply a surcharge of ten per cent on existing exchange rates for such period as will avoid the exigency. It desires also to increase the diff - erential between person to person calls and station to station calls from twenty -five to forty per cent and to increase other toll differentials accordingly. Hearing of this case was held November 4, 1920, in the offices of the Commission and summary sheets of applicant company were pre - sented, together with other exhibits, as evidence of financial difficulties now being suffered. Under order of the Commission applicant has for a considerable period filed monthly report* of the summaries of its operations and these have been at all times available so that the Com - mission was in a position to know the general trend of the company's affairv These reports show, in brief, that for the ten months ending October 31, 1920, applicant has failed to earn a seven per cent divi - dend on its outstanding stock, which dividend earning has had the ap - proval of this Commission as a result of preceding investigations, by $283,154. If the three months preceding the date mentioned are a fair criterion of the results of November and December operation, this deficit would be increased to $400,000 for the calendar year. At the present time the company has about $7,000,000 borrowed on demand notes from the parent corporation, on which it pays six per cent. It has outstanding $11,000,000 in common stock, all of which that has been issued in ten years, having received the approval of this .Commission after careful scrutiny. On this common stock it pays seven per cent It will thus be seen that the dividend requirements alone amount to $770,000 per annum. The last increases authorized by the Commission for this company were about the middle of 1919. Under the rates then temporarily al - lowed the company in January, 1920, earned its dividends and $6,000 additional. In February, it just earned its dividends. Not again during the year 1920 to date has it approached earning those dividends. During August, September and October, 1920, the net available amount for dividends was $3,690.67, whereas the dividend requirements amount - ed to $192,500 if the company was to maintain its payments of seven per cent. The trend of applicant's finances may be illustrated by the show- ing for the past six months, as follows Month Net income of Gross available for 1920 earnings dividends October 374,249 4,275.75 Hay $363,829 fune 362,713 uly 373394 August 371,063 September 367,062 $46,306.21 35,73084 38,776.26 4,251.75 4336.83 (in red) </seg>
            <seg id="p487">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 487 It will be noted that while the company earned two-thirds of its dividend requirements during the first three months named, it earned practically none of them in the next three months. It is necessary to ascertain the causes for this rapid decline of net income. The evidence showed, first, that wages increases during 1920, no* foreseen when the Commission acted in July, 1919, amounted to $95,700 per annum for operators alone. Other increases were granted to plant employes. The company's showing in August was $34,500 worse than it wms in July. The books show the following reasons: earnings fell off $2,800 gross; expense of operation increased $13,500 in August; taxes were adjusted to a basis $16,000 per month higher in August than in July; miscellaneous earnings were reduced $1,000. The increase in expense of operating was caused by $11,000 expense added to traffic, most of which is in the pay of operators. Commercial expense increased $2,200, this also largely being labor items. There was no increase in general salaries or miscellaneous expenses. It should be pointed out that the relationship between the first three months and the second three months in the tabulation above rather does an injustice to the latter period. The company had been setting aside for taxes in the early part of the year approximately $22,000 per month. On August 1, it was seen that this would not provide sufficient money to pay the taxes, and during the second three months period taxes were charged at the rate of approximately $39, - 000 per month. Obviously, part of the higher taxes in the second half of the year actually accrued during the first half of the year, but was not set up. If proper allocations had been made, the company would have earned less for dividends in May to July and more in August to October. The final result would not be different. This item of taxes is no small matter when both state and federal increases since the beginning of the war are taken into account. For instance, the taxes of this company for 1916, spread on a basis per telephone in use, amounted to $1.20 per station. In 1920, the taxes will amount to $3.39 per station. This is a tax basis of 282 Vi per cent of the pre-war rate. As a result of the rate adjustments made by the Commission in the summer of 1919 for this company, the revenues earned from ex - change service increased 12.8 cents per telephone in service. During the same period, that is, comparing 1919 for ten months, part of which was under a higher rate and part under a lower rate, with ten months of 1920, expenditures for operation increased 32.6 cents per telephone in operation. These figures do not include interest or dividends. Obviously, the trend of this company's affairs is such as to require attention and the application of remedies, and it was for that reason the application was made. Three possible alternatives to an increase </seg>
            <seg id="p488">488 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT in rates have been presented by respondents formally or informally These are: 1. Cease paying cash dividends and substitute therefor stock div idends against accumulated surplus. 2. Endure the depression and hang on until a reduction in operat - ing costs can be made effective. 3. Put into effect greater economies of operation. We will analyze these in turn. 1. Substitute stock dividends for cash dividends. The net assets of this company, as per its books, amount, at this time, to $20,487,863. Of this amount it alleges its accumulated surplus is $1,315,496.55. This surplus is not capitalized, but is invested in the property. The com - pany claims that in law it is entitled to all of the surplus to use as it sees fit and that even in equity the stockholders are entitled to it. It is alleged that it has for many years borrowed large quantities of money, due to its connection with the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph company, at four per cent per annum, when it would have been imposs - ible to borrow the same money otherwise at so low a rate. It is alleged also that it had during the stage of development, when the future tele - phone industry was uncertain and precarious, confined itself to six per cent dividends and had invested the small surplus and accumulations earned above that amount, whereas they were actually due the stock - holders as a reasonable return. The Commission does not feel called upon to pass upon whether these contentions are true. We do net know whether the surplus as shown on the books is actual surplus or properly belongs in deprecia - tion reserve. We do not pass either on the law or the equity of the questions raised. The surplus is invested. It is now being used in the interest of the public. What it earns helps pay the dividends on the remainder of the property. No dividends are paid on this sur - plus and none are threatened. In actual effect, it is the same as if the property were dedicated to the public. There is no question that such a surplus as a margin of safety has a happy effect on the mar - ket when the company seeks funds for additional development, which it is constantly doing, and that the lower rates, which must result from the existence of such a surplus, are directly beneficial to the tele - phone-using public in the exchange charges assessed. In November, 1919, the books surplus amounted to $1,800,000 in round numbers. It has decreased one-half million dollars under the operations of 1920, and, for the reasons given above, the Commission does not believe that, save in the gravest emergency, this book surplus should be called upon in any greater degree. 2. Await more favorable market conditions and reduction in costs. </seg>
            <seg id="p489">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 489 Whether such a remedy is available at all depends upon the immi - nence of such shrinking: of costs as to materials and labor. In the summer of 1918 this applicant appeared before the Commission and asked for a twenty per cent increase in telephone rates because of the rapidly increasing costs of operations. The Commission agreed that the situation was serious, but argued that it mdst be a very temporary - peak which would soon pass away. On this argument it granted a ten per cent increase in rates. How accurate was the forecast of the fu - ture then made is now a matter of history. Rendered more cautious by its failure in the prophetic field, the Commission has since content - ed itself by extending the higher rates for temporary periods, pre - ferring thus to treat with the future. All rates of this applicant over and above those existing before the war are on a temporary permit basis. The Commission does not at this time desire again to venture into the realm of prophesy far enough to say just when effective re - ductions in the costs of labor and materials will be reached. Had this company, and other regulated industry, enjoyed large earnings during the period of advancing prices, unusual or war-time dividends, or the creation of considerable surpluses out of earnings dur - ing the period of soaring prices, it might now be required, with justice, to meet the period of depression with fortitude and to write out its losses from these unusual surpluses earned. But such was not the experience of public utilities under the jurisdiction of this Commission. They were not allowed to advance their charges in keeping with other business and this period, when most industry was riding the top of the wave of prosperity, found the regulated utilities more closely pressed in their finances than under normal conditions. This particular ap - plicant has a smaller surplus by one-third of a million than it had when war-time prices first came int* evidence. 3. Further economics in operations. This must soon be the watchword in most industries which, during the war, have permitted operating expenses to reach very great heights. It is a good .slogan. In actual operation, this Commission does not know where it would direct the application of the pruning hook to the expenditures of the applicant company without at the same time seriously affecting the service adversely. The very fact that regulation during the war was so close has made necessary in this industry the practice of unusual economics as compared with other business. Wage increases have been laggard in comparison with other business. Expansion and unusual repairs have been avoided wherever possible in order to keep down operating costs. That such a policy has been successful can be readily shown from comparative accounts on file with the Commission, as well as from exhibits filed by the applicant. Exchange earnings, which excludes toll earnings, increased between 1916 and October, 1920, 24.3 per cent, measured by the earnings of </seg>
            <seg id="p490">490 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT i I the average telephone in service. Current maintenance, which is very largely a labor item, increased 34.1 per cent in the same time and had to be paid out of earnings. Traffic expenses, of which more than eighty per cent is the wages of operators, increased 98.2 per cent per station in service. Commercial expenses, which include clerical help, bookkeeper, and office expense, increased 73 per cent in the same period. All of these were largely labor items and all had to be secured from the increases in revenues, which, as stated, amounted to 24.3 per cent from telephone exchange service. Fortunately toll earnings increased 42.2 per cent, which was to a large extent due to very heavy volume of traffic. The actual increase in dollars and cent? to the patron for a given service was only about 21 per cent over pre-war rates. The total revenues, measured by one phone in service so as to eliminate increase of revenues due to growth, increased 32.4 per cent, toll and exchange revenues combined. The total expenses, before in - terest, taxes and dividends were taken out, increased 51.7 per cent. These figures will plainly indicate why the war-time period has had a different effect upon this public utility than on average private in - dustry and why it is not now possible to say that the remedy is either to endure the depression until costs are reduced or to follow the prac - tice of still greater economies. The instant application is for a temporary increase of exchange rates by ten per cent, this increase to appear separately on the bills Tendered so as to indicate its temporary nature. The average revenue from exchange service during the ten months of 1920 for this appli - cant was $257,224 per month. Ten per cent applied to this would in - crease the monthly revenue $25,722. If reasonable growth is enjoyed, the total increases under the surcharge would be somewhat above the figure named. No one is able at this time to state whether such growth will occur. It is evident that if conditions as they have existed since August are to continue additional revenue received from the ten per cent surcharge will only party offset the deficit. There are reasons to believe that this would be the most unfavorable view possi - ble to take and that conditions during the next six months will un - doubtedly improve. The surcharge will be approved for a period end - ing July 1, 1921. at which time it will automatically terminate unless other action is taken before that date. The surcharge will be applied to the temporary rates authorized by the Commission in supplement No. 4, Application No. 3696, effective January 1, 1920, and terminating December 31, 1920. Those temporary rates will also be extended by appropriate action in that matter. Applicant has asked for certain modification for toll rates and a spread in differentials under which the maximum earnings additional to present earnings would be $95,000 per </seg>
            <seg id="p491">491 annum and a minimum very considerably below that amount. The Commission will deal with that phase of the application in a supple - mental order. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Nebraska Telephone company be and it hereby is authorized, effective December 1, 1920, an emergency existing, to charge and collect ten per cent additional on all bills for exchange ser - vice over and above the rates now on file with the Commission ana in effect. This additional ten per cent shall appear on all bills rendered as a separate item, to be known as "surcharge." IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this order making this addition - al exchange rate charge shall remain in effect until the close of busi - ness June 30, 1921, at which time it shall automatically terminate un - less preceding that date other authorization is made.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO.4411 In the Matter of the Application of The Lincoln Traction Company for Auth - ority to Charge and Collect Increased Fare and to Increase Its Allowance for Maintenance and Depreciation. APPEARANCES: For Applicant— L. A. Ricketts, F. M. Hall, and V. E. Wilson, attor neys. For City of Lincoln — C. Petrus Peterson, attorney. For City of Havelock— H. E. Rush, attorney. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Chairman: Faced with another crisis in its financial affairs, The Lincoln Trac - tion company has applied to this Commission for further emergency relief in the form of increased fares. It proposes a base fare for the first zone of eight cents, or four fares or thirty cent*, and a base rate </seg>
            <seg id="p492">492 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT of ten cents to the suburbs. In addition, it would make a charge of five cents for all transfers and increase the rate to school children from seven for twenty-five cents to straight five cents. The present rates, which became effective July 23, 1920, are seven cents in the city zone, or three fares for twenty cents, with one cent additional to the sub- urbs. There is now no charge for transfers. This is the third application of the company for emergency relief since December, 1918, and, as in the two former cases, involves no question of stock issue or of valuation for permanent rates. The material allegations upon which applicant bases its request for relief are as follows: That the allowance of 7.2 per cent on the valuation of the depreciable property for maintenance and depreciation is in - adequate, that the actual expenditures for this purpose are in excess of this allowance, and that the allowance should be at least nine per cent; that the statement of operating revenues and expenses for the first eight months of 1920 shows that an actual deficit during that per - iod has been incurred of $31,254.32, based on the allowance of 7.2 per cent for maintenance and depreciation, but that if the actual expendi - tures for this purpose are included the deficit would aggregate approxi - mately $01,000; that there has been a falling off of passengers carried in the first eight months of 1920, as compared with the corresponding months of 1919, of approximately six per cent, which loss is entirely due to the increased use of automobiles; that since the filing of the various emergency applications there have been marked increases in the costs of such transportation, particularly in fuel. A hearing, last - ing two days, was had on November 5 and 6. Protests were filed b&gt; the city of Lincoln and the city of Havelock and these municipalities were represented by counsel. The present predicament of applicant is chargeable directly to two causes; first, to an unfaltering advance in its cost of operation; and second, to a substantial decrease in the number of passengers carried. In view of the rather urgent request for rate advance and the doubts entertained in many quarters as to their necessity, it is desirable at this point to discuss the extent of the mounting costs and compare the present situation with that prevailing in the so-called normal years. As bearing on this point, applicant submits exhibits covering the reve - nues and expenses for a period of years, from 1913 to 1920 inclusive. Selecting 1913 as a normal year, it is shown that the total operating expenses of the railway, heat and light plants have increased 101 per cent during the period. The revenues during the same period of years have increased but sixty-four per cent. The showing for 1920 is based on nine months' actual experience, combined with an estimate for the last three months. Expressed in dollars, the figures are as follows: mating expenses, 1913 $ 541,207.08 (rating expenses, 1920 1,093,340.19 srating revenue*, 1913 ; $ 736,005.74 (rating revenues, 1920 1,211,290.95 </seg>
            <seg id="p493">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 493 It will be observed that the ratio of operating expenses to the revenues has increased from seventy-four per cent in 1913 to ninety per cent in 1920. This sharp upward trend of operating costs is even more strikingly illustrated if we reduce them to a per passenger basis; that is, divide the total expense of operation of all departments by the total number of passengers carried. On this basis the cost per passenger in 1916, which was the last year before the abnormal price advance began, Ml 4.215 cents. In 1920, the cost per passenger was 7.789 cents. A like comparison with 1913 would disclose a still more striking disparity. The increase over 1916, it will be noted, is 84.8 per cent. The reve - nue per passenger in 1916 was 6.55 cents as against 10.5 cents in 1920, or an increase of only sixty per cent. The figures used cover expenses and revenues of the railway, light and heat departments and are not intended to represent the actual cost of transporting each passenger, being used merely for purposes of comparison. It is important to observe, however, • that the expenses include nothing for interest or dividends, the inclusion of which in 1920 would bring the cost to 10.6 cents per passenger. Two of the outstanding factors in this remarkable increase in operating cost are found in labor and fuel. Since August 1, 1919, the amount paid in wages has increased over $94,000 per year. In 1915, the average price paid by applicant for coal was $2.87 per ton. The average price paid in 1920 has been $5.63, while the price sine? Augurt of this year has been above $6.00, reaching an average of $6.77 for October. This represents an added charge against earnings of approx - imately $100,000 annually. These ascending costs have occurred despite substantial economies effected by the company. The installation of one-man cars has permitted the reduction of the force of trainmen by fifty, while the consumption of current and the cost of maintenance through the use of these cars have likewise been reduced. Other economies of a lesser extent have been brought about. Much of the record in this case is devoted to a discussion of the causes of the falling off in the number of passenger riders during the past year. At the hearing on the last emergency application in May, it was estimated by Witness Powell, for applicant, that the passenger traffic would fall off for the year an average of five per cent. The actual decrease has been approximately seven per cent for the year. For the last four months of the year it may reach eight per cent. This is a reduction in the traffic as compared to the year 1919. Anticipat - ing the objection that a further increase in fare would result in a still greater falling off in traffic, and thus fail as a remedy for the present condition, applicant submitted an exhibit in which an analysis of the traffic is made by lines, the purpose of which is to show, first, </seg>
            <seg id="p494">494 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT that the reduction in traffic took place not among short distance riders, but among those riding the long distances, and second, that the great - est reduction is in the south and southeast sections of the city where the effect of automobile competition is much more pronounced. The analysis does show that for some reason here has been a greater re - duction on the long lines than on the so-called short lines. It also shows a larger falling off in traffic on the lines south of O street than on the lines north. While this study of the traffic indicates that the short line rider has not been as greatly influenced by increased rates as the long line rider, and while the reduction in the traffic on the short lines in south and southeast Lincoln indicates that the automobile has been a large factor in the reduction, the figures are not necessarily con - clusive on this point. The analysis is valuable, however, as supporting the theory that the automobile is responsible to a considerable degree for the reduction in street railway riding in Lincoln. It is vigorously urged by many that it is impossible to operate a street railway system in any community, and more particularly in Lin - coln, without making rate concessions to the patrons living within walking distance of the business section, and it is usually assumed that this distance is from one to one and one-half miles. This point is em - phasized by counsel for the city of Lincoln, who contends "that in order to regain the lost patronage of the short rider, a reduced rate must be had for the first zone." No estimate is made by counsel as to how much patronage of this nature has been lost, nor does he venture an estimate as to how much could or would have to be secured in order to meet the exigencies of the present situation. Conceding for the moment that the time-honored fare of five cents ought to be made effective in the so-called walking zone, and that it would result in a substantial increase in traffic, let us consider briefly how substantial that increase should be in order to produce the revenue imperatively required by applicant if it is to continue to operate. The number of passengers carried in 1920 will be approximately 11,500,000, excluding riders on transfers. No studies have ever been made to determine what proportion of the company's traffic is handled in the first zone. If we assume this zone to extend one and one-half miles from the business section, and assume further that fifty per cent of the riders are within this limit, the number of short riders would thus ag - gregate 5,750,000 for the year. Assuming an average fare of eight cents to and from the suburban area, how many more riders would have to be tempted by the five cent rate to stop walking and start riding? The operating expense for 1920, exclusive of interest and preferred stock dividends, based on the actual experience for ten months, was $894,000. If there was an increase of ten per cent in five cent riders, there would be 6,325,000 riders within the first zone, which traffic would produce a revenue of $316,250. Assuming 5,750,000 passengers at eight cents, would produce revenue to the amount of $460,000, making a total of $776,250 This is $117,750 less than the actual money required to </seg>
            <seg id="p495">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 495 pay the direct operating expenses. An increase of twenty per cent in short riders would result in a total revenue of $805,000, while an increase of fifty per cent would result in total passenger earnings of only $891, - 250, which is still short of the necessary expenses. It would take an increase in this class of riders of over fifty-one per cent to produce the required revenue, assuming the other traffic to remain constant. It has never been claimed by even the most hopeful contenders for this theory that a five cent fare would stimulate short haul traffic to any such degree. The largest traffic ever handled by applicant was in 1915, when the number of passengers reached 12,996,254. The total would have to go to 14,430,000 on the basis of a fifty-one per cent increase in the first zone. It should be borne constantly in mind that no allow - ance for interest or dividends on preferred stock is accounted for in these figures, which if taken into consideration, would very materially swell the totals. It is highly significant in this connection, as measur - ing the extent of the revolution that has occurred in operating condi - tions, that it would require the transportation of 17,880,000 passengers at five cents to produce sufficient revenue to pay the direct operating expenses. To pay interest and preferred stock dividends in addition thereto would require the handling of a total of 20,664,860 passengers. This is almost double the number now carried and is fifty per cent greater than the traffic in the company's banner year, when fares were six for twenty-five cents. The figures used to determine the effect of a lower fare in the walking zone are, of course, subject to the criticism that they are based on certain assumption as to the extent of that zone and as to the relative proportion of the total traffic within it. The results would also be somewhat changed if the rate to the outer zone were increased to ten cents. But no matter what readjustment might result from an ascertainment of the actual facts and the application of somewhat different fares, it is manifest that the reduction to a five cent basis under present conditions is impossible and would only result in dis - aster to the company. The increased charge for transportation un - doubtedly has its effect on the number of passengers riding, but it is a futile remedy with which to cure the disease by applying a rate which is materially less than the actual cost to the company of carrying the passenger- Increased traffic under such a condition would only in - crease the company's deficit. The effect of these conditions upon the finances of the company is partially shown in the following statement of revenues and expenses of all the departments for 1920, as submitted by applicant: 12 Mo. Jan. 1, 1920 to Dec. 31, 1920 REVENUES: Railway * 789,511.40 </seg>

The actual figures for October are less favorable to the company, both as to revenues and expenses, than the estimate contained in the above table. For example, the number of passengers for the month was estimated at 984,000, whereas the ac- tual traffic amounted to 914,965, a decrease of practically 70,000. Rev- enue from steam heat, estimated on the same basis as to quantity, as for the season of 1919, will be materially less because of the unusually mild weather, the shrinkage probably being from $3,500 to $5,000. It is safe to assume that the gross revenue in the statement is over- stated by at least $10,000 and that the deficit will thus be close to $31,000. The statement for the month of October discloses a deficit of $5,452.24- A summary for the ten months including October shows a deficit for the period of $36,048.52. Based on the October experience, the deficit would reach $65,000 for the year, while on the ten months record it would be about $43,000. Applicant's estimate of revenues for the last three months of 1920, as contained in the operating state- ment, anticipated certain increased earnings, which it is manifest will not be fully realized and which explains the increased deficits as shown by the figures for October and for the ten months including October. In the foregoing statement an allowance of 7.2 per cent of the depreciable property has been charged against earnings for mainte- nance and depreciation. The actual expenditures of the company for the year will exceed the amount thus set aside by about $30,000. Ap- plicant offers this as conclusive proof that the allowance of 7.2 per cent is inadequate and that it should be increased to not less than nine per cent. It should be stated here that the depreciation reserve at the end of the year will show a deficit of approximately $42,000- The expenditures in excess of the allowance do not necessarily indicate that it should be increased. It is intended to be an average figure covering the life of the property and the actual cost in any one year for maintenance and replacements may very properly exceed the al- </seg>
            <seg id="p497">497 lowance for that year. There have been heavy retirements this year, particularly of cars. Twenty-four cars have been retired and replaced by the Birney one-man cars. There have also been heavy charges against the reserve because of paving and track changes. The inabil - ity of the company to finance any additions and betterments makes the problem much more difficult. It has been the practice of the com - pany, with the approval of the Commission, to charge the difference between the original cost of a unit of plant and its replacement co3t to the depreciation reserve. A physical valuation of property thus constructed would naturally include such amounts, notwithstanding they have been paid for out of operating expenses. In answer to an ob - jection made on this point, counsel for applicant submitted a stipula - tion, which is as follows: Page 53, record. "MR. WILSON: — If the Commission please, we are willing to state for the record the position of the company on any increase of value in the property by reason of expenditures from the depreciation reserve, and the position is this, — that the company does not expect or ask a return upon the value added to the property by reason of the difference in cost of replacements above the original cost of the property displaced. Q. (By MR. BROWNE) And on that basis you will proceed in the permanent case? A. Yes, sir, that is the position of the company. As stated in the last emergency order issued by this Commission, we have under consideration what constitutes a proper charge for main - tenance and depreciation and what is the proper method of making charges against a reserve fund- It is not intended at this time to reach any conclusion upon that question and the stipulation entered into by the company safeguards any decision that may ultimately be reached concerning it- We are of the opinion, however, that the exi - gencies of this company require an increased allowance for maintenance and depreciation, although we are also of the opinion that eight per cent would be sufficient, and that allowance will be approved- This will add approximately $18,000 per year to the operating expenses and would increase the deficit, heretofore referred to, to about $50,000. Counsel for the city of Lincoln asserts that the financial difficulties of applicant is due, not to a shortage in rate, but to a lack of capital, and bases this conclusion on the fact that the control of the company is vested in the common stock, which, it is asserted, represents nothing but "blue sky." The current indebtedness of applicant has now reached the sum of $573,497.59. One hundred eighty-seven thousand, five hundred dollars of this amount is represented by notes for one year held by certain stockholders who advanced this money for the purpose of assisting in retiring $250,000 of first mortgage bonds of the company, due January 1, 1920. These notes become due January 5, 1921. The remaining indebtedness covers current accounts and bills payable, which have accumulated because of the company's inability to meet its obligations. No payment has been made of preferred divi - dends for three years, so that there is now owing the preferred stock- </seg>
            <seg id="p498">498 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT holders $208,000. This is in addition to the indebtedness above referred to. During the three years, approximately $80,000 has been earned by the company for preferred stock dividends, but its circumstances have been such during all that period that this money had to be put into imperative additions and improvements in the property. Under such circumstances, if the company had a financial record that was unimpeachable, it could not now sell, nor could it at any time during the past three years have sold new securities- Sensible investors will not buy stock that pays no dividends. Nor is applicant able to respond Ei suggestion that it should bear with present conditions for the being in view of the prospective decline in all prices- Unlike rial and commercial institutions, this utility has not been per - mitted to build up any surplus. While private concerns have been accumulating a substantial reserve to protect themselves against de - clining prices, in addition to paying liberal dividends in the meantime, this company has been accumulating a deficit, even though it has re - quired its preferred stockholders to do without a return on their in - vestment- Under these circumstances, it is in no position to hang on until times improve- In other words, it faces an emergency as acute as any that has confronted it during recent years. As we have shown, applicant faces a deficit of at least $50,000 for 1920- It is estimated that the increase of the base rate to eight cents, with four fares for thirty cents, and two cents additional to the sub - urbs, will produce added revenue in the amount of $50,000. This assumes a continued decrease in traffic of six per cent. The increase in school children's tickets from seven for twenty-five cents to five cents will produce approximately $2,000 per year. Applicant asks authority to apply a charge of five cents for transfers. Under the above estimate, however, its revenue will be sufficient to meet its ex - penses and provide dividends on its preferred stock, which is all that is asked for in this case. The record indicates that the added revenue to be derived from a charge for transfers is not required at this time. It is estimated that this would produce approximately $45,000. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Lincoln Traction company be and the same is hereby authorized and directed to establish the fol - lowing fares for the transportation of passengers on its lines of street railway: 1. Eight cents cash, or one token, for the transportation of eac*h adult passenger, with the following exceptions: ten cents cash, or one token plus two cents, between Lincoln and Havelock, Lincoln and Uni - versity Place, Lincoln and Bethany, Lincoln and Normal, Lincoln and College View; between Havelock and Bethany, Havelock and Normal, Havelock and College View; between University Place and Bethany, University Place and Normal, University Place and College View; be- </seg>

Four tokens for transportation of adults shall be sold, on all cars operated, for thirty cents. They may also be sold at other places if applicant so desires. 3. Five cents for the transportation of school children for use within the city of Lincoln. 4. No dividends shall be paid on the common stock of applicant company while this order is in force, nor from the revenues of the company earned while this order is in force. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant be authorized to in - crease its allowance for maintenance and depreciation from 7-2 per cent of its depreciable property to eight per cent of its depreciable proper - ty, provided that its books and accounts be so kept as to show clearly the difference in the cost of property replaced between the original cost of such property and its replacement cost. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, that, there being an emergency for the making of this order, it will become effective December 5, 1920, and shall continue in effect until July 1, 1921.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 4474 In the Matter of the Application of the Lake Water Carrying Company for Authority to Issue and Sell Securi - ties. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: Applicant company is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Nebraska, with headquarters at Lewellen, Nebraska, with ap - proximately thirty stockholders and organizers in the immediate locali - ty, the purpose of said organization being to "acquire water rights, develop and store water, own and operate storage and distribution works for water for irrigation, power and domestic uses, selling and conveying water and using water for irrigation and power purposes" The history of this enterprise is in brief as follows: Blue Creek, </seg>
            <seg id="p500">500 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT a tributary of the North Platte river, rises in the northern part of Garden county and empties into the Platte at or near Lewe'.len. On this stream are five irrigation projects, all organized as irrigation dis - tricts under the laws of the state, and all at present going concerns. Approximately ten thousand acres of land are under the appropriation of water by these five districts. There is an insufficient supply of water in Blue Creek in the dry seasons of the &gt;?car for all the projects. Priority use deprives two districts of so much water that the land can hardly be called irrigated land. A third project secures only a por - tion of the needed water; the two oldest districts secure approximately their requirements. Owners of land under these districts have inter - ested themselves in securing a larger supply of water. In the northern part of Garden county lies Crescent or Beaver lake. It is the south, lake of a series of twenty or more lakes lying in a northwesterly direction from Beaver lake. Beaver lake has no sur - face outlet. Some of the lak)?s are connected with surface openings and some are apparently fed through the sands. The theory of geolo - gists is that the lakes are all fed in a subterranean manner from Snake river, lying wlell to the northwest of the chain of lakes, and which dis - appears in the sand. The project of this corporation is to dig a canal from Crescent lake a distance of one and three-fourths miles to the headwaters of Blue Creek, to construct ample headgates at Crescent lake, and to con - duct the water of that natural storage reservoir into Blue Creek in sufficient quantities to supply the needed water for irrigation below. It is proposed by the corporation to sell the water to the irrigation dis - tricts at a price of $50-00 per second foot, or at slightly more than sev- 6 cents per acre per annum, and to charge an additional amount • additional water in emergencies is purchased- The price at water should be sold falls under the jurisdiction of the Com - &gt;n and must be treated in a different application. The applicant is a common carrier under the laws of this state and makes application for authority to issue stock in the amount of $25,000 in shares par value of $10-00 each with which to finance the project. The headgates have already been built by money advanced by the incorporators, and a portion of the ditch, which it twelve feet wide on the bottom, has already been constructed. It is now found necessary before completing the financing of the work to issue and sell stock to those who have already advanced money and to others who stand ready to invest. The necessary appropriation of water has been secured from the state and two years time has been granted in which t complete the work. The items set forth in the application making the total cost are as follows: Building and construction of irrigation canal twelve feet wide on bottom and one and three-fourths miles long, 30,000 cubic yards dirt $7,600.00 </seg>

OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: This applicant desirfcs to change its owl car fare from a ten cent fare to a fifteen cent fare, said rate to be, charged between the hours of twelve o'clock midnight and six a. m. It also desires to change the rates for special and chartered car service to the following: Accounting and supervising charge for each car furnished, $3-00. Fifty cents per car mile for the distance traveled by the car. Two dollars per hour for standing or layover time. Regular fare for each passenger carried on each movement. A minimum of fifty passengers per car. The owl car fare of ten cents has existed since the pre-war rates of six tickets for twenty^five cents for day rides were the established rates. These rates have now been increased an average of sixty per cent. The owl cars at this time are earning less per hour operated than any other car except the north tenth street car. It appears only proper that riders on owl cars should bear a fair share of the added cost of operation. The increase will be approved- The rates for special and chartered cars will be approved with the exception of a minimum of fifty passengers to each car, which will be approved to read as in the old order, — minimum to be the regular seating capacity of the car used.

            <seg id="p503">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 503 Orders on Resolutions RESOLUTION NO. 53 In the Matter of Certain Service Rules of the Platte County Independent Tel - ephone Company. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Commissioner: At the hearing at Columbus, Nebraska, on Application No. 4101, on November 10th and 11th, wherein the questions under discussion were proper rate levels for the Platte County Independent Telephone Company, certain complaints were filed relative to service rules by the applicant company, respondents challenging the equity and legality of such rules. Inasmuch as the discussion of those rules had no proper place in the ques - tion then under consideration, the Commission issued an alternative order to show cause, dated November 26, 1919, requiring the Platte County Independent Telephone company to appear at its office on Monday, De - cember 8, 1919, for the purpose of defending certain of those rules, or in lieu of such appearances, to eliminate the rules and practices com - plained of. Applicant elected to appear in defense. Respondents represent - ing certain patrons and the city of Columbus, appeared as challengers of the rules. By stipulation read into the record it was agreed that oral argument on the rules be made and no verbatim report thereof be taken- The questions raised in the order to show cause are: ( 1 ) The practice of the Platte County Independent Telephone com - pany in charging $1.50 for reconnect where subscribers have been cut off from service for failure to pay bills within reasonable time after such bills are due- (2) Charges made against subscribers for materials for installa - tion and inside moves in addition to the charge promulgated by the fed - eral government known as "service connection charges," which federal charges were temporarily extended as legal charges by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, from* and after July 31, 1919. Being fully advised in the premises the Commission finds itself unable to approve either of the practices complained of. By its order on Application No. 2544, dated March 8, 1916, the Commission gave applicant authority to charge $1.00 for re-connecting a subscriber who has been disconnected for non-payment of bills or for gross misconduct in use of telephone equipment. This order was never superseded by the service connection charges of the federal government, and was there - fore in effect during the period under consideration and more particu - larly, the latter part of October and the first part of November, during </seg>
            <seg id="p504">504 which times defendant company disconnected many subscribers who had been very negligent in the matter of paying their accounts. The Commission realises that in making a charge of $1.50, applicant may have been led astray by the wording of the federal rules and they could have interpreted such rules as allowing a charge of $1-50, but careful reading of the rules does not warrant such conclusion- It finds that the charge in each of these instances which legally could have been made is $1.00 for each reconnection. Defendant company will be re - quired to make an allowance on subscribers bills in correction of this overcharge. The service connection charge promulgated by the federal govern - ment, which charges are still effective by temporary permission of the Nebraska State Railway Commission, is bottomed on certain expenses alleged to be incurred by telephone companies in making installations, which charges can not be capitalized. These charges are, speaking briefly, the keeping of central office records of the transactions and an advance payment of the labor cost of removing any such telephone equip - ment in the future. When a new telephone is installed by a telephone company proper records will show that the cost of the material and the labor for such installation is added to the capital account. Hence when a charge is made to a subscriber either for labor or for materials used in an nstallation, such subscriber has made &amp; donation to capital. tThe Commission has for years, realized that there is a limit beyond eh a telephone company should not go in expending its capital for installation of one telephone. The standard rule is that an invest - ment of $75 for one new subscriber is warranted. Any expenditure abovr that amount for one new subscriber can generally be required as a donation from the proposed subscriber. So far as testimony is at hand the rule of defendant was far more stringent. The evidence showed that there were certain charges made where special equipment was asked, or special wiring, to meet the convenience of the subscriber. Any such special service should be paid for by the proposed subscriber on the basis of cost, but for standard equipment no charge should be made for installations either as to labor or material costs over and above that charge which is still in effect as promulgated by the federal authorities. b These special charges made in the past for materials were not overcharges and the Commission cannot order reparation. Any ieved patron seeking recovery must do so in the courts- The Com - mission will however require the company to eliminate this rule for the future and cease making such charges except under unusual circum - stances- ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Platte County Independent Telephone company be </seg>

(SEAL) RESOLUTION NO- 53 In the Matter of Certain Service Rules of the Platte County Independent Telephone Company. ORDER ON MOTION FOR MODIFICATION BROWNE, Commissioner The original order herein entered February 9, 1920, resulted from testimony taken in the office of the Commission on a resolution of in - vestigation presented on the motion of the Commission. Applicant files a motion for modification of this order and joins with the motion a brief in support thereof. It asks through counsel that two changes be made. </seg>
            <seg id="p506">506 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 1. That the requirement that the company invest up to $75 in an extension to serve one subscriber before asking for a bonus from that subscriber be eliminated. 2. That the rule be modified which requires the company to con - tinue service to a delinquent subscriber until the end of the month for which rental is due and not paid before disconnecting such service. The standard rule, providing for an investment of $75 by a tele - phone company before calling upon the prospective subscriber to fur - nish a bonus, relates to metallic service and such rates as reflect that class of service. The order did not closely define. It will be amended to that extent. Applicant contends that such a rule will work confis - cation of its property. This has not been the experience of other com - panies where the Commission has required that this rule be adhered to- Applicant's own argument indicates that even on a rate of $1.25 a month adequate compensation for an investment of $75 will be re - turned. LOn the second point raised, applicant contends that adherence to rule will result in many bad accounts. The Commission has always recognised that in the interest of economy collections in advance for telephone service 1 are proper. It has consistently authorized gross and net rates to further collection convenience and provides a higher rate where such advance payments are not made. After careful perusal of the argument of counsel, it finds no reason to change its general posi - tion that a reasonable length of time should elapse after payment be - comes delinquent before an additional charge for reconnection may be imposed. Gross and net rates and charges for reconntttion are not intended as revenue producers. L Applicant contends that the order of the Commission, requiring t charges for reconnection be based on cost, conflicts with an order entered March 8, 1916, and that specific repeal of the previous oriier was not made. The point is not well taken. The latest order of the Commission on any particular rate or service made is the binding ex - pression on that subject. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the third paragraph of the original order in this cause 1 , dated February 9, 1920, be amended to read: "IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that defendant company shall hereafter make no other charge for installations and moves and changes of name than that provided in the federal order known as 'service connection charges;' provided that where the total cost of installation, or change, for metallic ser - t exceeds $75 for one subscriber, said subscriber shall pay to company as a bonus the excess cost over $75, this maximum </seg>

(SEAL) RESOLUTION NO. 55 ■ the Matter of the Investigation of Rates and Finances of the Chelsea Telephone Company, the Alpine Tele - phone Company, the West Geneva Telephone Company and the Big Four Telephone Company, all of Fillmore County, Nebraska. APPEARANCES— J. B. Miller and A. B Miller, representing the Chelsea Telephone Company; J. M. Jones for West Geneva Telephone Co.; R. A. Mattison for Big Four Telephone Com- pany and Alpine Telephone Company. OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: The above named telephone companies are all farm line companies operating in Fillmore county, and switched by the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company at its exchange in Geneva. They own no toll line or switchboard. The attention of the Railway Commission was called to the fact that the said companies had entered into the field of conducting a general telephone business to such an extent that a considerable number of tele - phones were being rented by each of the companies. According to the records on file in the office of the Commission, these companies were all mutual farm line companies- No schedule* of rates was on file and it was supposed that all parties receiving service were stockholders of the company. L Accordingly, when this condition was brought to the attention of Commission, it was thought the part of wisdom to summon the rep- </seg>
            <seg id="p509">509 resentatives of the different companies before the Commission for fur - ther investigation. Under order of the Commission the matter came on for further hearing at the offices of the Commission, of date February 20, 1920. Appearances were entered by the representatives of the diff - erent companies as above set forth. Representatives of the Chelsea Telephone company stated that the' Chelsea company, since this matter was called to their attention, had induced all who were renters to become stockholders, and that the Chel - sea company no longer had any rented telephones. Shares of stock had been sold to the renter for $35 per share which was the price paid per share' by the original stockholders when the company was formed a number of years ago. It appeared that this transaction was entirely satisfactory to both the stockholder and the renter. Accordingly, this action, in so far as the Chelsea Telephone company was concerned, was dismissed. Mr. Mattison, speaking in a general way for the remaining com - panies, testified as to the manner of conducting the affairs of the com - panies. It developed that the number of stockholders and subscribers on the different line.s is as follows: The switching rate is at present 50c per month per telephone on the farm line and is paid by the secretary or treasurer of the company, quarterly, to the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company at Geneva. Non-stockholders pay a monthly rental of $1.25 per month out of which the switching charge of 50c is paid by the company. This is the only charge made against the non-stockholder. Stockholders pay actual ca.-h into the funds of the company in the nature of assessments, which are levied from time to time 1 , according to the financial needs of the com - pany. None of the companies have any fixed definite annual assess - ment levied against the stockholders. Mr. Mattison, president of the Big Four company testified that during the first years of the organi - zation of the Big Four a small annual assessment was levied. This practice was later discontinued and for a number of years no assess - ments were made against the stockholders. However, in late years, the company has found it necessary, and for the past three years, the stockholders have paid an assessment of $10 per year. It was thought this would prove to be the experience of the remaining companies. No dividends have ever been paid by any of the companies. The farm lines were built by the farmers some twelve or fifteen years ago- The purpose of the original stockholders was that telephone service might be furnished, and not that money might be invested upon which to realize a return. The companies through the years have adhered 'ompany Alpine West Geneva Bij? Four ockhol 10 54 31 lers on-sl tockl 7 13 27 ;ho </seg>
            <seg id="p510">510 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT strictly to the original purposes which gave rise to their existence. Furthermore, practically all labor done on the lines is performed by the stockholders at no expense to the company. A pole breaks off, a stretch of wire pets tangled, or other trouble occurs on the line, and the farmer stockholder nearest to the cause of trouble usually goes with his hired man and makes the necessary repairs. In this manner, the donated labor of the stockholder is a very lmpoi tant factor in the keep - ing of the expenses of the companies at a minimum. None of the subscribers on any of the lines are required or expected to donate any labor for the maintenance of the lines. Mr. Jones of the West Geneva Company, in addition to Mr. Matti - son, testified to the fact that all subscribers on all the lines are privi - leged to become stockholders at any time 1 they desire. It has been the experience of the companies that the man who owns his farm ordinarily becomes a stockholder in the company, but the renter who is uncertain as to his length of tenure, usually prefers to receive service as a sub - scriber, though some stockholders are farm renters. It was insisted that all parties concerned, both stockholder and sub - scriber, are perfectly satisfied with the present manner of conducting the telephone business by the different farm line companies. In so far as the Commission is informed, this is true, no complaint of any sort having been filed with the Commission by either stockholders or sub - scribers relative to this matter. It is an easy matter, under the assessment plan, to allow the lines to depreciate until it is impossible to furnish a proper standard of ser - vice. This, of course, works an injustice upon the non-stockholdef who regularly pays his fixed monthly rental. It is probable that in the future, for a period of years, due to depreciation, larger assessments against the stockholder will be required, if the lines are to be properly maintained. Though no complaint from stockholder or subscriber has been filed with the Commission, the matter was thought worthy of consideration and investigation in view of the apparent discrimination in the rate being charged the stockholder and subscriber. Generally speaking, the attitude of the Commission is that a company which charges one rate to a stockholder and another rate to the subscriber is discriminating in its rate charges. The rate which is charged the stockholder and sub - scriber alike is to be sufficient to pay a fair return upon a fair invest - ment of the stockholder, and thus by the payment of dividends rather than by a system of rebates is the stockholder to realize upon his in - vestment. This «is the businesslike way of conducting a telephone exchange. However, in the case at hand, the companies involved are all small farm lines, none large enough to even justify the hiring of a lineman. The rule of the Commission should therefore perhaps not </seg>
            <seg id="p511">511 be so rigidly enforced. Representatives of the companies contended that when the matter of deferred dividends and donated labor, plus any assessments levied, was considered as a whole, no discrimination ex - ists against the subscriber- It appears that the contention of the companies is correct. Perhaps, at the present time the renter may be paying somewhat less for service than the stockholder. It would be a very difficult matter to determine this exactly, but it appears to the Commission, after study made, that the subscriber is not being dis - criminated against. This view is perhaps substantiated by the fact that the subscribers are all satisfied. The rate is not an unusual nor excessive rate- Extensive service is given, the subscriber being entitled to free service to the Geneva city exchange and all farm lines radiat - ing therefrom of which there are approximately sixteen. The Commission, while retaining jurisdiction in the matter, will therefore not disturb the present system of financing the affairs of these companies. It seems desirable, however, that the companies file an annual report showing in a general way the receipts and disburse - ments of the company. Of course, it is now thoroughly understood by the officers of these companies that any increase or decrease in the rates now being charged subscribers for service would need be author - ized by the Nebraska State Railway Commission before being legal. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the' rate charges as made by the Alpine Telephone company, the West Geneva Telephone company and the Big Four Tele - phone company, of Fillmore County, for service to subscribers, as of date, February 20, 1920, be, and the same arc hereby validated. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the said named telephone com - panies shall secure the proper authority from the Nebraska State Rail - way Commission before making any change in rates for service now being charged to non-stockholders. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the said named telephone com - panies file with the Nebraska State 1 Railway Commission, in January of each year, a financial statement, showing the entire receipts and expenditures for the preceding year.

It appeared that the company had been in very serious error regarding the effect of service connection order of the federal telephone adminis - tration and as to the latitude it gave this defendant company. It ap - peared quite impossible to the Commission that any such interpretation could have been secured by defendant, but, after going over the matter carefully, we are convinced that the error was not intentional and that, while technically defendant stands as a violator of the Railway Com - mission act, the Commission doe's not feel any such penalty should be imposed. In fact, subsequent to the hearing on the resolution the company's rate situation was taken up and adjustment of rates was authorized in an order dated July 21, 1920. That this order to show cause, was not dismissed a-; satisfied at an earlier date than this was an oversight. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway </seg>

NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION H. G. TAYLOR, Chairman- Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (S£AL) GENERAL ORDER NO. 47 In the Matter of Telephone Toll Rates in the State of Nebraska. BROWNE, Commissioner: LDue to war conditions the Commission in November, 1918, author - temporary higher toll rates, the increase being a flat percentage of 25. Shortly thereafter, the federal government, then operating toll properties of the nation, promulgated toll rates of national scope, built on a very different plan of operation. These rates were made effective January 21, 1919. They were held up by injunction proceedings brought by the state of Nebraska and various other states, on the ques - tion of jurisdiction. These proceedings were dismissed by the United States Supreme Court- In the latter part of June, 1919, the toll rates now being charged in Nebraska went into effect by the federal order. Wire companies were returned to their owners by act of congress on July 31, 1919, with the provision that unless proper authority made changes, the rates then in effect should continue until December' 1, 1919, when automatically, if no further action was taken, the rates would return to the effective schedules prior to government action. Press of work prevented the Nebraska Commission from giving the necessary careful consideration to the matter before the determining date and a temporary extension of the federal rates was made until January 31, 1920. Contemporaneously, a general order was issued requiring all toll companies to appear and show cause why the federal rates and classification should not be ordered discontinued. Hearings on the matter were held in the office of the Commission December 17 to 19, 1919, and much testimony was taken. Most of the toll properties of the state are owned by the Nebraska Telephone Company, and the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company. Most short line toll properties individually owned do business jointly with these two iarge companies and perforce must operate under the same schedules and rules- In order to pass intelligently on the ques - tion of toll rates, it is essential that a physical valuation of toll proper - ties and careful allocation of units used in common for exchange and </seg>
            <seg id="p515">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 515 toll purposes be made. No such studies have been made by the Com - mission for various reasons- First, these proceedings are to consider a temporary extension of present war time schedules and not for final determination of proper toll rates. Second, this is a period of high operating costs, reflected generally in high charges for service. Studies previously made as to the com - bined toll and exchange revenues of the two companies owning a very large part of the toll properties of the state showed conclusively that there could be no diminution in these combined revenues at this time without damage to service and properties. It is quite possible that a physical valuation of toll properties would show higher earning cap - acity than on exchange properties. If this were true, it would call for reduction in toll rates and according increase in exchange rates. Exchange 1 rates are now high and it is the plan of the Commission that, temporarily at least, toll service can bear the added burden better than exchange service, and that the present relation should not be dis - turbed at this time. Third, to make a valuation of toll properties and a segregation of common units of service would require a vast amount of work by en - gineers and an expenditure of money which the Commission at this time does not possess. Hence it would appear to be a matter of good discretion, as well as necessity, to continue for another temporary period the present rate relationship between tolls and exchanges- Present toll service is on a classified basis- The three divisions being: (a) person to person service, (b) station to station, or number to number service, (c) report charges . Station to station service is the base on which all other charges are made. It is applied to that portion of the total business where sub - scribers call the number of the party, or the name of the subscriber, if the number is not known, and talk to anyone who answers- It is not new service, although never heretofore classified. Prior to the war from 13 to 15% of the total toll business went by choice on this basis, although no rate inducement was involved. Sometimes the calling party was indifferent as to who answered. Sometimes the matter of speed in making connections was the determining factor. The rates now in effect for this class of service are? approximately pre-war toll rates with short line business passing slightly cheaper than at pre-war rates. This rate relationship will be shown by tabulation later. Person to person service passes under present schedules at about 20% higher cost than pre-war rates for short distances, and 257r higher on the entire business. This class of service was generally used pre- </seg>
            <seg id="p516">516 war and still predominates. It has certain variations. Appointment calls and messenger calls are modified classifications of the person to person scheme, and at the present time pass at a rate 507r higher than the station to station service, and 25% higher than the person to per - son service- Toll companies for several years had studied the possibility of station to station service and took advantage of the period of federal control, to urge its adoption nationally because of the advantages of unified rules on toll business. Since the relinquishment of the opera - tion of toll lines by the federal government, the toll companies have been urging state commissions to continue the use of classifications, and very generally they have done so for indeterminate future periods. In the meantime the classification will be carefully studied by all. In Nebraska, on the advice of the Commission, extensive studies are being made of the effect of the classification, in the process of which many thousands of toll tickets are being analyzed. With the results of that study at hand, the Commission will be in a better position to pass in - telligently on the classification as a permanent matter. The chief purpose of the station to station business and its devel - opment is speed in handling messages. For several years after the division of toll territory between South Platte and North Platte, toll circuits were ample for all purposes. They are now overcrowded for peak load business. The measure of efficiency for toll circuits is the capacity to handle the heaviest demands, which demands occur between 9 and 10 a. m- daily, and again in lesser degree between 2 and 3 p. m. Peak load telephone business differs from peak load passenger trans - portation in that the telephone business cannot be crowded. Only one message can pass over one circuit at a time. The use of the toll line is divided between: (a) the period the operator is making the con - nection, (b&gt; the conversation time', (c) the dead time. The dead lime or idle time of toll circuits averaging more than twenty hours of the twenty-four, and only one-third of the busy time is actually used in talking, under the old plan of operation. Studies ir. the possession of the 1 Commission show that at lea.-t three station to station messages can be completed in the same time two person to person messages can be handled. Obviously station to station messages will allow a greater use of present toll properties than would be in case if that class of messages were not in use. If such greater capacity cannot be secured, additional toll circuits must be constantly constructed and the resulting additional investment must be rewarded by earnings that the public must pay. Already toll com - panies have perfected one element for increasing speed in transacting business additional to the station to station service. Formerly, toll calls were carefully recorded by the operator at the originating end and all the information was passed to the operator at the terminating </seg>
            <seg id="p517">517 end, and there copied on a ticket- This took time. Wherever possible now, a single ticket is used and the operator at the originating end makes the only record. She it is who talks in a preliminary way to the party called. The operator at the terminating end has no other duty than to make the proper local connection as on a local call between subscribers. Station to station service will predominate on short distance busi - ness. The charge for station to station service is made whenever par - tits at the two stations are connected and are willing to risk getting connection with someone who can transact business. On long haul calls the charge is high enough that there will be an unwillingness to risk failure to secure connections who can talk business. Hence long distance calls will for the most part pass person to person. The short distance business is the heavy toll business and if it can be speeded up it will be a distinct advantage in promptness of connections, amount of business passing over given circuits, and in necessary rates. In the opinion of the Commission the value of the station to sta - tion service will depend somewhat on its development. If it can be used on part of their messages by most toll users it will justify its existence. Studies recently completed in Minnesota indicate that more than 25'A of all messages are passing station to station- A recent study in Nebraska on certain circuits, none of which were for short distances, or inter-town, showed an increase between May and Decem - ber in the station to station business of 4%9i of the total calls. Testi - mony was that including short haul business possibly the station to station service in Nebraska is now fully as heavy as in Minnesota. The manager of the Milburn and Anselmo Telephone company, with certain short line properties, testified that fully one-half of his toll busi - ness passed station to station now. The vice-president of the Plattt Valley Telephone company of Seottsbluff testified that on business con - finsd to the North Platte valley 46% were person to person calls, and 52% station to station calls. On longer haul messages the person to person business was 69% and the station to station business 21% of the total- These figures are encouraging. Evidence in possession of the Commission indicates that revenues under the rates and classification now in use are less than uner the war time scale 1 previously authorized by this Commission. A careful study for a week, by the Nebraska Telephone company showed that un - der the war time rates authorized by the Nebraska Commission the average cost of a message in Nebraska was 42.94c, and under the pres - ent scale and classification, 4181c. The Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company, whose hauls average shorter, found that the cheaper short line rate of the federal scale seriously embarrassed it financially in curtailment of revenue- Following is a tabulation showing comparative rates in messages </seg>

The present average for person to person business is 36.7c. For longer haul business the spread between E station to station and the person to person charge slightly increases station to station rates will average now for all business approxi- Hy the pre-war rates. Llf the station to station business can be developed to a reasonable cnt, it will of course result in a saving to those who can use it, as it is a cheaper grade of service than can otherwise be given. It will add speed to connections. This has already been proved- It will not, however, necessarily reduce the revenues of the toll companies, because r.f the added number of messages which can be handled over a given amount of property. It is, in fact, quite likely that it may increase the revenues of the company because of volume of business and at the same time be a saving to patrons. It will keep down invest ments. This result would not follow unless there is such a demand in the peak period that it cannot be handled fairly promptly on any other plan without adding to toll circuits. In authorizing the continuance of these classifications, the Com - mission is impressed with the necessity of publicity for this cheaper grade of service. That publicity has not thus far been adequate- A condition of this order will be that toll companies should include with each monthly bill rendered to its subscribers and patrons, for the month? of March, April and May, 1920, a slip containing brief and sim - ple explanation of the classes of toll service and the differences in rates involved. Toll operators shall also be instructed to add to this pub - licity in dealing with their patrons as extensively as possible without detracting from efficiency of operation.

            <seg id="p519">519 More than a year ago the labor problem of telephone companies had become so acute that it was difficult to hold operating forces for thf period 6 to 8 p. m , to handle the business arising during those hours, under the one-half rate in effect. To relieve this situation the Com - mission made the breaking point between day and night rates 9:30 p. m. This has since been changed to 8:30 p. m. The? effect of this is to spread this early night load until it can be cared for with smaller operating forces- This condition should be continued and the order will provide for the breaking point between day and early night rates at 8:30 p. m- It will also continue the M, day rate between 12 p. m. and 4:30 a. m. This period is but little used except on very long distance calls, but may develop. It is a period when operators are almost idle. Day rates will be charged between 4:30 a. m. and 8:30 p. m., one-half day rates from 8:30 p. m. to 12 p. m., and one-fourth day rates between 12 p- m. and 4:30 a. m. The Minnesota studies indicate that at the present time less than 10% of all messages will pass during the special - rate night periods. Appointment calls and messenger calls will con - tinue at the 50% increase over the day station to station rate- Only one message in a thousand is an appointment call, and about three mess - ages in each thousand require the use of a messenger. These higher rates are fully justified by the amount of time required to make the arrangements for such calls. Time was when no difference in rates represented this extra service, although a very great difference in the amount of time spent by the telephone company on such messages ex - isted- The conveniences, if they exist, of appointment calls, should be reflected in the charges made. The third chief factor in the classification now used is the report charge, a charge not made prior to the period of government control. This charge is not primarily for revenue purposes, as only 2 % °*&lt; of the revenues from person to person calls come from report charges. The rate is one-fourth the station to station rate. The time required to attempt to make a connection and to report the failure considerably ex - ceeds the time" required in completing the connection where conversa - tion is had. It is no fault of the telephone company that connection is not made. It has used its facilities and the time of its operators in making the effort. Frequently the calling party secures valuable information. More particularly the charge is for the purpose of heading off cer - tain extensive abuses. Large users of toll service 1 were the chief of - fenders. Systems of codes were worked out under which information was passed back and forth without any conversation actually taking place, and the necessary information was imparted at no expense- Again telephone companies were asked to call a considerable number of towns in the effort to locate a person. Often no conversation resulted from these efforts to locate parties, even when actually located, as the information was secured without conversation. Toll lines were en- </seg>
            <seg id="p520">520 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT cumbered with such requests to the detriment of legitimate business and revenues were seriously affectctl. Toll rates under normal con - ditions were higher as a result of tnese practices than would have been necessary had they beeYi eliminated. The report charge will partially cure the evils. Report charge* will not be made where a failure to make connections results, if later daring the same day conversation between same parties takes place. No charges will be made where the company fails to report within one hour of the time the call is placed. Report charges can only be made on person to person messages, for the reason that if no connection is made on a station to station message no charge at all results. Report charges have been included in the classification for the past seven months. Seven person to person messages are completed without a report charge, where one message results in a report charge. Hence while the charge heads off certain extensive abuses on the part of users who could well afford to pay for the services they secured, it does not at the same time impose any serious burdens on the telephone using Elic, as a whole. The Commission is constrained to indorse heartily efforts of the company to head off the practice of getting toll ser - without any charges. The present classification of toll business and the schedules of rates now in effect will be continued for part or all of the year 1920. In the meantime the Commission will on its own motion make certain investigations and require other investigations from the companies for t purpose of ascertaining whether the classification shall become per - ently established for toll business. Because of serious impairment of revenues which it could Hi afford at the time of the adoption of the present classification and rate scales, the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company, party hereto, secured slightly higher than standard rates on toll messages for distances of not more than 40 miles, and these higher rates are now in effect. To put these short distance rates down to a standard basis at this time would result in a deficit in the company's finances and the Commission will not do so now. It will allow the present scale of this company to stand with one exception. The standard rate for distances of. not more than 12 miles is 10c station to station, where the pre-war rate was originally 15c. The Lincoln company has been charging, with the permission of the federal government, 15c for this short distance busi - ness. When the war tax is added it makes the rate 20c on inter-town business which is 100% higher than the standard rate approved above. The Commission will require this company to publish a rate of 14c on messages for distances not to exceed 12 miles, where at present the rates are not lower than that amount.

            <seg id="p525">525 Brome &amp; Ramsey and J. P- Uvick, all of Omaha, for appellees. FLANSBURG, J. Suit in equity brought by the Nebraska State Railway Commission to require, for the alleged benefit of stockholders, an accounting of cor - porate funds, and to enjoin the defendant company, its officers and agents, from the further sale of defendant's corporate stock- The trial court sustained a demurrer to the petition, and, plaintiff having elected to stand upon the petition, the case was dismissed. Plaintiff appeals. Plaintiff claims its authority for this action under the provisions of the so-called "Blue Sky Law" (Rev. St. 1913, 796-811), and the pri - mary question to be determined is whether or not the defendant com - pany is a corporation within the purview of that act. The petition discloses that this company was incorporated in Octo - ber, 1915, and had been in existence for more than one year at the time of the commencement of this proceeding. It is contended that the defendant corporation, having been in existence for one year, was ex - empted from thfe operation of the act under that provision of section 7!&gt;8, Rev. St. 1913, which reads as follows: "This article shall not include within its purvisw sales of stock in Nebraska corporations already in existence, and in Ne - braska corporation.-; hereafter created, but which have boen in existence one year or more at the time of such sale, and in corporations of other states which have been in existence fi\v years or more at the time of such sale, the majority of stock - holders, directors and officers of which were at the time of commencing business and are at the date of the approval of this article, citizens of the state of Nebraska, nor individual sales of securities owned by the seller prior to the taking effect of this article and purchased by such seller prior to March 1st, 1913, when no commission or other compensation of any charac - ter whatsoever is to move in the transaction, and no puDlicity is used in accompanying the sale." (1) The question is whether or not the words, "when no com - mission or other compensation of any character whatsoever is to move in the transaction, and no publicity is used in accompanying t v e sale." refer only to those individual sales of securities by the owner, or wheth - er they refer back to Nebraska corporations already in existence, to Nebraska corporations to be created, and to foreign corporations of five years' existence where a majority of the officers and stockholders arc citizens of this state- The intention of the Legislature is the law, and such intention is to be gathered from the meaning of the language used, in the light of the necessity for or reason of the enactment, and the objects sought to be att.iined, and, in determining the meaning of the language, its oi\iin - ary and its grammatical construction is to be followed, unless an intent </seg>
            <seg id="p526">526 appears to the contrary, or unless, by following such construction, the intended effect of the provisions would apparently be impaired The evident purpose of this enactment was to stop the sale of stock in companies organized for fraudulent stock exploitation. The frauds thus perpetrated seem to have been considered by the Legisla - ture to especially arise in the organization and sale of stock in new companies and promotion schemes, having no proper plan or bona fide intent of applying the proceeds from the sale of such stock to the carrying on of any actual business, but for the purpose only of ex - ploiting the public- A statute of this kind is to be given a prospec - tive effect only, rather than a retroactive operation, unless another in - tent is expressed. It is reasonable to assume that, as to the great number of Nebraska corporations, then existing and actually doing business in this state no regulation was considered necessary. In such corporations the stock had, for the most part, been sold prior to the time of this enactment, and the great body of such corporations would not, therefore, come within the purpose of the act For this reason, and for the reason that outstanding stock in such corporations was not intended to be affected, the general exemption of Nebraska corpor - ations, then existing, may have been provided. As to corporations to be thereafter created in this state, the Leg - islature evidently considered it necessary to prohibit the sale of stock unless the organization and plan of the enterprise to be carried on, and the sale of stock, should be under the supervision of and be approved by some agency of the state. Such supervision by the railway com - mission was limited to one year only, no doubt because it was thought such corporations could come into existence only under the supervision and permission and direction of the railway commission, and that, if properly organized upon a legitimate plan of business, and with proper assets and valuation representing the stock, the danger of stock specu - lation would have been avoided. By this supervisory power, the rail - wmy commission could, by criminal or other proceedings, prevent the sale of stock in that class of companies which were organized for the purpose of exploitation in the sale of stock and not for legitimate business. If, as plaintiff contends, the proviso in question applies to Nebras - ka companies created after the enactment, we can see no reasonable purpose of fixing the one-year limitation, for, if a corporation is to continue under the operation of the law in all practical manner the same after the year has elapsed as before, why did not the Legislature leave out the provision of the one-year limitation entirely? It is true that under plaintiff's construction such a corporation, after a year, would not be prohibited from selling stock when no commission or publicity was resorted to, which sales, prior to that time, would have been pro - hibited; but it is during the first year of a corporation's existence that commissions and publicity are necessary, and it is then that stock is not ordinarily sold without such means being employed. In other </seg>
            <seg id="p527">527 words, it is more likely that stocks may be sold without resort to com - missions: and publicity after the first year of the corporation's exist - ence than before, and, if the corporation was one which the Legislature considered should be under the supervision of the railway commission after a year's existence, it would seem plausible that the same power of supervision should continue, to prevent the fraudulent sale of stock, regardless of how such sales should be effected. Having exempted the sale of stock in those corporations expressly mentioned, it was in the mind of the Legislature that still other stock in other corporations, not exempted (since all foreign corporations, less than five years old, and all foreign corporations, a majority of whose stockholders, officers, and directors were not residents of the state, were not exempted), was at that time held by owners who had purchased the same prior to the enactment of the law, and it was considered that those persons should be protected in their property rights in that stock. It was therefore provided that such persons or owners might dis - pose of their stock in the ordinary course of business, and thus derive a fair value therefrom, but provided that such sales should not be made without a permit and approval of the sale by the state, if agents were employed or publicity used in effecting the sale, since such means might make possible the sale of securities at more than a fair valuation- That sales of stock by an owner, in the ordinary course of business, are placed upon a different footing from all other sales, is now definitely and expressly stated in the re-enactment of this statute in 1919. The language of the statute under consideration is so employed that it is difficult of interpretation, but we feel that the construction con - tended for by the plaintiff leads to a complex situation, never intended by the Legislature. We have examined the history of this amendment and the form in which it was originally introduced, as disclosed by legislative journals, but find nothing which would control the interpretation of the act, as it emerged after amendments and in final form. It is urged by plaintiff that other sections of the act provide that permits for the sale of stock were to be issued for one year and were to be renewed or continued from year to year, and that this discloses an intent that all corporations be within the act for all time; but such provisions are entirely consistent with the construction which we have given the statute, as there are many foreign corporations which would continue under the provisions more than one year and indefinitely. The Attorney General of this state, immediately after this law went into effect, interpreted the statute in the same manner that we have now interpreted it- (Opinions Attorney General 1913-14, p. Ill), and for many years corporations have operated in this state under </seg>
            <seg id="p528">THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 528 that interpretation. The contemporaneous construction by such exec - utive office, whose duty it was to enforce the statute, is entitled to consideration now. 36 Cyc. 1140- (2) One canon of construction, known as the doctrine of the "last antecedent clause," is that relative and qualifying words or phrases are to be applied to the words or phrases immediately preceding, and as not extending to or including other words, phrases, or clauses more remote, unless such extensions or inclusion is clearly required by the intent and meaning of the context, or disclosed by an examination of the entire act. In the application of that rule, there is a strict analogy to the case before us in the following decisions: City of Traverse City v. Township of Blair, 190 Mich. 313, 157 N. W. 81; Dagan v. State. 162 Wis. 353, 156 N. W. 153; State v. Scaffer, 95 Minn. 311, 104 N. W. 139; Zwietusch v. Village of East Milwaukee, 161 Wis. 519, 154 N. W 981; Summerman v. Knowles, 33 N. J. Law, 202; 36 Cyc. 1123. kin the case of Summerman v. Knowles, supra, 33 N. J. Law, 205, is said: "It would be highly convenient to extend the remedy pro - vided by the third section to all cases where materials are fur - nished. - - - But mere convenience in attaining a right given by the statute, in an expeditious and inexpensive way, not to be obtained by the application of established rules of construction, ought not to influence this court in dealing with the intent of the Legislature, as expressed in a statute. A de - parture from, or relaxation of, these rules will introduce doubt and uncertainty in the administration of justice. Better by far resort to the Legislature to simplify the remedy in the future, and preserve, in full vigor, those established rules of construc - tion which give certainty and uniformity to the construction of statutes and legal instruments." It is not within the province of this court to deal with the policy of the law, nor to attempt to extend it, even though an extension should be considered desirable; but its duty is to go so far only as to interpret the law as it stands, and determine what the Legislature, at the time of the enactment, intended by it As is usual in the enactment of statutes covering a new field of legislation, there are ambiguities and discrepancies which sometimes leave the law incomplete or inadequate; but if the law, as enacted, has proven inadequate, that is for the Legis - lature to decide, and not for the court. The statute now involved was by the act of 1919 repealed, and is no longer the law in this state, and the difficulties of interpi station. now involved, have become settled by the 1919 law, enacted in the place of thip one- kThe statute now in question contains another provision (Rev.

It is contended that the defendant company has, by virtue of this provision, come within the act, since it amended its articles of incorporation after it had been in existence for one year. It swms manifest, from a reading of the section, that this provision was intended to apply to those corporations within the purview of the act, and not to those expressly exempted, and that this provision has no applica - tion here- The lower court refused to grant an injunction in this case and no injunction has been allowed to the present time. By the law of 1919, enacted after this suit was commenced, covering the subject matter of the statute under consideration, the exemptions of sales of stock, in - volved here, have been dispensed with, and that law, it appears, affords full relief in the matters here in controversy- For the reasons given, the judgment of the lower court is affirmed.
