In presenting to you the President's , I know you will pardon me for making it very brief. In the first I feel my inability to write the report as you would have received n our late President. The fair of 1913 was one of the most successful ever held. While there have been years that showed a larger attendance there has never been a time when as much value was represented as this year. This was du- to two things, the high class of animals of all kinds on exhibition and the great display of machinery, including tractors and automobiles. While hog cholera in 1912 cost the country almost one billion pounds of meat, enough to supply ten pounds to every man, woman and child in the I'nited States, in 1913 the loss was much greater — Iowa alone losing about twenty million dollars; yet our hog exhibit was one of the best ever held, and I am sure much credit is due Superintendent E. Z. Russell for the great show in that department. I shall not attempt to take up the departments separately, but will say I like the spirit manifested by each superintendent, that upon his or her class depeuds the success or failure ot the fair; and when such a feeling exists the different depart nit nts are sure to be taken care of. Iowever. I do desire to say just a word regarding the two new features were added to our fair this year, the boys' and babies' departments, ly mind these are a great advertisement as well as the greatest edu - nal exhibits we have at our fair. I have heard remarks made by and their parents that the insti action they received from those in ;e of that department wag as beneficial to them as six months in •ommon school. The baby show was a success beyond all expectations. No one can estimate the value of this exhibit for future state fairs. Those five hundred babies will be the best advertisers we could possibly get, as they grow into manhood and womanhood. They will not only come to </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 the fair, if possible, but will keep talking fair to father and mother all the year; in fact, we have now an endless chain of boosters for the state In reading over the report of our late President for the last year and noting the broad and comprehensive view he had on state fair matters. I believe I could do no greater honor to his memory than to ask each member to read carefully his report, and note how fully he went into evciy detail regarding the progress of the past and needs of the future, that would work for the best interest of the Nebraska state fair; believing that in so doing you will agree with me that the all-wise Providence in - tended that masterly report should cover two years. But I do want to say to officers, superintendents and others who worked so faithfully for the success of the 1913 fair the words I know he felt at its close, "Well done, thou good and faithful servants." Ehdent Roberts: Next thing in order, gentlemen, will be the nom - of new members so we can get the names and have them printed orrow morning on the Australian ballot. Secretary Mei.lok: I will announce what the different districts are entitled to in the way of members and the vacancies that may occur. Nominations for the First District should be taken up before any others. The First District comprises the same as the First Congressional District. Mr. Leonard: Mr. Chairman, I would like to place in nomination William Foster of Lancaster county as a member from the First District. President Roberts: William Foster is nominated for the First Dis - trict Are there any others? If not, we will pass to the second. »V. Riksen: I nominate Mr. Arnold of Richardson county.

Ryan is nominated from the Fifth District. Secretary Mellok : Before further nominations, if it is not declared out of order, I would like to make a motion that the new member to take th» place of our late President, Mr. Haws, be elected for a term of two years, for the reason that if we should follow the old plan next year there would be four nominations from the Fifth District, while thii year there is but one. Therefore, by nominating two for the full term at this time, there will be two elected this year and three next year, and I there - fore move that the nomination for the successor to Mr. Haws be for the two-year term; and that we also declare the one having the least number of votes from the four members elected. in the Sixth District as being elected for but one year, making two full term members to be elected next year instead of one as it stands now. Motion seconded. J. F. McArdle: I request that you separate your motion. That Is two Secretary Mellor: Not unless the Board wills it otherwise, as I con - strue it as one motion. Mr. McArdle: This Board is not going up against the law. Mr. Rcdge: Mr. President, I would like to ask if you have looked up the constitution, if we are not legally bound to elect fourteen members one year and fifteen another year. Eret art Mellor: Yes, sir; and that does it. It is also legal to fill scy. The constitution specifies that twenty-nine members be named ites that one-half of the original members' terms should expire at 1 of one year and the balance at the end of two years. Mb. Rudge: Are we electing fourteen members this year, or fifteen? Eretaby Mellor : The original list contains fourteen.

SECRETARY'S REPORT The State Fair The pioneer promoter of what is now the modern fair was, from all recognized information, one Elkanah Watson, of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, who soon after the year 1800 began to advocate the showing of animals and products for comparison in order to educate the masses in the desir - ability for better results from the farm. History of specific fairs nrrw to be lacking, however, until the year 1819, when we find record of the Tri State Fair held in New York. Like many other innovations in the conservative East, very little progress was made until the period begin ning in 1850. when the onward march of the great central West began. This active era continued until 1870, during which time nearly all the state fairs were organized. Eraska held its first territorial fair in 1859 at Nebraska City, with W. Furnas as its president and J. Sterling Morton as orator, men names are common household words in Nebraska and who were s in advanced ideas for better agriculture. Fairs were the only factors for advancement in agricultural education for a period of time extending up to about the year 1900, when the rush of the times demanded additional expert education along the lines of animal husbandry and agriculture, and an era of huge national and state appropriations began for the dissemination of such information through the agricultural schools of the country. These schools are furnishing valuable training for the rising generation who are blessed with either the necessary independent qualifications through ambition, or money, but the number so favored is pitiably small in proportion to the total population, being an average of one scholar in every 6,700; therefore these schools are doing their work In a limited sphere, while the field of educational value of the state fair is constantly enlarging, so that now the total attendance for the large fairs of the l'nited States has reached the tremendous figure of 30,000,000 annually, with an average premium distribution of 12.500,000 each year. From these figures it is safe to say that about one-sixth of the people of the l'nited States visit a fair, and while some parties object to our claims of the educational value of the state fair, still the fact becomes more and more apparent on thoughtful consideration. </seg>
            <seg id="p015">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 15 IM our last meeting several matters of vital importance to the Ne - i State Board of Agriculture have changed. At that time the ac - s of the Stallion Registration Board were conducted by your Secre - inder operation of a law found unconstitutional by the supreme court, •ount or the constitutional non-authorization of its executive officers, v law was enacted by the legislature which named the governor, treasurer, and commissioner of public lands and buildings as execu - ifftcers, leaving the original law the same as before, which law is n active operation. On January 16, 1913, a bill for $108,000, of which $100,000 was for the i r. . tion of an agriculture-horticulture building on the state fair grounds and $8,000 for the purchase of additional land east and west of the grounds, was introduced in the legislature by Hon. Michael Lee of Omaha and Hon. George Jackson of Nelson. This bill passed both houses and on April 16. 1913, was signed by Governor John H. Morehead ia its original form, and nqw we have erected one of the best agriculture-horticulture buildings to be found on any state fair grounds in the United States. We have a deed to the sixty acres of land for which the $8,000 was appro - priated, but owing to a defect in title It is now in course of condemna - tion. Most of this land is already enclosed by our wire fence, and when finally acquired will make a total holding of 183 acres owned by the state of Nebraska to be used for state fair purposes. Bill No. 155 as described in words and figures is as follows: "AN ACT authorizing the construction on the state fair grounds of a &gt;ermanent building, and to appropriate for such purpose the sum of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), or as much thereof as may be necessary, and authorizing the purqhase of additional land con - iguous to the fair grounds, and appropriating for such purpose the sum of eight thousand dollars ($8,000), or as much thereof as may be necessary. ••«.- if Enacted 'by the People of the State of Xebraska: Ilrctlon 1.

On January 17, 1913, Hon. F. L. Bollen of Crofton introduced in the house of representatives Bill No. 197, an act to enable the state of Nebraska to condemn lands needed for state institutions or the state fair, or for any other state use, and to provide a method of procedure of such condemnation, and declaring an emergency, which bill was passed by both houses and signed by Governor John H. Morehead on the 13th day of March, 1913. Under the provisions of this bill the state of Ne - braska is, by purchase and condemnation, securing the land lying east of the fair grounds to the intersection of the Rock Island and Burlington railroads, and west of the grounds to Fourteenth street, being the land lying south of the old channel of Salt Creek. The act enabling this purchase is as follows: "Be it Enacted by the People of the State of Nebraska: Iection 1. (Condemnation of land for state uses.) The state of dka is hereby given power and authority to acquire, by condemna - ands necessary for the state institutions or the state fair, or for any use "Section 2. (Procedure; appraisers, duties.)

(Emergency.) Whereas an emergency exists, this act to force and effect from and after its passage and approval." Exhibitors The 1913 Nebraska state fair attained the high mark in total number of exhibits made. In five departments we think it can be truthfully said that each of the five was the most complete and best department of its kind seen at any fair in the United States during the year. To the exhibitors who made this fact possible we extend greetings. We feel that the cooperation extended in making these great exhibits is often - times done at great personal care and expense, and only after a season of many annoyances and continuous effort. We hope that such loyalty resulted in personal profit, both in the money received and the satisfac - tion derived in being permitted to participate in such an opportunity to extend educational facts along the line of ideals you sought to impress. Superintendents ihen one fair can claim distinction in five of its departments in corn - on with all those held in this great country, it is a recommendation e unusual merit of the class of superintendents in charge of the us departments of our fair. Such distinction comes only to those are constant in their endeavor to build up that with which they are isted. To all those who have so ably assisted the Board in making ork a success we extend heartfelt congratulations, but realize that </seg>
            <seg id="p019">19 the satisfaction which comes with the knowledge of labor well performed is its best reward. Boys' Camp l'l&gt;on a recommendation made at our last annual meeting, our first Boys" School Encampment was held during the 1913 state fair. Th&lt;- aim of the school was to offer to a select body of young men (two from each county, except Douglas and Lancaster) the means for systematic obser - vation and study under the direction of competent instructors of the animal, agricultural, mechanical and educational exhibits of the state fair, and through such agency more fully to inform and interest the residents of the counties in the resources of Nebraska and the achieve - ment of her citizens as demonstrated by the displays on exhibition. In - structors from the State Farm under Prof. C. W. Pugsley and Prof. H. E. Bradford had charge of the educational features, and the city Y. M. C. A. furnished athletic directors. Ninety-three boys from forty-four counties attended and were placed in charge of Superintendent E. von Forell. The camp was located at the southwest corner of the grounds and the boys were housed in fourteen army tents, with additional mess and lertur*' t«&gt;nts. The boys were instructed in farm mechanics, animal husbandry, agronomy and soils from 8 o'clock until 11 each morning, and afternoons an&lt;l evenings were devoted to visiting the various exhibits, places of general interest in Lincoln and vicinity, and ushering in the grandstand. From the reports returned to the office we infer the deduction that this new departure was an unqualified success and reflects credit on the men who had it in charge. Better Babies When in its first contest a fair can pull off the distinction of holding the second largest Better Babies' Contest in the United States, it surely speaks well for the amount of work performed in securing such rank. We wish to especially congratulate Mrs. M. E. Vance, the superintendent, and her efficient co-workers in accomplishing such result, and also com - mend the Nebraska State Board of Health and the men of the medical profession who rendered valuable aid in carrying this interesting show - to a dignified, scientific conclusion. Over 600 entries were received and abies examined. From the interest taken in this state show we think the Board will be warranted in continuing it as an annual feature of the fair. Live Stock Live stock exhibited at the Nebraska state fair furnish an educational opportunity for inspiration to the stock grower not to be found elsewhere. With the finished type of animal In the horse, cattle, swine and sheep departments, an object lesson is provided from which scientific deduc - tions of the type, breed, feed and kindred necessities for final attainment of animal excellence can be drawn. The year 1913 brought to thii fair the greatest swine show held at any fair the past year. We think this </seg>
            <seg id="p020">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 20 Is the first time we have secured this position. The horse, cattle and sheep shows were up to their usual excellence. Poultry I; poultry building was completely filled and it was again necessary vide for the accustonifd overflow in the old poultry house. This ment has for years been one of continued excellence, reflecting one braska's great industries which provides facilities to purchase sugar and coffee than any other single product of the state. We he time will speedily arrive when this exhibit may be shown In m coops. Displays in agriculture, horticulture and education were as usual the best shown at any of the fairs this year. This fact relative to these departments has been recognized for a number of years and is always the wonder of visiting fair officials. Nebraska almost stands alone in its class of exhibitors in those specific classes. Readjustment of Display Space I; past year witnessed the removal of the ladies' textile and fine nartim-nts from the round building in which it has been housed for Into the original live stock building at the intersection of Dinsmore laws avenues, thereby providing them a large and commodious f space, relieving the congestion of former quarters and giving an ired opportunity for showing these splendid exhibits. Iie next fair will see several more changes in location with the com - n of the new hall in which will be housed the displays of agricul - horticulture, floriculture, educational, domestic products, bees and ■, and better babies. This arrangement will permit the University braska to use the old horticulture building to make a display of its ties; the use of the old educational hall for the fast growing Shet pony exhibit, and old agricultural hall for cement manufacturers. Automobile Exhibit II slate fair automobile exhibit of 1913 was a revelation. This is a ment which is virtually in its infancy, but from the wonderful in exhibits made during the past few years It is probable, within t period of time, to demand quarters of considerable area. Many ble comments were heard of the taste and beauty of the automobile j of 1913, and we trust that the efforts of the exhibitors returned m a profit in additional business secured. Machinery and Tractors An agricultural state of the Importance of Nebraska demands many and varied kinds of farming machinery from a wrench to a tractor. Prom the magnitude of the exhibit we think that everything was there and our patrons found experts in every department thoroughly conver - sant with minute detail for a liberal education. This is the one great opportunity for the dealer and consumer to come In direct contact </seg>
            <seg id="p021">21 The Board of Educational Lands and Funds, in charge of the state rapitol grounds, advertised the flagstones for sale at a nominal pries. These have served for a number of years as walks at the state house. Your Secretary, on being advised of such action, appeared before said Board of Educational Lands and Funds and petitioned them to give all such stone remaining for the purpose of constructing walks upon the state fair grounds, which request i as granted, and we have taken up. hauled and laid a part of the stones in walks on Dunham, Morton, and Barnes avenues, and have sufficient stone to continue necessary walks as soon as we feel able to spare the funds with which to pay for the labor. Paving Is of our most appreciated Improvements for the year 1913 is the ;ted paving of Seventeenth street. For several years we have eon - r urged the Lincoln city authorities to pave Seventeenth street from et to the tracks south of our main entrance, which was finally com - in time for our 1913 fair. In order to make the paving continuous gate we were compelled to pave north of the Burlington right-of - n our gate, wholly upon land owned by the state of Nebraska, and expense to this Board of J2.056.31. Water Mains and Sewer Ering the year extensions of water mains have been made to Agri - ;-Horticulture Hall and Machinery Hall, totaling 1,100 lineal feet, sanitary sewer 1,300 feet long and storm sewer 1,450 feet long, made »ry by the erection of the new building. Excavation and Fills I ring the year we have excavated and filled 5,628 cubic yards of in addition to the necessary dirt moving at Agriculture-Horticulture and for paving at the gate. This 5,628 cubic yards of dirt was a filling the draw running from the Burlington track to Cut-off Lake, to eliminate that depression from the tractor exhibit ground. It desire of the management to fill old Antelope Creek bed back of the barns as soon as funds are available. Midway Shows Iich year we have received numerous suggestions from persons ig for the elimination of the old style of Midway shows from the grounds, and while fully 50 per cent of all patrons seem to have ally patronized the Midway shows of the past, still we believe there srit in such suggestions. As soon as money can be spared for the Ion of commodious vaudeville theatres this evolution will take place, he demands for improvements far exceeds the money obtainable, so natural consequence care must be taken of exhibits first. </seg>
            <seg id="p022">Guards At the last fair we tried an innovation. Adjutant General Hall |&gt;re- &gt;.!iitd a plan of guarding the grounds with picked members of the Staie Militia. An agreenunt for such an experiment was entered into and car- ried out in a very satisfactory manner. The military guards were ex iri'Micly proficient in handling the crowds at the race track, and on th ts, and we wish to compliment Adjutant General Hall and the nu-m berg of the State Militia on the efficient service, combining the elements of courtesy and tirmness necessary for such success.

History of the Work As explained in the 1912 report, the State Board of Agriculture has consistently advertised the resources of the state out of state fair earn - ings without taking money from the pockets of the taxpayers. A bureau has been established and weekly notices sent out to the rural press, the country papers, the Western Newspaper Union, and the American Press Association. I'nder the operation of the Scott act the scope of the work has been broadened. A daily service was established for the metropolitan press and "feature stories" were prepared at regular intervals for the eastern papers. In 1913 the State Board of Agriculture collected the statistics and tabulated them. Furthermore, the statistics were published and dis - tributed in compliance with the terms of the act. In addition, a service wu established by which crop reports were issued at regular intervals during the growing season. This, supplementing the statistics turned in by the assessors, has built up a system of crop reporting which last season proved more accurate than the estimates of the government, if the opin - ions of many of the leading agriculturists of the state are to be relied upon. The expense of these undertakings have been defrayed out of the earnings of the fair, as above stated, and there has been no legislative appropriation for the work. In estimating crop yields the State Board of Agriculture uses the acreage reports turned in by the precinct assessors and the estimates of men who are actually in touch with production. For instance, precinct estimates of each crop are called for and both farmers and grain men are consulted. The precinct reports are averaged for the average yield </seg>
            <seg id="p093">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA 8TATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 91 of each county. By multiplying the average yield with the total acreage the production in each county is estimated. During the past season we are of the opinion that the results have been found more reliable than the federal system of averages. , Inters and stockmen should report in detail on the minor items of m. The poultry yard, the dairy operations, the number of acres lens and orchards should not be neglected in the least. Care in data on these details will provide surprising results. Nebraska ■h state; few of her sons and daughters realize the vastness of her , Let there be frank and candid discussion of these matters when inks are prepared for the county clerks each spring. Aiding Scientific Agriculture During the last year the policy of aiding all the various branches of agriculture has been most vigorously pursued. The department of pub - licity has effectively and substantially promoted many undertakings. For about two months this department circulated advertising matter for the exploitation of the dairy train. The horticultural interests of the state, the live stock situation, the better babies movement, the state con - servation work, all the various activities of the state fair, the silo situa - tion, educational work, the interests of the potato growers, and Ne - braska's resources have been effectually advertised at the expense of the State Board of Agriculture. In this connection, it should not be for - gotten that an immense task yet awaits the men and women who are interested in the upbuilding of Nebraska. There is not a day that does not bring its tale of some Nebraskan who has come to grief in other localities as a result of the land lure. In too many of these cases the dollars frittered away came out of Nebraska's fertile soil. Een production, advantages of schools, and markets, and other vital are considered, the lands of Nebraska are so reasonable in price safe from an investment standpoint that it is folly to look else for better bargains. The year of 1913, from the standpoint of the agriculturist, has been a succession of both gratification and disappointment — gratitude for an increasingly large yield of small grain with the largest wheat crop ever harvested, and disappointment over the dry weather which caused a decreased corn crop. The yield in corn is the smallest, with one excep - tion, of any season in the last eighteen years. Seventy thousand landowners and fifty thousand tenants last year raised crops aggregating the value of $280,967,432, as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p094">The Press With very few exceptions, the press of Nebraska as a whole is an institution of which we have just cause for pride. A more consistent lot of whole-souled boosters cannot be found in any state in the Union. The metropolitan press and the press associations have done their share, publishing columns and columns of matter, exploiting the state's re - sources. The weekly press, the country papers as some term them, have been particularly valuable in carrying the gospel of rural advancement. The most progressive farmers of the state read the local papers. Small items of news in these publications have produced most flattering results. No task seems to be too laborious for these editors to undertake and they do it without thought of reward. It should be the policy of the Board of Agriculture to consistently support any movement which will bring increased advertising patronage to these men, for the value of their services to the state of Nebraska cannot be approximated.

The registration is as follows: Within the last year Plant Industry Hall, costing with its equipment Iximately $100,000, has been completed and is occupied by the de - ents of agricultural botany, entomology, experimental agronomy orticulture. Additional buildings have become necessary, especially ich departments as dairy husbandry and agricultural engineering, hoped that with the final settlement of the University policy pro - may be made tor erecting these buildings with money made avail- able by the last legislature. The growth of work in home economics has been greater in the past ■ than in any previous year, and the building which was provided six years ago for this work is no longer sufficient Class-rooms are being used in other buildings, and laboratories must soon be in - il elsewhere or the dormitory features of the department done away The work in Agricultural Extension has developed, and new lines have been established. Two hundred and twenty-four farmers' institutes and special agricultural meetings have been held, with an attendance of 115,000 people. Fourteen agricultural short courses were held last year, with an attendance of 10,000 persons. During the month of September last a dairy special was run in cooperation with the State Dairymen's Association, covering 1,500 miles on the Northwestern and Burlington railways and making 68 stops. The train carried a herd of dairy cows, a full line of equipment for the farm dairy, and endeavored to promote better methods of dairying in the region covered. Splendid interest was shown wherever stops were made. Twenty-seven thousand people visited the train. Through the hog cholera serum work, farmers in many counties have f reached, sufficient serum having been produced for the treatment 2,000 hogs within the year.

Secretary Meixok: Now, gentlemen, if there is anything else you would like to know about which 1 have omitted from my report I shall be pleased to answer any questions. t Jacob Sass: I would like to ask one question, and that is in regard the misuse of the pass system. I would like to ask about the passes is year to the state fair. Sbcketaby Meixok: 1 suppose you have reference to the newspaper report in regard to the guest tickets. I will state that we ordered 800 guest tickets last year and got 836. Of those we gave 128 to the members of the legislature who had participated in the giving of the $100,000 building and $8,000 for land to be added to the fair ground; one to each member's wife or lady, which was 29. We gave 31 to our judges, 18 to superintendents that were other than the members of the Board, 18 to the scientific corps that are mentioned in our premium list. We gave 13 to the Board of Educational Lands and Funds, who have charge of the buildings which are erected on our grounds. We sent 43 away to sister fairs, like Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, Kansas, and different states all the way to New Jersey. Seven went to Iowa alone. The Board mem - bers, seven of us, took five each for what we thought were necessary for us to use for various purposes. Mr. Haws secured from me 56. These went through his hands, 1 do not know exactly where. Possibly some of the other Board of Managers know; maybe they went to the sheriff and his deputies, the water commissioner, the police department, and for such purposes as that. The total number I have mentioned is 371, I think. Gentlemen, I have over half of the passes in my box at the state house right now, and have shown them to some of the parties who de - sired to see them. That is the history of the pass question. Possibly I used six or eight passes to give to men who had forgotten their tickets and left them at home. I think Mr. George Potts was one of them. He was our superintendent of sanitation in place of Mr. Taylor, who was sick. If a total of less than a dozen passes unaccounted for is sufficient to build up a man's political prestige in Nebraska, I suggest that you who desire such a commodity now are advised of a cheap way to secure it. Chas. McLeod: I have wondered about that Labor Bureau. I see the appropriation was increased somewhat, and yet the agricultural statisti - cal labor was done in your office. Why was that appropriation increased? Secretaky Mellob: The committee on finance, ways and means of the legislature gave hearings to all of the state departments, and they were the ones that left this labor appropriation Just as it is. They took this action after our statistical bill was passed, because the bill for appropria - tions was about the last one to be considered. The legislature passed three bills and put the operating provisions of these bills in the hands of the labor commissioner, as you will note by referring to chapters 103, </seg>
            <seg id="p097">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 95 198 and 207 of the 1913 session laws. Some of them entail the necessity for a great deal of work along the line of inspection of factories in the state, and various other things, as the bill relative to the working of women and children in the factories. It is a fact, in my Judgment, that the Labor Bureau cannot begin to properly care for the activities that have been placed upon it by the legislature with the amount of money they are now receiving, so I do not think we cut any figure in the Labor Bureau appropriation when it was considered by the finance, ways and means committee. We had nothing to do with that. This committee was made up of the very best legislative minds of the session and I am sure that they did what they thought to be for the best interests of the state of Nebraska. ■«. Pubcell: Mr. Secretary, I have read somewhere of your pleading the -state press. Being in that line of work myself I should like to about it. Iretary Mellor: I have never written a word or said a word to ate press in any way at all pleading whether the State Board of ilture shall be investigated or not. I really shall feel glad if the igation is made. We have nothing to cover up. I claim the Board [culture has made the best use of Its money and has had the best ng of any institution in the state of Nebraska, and I challenge rison with other state institutions. ■ . l'i kcei i : We have been getting reports and bulletins sent out your department and I did not know whether I had been slighted Mr. James: I was wondering why Mr. Odell was left off. Secretary Meli.or: Mr. Odell secured a better position, one that paid more money than we could offer him, and his family necessitated his best earning power. We did not fire him; he left of own free will. He had the other job before he left us. He would probably have been with us yet if it had not been for that.

BANQUET OF STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND COUNTY FAIB ASSOCIATIONS Held at Commercial Club, January 20, 1914. H. P. Wilso.v, TOA8TM ASTER Toastmaster Wilson: We will now come to order. It is a pleasure and an honor for me to preside over this meeting this evening. When I look around me I see the character of the men of which this body Is composed, representative men from the most progressive communities of the state; men who have entered upon a work of education for the betterment of our state; men who are leaders in their own communities; men who come here not because they know all, but to learn more. Ne - braska stands today as one of the most progressive states in the Union, not only in her schools, but in the work which she is carrying on in - dustrially in her own field. The reason she has attained that high position is because of the high character of the men out over the state, men who are ready and willing to learn. That means on the part of those who take the time to come here a heavy sacrifice; it means they are giving their time and their money, not for selfish purposes, but for the purpose of building up their communities. Four years ago this organization was first launched. It has grown, and the wisdom of its being started is vindicated today, and has been in the years that have intervened, by the record that has shown in the organization of new agricultural societies. The agricultural society in each community must be built up by men who are willing to give their time and give ft un selfishly; they must give their money and give it unselfishly. There is not, I dare say, a county agricultural society in the state that could exist for one year if it were not for the time and money that those who are pushing it are putting into it. And yet it is a grand educational in - stitution. It is more than that, it is a social institution, a clearing houae where people meet socially and compare ideas and so advance the general prosperity of the community. Our purpose in these annual meetings la to exchange views. We have met here four years, are now beginning our fifth, I believe, and, as I said before, I esteem it an honor and a privilege to preside over such a body of men. I have no talk to make, but we have men here tonight who are able and willing, who will tell you things that are good. First, in order to prepare you for some things that may not be so digestible later on, we have with us an eminent doctor who will prescribe for us. I think maybe he will give us some </seg>
            <seg id="p103">Kstions which will enable us to get along with the ordeal that will later. I have the pleasure of introducing to you Dr. P. L. Hall of Du. Ham.: Mr. President, and members of the State Board of Agri - culture, State Fair Associations, 1-adies and Gentlemen: It has fallen to my lot tonight to welcome you to Lincoln on behalf of the Commercial Club of Lincoln, because of the unavoidable absence of the president of this club, Mr. Quiggle. It is certainly a pleasure to meet and greet you in this splendid building which we of Lincoln are proud to offer to you as a place where we may gather around the festive board and renew acquaintances. We are glad to welcome you to Lincoln because we know the prosperity of this city depends upon the agricultural prosperity of this state. We know that when you prosper we prosper, and when you suffer we suffer; therefore our interests are mutual and almost identical. I have watched with a great deal of interest the past few years the splendid work that is going on in this state in the way of agricultural development, or the development of scientific agricultuie, and I take it that such associations as are meeting in Lincoln now are the fathers of this splendid movement that bids fair to put Nebraska to the front of every state in the West, at least in agriculture. I chanced to be a member of the committee on agricultural development of the state which has kindly offered its services to you to lend assistance In this development of agriculture in the state, and in that way I have become somewhat familiar with the work that is going on in this line. Then it is also my privilege to assist these splendid teachers we hare here in Lincoln, such as Professor Condra and Professor Pugsley, and you cannot help but get from them, even in the casual moments you may meet them, the great idea of this agricultural development We are proud to offer you the courtesies of our city. We are proud of the city of Lincoln, and I, as one of the members of this club, am glad to extend to you as cordial a welcome as we know how. We think we have reason to be proud of this city with its broad streets, its beautiful homes and its growing business houses, with the splendid intelligence of its people, and ihe high moral character that is everywhere evidenced in the city. We are not hide-bound, as we are represented in some parts of the state; we are simply Intelligent enough to try to build up in the city a splendid citizen - ship, and we are proud to have you meet with us. I have a right to meet with you as a farmer, for I was born and raised on a farm and lived there until I was twenty-six years old, and I know all the hardships of pioneer farming in the state of Nebraska, in the days when I could not ride on a cultivator with an umbrella over me, nor on a harvester which bound the grain. There have been wonderful improvements since I was a farmer boy in the early history of the state, and as I go over the state now and see the splendid homes that everywhere give evidence of pros - perity in this state I think of the early days when the early pioneer sat in his shed or dugout and dreamed of days to come when the railroad and the city and the automobile would come to make life worth the </seg>
            <seg id="p104">102 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGKU'll.Tl HE Band I have lived to see those days come. On behalf of the city come you cordially. The gates are open and the keys are yours, nt you to come again, and again and again, and our hospitality all that we can give you. Gentlemen, I thank you. I.STMASTER Wii.so.n : On behalf of this club we accept the hoepi - you have so kindly offered us, In the same spirit in which it is We will now take up the program — "The Relation of Fair Officers ■semen." The speaker on that subject is not present on account cness at home. I have asked Mr. Riesen to kindly take up and • this matter. H. V. Riese.n : Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: I hope you will bear with me, as I have only had a very few moments to think of this matter — "The Relation of Fair Officers to Horsemen." I am told I am to take the opposite side from that I have been used to take. I have always been on the side of the fair managers. Mr. Wilson has instructed me to take the other side, and I will have to imagine myself a horseman for a while. The lot of the horseman, as a rule, is not easy. He may start out at the beginning of the season with a little money, but by the time he has been to three or four race meetings his funds begin to give out unless he wins, and as you all know there are only four prizes in each race. Sometimes it happens that a driver forgets himself and dis - tances the field, and then there is only one money. In this connection I want to tell you of an incident that happened a few years ago on our track at Beatrice. We had a good field of horses and, if I remember cor - rectly, it was the 2 : 13 pace. I think there were seven or eight starters.. The race went along the first heat, I think, in something like 2:16. We had some people on the ground who liked to make bets among them selves. Two gentlemen were betting and one said: "I don't think this race will go any faster than 2:16." The other said: "I will bet you $10." The bet was taken. The first gentleman went to the driver between heats and said: "Say, friend, how fast can that horse of yours pace?" He said: "He will go to thirteen all right." "I will give you $6 if you go faster than I:1S%." "All right, I will do it" The next heat, which was the third one, he started out to beat 2:16. He came along to the track once and was getting pretty fast. After he had passed the judges' stand at the half mile he began to draw away from his field of horses. People wondered what was up. The owner of the horse was standing in front of the judges' stand and I heard him say: "What is the matter with the man?" The man gauged his time correctly and so drove until he had advanced the whole field of seven horses that put the others all out. Of course, he got first money, but he came in at 2:12%, or something like that, and made a record that he did not have to make. You cannot im agine what happened to him after he left the track. The treatment of horsemen at fairs should be such I think' that they are satisfied, and I think in most of the meetings the horsemen are treated well. It is really to the advantage of the fairs and fair managers to be on good terms with horsemen. I have had the pleasure of being connected with the </seg>
            <seg id="p105">PROPKEDINfiS NERRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 10S races at the state fair, and T think I can say the management of the state fair have always treated the horsemen exceedingly well; I know of no other place where they are treated any better. A sort of friendship springs up between the horsemen and those who come in contact with them at the fairs every year and I find myself very glad to meet them as they come back year after year. Some of them I am not so glad to meet, but most of them are gentlemen and It Is a pleasure to meet them If they are treated well and their rights are considered, they will come again. They get used to certain tracks and managements. I want to gay another thing which I think Is of great Imnortance in these race meet - ings, and that is the fairness of the starter as well as the judges. It often happens that the starter has a good many friends among the horsemen on the track, and you often see a little favor here and a little favor there, and It Is the same with the Judges. I have often se«n In - justice done to the horsemen, but it Is Impossible sometimes to correct It right at the time, and the only thing to do is to be careful about the selection of the starters and officers and Judges for the next time. Then again. I thin'c the accommodations given to the horsemen should be such that they do not have to suffer. In most cases they are fairly good, even If they are only medium, and once in a while they are bad. I attended a race meeting last fall where I really wondered that the horsemen had come to such a meeting and to such a track, to such stalls and barns as they were given. They raced In a cloud of dust, no straw wu put on the track and It was not even smoothed off, and when the drivers came in after the race they looked more like colored men than white men. I hope you will take up this discussion and be satisfied with Just the start I have given it. I hope to hear from others on this sub - ject; I have simply taken the place of another gentleman. I want to thank you for your forbearance. Toastmaster Wilson: Mr. Riesen simply presented the matter for the absent one. Now we would like to hear from those present as to their standpoint. The discussion Is yours. I Duncan: I want to add my testimony to the driving horse. I kid yet at seventy-flve and I never allow my children or my wife 1 a risk with any other person on the road. The horse is the noblest t that God ever created. You may have your automobile, but give e horse. I am glad the gentleman stands up in defense of the g horse. E.stmaster WiLsoN: We would like to hear from some one else as relation of the fairs to the horsemen. This is one of the Important ins that you have at each fair. Perhaps the chair Is mistaken and o trouble arises on this question at all. W. R. Mellok: I would like to ask if there are any persons who desire to have any changes in the rules which horsemen now enjoy through the American Trotting Association. I expect to be present at their meeting next month in Chicago, and if you have any opinions as to any rules which you would like introduced at that time I would like to hear from you. </seg>
            <seg id="p106">104 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE Bstmaster Wilson: I think that is a matter that can well be dig - here. I think it would be well to give Mr. Mellor the proxies of rerent organizations so that he may take the matter up at the 3 meeting and ask for whatever is necessary. Mb. Riesen: We have looked over those rules, Mr. Mellor, and so far as our association or myself are concerned I think those changes that have been suggested in Chicago are good. I know of none there that would work any hardship for the horseman or the association KJ. JonNRON: Mr. Chairman, I want to ask if any one here cmn the problem of how a fair association is going to give $400 prizes &gt;me out even. We have never been able to do it at our race meets. Mr. Riesen: Don't give it. Toabtmaster Wilson : If there is nothing further on that we will pass to the subject of "A Well Balanced Program," by Mr. H. Pickett of Mr. Pickett: Mr. President and Fair Managers: The subject of a well balanced program that has been assigned to me by your secretary. Brother Smith, is one that requires a good deal of thought, study and judgment when the programs are being arranged for the county fairs, as it is necessary to take into consideration so many things before definitely deciding on any free act, unless, of course, you have all your facts at hand, or you prefer a hit-or-miss program to one where every fact Is given consideration. First, you should have a statement of re - ceipts for prior years, so that out of this sum your allowance or esti - mate of money for your attractions could be made. Second, consider what attractions your crowd would enjoy best as a whole, and what the ma - jority of them would enjoy. Then you will know, or have a good idea of how to divide your allowance. Third, arrange your attractions so they will not conflict with any other feature of your program. Fourth, always keep in mind your admission fee at the gate, whom you shall charge admission. I mean by this, whether you charge admission to the ground for children just the same as the grown-ups. You know the money at the gate is what has to pay most of the running expense of your fair. I have in mind a fair that allowed all children under sixteen years of age free admission to the grounds, and this same fair booked a dog and pony show which cost them $400. I hold that the booking of this show was very poor judgment, in that the receipts to offset this show should have come from the children. So you see there are many things to be considered in making a program for county fairs. Fairs or agricultural associations were primarily organized for the purpose of comparing grains, live stock, new farm implements, the many, many good things that the farmers' wives and the ladies in town put up for use in the winter time, also the different articles they make with their needles in winter, and the ones the judges find, in their opinion, the best, they award prizes to. They have not changed this custom to the present day. In some communities where there are a sufficient number of breeders of </seg>
            <seg id="p107">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 105 thoroughbred stock, a parade of cattle and horses would be a capital Idea, and no doubt some of you have such a parade. A good band is one of the best features for a fair, and a good speed program is another number one feature, as you will always find a crowd lined up along the race track watching the races. I don't believe in overdoing the races, but I do like to see good ones. Your allowance for this feature of your program should be estimated from your receipts also. Our band starts from the business district of the town at 1 o'clock in the afternoon, and it is like the old circus days when we were all children, the crowd will follow a band, if it is a good one, down to the fair ground. The band then stops in front of the horticultural hall, where they play some good live selection, and while the band is playing a free act on the bars or con - tortion work of some kind is most appropriate. At the close of this the band then proceeds down to the band stand near the amphitheatre, where another act should be staged in grout of the grandstand. This will take up the time until about 2 o'clock, when it is time for the races to begin. Now, regarding races: I would advise every race committee to put on their long races the first days of the fair and end up with short ones. You will find that you will have better races. Personally, I prefer a run - ning race to a harness race, if it is a race. If they are not races I care nothing for them, and that is exactly the way every person that stands along the track or observes them from the grandstand feels, so make them races, if possible. This is a hard part of the program for the secre - tary to handle, and I would advise a race committee for this, if you can get the right ones to handle it. The right ones do not mean altogether the ones that understand races, but it means those who will handle it ac - cording to the rules of the game. If you have three days races, wind them up one day an hour earlier and put on an automobile parade, making an offer through the columns of your local papers that on such and such a day an automobile parade will be held and the most beauti - fully decorated automobile will receive a prize of $50, second $25 and third $10, or amounts in this order. Have them drive around your race track and your judges award the prizes from in front of the grand - stand. This will add much interest to your program. What would no doubt be as good a drawing card as the best for a county fair, and I hope that our association tries it, would be to get, if possible, the cow that gives more milk than any other cow in the world. Advertise it and it will draw you a crowd. Now I do not know if this is possible, but I intend to write and ascertain. County fairs are farmers' institutions, and they are the ones who should be given every considera - tion when arranging your program. You will doubtless remember that P. T. Barnum'8 success lay in the fact that he had the biggest things In his day of any show on the road. Tom Thumb, the smallest man In the world, and Jumbo, the largest elephant, etc. That is the kind of dope that makes a hit with the people. Compare the difference between thaw two headings and draw your own conclusions: KINENT BESS, the cow that gives more milk than any other cow world. </seg>
            <seg id="p108">BEGMAN'S DOG AND PONY SHOW, the greatest show of its kind on the road. The former means something of interest to your community, as ever} one living in Nebraska is interested in the things or subjects that in - terest the farmer. The latter means "fun for the children" mostly. The State Farm at Lincoln has some tine cattle, in fact many of them have taken prizes at various stuck shows around the country. These would make good attractions. It will of course cost something to get them and a professor to lecture about them, but I believe arrangements could be made for them. In fact, if the state would send out their seed corn lecturers and their cattle and horse lecturers during the county fairs, where they would get crowds so easily to talk to. there would be a whole lot more sense to that than the seed corn specials that are run each year. Possibly all the counties of the state would then get an opportunity to hear them, and in all probability the county fair managers would entertain them while they were in each respective county. Another feature that adds much interest to fairs is the better babies contest, and a suggestion right here to ail of you who have not put on a contest of this kind. If you have a woman's club In your town, put the matter up to them and tell them that it will be a great thing for the community to hold one, and that your county fair will be the place to hold it. The Woman's Home Companion will be glad to co - operate with you, furnish blanks, etc., which will be of much assistance to you. Ours last year was a great success. I thank you. Toastmasicb Wilson : This is open to discussion. Mt. Dickinson: I would like to know it' any county fair association has tried offering prizes for the best kept farm in the county or anything along that line, or if it is practicable. We thought if we would offer, say, five premiums which could be awarded to a renter as well as an owner, it might be an attraction, but whether it would or not I don't know. One difficulty might be getting a farm on exhibition at a fair. We thought possibly that a farmer would have to enter his farm about the first of June and It would have to be inspected in June and again in August and prizes would be awarded in August, which would be a tablet on which was placed the owner or renter of the farm and where located. These tablets would be placed on posts and would be on exhibition at the fair during the time of the fair, after which each winner would take his prize home with him. Mk. A.vutHbo.N : I am somewhat interested in this county fair busi - ness. The gentleman who spoke a little bit ago gave me an idea about having the cow that gave the most milk of any cow in the world. I do not know whether we could get that cow in the United States or not It Is doubtful, as I came from the best dairy country in the world. Me talked as if he wanted this for an attraction. I think the idea Is to give a good prize or premium on the cow that gives the most milk during the three days of the fair. I was just thinking the dairy proposition is get - ting to be quite a problem in Nebraska. It would be a great thing tor </seg>
            <seg id="p109">the county fairs to put a premium on the cow that save the most milk s«y from Tuesday morning until Friday morning of the fair, and have the Judges keep the record. A great many people nowadays are making a business of raising dairy cows and selling them and it might be a good advertisement for these people to bring such a cow to the county fair. This dairy business Is a matter of money and every one is reaching out for good cows. If a man would bring to the county fair a cow that would give the most milk of any cow in the county and take away the prize I believe It would be a good drawing card. As president of the county fair of Custer county I think I will make use of that suggestion, only In a different way from what I understood the gentleman to mention. T am going to offer a prize to the cow that gives the most milk during the three days of the fair. Mr. Camfbd.l: I want to bring out the feature of the individual cows at a dairy show. I live seventeen miles away from the county seat, but I tooli my little boy. who \r nearly eight, and an older boy who Is doing the milking for me They listened to the lecture on the cow which was on exhibition. Some weeks later that little boy saw a picture of a cow. There was no name that I noticed and he of course would not have known it if there had been. He said that looks like Katy Orben and he told me more about Katy Gerben at that fair than I had seen. Now that little eight-year-old boy had observed closely and all of his life he will remember that he saw the cow Katy Gerben. It gave me a splendid idea and It may be the making of a dairyman of him. Mb. Dtingan: I would like to emphasize the feature this friend sug gested in trying to get our tenants wakened un. If we could offer sufB i -lent prizes for the best conducted tenant farm, I think It would come back home to us. The tenants do not take the Interest they should. In 1894 on my farm I raised sixty bushels of corn to the acre. My tenant last year raised twenty bushels. Two years ago my tenant raised ninety bushels on the same ground. That was the third year after the field had been seven years in alfalfa. The government fixed It in good shape for me, being the old Port Kearney site. I have tried to be as liberal as possible with my boys. Two of them went through your school. I am proud of your schools and I would like to be proud of our tenant farmers If we can waken them up and I believe we can. Speaking of a well balanced program, there was one point that has confronted us, and that Is the rainy day. We are dependent almost wholly upon our attendance the middle day of the fair, Thursday, and If anything goes wrong on that day and our receipts are materially de - creased, the expenses are the same. A good many of the fairs are con - fronted perhaps with this same condition. The suggestions relative to the dairy show and farm exhibits I think are all right. While they may not be so practical in some counties I am sure they might be in others and would be of real benefit. Another point I would like to bring out is the stock judging proposition at our county fairs. I think every fair oucht to have a stock ludtrtnc amphitheatre The stock could be brought </seg>
            <seg id="p110">Bit of the amphitheatre and the experts can give pointers that will rr-al benefit to the farmers' and give them something they can take lome with them. While the fair is sort of an entertainment feature, should be made instructive also. M«. Pottek of Brown County: I have had experience In the county fair business for about fifteen years, and it is an uphill business to suc - cessfully conduct a county fair, especially in those western counties where the population is only about half, or less than half, of what it is in the counties in the eastern part of the state. My friend has made some suggestions that I believe might be a drawing card. Now of course we intend to have as good an exhibit as we can possibly get, and we generally have a pretty good exhibit, but the attendance is not sufficient to pay out such premiums as we ought to pay. My society has cut out horse races almost entirely, because we were not able to offer the pre - miums and take the chances, and we have succeeded just exactly as well and 1 think our attendance has been a little better. Our friend from Wahoo suggested that we have a better babies contest. We have a Woman's Suffrage Club in our town and I think the baby contest would be a good drawing card. But what I want to suggest mainly is this: If the Experiment Station here in Lincoln could only furnish a demon - strator to every county fair in keeping with the exhibit, I believe you would see a wonderful improvement. Men will read about matters, as to how to conduct a farm, etc., and what is necessary to make a success - ful farmer, but it is not like putting up the goods. I believe if arrange - ments could be made so that there could be a representative from the Experiment Station to demonstrate their work right there it would be one of the best things we could do for the county fair. I don't know how it is with other counties, but in my county only about one-fourth of the people take any interest in the fair. Of course they will go merely to see the show and to help out a little, but they don't seem to realize the benefit to be derived from a county fair. For instance, a demonstrator from the Experiment Station could visit six or seven fairs over the Northwestern, if they were arranged so they do not conflict. I think you would find this would make a great difference to the agricultural interests of Nebraska. Brown county has had an exhibit at the state fair for the last ten or eleven years. It is quite an expense to get up an exhibit, and it seems to me that in counties where there is an agricultural society this society ought to assist in the expense of putting on this exhibit at the state fair, as it is the greatest advertiser for a county there is; no doubt about it. I believe our exhibit at the state fair has raised the price of land in Brown county $25 per acre. Land was selling there from about $16 to $20 per acre, and you cannot buy it today for $85 or $90. They realixe it is just as much advertisement for the county to have an exhibit here as it is. to Nebraska to have an exhibit to publish to the world what we have in this state. We are all working for Nebraska and the people of Nebraska. Mr. Odkii.: Mr. Chairman: Mr. Potter has said some things I think </seg>
            <seg id="p111">tht not to forget. We might take some of our hired men at the nent Station and put them to good use at the county fair. I have I privilege of studying closely the work of the University and I 1 entirely new conception of the University since I have got out the people. I believe the highest obligation the University owes people who sustain it is to serve those people to the utmost. I • pay a tribute to the talent and ability of the splendid men we have in the University. T printed an article in my paper a few weeks ■about that wonderful cow, La May. I was foolish enough to take my &gt; from a daily newspaper. I ought to have known better. But the I of the department of dairy husbandry saw tit to send the facts out le daily press before he sent them to the farm press, consequently I my facts twisted, because I did not get them from headquarters. It wonderful story as I printed it, but I got an awful calling down from &gt;ver the state because I had Raid half the truth concerning La May. I lose farmers do not realize that this is their cow. They do not e that this professor who is looking after her and the students who working under him are simply their hired men. They have got an some way or other that that cow is petted and coddled under en - different conditions than their own stock. There was a suggestion here as to an exhibition in the dairy line that seems to be a splen - ling if brought along with a practical lesson. We have the best farmers in Nebraska that are to be found anywhere and I suspect they know a whole lot more than we give them credit for. That was impressed upon my mind very forcibly in Omaha when I at - tended the meeting of business men interested in the farm demonstration movement. Professor Spillman made a little talk on this subject of farm demonstration, etc., and a great many questions were asked him. Among them was the question. "What do you consider the qualifications neces - sary for a county demonstrator?" He said: "We think in the first place he ought to be a man with a personality, a young man full of vitality and force who was raised on the farm. Necessarily because of the technical requirements, he should have an agricultural college train - ing. Then he ought to have pone back to the farm and worked upon a farm long enough to forget about half he has learned in college and be able to put in force the other half which he learns from farmers with whom he comes in contact." I believe there is a whole lot to that. If some system could be worked out by which we could get these splendid men of ours out from the Experiment Station and let them come in every-day contact with the men who have their feet on the ground, there would be a new under - standing come about among the people and the agricultural college, which is the greatest servant of the people. I suspect they could come a little bit closer together and much of this prejudice and misapprehension that comes about would be dispelled by this personal contact. I believe it beats all of the seed corn trains and dairy specials which could be run for the next thousand years to come. A county fair association is the greatest educational center we have. </seg>
            <seg id="p112">110 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICI ' TIRE Just a step further. I was very much impressed with what Mr. Ptekett says about a well balanced program. Had he had time to enter into this subject he would havp said some more things. A fair, as my friend over there says, is a place of entertainment. It is also a place of instruction and education. There hos been a lot of fun made of my very pood friend, and yours, our secretary cf the state fair, because he has maintained the fair is an educational institution, but he is right. I to tell you there is no place upon the face of the earth where a man can pet as good practical valuable education in a snaee of a single day as he can in a day at a fair, if he is disnosed to observe it. The best nlace I know of to get that sort of education is at the best fair in the t T nlted States and I believe in the world — th^ state of Nebraska. These old exhibitors who have been coming down here year after year are going to fall by the wayside presently and we will have to brine; in youne men and train them up in the way of gettini un these snlendH exhibits we all enjoy, and we must get a good system of exnert judeins: judges who can go out to our county fairs in the state and educate our boys and girls, the men and women who are goine to be the one"? that will make our state fair greater In the future. Here is a distinct field of popular education which lies at our hand which we should avail ourselves of. People become surfeited with education. I sometimes think we educate too much. Sometimes it is better if we could go off and forget some of the things we learn from the teacher. Then in the way of amusements; we must have amusement, but by all moans let us have those that are clean and wholesome. I have seen things at your county fair grounds, and I have seen things on your state fair grounds, that I would not take my sons and daughters to see. The public has a right to ask and demand of you. when you establish a great educational institution like this I have mentioned, that the amusements furnished shall be clean and wholesome. Cut out the hioehi - coochi shows, the skirt dancers, etc. I know it is hard to get anythin? else, but there ought to be some place in this United States where a high set of morals can be found, where we could eo when we want an entertainment and say to them, give us something clean, at the same time legitimate, to entertain our people, or else stay away; we don't want you. We should demand that here in Nebraska, and it is just such organiza - tions as this that can bring this about. These are some of the things I think should be considered with reference to a well balanced program. The more closely you approach this idea the more fully you will establish yourself in the confidence of your home people and the higher the stan - dard you will set for the future. I Graff: My friend Odell I rather think has started something. 3 given us a very entertaining talk on that line, but I will differ im, and I believe many of you will also, in that he has put the matter hoochi-eoochi show and things of that sort a little too strong for ite fair. For the last ten years, or rather for the last twenty-five I have had the opportunity for pretty close observation of condi- </seg>
            <seg id="p113">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 111 tions existing at our state fair. I had the opportunity last fall of visit - ing the South Dakota state fair. The president of that association, Mr. Hill, an old friend of mine, had been extending to me an annual invita - tion for several years to come out and visit their fair. When I got ready to leave Huron 1 told Mr. Hill, "By all means come down and visit the Nebraska state fair." He wanted to know how they compared. I said, ' They do not compare." There is no comparison, gentlemen. Talk about hoochi-coochi dances. I want to say to you that the South Dakota state fair actually had all the fortune tellers I had ever seen, heard or read of; they had all the fortune wheels; they had high divers; they had a heavy weight female diver that would come down into the water for about fifteen feet. She weighed 30U pounds at least. They were the chief attractions at that fair, and as a member of the State Board of Agricul - ture of Nebraska 1 want to say to you that of all other fairs, and I have visited many of them and a good many times, 1 believe today Nebraska puts up as clean a fair as any state that I know of. At the same time I want to confess, if I had it all my own way, I would go a little further along the lines my friend Udell suggested, but I realize, gentlemen, that these things cannot all be brought about at once. I believe it is better lo tdutate our people along that line and come to it gradually. I think it works better. The great problem seems to be how to get the people to come to our fairs, either county or state. I realize they must have the attendance, and it is impossible to conduct any kind of a fair absolutely along Sunday school lines. I hope the day may come when every single soul will want to see the fairs conducted along that line, but I am afraid it will not be in my time. P.VMMASTKK Wilson: If there is nothing further along that line 11 pass along and take up the next subject, which is a very impor - ne, that of awarding premiums. The matter has been touched upon &gt;hat in the discussion which has followed. However, we will take under a heading of itself, led by Mr. L. H. Cheney: .Mi;. Ciit.stv: Awarding premiums is what interests the exhibitors and their friends, and to the winners it is as welcome as the call of the dinner bell. As exhibitors, we favor more and larger premiums sl.\1 the introduction of new classes. The wish to excel, to win, is second nature to the exhibitor, and while the laurel was a sufficient reward to the an - cient Greek, today a more substantial prize is required, not because we are so much more selfish, but because of the necessary expense Incident to preparing and showing the various exhibits. The average exhibitor would like to see the blue card on every worthy exhibit, particularly on his own. His state of mind toward his competitors before and after the awards are made may be illustrated by the story of two Irishmen. Mike and Pat had been friends of long standing. Mike, during his absence in the city, became a socialist and on his return to the farm Pat heard of it and wanted to learn what it is to be a socialist, and at the first chance inquired, "Mike, are you a socialist?" "Yis," answered Mike. Pat— 'Well, what is a social!*? How U it? Tell me about It" </seg>
            <seg id="p114">112 PROCEKDIXCiS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE "Now it is this way," says Mike. "If I had two mill/on dollars I would give you one million and I would keep one million, or if I had two good farms I would give you one and I would keep one. That is a socialist." Pat — "And thin, Mike, ye are a socialist?" Mike — "I am that," Pat — "Now Mike, and if ye had two pigs?" Mike — "Away wid ye, Pat, ye know I hev two pigs." As managers of county fairs we sometimes view with alarm the extension and growth of the premium list, knowing the limited and uncertain income. Should premiums be awarded on each new breed of stock and poultry and the many new varieties of farm ;irodui ts? 1 his appears to be one of the best ways of bringing them and their relative value compared with older kinds to public attention and thus give the public the benefit of any superiority possessed by the new. In awarding premiums at the county fairs the single judge system is growing in favor. In my own county of Frontier we have used this system in the live stock and poultry classes for the past seven years. An experienced outside party to do this awarding has given better satisfaction than the old sys - tem of a committee of three local judges. We make it a practice to print the name of the judge in the premium list with the superintendent of the class, and in publishing the list of winners to gi.v the names of the judges awarding the premiums. I would offer two suggestions in awarding premiums at county fairs: First, make the awards early. In Justice to the visitors as well as exhibitors, premiums should be awarded in time to have the cards and ribbons on during the last two days of the fair. To do this requires the cooperation of exhibitors with the manage - ment in getting all entries made promptly within the required time. Second, give ample notice of the time for stock judging. Make this one of the entertainments as well as educational features. Have the band at hand with their music; work them overtime if need be. Get the crowd and get the crowd interested, popularize this feature of the fair. The interest frequently, usually, grows in proportion to the size of the crowd. The stock is seen at its best in the show ring. The exhioHor-s are en - titled to and will appreciate this attention and the attendance. They will be better satisfied and become our cordial supporters and advertisers for the next fair. Toastmaktek Wilson: The printed program before us does not give just what we have for our program. This discussion will be opened by Dean E. A. Burnett of the Agricultural School. Mb. Burnett: Members of the Association: It has occurred to me in visiting a few of the county fairs that if it were possible for the management to have all of the live stock on the grounds early so that the judge might begin work on the morning of the second day, we will say, that would be a rather more satisfactory arrangement. I have aeon a number of fairs where the secretary could not get the books closed, could not get the entries in so that everybody was ready to show, and it would help a fair a great deal if the judging could be done early. An - other thing which it occurs to me would help a good deal if it could be accomplished. I do not know whether it is possible or not, but a good </seg>
            <seg id="p115">deal of the stock that goes to the county fair is out of condition; it has not been in any way prepared for the fair. The farmer picks up his hogs from his farm. His horses might be in a little better shape, but if he brings hogs, cattle or sheep it is almost certain they will come right out of his yards without putting them in condition to show. The farmer who has purchased a good animal and paid a good price frequently will let this animal get entirely out of condition and does not understand why some other animal which he thinks is Inferior, and which may be inferior in some ways, but it happens to come forward in condition, why this animal should score over his animal which he believes is a good one. A judge can never get over that question of condition. It is al - most impossible for a judge to presume what an animal would be if he was a good deal better than he is, and you cannot tie ribbons on that basis. You are forced to tie the ribbons and award the premiums on the animals as they stand. If there were any way by which the fair manage - ment could get a line on the men who are to exhibit and stir up a little interest in this matter some weeks in advance so that the men who con - template exhibiting at the county fair would get ready and get his animals in nice condition, it would certainly be a big advertisement for his stock, better than if he takes his stock rough froi-i the yard. That would be of great advantage to the fair and of great advantage to the breeder. Possibly some of you fair managers could suggest how this could be done. If this were possible I think it would strengthen your fair a great deal. I think another point was suggested further back by a man speaking on another subject, in regard to the explanation of the awards. A judge who is at all consistent and has been at this work long enough, or if his judgment is matured, is nearly always glad to explain bis award to the people at the ring, as it is not always apparent. Fre - quently it is not apparent to the man at the ring side who has not had ma good an opportunity to inspect the animal. I think a most excellent plan would be to so arrange the judging that the explanation of the awards can be made public and the reason stated. Frequently the owner who is disappointed and feels he has not been treated finite right would take the place he is given with much better grace if an explanation of the award was made him. To accomplish this it would be practically necessary to have a ring of some sort where the animals could be as - sembled, at least the cattle, sheep and hogs, so the people will not be scattered in among the animals and so interfere with the work of the judge. I* you will rope off a place for the animals to be shown then the people wi!l gather around that. Be sure to make it large enough so that a large number of people can get around it and be able to see, and then the judge will also have a better chance to work, for if he is too close to the animals he cannot use his best judgment If it is toward night, when the sun is low, then the shadows on the stock he is judging very materially affect their appearance. That is not only true at county fain, but also at state fairs. I think a good deal of interest could be awakened If it were possible to do a few of these things I have mentioned. There </seg>
            <seg id="p116">114 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE is one matter I should like to speak of, though I do not know how it could be remedied. I cannot suggest a way. One of the most difficult things which any judge has to contend with, especially at a county fair, is the placing of animals where there is no competition or no real competition. After a farmer has taken the trouble to bring an animal to the fair and exhibit him, even it' it is an interior animal, he is unwilling to be placed down below nothing. It' there is a superior animal above him that is an excuse for not awarding first place to an inferior animal. A judge is put in one of the most diflu uk places when there is no competition, and as a result the one animal generally gets the blue card. That is the easiest way out of it for the judge, and generally the superintendent does not know any better way out of it. I think sometimes the rules do say when there is no competition ihe money prizes shall be cut in two, or something of that soit. In grain, etc., I think a good deal of the same method might be followed. Get your exhibits together as early as pos - sible, give the judge an opportunity to go over them and then explain to the people who are interested why the award was made, and if that can be done in a great many interests it will add greatly to the interest, u; course I would like to see a sufficient number of dHM H tfcM iniuiuls not like each other would not compete in the same class, but in county fairs I think you could overdo this classification by getting too many classes where them is little competition, so there are occasions when it might be justified to put all breeds of hogs together. An effort should be made to get enough interest before the fair by advertising it and by personal solicitation so that there will be good exhibits in several classes and then make the classification as carefully as you can. Make as many classes as your funds will warrant and the exhibits will warrant in the state fair I think the classifications are generally good, because the competition between the classes with which 1 am familiar is always sc tie. In reference to this plan which has been mentioned once or twice of competition say in milk production, getting the best milking cows in the community together and running an actual dairy contest, I think this would awaken a large amount of interest, and I believe something 01 this sort could be put on in a number of places and that you would find it was worth while. Possibly that can be carried to other things besides dairy cows, but that would be one of the easiest. Tuastjiastku Wilson: The subject is open for general discussion. There does not seem to be much interest in this subject. I would like to 3.1) to Dean Burnett our trouble is not so much the Kind of av.anU as to get some one to make the awards, to get competent judges? We have gone to considerable trouble in that line at our fair and whenever we have had competent judges we have had no trouble with our exhibitors. When the reason is given for the awarding of a certain premium, our ex - hibitors are very reasonable in that respect, but sometimes it has been a little difficult to get judges upon whom the exhibitors look as being per - fectly competent. I do not know how it has been with other fairs, but that hflji been our main trouble. If any one has anything more to offer upon </seg>
            <seg id="p117">PROrEEDINnp NKRRASKA STATE BOARD OF AORICTr.TrRE 115 this we would like to hear from them; if not, we will pass to the next 0. W. Hkrvey: T think Professor Burnett brought out a very strong nroposition when ho s^iid the judee should explain his decision. If a judge is not able to tell why he distinguishes between animals and point out the difference and convince the neonle who are interested bystanders around the ring, he is not competent to be a judge, and a man that is not competent to tell why tho awards are made should not be employed in any fair. I saw this thing pretty satisfactorily carried out a few years ago at Sioux City. I went with Prof. H. R. Smith. We were talking about judges and the awarding of prizes, and this very same question came up He said, "What do you think of a proposition of this kind here at Sioux City?" He was going there as a judge of beef cattle T said to him, "I believe it is all rieht and you are a good man to in - troduce it," and he did try it. It worked out splendidly, could not have hern better, but he did not get through that proposition without quite a little discussion. The only drawback Is that it encourages discussion with the fellows around the ring, and it is necessary that the judge be very sure of his position. There was not a single discussion that arose that Professor Smith did not bring the man into the ring and show him why he had awarded the premium as he did. and they were all satisfied While those fellows were standing around the ring there was some little difference of opinion and there was good ground for It too, for the ani - mals were closely matched, so closely that two pretty good judges might examine them and not come to the same conclusion. There is no question but what this idea will work at county fairs and there is no question hut -what you should adopt It. I don't care what the department Is, If the judge is not able to tell to the Inquirer and bystander why he has awarded a premium, he is certainly incompetent to make the award. Tt is simply a guess with him, and you cannot afford to employ judges who are puessers. If you take a man as Judge from your Experiment Station or Agricultural College, let him be an instructor for the time being and tell why the premium awards are made. M&gt; A&gt;'dkrson: I think as the gentleman who spoke a few moments aeo. that we should be satisfied with the ribbons when it comes to premiums, but the exhibitor seems to think otherwise. When I see a farmer with some fine stock T sny to him, "Why don't you bring some of your cattle down to the fair?" He replies that It does not nay; that it costs no and so to get them ready and hire a man to get them there. But it has come to the noint where everything has a commercial value, where everything is valued by dollars and cents. The ordinary exhibitor does not consider the value he gets out of it in advertisement, though if he has a pood thing he brings it to the fiir and advertises it. The ex - hibitor wants everything he can pet his hands on; he Is not satisfied with the advertisement or the educational feature, but he wants the money, and that is what every one of us county fair managers is u&gt;i fratnst. Tf we could only get the people to brine In their stuff and note </seg>
            <seg id="p118">U« PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the difference between the poor and the good and make the comparison the ohject of the fair, we would have a great fair. But we are up against a different proposition, we have to award premiums so as to make it pay (he exhibitor in money values, and I am here tonight to learn something along this line. One gentleman said they have eliminated the horse race at their fair. We could not do that in our county fair, as they like to see the horses run and so we have to have the races. But I think the premiums should be sufficient to pay the farmer's expense for bringing the stock, and then if we could Just instill into these people the idea of bringing their best products and demonstrate to the people their ability as good farmers it would be a fine thing. A farmer ought to be as proud of his vocation as any other business man, and if a farmer would bring his best horses and cattle and hogs to the fair his neighbors would recognize his ability along this line, as it shows he is a master of his vocation as a farmer. The interest In the farm would increase. As a rule the farmer is not proud of his profession and has the impression he does not amount to anything, but he is entirely wrong. This is one thing I want to especially emphasize. If there are any newspaper men here tonight I would like to suggest that they could do much in this di - rection by items in their papers occasionally and making the farmer feel that his vocation is an honorable one, that it is something to be proud of to be able to raise and sell good horses, good cattle, and good hogB. Mk. Black max: The thought has Just occurred to me, for instance, what percentage of the receipts of a fair ought to go Into premiums? Now I know that sometimes a man who brings the exhibits has an Idea there is too much money being spent for the entertainment features and that he is not receiving enough consideration. In Madison county last year we paid about $1,000 for program and our total receipts were about $4,000. Of course there are a good many expenses besides entertainment, and out of the balance we paid off some of the debt, about $500, but I was wondering if some one would not bring out in this discussion about what percentage ought to go into these premiums, and if we ought not to take that into consideration when we are making up our program so as not to get it top-heavy. Toastmarteh Wii.son : I would like to say a word on that. We offer about twice as much In money premiums as we ever pay. That does not mean that some one is disappointed, because we pay every premium that is awarded, and if we do not have the money in the treasury we borrow it. No man that deserves a premium comes to our fair and goes away without it. He understands that in the first place. He cannot complain that the premiums are not what he ought to get, for he knows Just what he is to get. providing he wins out. You know what your own exnenaca are and every community has to learn several things for themselves I think. One of them is what is going to bring returns so they can pay their premiums. You must have a good attendance in order to get money to pay premiums and you must provide entertainment to get them there. You have your races. Some communities will not need </seg>
            <seg id="p119">PROCEEDINGS NEBRA8KA STATE BOARD OF AGRICUI.Tl.RE 117 that, they will take something else. Every community has its own tastes in that respect. Some places I suppose they will go just to look at the pigeons and hogs; others, they will go to see the horse race, and others will go to see the dog show. Your success depends largely upon you and you will have to size up the situation largely in vour own locality. And then an important thing in the matter of premiums is to know you have competent judges. If you have an exhibitor go away satisfied he will come again the next year, even if he did not get any - thing. Dean Burnett spoke of one important thing, and that is the difficulty in saying to an exhibitor your animal is not worthy of first premium. If a competent judge can show the vital defects in the animal, the exhibitor, as a rule, if he is fair and reasonable, will understand it. But it requires a judge with tact as well as knowledge to do these things. IDokiiling: A few things came to my mind as this gentleman about the exhibitor taking everything they could get their hands d about making awards where only one animal is shown. In our ition where an animal is not worthy of first money we give him place, but some get around that by bringing in three animals so take the first, second and third money. Can you help us out on ■ASTMA8TF.it Wii-son : We do not specify whether there is competi - &gt;r not, but simply whether the animal or article is worthy of the urn. Mit. Doehlinq: But if three of them are in the ring, you would have to give first, second and third, would you not? Toastm aster Wilson: If they are worthy of it. Mr. Chase: I think this suggestion might help him a little, and that Is to make only one entry in each class. Toastmaster W11.80N: We do not do that in individual classes. If it were a manufactured article it might be a different proposition, but in the live stock we won't prohibit them from making as many entries as they want, providing they have the exhibits there. We will now pass to the next subject by Prof. C. W. Pugsley. Mr. Pugsley: Prefacing my remarks with some notes that have occurred to me in connection with the things that have been said, I would like first of all to use as an excuse some things that have been said about the student and college; to emphasize the duty of the people at the station and college to the people of the state, and the work they are hired to do. I think I am safe in saying, am I not, Dean Burnett, that practically all, if not all, of the heads of departments at your experiment station are farm raised boys, and that the majority of them are Nebraska farm raised boys, and that not a few of them have gone back to a farm after they graduate, before they have come back to the Experiment Sta - tion. I know I am safe in saying this, so far as I am concerned and the majority of them out there. And I would like to say we are not working for ourselves, but for the people whom we serve. And we implore the people of the state of Nebraska to tell us what they would like as to do. </seg>
            <seg id="p120">IIS PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE We want In so far as possible that the head of each department con - nected with the College and Experiment Station shall come In contact with as many farmers of the state as possible for htm to do. Many of these teachers who are teaching the 1.200 students now taking agricul - ture in the College and School of Agriculture at the Farm do not have time to get out into the state without neglecting resident students when school is in session, and when school is not in session you people are too busy and are not ready for meetings; and you don't like to be bothered too much by having people come around your home that you do not know. Some of the teachers do not have time for all the teaching they have to do in the daytime, so they have night classes. That is true In more instances than one. Not being able to go out into th* state as much as they would like, or as much as Dean Burnett would like to have them, the only other thing that can be done is for you to do as you would with any one else you would hire, and that is to tell them what you want them to do. If you will pardon me a moment. I would like to make some suggestions that have occurred to me in connection with these talks and also in connection with some work I did for the county fair board in western Iowa In regard to awarding premiums. Some one asked the question, "Why not award the prizes to the animal that pro - duces the greatest amount of milk during the two or three days at a county fair?" That is good, but why not carry it even further than th*t: why not award the prize to the cow that trives the greatest amount of milk during a year? And If the work were nronerly carried on, why could not the prize be awarded to the best dairy herd in the county? The same thing would apnly to the ten best cirs of corn. Why award the prize to the ten best ears of corn that when the judge gets through with them he is not competent to say they are better so far as the yield is concerned than any other ten ears that the farmer can produce economi - cally on ten acres of land? Why confine it to corn? Why not c^rry It to wheat or oats or other farm products? You can exhibit samples for quality at the county fair, and more than that, you can have snlendld educational exhibits at the county fair showing how the nrlzes were won, showing what methods are used to nroduce these economically. Tt is true that people in the counties are domandlnc and thinktne all the time along economic lines, along lines of nroflt. Here is a way to answer their objections. There may be something In it thst may be worth while. Tt might be worked out: I offer it as a sueeestion only. I believe that county and state fairs are doine a exeat educational work, and that they can do still more. As director of the Extension Service of the Nebraska College of Agriculture, I am exceedingly anxious to do all In my power to aid In assisting those fairs which are not as educational as they would like to be. qs well as those which have the educational features well grounded. In 1911 I wrote an article for a Nebraska farm paper dealing with the value of educational features at county fairs and followed that the next year, at the request of the editor, with another article entitled "Making the County Fair Educational." </seg>
            <seg id="p121">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 11» At that time I canvassed the situation in the United States pretty thoroughly and found that a few colleges of agriculture were sending exhibits to the county fairs. Since then I have followed its advance In various states. In every instance where the work has been undertaken, the colleges, the fair managers and the patrons are enthusiastically in favor of its continuance. This work having been tried in Ohio longer than in any other state, I take the liberty of quoting from a statement made by the man in charge: II soon as the managers found out the nature of these exhibits there struggle to see who should have them, and no trouble whatever [perienced in our receiving all the appropriation we needed for the On several occasions we have had to go before the finance com of the legislature to oppose an undue advance in the appropria &gt;r the work. It is impossible to expand too rapidly without doiug in a great many things of an agricultural nature." There is a splendid opportunity at county and state fairs to show in a simple and graphic manner the results of the experiments conducted by an experiment station. The exhibits need not necessarily be confined to the Nebraska station, if findings of others are of value to Nebraska agriculture. Many of these results can be exhibited in such a way that the principal lessons to be learned can be seen at a glance. For example, in connection with its work the department of agricultural botany of the Nebraska college found that the treatment of oats for smut on a forty-acre field gave a profit of $44.20, after deducting the cost of the treatment. This could easily be shown in a striking manner by an exhibit, and at the same time samples of the diseased oats could be exhibited. Bulletins could be distributed to those who were interested in studying the matter further. The department of animal husbandry found, in some of its feeding experiments with hogs, that every one-half pound of alfalfa hay saved seven tenths of a pound of corn, when alfalfa and corn was compared with a ration of corn alone. This means that a ton of alfalfa hay for pork production, worth $10, saved 50 bushels of corn worth $25, making the farmer a net profit of $15. It has also been found by the animal husbandry department that it takes considerably less alfalfa hay and corn to produce a pound of feed than it does prairie hay and corn, when feeding beef cattle. Many valuable feeding tests lend themselves ad - mirably to exhibits which could be incorporated in county fair work. tis not possible, of course, for every dairyman to have every cow to the world record cow, Katie Qerben, owned by the state of ska. At the same time, much can be done in weeding out the :hat are not profitable. The average Nebraska cow yields only 310 s of milk each month, which gives 13 pounds of butter worth $3.26. Gerben has an average monthly production of 1,616 pounds of giving 64.7 pounds of butter worth $26.17. This is $22.92 in Katie's Katie Gerben is not the only cow which has made a record at </seg>

I^a May returned to her owner $3.08 for dollar's worth of food eaten, while the avtrage Nebraska cow is $1.25 for every dollar's worth. In determining the profitable the use of the Babcock tester and the scales afford the only reliable d, — a method which can be easily illustrated at a fair exhibit. I formation gathered from thirty-one farmers shows that the yield of on ground which has been properly rotated was practically doubled, crops received from the land during the period of rotation paid derable more money to the owners than would have been received 1 ground had been kept in corn, or in corn and wheat, all the time. We now have many examples of the effect of spraying orchards. One man is devoting practically all of his time to carrying on spraying dem - onstrations in the state, and during the next summer it will be necessary to get him an assistant. The results of these spraying demonstrations lend themselves admirably to fair exhibits. At the Nebraska station it was found that the rolling of winter wheat the first thing in the spring increased the yield about six bushels per acre. These figures are based on a six-year test. This would mean that a fifty-acre field would yield over $200 more if rolled than if not rolled, after paying for the expenses Professor Montgomery found that corn planted at the Experiment Station, which was of the very finest type according to the best Judges in the world, but which was grown in Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, yielded on a fifty-acre field 450 bushels less than the field would have yielded if planted to home grown seed. He also found that seed which was Ne - braska grown but produced sixty miles from the station yielded 160 Dushels less on a fifty-acre field than the seed produced in the immediate neighborhood. At 50 cents per bushel this represents $80 less money in the last instance, and $224 less money in the former. It emphasizes the folly of sending away from home for large quantities of seed, beau - tiful, but not adapted to local conditions. It is unnecessary to go over the list of instructive and interesting exhibits which could be incorporated in such a program. These exhibits would cover feeding experiments with hogs, dairy cattle, beef cattle, sheep and horses, cooperative fertilizing tests with farmers, experiments with the seeding and the growing of alfalfa, work on plant diseases, the methods of using hog cholera serum and virus and the results obtained In various sections, graphic reports on the work accomplished by the County Farm Demonstrators, proper construction of silos and farm buildings and a thousand other things. I lie Nebraska station feels that it would be well to try out this work modest way before an appropriation is asked for in the legislature. is will not permit more than a modest trial. Last year Representa- Pearson introduced a bill asking for $5,500 for county fair exhibits. • talking it over with the various members, — while he found no lition to the bill or the plan of work, — it was deemed advisable on int of the condition which existed In the state finances at that time </seg>
            <seg id="p123">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 121 to withdraw the bill and Introduce it at another time if it seemed bert. We believe that the plan should be tried by the county fairs before a very large appropriation is asked. For this reason the Extension Service has formulated a plan to submit to you based on the work car - ried on in other states revised somewhat to suit our conditions. The plan we are working out for Nebraska is given herewith in brief in so far as we have been able to perfect it. It is impossible for us to com - plete this until we have a conference with the county fair managers. For the purpose of giving fair exhibits a trial, in case the fair managers think it worth while, the Extension Service of the College of Agriculture will purchase a tent 30x40 feet. It will also furnish cases which will be built on a uniform plan, already agreed upon by the heads of the depart - ments in the College of Agriculture. These cases will be made of oak and will be glass covered. They will be uniform in size, each of them four inches wide and six feet tall and of a depth to suit the exhibit. They will be so built that they can be clasped together, placing the glass covers on the inside, thus speedily preparing them for shipment. In addition there will be frames thirty-four inches wide and of the proper depth and height to accommodate various small exhibits. A table will be provided through the center of the tent which will contain exhibits not adapted to frames or cases. The exhibits for these cases will be prepared by the various departments of the college. The departments have agreed to donate the work and material necessary for the trial exhibit for next fall. The Extension Service will furnish two demonstrators to accompany the tent to each fair scheduled. These demonstrators will be at all times with the exhibits to superintend their erection and to give detailed explanations. A stereopticon and slides will be furnished where they can be used to advantage. Elng the requirements of the county upon the work which has been on in other states and upon our personal ideas in the matter, we it the following should be expected from the fair boards: There should be a contract signed by the Fair Board and by the College covering the details of the agreement concerning the exhibits This contract should take into consideration the location of the tent on the fair grounds, the advertising to be furnished by the county people, transportation of the exhibit from the railroad to the fair grounds and its return, the furnishing of a sufficient amount of help to be used in the erection of the tent and the installation of the cases, police protection both night and day for the exhibit, and whatever assistance is needed In miscellaneous expenses. After discussing the matter thoroughly in the College we feel that we would like to recommend to the Association of County Fair Managers that there be appointed a committee from the association to work with the College of Agriculture in making a schedule of the fairs to be visited for this and coming years. The matter of selection of places should be left entirely to the priority of requests, but should be considered partly from the standpoint of ease of service. A series should be established for this year at least, since we have no </seg>
            <seg id="p124">122 fl money for the work, which will permit us to po from one county &gt;ther with the least possible expense and loss of time. The logical to determine such a schedule would be a committee from the fair rers In consultation with the Colleee. The framing of a suitable irt and other perplexing matters could well he left to this com - !. If we feel that the work is worth while we are willing to under - t for the coming year alonp the above lines. Mr. Kokjeb: I move, Mr Chairman, that a committee of three be appointed to confer with the School of Aertculture unon this subject. Kbtm aster Wn.sov: You have heard the motion, all In favor sav t Is carried. Tf any nn» has any suppestlons to offer we should Bed to hear them now. Mr. Chas. Mans: Since Mr. Odell has made his remarks T want to say this much, that I think our discussion this evenlnp has been verv profitable for our county associations. The main thoupht in my mind, as I believe It Is In all the minds of the managers of county fairs. Is the rate receipts. The pate receipts means the payment of nremlums. It Is necessary that we have them. That anplies also to our State Board. Tf our State Hoard did not pay its premiums the state fair would soon po to pieces the same as our county fairs. The ladles' department is one of our main factors at our county fair. In our fair we elect our own presidents, etc., and run our own department, and they anpolnt their own reception committee. I want to touch on that for a moment. When we have stranpers from Wyoming, or South Dakota, or Iowa, or wherever It is. it Is the business of these ladles to entertain these stranpers and see thit they have a pood time, and It is the same with the men. and I don't know bt:t what that would be a pood thlnp for our State Fair Board. I bep your pardon for maklnp the suppestton, but If we can make our visitors have a pood time and zo home feeltnp they have en- Joyed themselves, that fair will prow, whether It is county or state. We have our committees meet each Incoming train, and these people realize that we welcome them and feel that they are being entertained. At our fair we charee 50 cents for admission, and we try to put un a 50-eent propram. I think It was three years apo when I was talkine before thl« association T made a break: I said T would rather see a squaw race for the blood than a twenty race where It Is fixed up, and I meant what T said, for it would Rive the people their money's worth in satisfaction In the central part of the state it is very difficult to pet up a county fair propram. I would advise you to appoint a ladles' reception com - mittee and a Joint reception committee where they can po around amonp the people and take them by the hand. I tell you It creates a good feeling. For two years we have had flying machines and they were a perfect success. We did not have them last year, but we had fireworks, and dayllpht fireworks for the children. I am proud of our state fair. I went Into the Judpinp pavilion; there were some of the prettiest horses I have ever seen and here was one of our own boys Judrtnp those horses, and that gave me as much satisfaction as anything I have seen. </seg>
            <seg id="p125">Mr. Campbell announced the meeting of the Rural School Congress to be held Thursday morning at room 30^, Agricultural Hall, at which there would be an open forum meeting. Mi:. Ryan: I would like to move that we proceed to the general order of business and get done with it. Mn. Mann: I would like to make a motion that we thank the Com - mercial Club of Lincoln for their courtesy and the use of their hall and entertainment before Dr. Hall leaves the room. Kstmastek Wilson : It is moved and seconded that a vote of thanks Lincoln Commercial Club through their representative, Dr. Hall, n. Those in favor of this motion signify by saying Aye. Dr. Hall: Mr. President, I shall be very glad to convey to the Board of Diiectors and members of this club your thanks for this entertain - ment. We are not only glad to give it to you, but we consider it a privilege to have an opportunity of extending to you the use of our building for the purposes of your meeting. I have been very much In - terested in your associations and we are intensely interested in the state fair. We in Lincoln believe we have the best state fair of any state in the Union; and I assure you that every citizen of Lincoln, and especially and particularly every member of the Lincoln Commercial Club, and there are 1.6U0 of us, every year exert ourselves to the utmost to assist Mr. Mellor and the managers of this Board in making this fair a success and we shall continue to do so. We have people in our city every fair week from all over the state and we do our utmost to help them secure accommodations and show them everything we have. We Me that strangers are given an opportunity to get any information they want, as to accommodations for the night, or anything else. Every year we have about 1,500 rooms we provide outside of the hotels for people who wish to stay over night, and in every way possible we try to make your State Fair a success, and we people in Lincoln are proud of it. Toastmastek Wilson: The business of the meeting will now be taken up. We will have a report of the Secretary-Treasurer. Wii. H. Smith: We had on hand at the close of our year's business a year ago $43.45, and we have on hand at the present time of that (43.45 the sum of $35.95. Expenditures in cash have been $7.50 for the past year. The Commercial Club has very generously tendered this banquet to the State Board, so it has been unnecessary to collect any payments for the banquet, as has been the case in years past. With this $35.95 I think we can probably run the association for two or three years yet. so there will be no necessity of collecting payments this year at least. I might say at the present time, according to the reports we have on hand, there are fifty-nine organized fairs in the state. Eight of these have been organized the past year, and two of these eight will hold their first fair in 1914. One of the two is at Grand Island, and the other at Neligh in Antelope county. There are other things I might call your attention to, but the hour is getting late. It was moved and seconded that the Secretary's report be accepted. Carried. </seg>

I have a statement of the association that has been organized in Thayer county. They have no credentials; they have not purchased any grounds, but they held a fair last year, and, as I understand it, they have complied with the statutes in this case. Albert Coy was elected president and E. J. Mitchell secretary. They held a fair and paid in premiums something like $450. They secured cash from the county of $825, and they have a cash balance on hand of $1,100, but on account of the irregularity your committee has not seen fit to place them on the list, but leaves that matter with you people. It is a most remarkable showing to have a county organization come out of the season with $1,100 cash on hand; it looks as if they might do something.

Mi: MrT.Fon: While some of the older members here know I have endorsed that action a exeat manv tlmrs. stilt a person learns Rome thin?* in the course of time, and when it comes to the election of the Rnard of Manaerers in that way I think I see an error to a certain ex tent. T think the First Vice-President, the S°eond Vlee-Presldent, and the President should be members of that Board. Some one here sug - gested the Secretary, but I will not suggest the Secretary, as there mlirht be a question on that. If you elect by congressional districts It Is rolng to be difficult to elect the President. First or Second Vlee-Pregi rtent. unless you repeal the action we have already taken, so I don't think that nart is advisable, althoueh I am In favor of every member of that Board being elected by this body, but I prefer to have that change made so that the President. First and Second Vice-Presidents remain on tho Board, and we elect the three members which the President has been a'molntine. Not that I have any fpu't to find with any appointments that have been made, but I believe It is better for th" districts to name their representative. However, I think this resolution as presented Is remote, therefore I would oppose in part, while I am heartily In faror of a ereat bis: pirt of it. So far as the Board of Manae°rs Is concerned, T am In favor of the part which relates to th» election of the anoolntlve members. So far as the free tickets is concerned. T think it is a little strone. but I am willing; to endorse the entire resolution, except that part relating to the Board of Managers, which I think is a little remote, if investigated. K Member: I would like to ask. Is not that provided for in the con - ion and by-laws? I understand they can be amended at any ir meeting, but this resolution is so broad thst I for one do not stand In lust what shane It would put us In if adopted. President Roherts: I do not know as I can answer thst question exactly, but I suppose this body has a right to make any changes It Bees fit. I think that a two-thirds vote of the members present can make any alterations this body sees fit to make. Are there any other remarks on the resolution? I,. W. Leonard: In regard to the free ticket part of it, that would anply all right for any one that lived in this state, any of our state officers or men havine the manaeement of the fairs of this state If they don't want to put up their 50 cents to get into the gate, let them stay out: but it does look to me, when we have visitors from other states, as we do every year, it Is not showing thpm very much courtesy If we do not give them the freedom of the grounds. That Is as far as I can endorse the free ticket part of it. Residents of our state I would not object to at all, but we have fair men comine here from other states. </seg>
            <seg id="p130">We are glad to have them come and notify them, sometimes by special invitation, and I do not believe it would be policy to close our gates to such men as that. I.

That do away with the free pass feature.

J. F. MoArdle: There is some good and some bad in this resolu - tion. I do not believe there is a man here that wants to vote on this resolution as a whole, because it covers seven different propositions, no one of which is germane to the other, and I do not think it is fair to the men here to present such a resolution, and I do not think Mr. Gustafson wants to present a resolution that is not fair. You under stand there are some good features in this, some features that probably some of you would support and seme that others would not support. If you want to act intelligently and fairly, you must separate these propositions contained in this resolution and take each one up by itself and act on it, and then you will act intelligently. You are the men who are to decide this thing and when you do act it will be final, but you cannot act intelligently on six or seven propositions, neither one of them germane to the other. Pbkbident Roberts: I think it would be well for us to take a vote on the two-thirds proposition as to whether we want to change the by - laws or not. It seems to me that is the first thing in order and then we can vote on this intelligently, section by section. I think we ought to know whether this body wants to change the by-laws. What do you think about it? Wouldn't that be better, Mr. Gustafson? C. H. Gistafso.n: Yes, sir; I am satisfied with that, but I would like to have a roll call on that. ■ H.

For fear new men here do not quite understand this I make this explana that is, that you elect the majority of the Board of Managers when vote for your officers, and the President appoints the minority, ot to your approval. C. H. Gcstafson: I would like to talk to this whole resolution, but I hardly feel physically able. I was practically sick in bed before I came down here, but I will do the best I can anyway. We all know there has been more or less unrest in the state of Nebraska over this State Board of Agriculture. As a member of the legislature I probably know a little more about it than the ordinary men do. There was a proposition up at the last session of the legislature to reorganize this Board; that is, to put a new law in our statutes. I want to say that here is our chance to comply with some of the requests of the common people of the state of Nebraska. If we don't, we are going to fall down, that Is my prediction, and I know whereof I speak. Here is our chance to do something and do something good for the state of Nebraska and do something good for ourselves. This resolution Is vir - tually my own, I have not been asked by any one to do this. I am acting for myself and for the taxpayers of Nebraska. I have studied this question closely and have come to the conclusion that this Is the thing to do at this time. I did not introduce this and expect you to accept It word for word as it was introduced. You will know I am not after anybody's scalp. You know by principle I am democratic. I ani trying to put this into the hands of the people and to get more closely to them. If you can find any fault with each district electing its own member to the BoRrd of Managers, I would like to know where you can find it. It has been said the President, Vice-Presidents, and Secretary are members of that Board. Very well. If they are a majority of the Board, why not let each congressional district select its own member instead of having him appointed? If a member from my district Is elected on the Board under this proposed plan, the people of this dis - trict are going to hold us responsible for this member; they are not going to hold the whole Board of Agriculture responsible for him, as we have elected him from our district. I cannot see any Injustice in this and there Is no personal grouch; it is for the betterment of the association and the fair and to please the people. I want to say right here that I represent seven thousand organized farmers In the state of Nebraska when I am speaking to yon, and it is their wish I am sure, and I voice the sentiment of most of them. If you have any questions to ask I will be glad to answer them. You all know I am not much of an orator; I want to do this for the improvement of our Board and to save ourselves, because if we do not, something is going to happen. If we think we are so perfect no improvements can be made, we will find It out when it is too late Chan. Gbaff: I would like to ask Mr. Gustafson what action your </seg>
            <seg id="p133">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 111 organization which you have just stated you represent in the state of Nebraska took along these lines at their last meeting at Fremont. EGlstafson: Owing to the fact that we were just organizing we have time to take any definite action at that time, but these were referred to the Board made up of executive officers and e supposed to act for the members. Chas. Oeaff: It seems to me, Mr. President, that Mr. Qustafson Is putting this matter a little too strong when he states he is representing from 7,000 to 10,000 people of Nebraska when they did not deem It of sufficient importance themselves to take it up at their recent meeting. I will confess I live out in the country, I have lived there all my life, and I expect to live there until I die, unless they run me out into some worse place. I will confess I have not heard any of the farmers or stock breeders, and when I say stock breeders I mean the Improved Lire Stock Breeders as well as the stock feeders, I have not heard any criti - cism or complaint against the policies of this Board which Mr. Gustaf- Bon speaks of. We heard a little down at the Farmers' Congress at Omaha a short time ago about this matter. I have not noticed anywhere that the people of Nebraska were worked up over the methods of this Board of Agriculture and that it needed reorganizing so badly. I be - lieve, like Mr. Gustafson and no doubt many of you, that there ought to be some changes made, and there have been changes made right along and there will be more. We will get to these things if we will take a little time, but I am opposed to the first section of this resolution at this time. I think it will throw the thing wide open. It is coming, but it takes time as everything else does. If I understand that section of the resolution it says each congressional district elects its own member on that Board; that is, these other congressional districts would take no part in it. It takes men to do things. One man can do this thing, another man can do that. I am not able to say why this change in our Board should take place at this time. 1 wish to say this from what connection I have had with the members of the State Board of Agricul - ture that I have found the biggest men in the state of Nebraska, I have never seen anything wrong or crooked, I do not believe this criticism is at all serious, and if I thought bo I would sever my connection and bunt up other company. tH. Rudge: I would like to call your attention to rule 11 of our s. Now if we adopt a new rule to take the place of rule 11 It to me we will have to repeal that rule some way before we can a new rule to take its place. This proposed resolution would ; rule 11 altogether. I has. McLeod: There is part of that resolution I am in favor of part I am opposed to. We already elect four of these members as d of Managers. You will find this Board of Managers was elected year In the six congressional districts of the state. They are scat - 1 all over the state, one from each congressional district What I to do now is to move to amend so that after the election of the </seg>
            <seg id="p134">officers that the three remaining members for the Board be elected from the congressional districts not already represented on the Board, to be approved by this body. That would then allow us to elect the seven members. We now elect four. I believe the President should be on the Board of Managers, also the two vice-presidents, and the Secretary I believe is all right on the Board of Managers. After they are elected then this motion to amend, if it should be carried, would allow the con gressional districts not represented to elect the other three and thej would be approved by this body. If that is in order I- should like to make this amendment. Mi:. McKelvie: I should like to answer some questions which have been raised here in regard to the farmers' organizations as brought forth by Mr. Gustafson. As a matter of fact, gentlemen, you all know this farmers' organization is a new thing. They had many things to take into consideration and you know it would be impossible for them to take up very much at their first meeting aside from the matter of organization, the many problems they feel it their duty to consider, and, as a matter of fact, this one thing was spoken of, though there was no definite action taken on it at that time, but as president of that organ - ization in our county I want to uphold what Mr Gustafson has said in regard to the matter, that there is a feeling of unrest. While I am not here claiming there is crooked work or anything of that nature, I do aay that at least it ought to be in the hands of the people to say who should be their Board. I think we are not asking anything unfair; and as a matter of fact, so far as the farmers' organization is concerned, I think you will find in the course of a short time there will be definite action taken on that. President Roberts: Gentlemen, the motion before the house at the present time is amended to read that after the election of the officers the three remaining members for the Board be elected from the con - gressional districts not already represented on the Board. Are you ready for the question? J. A. Oi.iis: I am certainly in sympathy with Mr. Gustafson or any one else that advocates the bringing of these things close to the people, while at the same time there is a question whether you are bringing them closer to the people or farther from the people on any action you may take. I think it should be given careful consideration.' There Is a wide-spread sentiment in this state at the present time that it would better in regard to our state administration to elect a governor and have him appoint the other state officers, as they could center the strength on the governor and become acquainted with the kind of a man they are voting for, and then make him responsible for the ad - ministration of the state's affairs. What little experience I have had with state fair matters leads me to believe you have got to have a responsible head to manage the affairs of the state fair, and in order to have a responsible head you must give him some power. At the present time you elect four members and allow the President to appoint </seg>
            <seg id="p135">three. You must give a man a little bit of power if you are going to hold him responsible. It is not taking it away from the people entirely. You are the people who are electing the President, and you are not going to elect a President in whom you do not have confidence that he will appoint three good men. But it does not stop there. After he appoints his three men, if any one of them is not a good representative man. you can turn him down and then he can appoint others from the whole Board, so you have it in your power to see that he appoints good men, although you do not say just what men he shall appoint. So tar as I am concerned, at the present time I am Vice-President, and under our rules I am a member of the Board of Managers, but I am mighty sure if I thought the delegates from my congressional district did not want me to hold that office I would not take it if elected by this body, but I do believe you should give the President a little power if you are going to put responsibility on him. Ii. GrsT.vFsox: The very point Mr. Ollis brought up Is the one I to speak of. He advocates the centering of the power in the Presl- I think my resolution will give him more power and responsibility before, for this reason: Under the old system the President is not hairman of the Board. The duty of the chairman is to audit the nts. I come to Lincoln quite often and I have seen this Board in n without its President, therefore I came to the conclusion that the nan of the Board was the President so far as presiding was con - i. 1 think you are centering his responsibility and holding him nsible more under my resolution than under the present practice. KA. Oixis: Another thing I want to call your attention to. You say ir resolution the Board of Managers shall consist of seven, but you irovide for six. I think that must be an oversight, is it not? Mk. Gi-stafson: No, I state that the president shall be an ez-officio member of the Board, and one member from each congressional district The district in which the President lives would have two representatives. We cannot overcome that. C. H. Rudoe: As chairman of your Board for the last year and a number of years, I want to thank Mr. Gustafson for the nice compliment paid me, and I want to say to the members here that since this new by - law was adopted some three or four years ago the President has presided at all meetings except meetings that have been held at the fair grounds, where the President had other duties to attend to in his private office. He has looked after a large share of the ticket business. Previous to the passage of this by-law, which was passed some three or four years ago, tb« chairman always presided at the meetings, but since then the Presi - dent has always presided. He attended nine-tenths of the meetings at least. He has probably attended more meetings than any other member of the Board. Mr. Kokjek: I wish to amend if it is not too late, that a committee of three on revision of constitution and by-laws be appointed at this meet - ing, to report at the next annual meeting, and ail proposed changes be published not less than sixty days before the meeting. </seg>

L. \V.

In (act, yesterday we added two new by-laws. It was on their recommenda - tion that we did it and we accepted their report. I think they take the place entirely of the committee this gentleman has just proposed to have appointed.

If we take any action it should be done without criticism, and I do not think this State Board of Agriculture that has assembled here today should do any - thing along the line of criticism, but whatever is done should be because they have the best interests of the state and the State Board of Agricul - ture at heart.

I think if any member of the Board of Agriculture wishes to be present he should have . the opportunity. I think it is the Secretary's duty to notify every member of the Board of every meeting to be held. Mk. Rudge: I would like to say one word on that. I have seen the time when it was necessary to call a meeting of the Board of Managers by telephone or telegram. That might happen once in a year, perhaps once in two years, but suppose an important matter comes up a month, maybe two or three months, before the fair, like it did I know when the men were here on the wild west show two years ago. It was necessary to have a meeting of the Board of Managers and it was taken up by telephone and there was a meeting of the Board. If this section should pass it would be almost impossible to call a meeting by phone or wire. Sometimes special meetings of this kind are necessary. IW. Leonard: I do not believe It is at all necessary to have any by-law as this. It would be very seldom if ever that any member s State Board of Agriculture would come before the Board of Mana - and if they do have any important thing to bring before the Board, Dost every instance they can write to the Secretary in regard to It le will always be notified.

James: I would like to say a word in regard to this matter in behalf of the agricultural part of the state fair. I come in contact with twenty-five to thirty or thirty-five counties each year and I personally know that the exhibitors in that department go out and work more or leas the whole year gathering up their exhibits to bring down to the state fair to make a showing for the man that pays his 50 cents admis - sion into the grounds, and I also personally know that never in one time out of twenty does the money they receive as premiums pay them for the expense to which they are put. For my part I would hate to see this adopted, because they are the people who make the fair, and I am satisfied in my own mind it would mean wreck and ruin to the agri - cultural department of the state fair if the exhibitors who make the show would have to come down to the fair and pay 50 cents each day to enter the grounds. IB. Keedle: As an exhibitor at the state fair for the last fourteen I have been doing my best to build up this fair. I live about 130 west of here. It takes a great deal of work to get up an agricul - dlsplay for the Nebraska state fair. The minute the state fair one year we have to commence to prepare for the next year, con - itly we are working directly for the fair, while not every minute year, but a good portion of It. Now to get down here with a </seg>
            <seg id="p139">I'KOCKBUINGH NEBRA8KA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE lit display it takes from four to five men to put it up. I have come down here several times and have never got one dollar. Now in case this resolution is made one of the by-laws I would be about $10 out if I had to pay $2.50 for admissions, which is 50 cents per day for five days. I rather think, Mr. Chairman, we would not need that grand building which the state and taxpayers paid for. I don't think you will need It and I don't believe you will find a bundle of grain at your state fair. I am making no threats, but I am giving you the facts as I believe them to be. Mr. Gustafson spoke about the farmers. I am as close to the farmer as any one. I have farmed in this state for over thirty years, I have never done anything else in my life, and I know I am pretty close to the farmer, and when he says there are complaints being made among the farmers about the State Board of Agriculture, there may be in his locality, but out in the west he will find a different proposition alto - gether. They are not talking about the reorganization of this body, they are more than well pleased and think it is a grand success, and it is a fact that we are building up the best and greatest agricultural fair that is held in the world. Therefore, Mr. President, I call for the roll RGvhtafmon: I would answer the objections this man has made ay; I don't see why this expense of gate admissions cannot be ed after the fair is over. George Dickma.n: Do you know that rebates are absolutely for - bidden by law? Mr. Gvstafson: Rebates nothing. We could turn the money back, to them. I don't like the idea of a whole lot of fellows hanging onto me wanting passes to get in. I think every member of the Board would be glad to get rid of it, and I don't see why, if we have been able to abolish the railroad pass and things of that kind, we cannot make such rules so we can fix this matter also and arrange so that no one can successfully charge that we were giving favors to a few. As (or being close to the farmer, I want to state that I have farmed in Nebraska for forty-four years and I think I know something of the feeling among the farmers on this subject IW. Lkonai:i&gt;: I do not think that in giving free admission to the ds to our exhibitors we are giving them a pass; in fact, we don't them free admissions, as they have to buy an exhibitor's ticket, an give their helpers admission to the grounds, but we ar« not ? them a pass. The railroads are not giving passes, but all their tyees ride without paying fare. We are not giving passes when ive a man who works for us and who helps us to make that fair i through the gate on a ticket; that is not a pass. Evident Roberts: I believe the concessionaires pay a certain : of money for their concessions before they are entitled to any and they are given one ticket for every $10 they pay into the tion. Mr. Gustafsov: Why not reduce the amount the concessionaire </seg>
            <seg id="p140">1M PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tl am advocating this to make it fair for the exhibitor. I find It the poor man or the widow or the orphan who are getting these but it is the fellow that is well able to pay his admission Into &gt;unds. All the passes I have ever had were the member's ticket 'self and wife, and my wife's ticket was not even used. My er came down and paid 50 cents to get into the gate and 50 cents into the grandstand. Mr. Rudgb: Did you not ask for a ticket for your daughter? tGusTAFBON: Yes, sir, I did, but she came to the gate and paid ly into the grounds before I had time to get a ticket to her. iter.] Members of this Board have had from five to seven passes, the charge at least, and 1 think they will admit it, so, if I had for a ticket for my daughter, I would not have been nearly bo the rest. IMcAkdle: There are a little more than 4,000 people working ! grounds during the fair week. While these passes look large, people work on the grounds and are entitled to admission. Four ad of them come in every day and are counted at the gate. They i out as often as they wish, and when they go down town and to their business and come back they are counted again. This Use the number possibly to 8,000 or 10,000 per day, and this looks I make this as an explanation. Mr. Smith from Kearney: I want to say a word on this matter. 1 have taken a great deal of interest in the remarks that have been made on this question. I believe our friend, Mr. Gustafson of Saunders, is honest in his intentions. He has but one object, he cannot have any other object. He does not question for a moment the honesty of the fair managers. If he has any motive at all it is the motive of economy. I have been coming to the state fair for thirty years. I have been an exhibitor al - most all that time and I want to plead guilty of having a pass from an early time down to the present time, but I want to tell you every pass that has been issued has brought three or four paid admissions. Part of the time it meant the bringing of some of my family. I paid their way in and never asked for passage. Last year I came to the fair as an exhibitor in the swine department. I had a pass sent me, I suppose as secretary of the fair association in our county. I know that the honor brought me down here. I would have come anyway as an ex - hibitor, but I paid $2 for an exhibitor's ticket for my man to come in. I felt if I did not have to pay $2 for myself I could bring another man along to help me, so I paid $2 for the ticket and I did not ask for a helper's ticket. So then my pass made $2 for the association. I can take from the early time of our departed Governor Furnas, who always Bald: "Be good to the fellows who make the exhibits; that is about all they get out of it" At that time I was superintendent of Class M, machinery. I know we issued passes to the machinery men and they came in with their families, and every pass I issued brought three or four dollars in tickets. That is what it takes to make a good fair. </seg>

            <seg id="p142">14* PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE If the otht'p state fairs were not doing it I do not think it would cause very much complaint among the stock dealers of this state, but as they are it creates dissatisfaction. I do not think I would have favored adding it at any rate if it had not been that we adopted a new rule yesterday giving champion money in the horse class. I certainly think if it Is paid in any class it should be to hogs and cattle first I also want to see the horse show built up, but there is this fact that you roust recognize that the horse show here is very largely made up of im - porters, while the cattle and hog show is a different class entirely. It is the farmers over this state that are struggling to build up a herd. While some of the horsemen are in the same class, our horse show is made up largely of importers that are backed up by plenty of money. C. H. Ridge: As chairman of the committee on the premium list I would say this matter was up before the premium list revision com - mittee. We had a recommendation from the superintendent of Class B and Class C requesting this. You will remember about two years ago we increased our cattle premium list a good deal in order to take advantage of the special offer of the different foreign associations. We had to increase our premiums to get the Shorthorn Breeders' Associa - tion to give us the $400. There was a very large increase in Class B. In regard to what Mr. Ollis has said in regard to the horse proposition I am not very familiar with the show we had this last year. I think I am correct when I say we had only one importer exhibiting at the last state fair. I would like to ask Mr. Wolcott if I am oorrect in that. ■ M. Wolcott: There was only one horse from outside of the They were all Nebraska men who had horses on exhibition. Mr. Ollis: Were many of them imported horses or Nebraska bred? Mk. Ri'txiE: A good many imported horses, but they belonged to Nebraska men. Mr. Ollis: The exhibitors of the show are largely Importers; not many of them are struggling farmers trying to build up a herd as the cattlemen are, not so many at any rate. M«. Rudoe: In Class C, in the open class in Iowa, which perhaps is one of the biggest state fairs, they give $32 while we give $33. In previous years we have thought if we could divide up the premium money and give it all along the line and make more premiums it would be better for the exhibitors than to give so large a share to one exhibitor. For instance, take the champion boar or bull. He gets first premium In his class of course, then he gets another premium as cham - pion, and then perhaps he gets the grand champion. In that way he gets two and three moneys. The idea has been in former years not to give so much to one animal; he gets the advertisement and the purple ribbon, and he gets more advertising than any of the rest of them. Our plan has been to encourage the small exhibitor, arrange it so that he can make a little and come back another year. If you think we ought to put in the champion money, of course we can do it, but. it will take some money. Do you know how much, Mr. Ollis? </seg>
            <seg id="p143">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE luiAKI) OF AGRICULTURE 141 Mk. Ollis: I think about $300 in each class. It. Rudge: After consideration of this matter I think you will with your premium list committee. No one would like to give ■ premiums than I would and I have always been in faror of it. reason we raised the premiums for horses was because we gave about one-half the money they do in Iowa. They start out with Ad we give $20, and they also give $20 championship money. In A the other states have been giving twice as much money as we do. IR. Danielson: While this matter is up for discussion, you spoke materially increasing the premiums about two years ago, but did ay that was in the Shorthorn class entirely. The other classes not increased very much. W. R. Mellob: The championship money was taken out of the cham - pionship class and added to the regular classes. IDanielson: I requested at that time that this be put at the top premium list so that the exhibitors would know it. The conten - lat arises among the exhibitors has been the matter of different it different fairs. Let Nebraska line up with other fairs or else use fairs to line up with us. Let all of them pay championship or else all cut it out. It is immaterial to me, but it does not ght to the men who pick up our premium list and expect to exhibit and find we do not pay championship money while other fairs do. ('has. Graff: Of course it would be expected of me to get into this. I agree with Mr. Rudge; it is true the premiums in Class B were raised considerably a few years back, so has the price of feed, the price of cattle and the price of labor and everything along the line, and I believe the exhibitors in Class B would take very kindly to a little championship money. I believe it ought to be done. I believe the state fair of Nebraska can stand the financial strain. I believe it will be money well invested by the State Fair Association. The difficulty is to get the help in order to produce a finished animal to bring down to this fair. There are a great many problems that confront us now that did not a few years ago, and I think we ought to hang a little money to the championship ribbons in Class B. Et. McArole-: In so far as other fairs, as I understand it, pay championship money, and the committee saw fit to allow it in orse department, I want to second the motion made by Mr. OIUs half of the cattle breeders and swine breeders of Nebraska. ■k. Rohebts: I think that motion was seconded a long while ago, but all right. Z. T. Leftwich: It seems to me it is of more interest to the stock, breeders of this state to put this championship money on the hogs and cattle than the horses, from the fact we are breeding our hogs and cattle at home while the most of our horses are imported, and it looks to me as though hanging the premiums of this kind onto these two depart - ments will do a great deal in encouraging the championship, and, as has been said, if other states are doing that I think we ought to do It, </seg>

Yesterday we accepted the report of the revision com - mittee and the motion was made and carried that any further changes be left to the Board of Managers that they may see fit to make.

            <seg id="p146">144 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Eutabt Mnxon: Mr. President, by direction of the State Board of Iture, I cast the full vote of this Board for Mr. Joseph Roberts for ■nt for the ensuing year. Calls for Mr. Roberts. Ijf.siDENT Roberts: I thank you for the honor you have conferred me by electing me President of this association. What higher com - ■nt could be paid a man than the support and confidence of represen- I men from different parts of the state with whom you have worked tany years trying to build up one of the best state fairs in one of the states in America. It gives me added pleasure at this time to feel you have perhaps not forgotten, but have overlooked the many mis I have made in the years we have worked together. I presume, having been elected President, I am now in a position to be classed as building a political machine to elect me. I want to say that I have never asked a single person to assist me or vote for me to any position I have ever held in this association, neither have I ever heard Messrs. Rudge, Mellor, or Youngers in any way solicit support to retain themselves in office, or gay aught against any candidate for election or re-election, and when such charges are made, that their election is the result of a political machine built up by them, it is a reflection on every member who has a vote in this association, for, we have been the so - called machine that has retained them. And why? Because they have the ability to do things and have done them. They are the men who, when this association was in debt and unable to pay its premiums, as - sumed the obligations by giving their personal notes to secure the money to pay the indebtedness. These men have built up a reputation, not a machine. That is why you and I have voted to keep them in office. Mr. Mellor has built up a reputation by his ability to do things, that Is recognized by all the state fairs in the United States. He was elected chairman of the legislative committee at the National Fair Association held in Chicago in December, also vice-president of that association, without a dissenting vote, and he will be elected president next De - cember if he chooses to accept it. Do long terms in office of honest and competent men demand criticism, or does it not show good judgment of ihe men who vote to keep them there? As to the reorganization of the State Board of Agriculture, I do not believe there is a member on this Board but that would gladly welcome it, if by so doing the great agricultural, educational and other interests that go to make up our great state could be better conserved. But it is well to consider the source and motives that prompt this action. The Nebraska state fair owes its success in a great measure to the newspapers that have loyally supported it, and I had hoped that the paper now attacking the Board would be fair and publish facts; on the other hand, everything that it has written, it seems to me, has been for the purpose of misleading the ones that read it. The editor seriously objects to the swine pens having been removed to the lower part of the grounds instead of the baby exhibit and the heavy tractors, </seg>
            <seg id="p147">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 141 for the reason that if the fair had been held one week earlier, the hogs would all have been drowned. He does not say that if there had been any hogs anywhere between the fair grounds and Arbor or in the lower residence part of Lincoln during this flood it would have been impossible to save them. And no mention is made of the fact that the grounds have been protected by a dyke and ditches dug so it would be impossible for a like condition to exist again. Some of the records of 1911 are quoted where Mr. Mcl^eod of Stanton offered a resolution advocating some changes, but no mention is made to what Mr. McLeod said, and the good words he spoke of Messrs. Rudge, Mellor and Young - era. The records show that Mr. Rudge at that meeting requested that he be left off the Board of Managers. This paper does not say that oar good friend, Mr. Lawson, president of the Farmers' Congress, moved to table Mr. McLeod's resolution. I have known Mr. McLeod for many years and I believe him one of Nebraska's best citizens and would be a valuable member to any organization. I can see the handwriting on the wall of some men who year after year have used every effort to become members of the State Board of Agriculture, but for some reason, I know not, have failed to secure enough votes; others whose bills were not allowed because of over - charges, in fact they are trying with the editor of the Twentieth Cen - tury to mislead its readers into believing that they are working for the upbuilding of one of Nebraska's greatest institutions, when in reality nothing would suit' them better than to see the state fair a failure. We are criticised for electing old members to office and denounced if a member seeking re-election is defeated. And the paper claims it is absolutely fair. I will leave others to be the judge. Iowa has just passed through just such an experience and an Investigating commit - tee appointed, and after investigation reported everything in the best of condition, and that is the way a committee will find things here. Their annual meeting was held a short time ago and President Cameron and Secretary Corey were re-elected. Governor Clark at that meeting gave great praise to the men in charge, and I am proud to say that ex-Governor Aldrich and Governor Morehead have used every effort by their good words and personal work to make our fair one of the Ii, fellow members, the only way for us to do is what we believe and for the best interests of our association regardless of our is, and I invite and request any member or person interested in &gt;building of our state fair to help me with any suggestions or sms that will work for its good. So let us all pull together and lly maintain the high standard set in the past, but endeavor to the 1914 state fair one of the best in its history.

To the Honorable Chairman and Board of Managers of State Board of Agriculture, Lincoln, Nebr., Gentlemen : As superintendent of the amphitheater during the 1913 fair I wish to commend the action of the Board of Managers in inaugurat - ing the Boys' School during the last fair. By this advanced step it is possible for young men from every county in Nebraska to become familiar with the educational features of the fair, as well as to get an insight into the particular workings of it, and thus take to their home agricultural societies many valuable suggestions in fair work. I had nearly 100 of these boys as ushers of the amphitheater, and I was indeed gratified by the excellence of the service rendered. I found them a splendid lot of boys; bright, energetic, faithful, and anxious to please So far as I could learn they were quite well satisfied with the amphitheater work and found it a pleasant diversion from their school duties at the camp grounds. If the same plan is followed another year the experience gained at the last fair will make it possible to improve on the system and secure even better organization and better results in this department. This, however, is a matter of detail that must be worked out. Definite assignments at the amphitheater for the entire week should be given to each boy and simple, but concise, instructions given to each in printed form. It is important to have every usher in his place at the right time, and it is equally important that he be properly instructed before the rush is on. By good organization it is possible to reach a high state of effi - ciency. The public recognizes good service quickly and appreciates it. The Ticket System I believe the ticket system at the amphitheater can be materially </seg>
            <seg id="p152">150 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICTTI-TI'RE improved. Occasionally people who are not pleased with their s°ats will present seat checks used at a former time, and in the rush of the after noon, or the dini llfht of the evpnin^. mav succeed In epttin-* nossession of the seats and holding them until the rightful owners annear To avoid this possibility of mix-ups I would atrain urge that the seat check on the amnhithester ticket for 1914 bear a bold and distinctive nnnihnr. T numbers should run consecutively. For Instance, all tickets for Mondav afternoon should N» numbered "1" in bold n&gt;ures: all seats for Mondav nirht should be numbered "2." and so on. The box seat checks should not call for any special chair, but should read "Good for any chair In Box No. 1." and so on. I would suggest a radical revision of the ticket and seatlne svstem for the evening: performance. Heretofore a 25-cent general admission has been charged for the umier half of the smnhUheater at the nifht show, while for the lower ha'f crn"on tickets have been sold. When tho fire - works are on durine the latter part of the evenine the view from th" unner seats Is obstructed by the roof of the nmnhitheater- and the neonle become so restless that It has been the nractice to let them ocennv th" vacant seats In the lower part of the buildlnp after thnt time.

I would stronelv urge that 2K-cent coupon tickets be sold for such nart of the lower half of the bulldine- as the Board of Managers may determine. This method will eive the nubile better service and will not materially chance the revenue derived from this denartment. I would recommend that no tickets be snld In section* "M" and "V" for afternoon performances until sfter the same nrlced seats In all other sections have been dlsnosed of. This for the reason that th» sun strikes these sections, and on hot afternoons the peonle will not remain in their Ei reduction In the i&gt;rlce of soft drinks, con'ections and c'ppi-s within nhitheater «t the last fair met with "ocular sniroval bv the nub'ic ■rvine of the peonle in the amnhitheater means an additional ex - by reason of the extra heln re&lt;iulr&lt;vV yet the nublic =e«&gt;med to late the fact that cn'v regular nrices were changed.

Mellor, Secretary of State Board of Agriculture, Lincoln, Xebr.. EDear Sir: As superintendent of newspapers at the 1913 fair, in behalf of Mr. S. C. Bassett, allow me to submit the following Eing to the illness of Mr. Bassett he was unable to look after thH ment at the last fair. He has made an enviable record as super ent of newspapers and I tried to adhere steadfastly to the recom tions of the Board of Managers and the policy of Mr. Bassett. 11912 thirty-two publications were represented. The men who came lalf of these papers secured twenty-two location permits and were 145 free admission tags. A large number of these alleged "news - men" were in fact members of what is known as the "strong arm" of agricultural papers of inferior quality. In other words, they out to secure subscriptions by whatever method, no matter how lest. </seg>
            <seg id="p154">ltt PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Kuntain pens, stock foods and other forms of premiums were thrust the unsuspecting. Farmers, who came to see the fair, were badgered ajoled. Stock exhibitors were annoyed and pestered in the stock Investigations by Mr. Bassett proved that 85 per cent of the money taken in went to the solicitor, while 15 per cent was paid the paper as a usual thing. Of course, the higher class of farm periodicals did not give premiums on the grounds and employed no disreputable solicitors. As a result of his experiences Mr. Bassett urged in his report last year that soliciting subscriptions be classed as a concession. The Board of Managers and the authorities of the fair looked into the matter and issued instructions that the newspapers be given locations free of charge, that all premiums be forbidden, that soliciting outside of the regular location be placed under the ban, and that all subscription solicitors be charged admission to the grounds. It was also required that a list of solicitors be furnished the fair management previous to the fair and that all employees be in the service of the paper for a period of three months before the filing of the application. To Real Newspaper Men Kitorial courtesies were extended to the editors and reporters of the Itural press, the weekly press and the daily press. This was re - d to men who were actually engaged in the collection of news or 5 articles. I a result of these regulations six applications for locations were I. Letters of commendation were received from a number of lead - ricultural papers endorsing the fair officials. There was a torn from a paper published outside the state, this publication wishing me the old methods. During the fair the locations were assigned e regulations faithfully followed except in one instance. Iie Twentieth Century Farmer, published at Omaha, was found guilty gross infraction of the regulations of the Board of Managers. This , several weeks before the fair, sent in a list of about twenty solici - wd certified that they had been employed by the paper for more three months. The letter from Circulation Manager Reel contained • pledge that the latter would be in personal charge of the workers on the fair grounds and that no violations of the rules of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture would be permitted. On the morning of September 4 complaints reached the superintend - ent that the Twentieth Century Farmer solicitors were giving foun - tain pens and stock dip as premiums. Investigation revealed that the complaints were well founded. A fountain pen contract was signed and delivered to an employee of the state fair, while three solicitors were caught in the act of disposing of the stock dip in the cattle barns. All the solicitors were taken into custody by the police and brought before the Board of Managers. The matter was discussed in detail and Chairman Rudge called Reel's </seg>
            <seg id="p155">solicitors were demanded, and it was found that but one of the names furnished the Secretary by the circulation manager was in the crowd. The others were evidently "strong arm artists" who made a practice of "working the farmers" at state and county fairs. Ee man in charge of the solicitors attempted to deny responsibility le actions of the men. His attention was called to his written se to see that the regulations of the fair managers were obeyed, nee was introduced which indicated that the men secured their iims through the connivance of the manager. The fountain pens found to be flimsy, the stock dip a cheap imitation. A motion to eject the solicitors of the Twentieth Century Farmer from the grounds was made by Secretary W. R. Mellor and seconded by Peter Youngers. During its discussion, the circulation manager announced that his men were going to withdraw from the fair grounds The Board of Managers then passed a resolution ordering that "newspapers whose solicitors are found violating the rules of the association be barred from soliciting on the grounds." "Strong Arm Squad" I ere is no doubt that the methods of the "strong arm squad" are ive in the extreme. They usually select for their victims the dif - and unassuming. Finally the harassed ones will make a partial &gt;nt on a contract in order to escape the persistent solicitor. How - this merely subjects him to more solicitation in another form or ibly for another paper. The rule that these solicitors should pay their way into the grounds and remain in a certain location is a wise one. It should be made more rigid by the sale of concession space at the regular rate for the purpose of soliciting subscriptions. The newspapers should be given free space for rest rooms or tents where they may meet their patrons or give out sample copies of their papers. The progressive and honest newspapers do not countenance the methods outlined above and it is an unjust dis crimination to allow the irresponsible publisher to intimidate ' and fleece farmers and visitors to the fair. . The journalistic world is afflicted with irresponsible men as is other callings. But progress has been rapid during the last few years. The circulation faker, the advertising grafter and the premium flim-flam artist are being rapidly consigned to the junk pile of newspaperdom. The great number of Nebraska newspaper men stand for the square deal, both in the editorial office and the counting room. The honest and fearless publishers are urging progress and reform and they are sup - porting the Board of Managers in the effort to purge the Nebraska state fair of these abuses. Respectfully submitted, Geokiie W. Kline, Acting Superintendent. </seg>

Kll rent was collected to the amount of $623; this I think is a trifle last year, but we were also short in numbers of cattle on exhibition pared to 1912. The Show in General |&gt;rthorns. — I feel that it is needless to go into detail about this t the show, when the records show that Nebraska breeders carried teen first prizes out of a possible seventeen. They also claimed all tampions, both in males and females. With all the outside eom - n that was presented against them, you can very readily see that ska is the home of some very constructive breeders, perhaps as as any one state in the union can produce. Kl younger classes brought forth some very promising stuff for the and I feel that Nebraska will be known by its Shorthorns before more such fairs are held. </seg>

Green of Genoa being practically the only Nebraska breeder present. I iteems rather strange that the breeders of Nebraska do not take to this breed of cattle, as it seems that we have land In this state is as suitable for the Herefords as the Shorthorns. The classes ited betore the judge consisted of as good Herefords as you can n a western circuit, and competition was keen all the way through. is no criticism to otter on this part of the show, only as I have the absence of breeders from our own state. I&gt;erdeen-Angus. — This breed was well represented, and I think with le encouragement this part of the show can be improved greatly, of the old breeders oi this breed of cattle have been in the habit of from Iowa north, and it is a very hard matter to convince them here Is just as good a field for them on this western circuit as the way, but 1 think more ot them are seeing it year by year, and 1 with persistent energy Nebraska can have as good a black show as f them. Galloways. — Just two herds made up this part of the show. One from i he li. id ot the Capital View Ranch of Kansas, and the other from A. O. I i uft ot Arcadia. Capital View people had out a good herd well fitted, but the cattle of Mr. Huff were more in their every-day clothes. One of our old stand-bys in this breed, the Straub Bros., of Avoca, Nebr., were seriously damaged by the cyclone last spring, and I presume that kept th( in from the show ring the past fall. Eled Durhams. — Here we found a very nice show all the way h, mostly composed ot breeders from out the state. I think the rd of this part of the show was fully as good as In the past. Bed Polls.— Just one herd presented itself for the judge. This herd belonging to Haussler Bros, of Holbrook, Nebr. Quite a contrast to 1912 when we had five full herds on exhibition. I think with better prospects for the year 1914 will find the Red Polled man back in line ready to give you a show. Itolsteins. — We now get to the dairy end of the show, that part which ink has made a wonderful growth in the past three years. I do not ii the time very far distant when Nebraska will rank foremost among western states in dairying, and I am sure that the Nebraska State d of Agriculture can do a great deal towards encouraging this line ork. The Hoist ein shows of 1912 and 1913 were certainly a credit ny show ring, and we should feel proud of this fact. Had it not for a little ill fate that befell two herds of Holsteins just before the we would have had a better showing. Jerseys. — These little milk machines were out in good numbers, and had we had the herd of H. C. Young with us this year It would have rounded out a very wholesome show. But there was plenty of quality as it was and I feel that another year we can have as good a dairy show as </seg>
            <seg id="p158">1M PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Guernseys. — Just the one herd of these animals was present, that of Wilcox £ Stubbs of Des Moines, Iowa. They made a very creditable showing, and I would like to see more of this breed brought into com - petition at the Nebraska state fair. Recommendations The first fact that I would like to impress upon the Board is that we ought to pay a championship money. This I think is the greatest con - tention that a superintendent of the Nebraska state fair has to deal with, and it seems to be the one "cry" of all exhibitors. They know that all adjoining fairs pay this, even if it is sometimes rather a small compen - sation; but they want to see that money in the champion, rather than the ribbons, and I think it would be well for the Board to consider this. I feel satisfied with money in all championships that it will spell success for your cattle show far more than anything else you can do along that line, and I sincerely hope that the Board will see its way clear to take this matter up with a favorable announcement in their next premium list. Another matter that I think should be considered carefully is the fact of letting the Genoa Indian School compete for premium money. There w.as quite a bit of contention among the Holstein breeders about this, and I know it didn't seem to make the best of feeling among them. I had no authority in the matter, and as long as the Holstein breeders did not tile a protest, I simply let the matter go, but I think it would be well to decide this definitely before another year. In regard to the classes for steers, we have tried bunching them now for two years, that is, making the pure breds and grades show against each other, and it has not turned out as satisfactory as I thought it would. The breeders do not like it, and I know that we lost two good herds of breeding cattle this year, simply because we didn't have our steer classes separated. The men had a good string of pure bred steers and grades, but did not want to show them together. This is a matter for the Board to decide upon; it is simply whether you want a steer show or not The water supply has been appreciated, and I am sure this trouble Is fixed. The judging was done in a very creditable manner, and there was no complaint in that line; the judges picking their animals and placing them as they saw them. Another idea that has occurred to me would be the manner of getting the assistants for the cattle show. I think it would be fine to have some of the young men, either from the State Farm or some of the County Demonstrators, young men who are interested in this line of work, to come in and help with the work in this department, and I would recom - mend that the Board take this matter up and see if they could not get such young men to come. I hope the Board will take the above recommendations in the light in which they have been given, as I feel that it is a superintendent's duty to </seg>
            <seg id="p159">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 1ST ■the Board this kind of information, that they may have a better -standing of the wants and wishes of the exhibitors in their respec - lepartments. In closing I wish to thank the Board for the courteous and kind treatment afforded me, and only hope that the year 1914 will bring about better conditions for a Bumper State Fair for Nebraska. Respectfully submitted, E. R. DAIflELSON, Superintendent Class B — Cattle. </seg>

            <seg id="p186">184 REPOBT OF SUPERINTENDENT OF CLASS C— SWINE To the Board of .Managers of the Nebraska State Fair, c,h muD: As superintendent of class C at the 1913 state fair I here with submit my report. There was on exhibition 1,556 head of swine, divided among the differ - ent breeds as follows: Poland -Chinas, 395; Berkshires, 35; Duroc-Jerseys Chester Whites, 211; Hampshires, 136; Mule Foots, 29. The total did not conic up to the number of hogs on exhibition in former years. This is very easily accounted for in two ways: First, the extreme dry and hot weather, and, secondly, the rage of hog cholera over the state. I believe that during the past summer there have been more sick herds in the state than was ever known in the same length of time before. While we were short in numbers we were not short in quality. I think I am safe in saying that in all breeds we had one of the greatest shows ever pulled off on our fair grounds. The Poland-China show was in most classes very good. I am firmly of the belief that in this breed of hogs we are now having the leading how in the United States. The gentlemen who are managing the futur - ity show in this breed told me that they were considering making about three shows in the futurity after this, one to be west of the Missouri river, one &lt;^ast and the other in the southern states. They said that if this method was pursued it looked like Nebraska should be the fair in the west at which this show should be held. This is a matter worth looking after and I believe that your Board should make an effort to land this show for our state fair. Re Dunn- show was fully up to standard in quality. Not so many young pigs as usual, but splendid quality in the aged classes. Ne - i has for some years been the leading Duroc show of the country, believe we still hold that position. Ii Chester Whites we show a slight increase in numbers over last and the quality fully up to standard. In Berkshires a small number shown, but we bad with us two very good herds, one of them one e most prominent in the country. The Hampshire show was up to lard in quality and just a little under last year in numbers. More Foots were shown than last year and in quality compared favorably former years. tring the fair Just past quantities of manure was dumped west of ig barns along the bank of the old creek and It became very offen- I would recommend that in the future the manure be dumped in other place. Many of our hog exhibitors are compelled to camp o this place and it is not pleasant, to say the least. Very often hogs shown are tender in their feet and the sharp cinders in the show pens sometimes make them lame and an exhibitor might lose a valuable ribbon on this account. I would recommend that before the next fair that these show pens be covered with sufficient coarse sand to t&gt; rw these cinders. This sand should not contain any gravel. </seg>
            <seg id="p187">185 Kit of the leading fairs make classifications for junior and senior ions and then grand champions for the different breeds. I would nend that these classes be so made and that money premiums be in addition to the ribbons. ■hibitors expressed appreciation of the many courtesies shown by Board and are pleased with the co-operation of the Board in the r of getting a new and modern barn for swine on our fair grounds. Respectfully submitted, E. Z. Russell, Superintendent. REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT CLASS D— SHEEP Lincoln, Nebr., September 4, 1913. Hon. W. R. Mellor, Secretary State Board of Agriculture, LDeab Sir: I herewith submit my report for class D, sheep, at the :e fair held at Lincoln, September 1 to 7, 1913: The sheep on exhibit numbered 219. Sixty-one pens were occupied. The cash receiots, $61, have been turned over to the Treasurer. KB exhibits of class I) were successful in every way and I have no mendations to submit at this time. Very sincerely, W. C. Caley, Superintendent Class I). RFPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT CLASS E— POULTRY Lincoln, Nebr., December 20, 1913. To the Honorable Secretary and Board of Directors of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture, ■mi.kmen: I herewith submit for your consideration my annual as superintendent of class E, poultry, for the year 1913; also my mendations for changes for the above department. Although I keep in close touch with the pure bred poultry industry of the state and generally know about what to expect in the way of an exhibition at our fair, the 1913 exhibit was a surprise to me both in the quality and the quantity shown. Nearly every class contained better quality than ever shown here before and very few inferior specimens were on exhibition. We also had a larger number of good breeders show with us this year for the first time than ever before; this shows that the poultry breeders throughout the country are beginning to realize that the Ne - braska state fair is one of the best places to exhibit their birds. The exhibitors advise me that they make many good sales while at the fair and sell a large number of eggs and a great deal of their surplus stock during the following winter and spring to parties who saw their stock at the fair. Owing to the extreme hot weather the last exhibition was the hardest onp wp p vpr h&amp;d to h find If &amp;od t ht? hfln^rs wp.i*c kcDt. busy &amp;t &amp;I1 times </seg>
            <seg id="p188">186 water, and we received many praises from the exhibitors for the manni r in which their birds were cared for while on exhibition. A few binls were dead upon arrival at the grounds and a few more died during the ■Mk, Death was caused mostly by becoming overheated in the &lt;' icn&gt;!&gt;s. This happens every year to a certain extent, but the loss was a little heavier this year than common. Another Judge Needed E poultry exhibit is getting rather large for one judge to handle In manner and if the number of entries continue to increase th' - will be compelled to employ another Judge in order to get the made in time to give the exhibitor the benefit of the advertising. I would prefer to see fewer birds on exhibition but of higher quality, and also a better looking exhibition and general appearance of the room. The quality was improved and the number slightly decreased when the rule went into effect compelling all exhibitors to purchase ex - hihitors' tickets. That rule kept those away who in the past used to gather together a bunch of stuff and inter it for no other purpose than to get a free pass to the fair. However, it did not affect the true breid.i. for he never stands back for a few cents or dollars when he has good I'irds to show. That rule was, in my opinion, one of the best rules ever adopted in the poultry department of the state fair. But Units have changed, and we are living in an age of advancement. If we fall behind the times we are looked upon with scorn, so I am going to offer a few - suggestions to be acted upon as your honorable body sees fit. If act id upon favorably, I will lend all the assistance in my power to assist you. or those whose duty it may be, in effecting the changes and in otherwise endeavoring to make the changes a success. If you do not think best to makes these changes, I will use the same effort in trying to nnke the next exhibition a success as I have in the past, should you see fit to again choose me as your superintendent of that department. For Uniform Coops I would recommend that the Roard install uniform coops complete. Many of the other state fairs have done so, and this style of nionai ■ cvinine into general use. The State Poultry Association has purchased a large number of them that they expect to use at this winter's show, and will coop their exhibition of next winter complete with them. If you have not seen a show cooped uniform, you can form no idea whti a difference it makes in the appearance of same. By the use of these i we do'away with a great many things that causes us trouble with the old style cloth coop. The shipper saves a great deal of expense as the old coops were large and dangerous for the express companies to handle, for they were easily torn and broken and birds would get out and become lost. In hot weather they were too warm, being closed tight on all sides but one, leaving no chance for air to circulate through them thereby </seg>
            <seg id="p189">187 causing the birds to suffer unnecessarily. Often this resulted in death wt also lose good exhibitors with good birds from our own and neighbor - in- states just because they will not chance shipping valuable birds in the ctoth exhibition coop. The demand for these coops is becoming stronger each year from the exhibitor and the installation of them can - not be put off much longer. I would also recommend that if these coops are Installed that the sale of exhibitors' tickets be done away with in this department, but that an entry fee of 25 cents per bird be charged as coop rent, and where the exhibitor pays $2.50 or more entry fee, he be furnished an exhibitor's ticket without further cost. This 25 cents will not kee.i th.- exhibitor away with his good birds but it will keep him from bring - ing to the show a lot of his poor stuff just to make a big show and to get the state fair board to feed them. This will no doubt decrease t h&lt; number of birds on exhibition, but it will at the same time bring out the birds of quality, and we always prefer quality to quantity as I wt above. At present the Nebraska state fair has more birds on exhibition in their inniltry department than any other state fair I ever visited and I have seen nearly all of them from coast to coast. I do not think that «■ will lose our reputation if we do lose a hundred birds by the change, fo;' this chance will increase the income from this department and eventually* will make it more self sustaining then it is at the present time. Think i his matter over carefully, gentlemen, for I feel sure it is a move in th right direction for the upbuilding of the poultry department of our state I would also recommend that benches be placed in the old poultr; ing as follows: Along the north and south walls of the east and wings and through the middle running east and west from about ■ft inside of east door to within ten feet of west door, leaving about ?et for passage in center opposite the south door; leaving the north as it now stands, but removing the circular enclosure formerly useil n incubator exhibit that now stands in center of building. ■lis building has been an eyesore to the visitors of the fair for the few years, as it has been practically empty and is a dirty looking , but can be used to good advantage by the poultry department. As there has been some misunderstanding in the past regarding the amount charged for transferring poultry from the depot to the grounds 1 would suggest that it be made more plain in the premium list. As it now reads the express agents throughout the state do not understand II and they will weigh up the exhibitor's shipment, charge him double rate return free, then add 50 cents per hundred for the transfer here, and in most cases when the exhibitor goes to his depot for his birds he finds a bill for 50 cents per hundred for returning them to the de;&gt;ot at Lincoln charged to him and he says right away that he is being held u&lt;&gt;. He does not mind paying the transfer "though it does look like a hold up. ' but when he prepays he does not want it to come back with a collect bill attached. I would therefore recommend that it be made to read 50 cents </seg>
            <seg id="p190">188 per hundred each way, or 50 cents per hundred for the round trip, as the rust* ii my b^. I would also recommend that Silver Campines be added to Lot 4 and Bt Games be added to Lot 8 in the next premium list, above changes I feel sure will be for the best interests of the state fair, and I respectfully ask that you give them your consideration Respectfully submitted, A. H. Smith, Superintendent Class E — Poultry. rRT OF SUPERINTENDENT CLASS F— AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS To I he Board of Managers of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture, Ckmiemen: The success of the agricultural display of the 1913 state fair is unquestioned. Regardless of conditions extremely trying, the exhibits aroused comment of a flattering nature. Perhaps the best way (o put before you the views of the agricultural exhibitors will be to present the condensed minutes of a meeting of these exhibitors. It was held in Agricultural Hall, September 4, at 8 p. m. The minutes follow: Meeting of Exhibitors at Agricultural Hall September 4, 1913, at 8 P. M. The meeting was called to order by Superintendent James and the fol- lowing counties responded to roll call: County Repicsen'.ati'. e I J ostOmce ( Nebr. I Antelope C. W. Hear Clearwater Banner G. A.

Peisiger Blue Hill Superintendent James then took up the selection of grains and grasses for exhibits, and gave r.ome very instructive and interesting information as to how to prepare and select them. Mr. Peck, of Brown county, said it ought to be shown as it comes from the field, and judred under the same conditions. Mr. Lonergan, of Douglas county, says we are continually changing:. and should establish a set rule. He says that millets should be cut so as to show the proper feeding value. The judges were then discussed, and Supt. James instructed all exhibitors not satisfied with the judging to be at his office the following morning, and the judges would be there to explain the same to them. Motion was made by Lonergan, of Florence, that all sheaf grain and forage be stained or marked by order of the superintendent, so it cannot be shown at following state fairs. Motion carried by vote of thirty for and six against. Motion made by Lonergan that sweepstakes collections of corn shall be new corn. Motion carried.

Mellor, Secretary State Board of Agriculture, Iu.ak 9m: In regard to the dairy department, the only suggestion I care to make is that the rules specifically state that each creamery make but one exhibit. 1 would also suggest that in fairness to the various companies making displays in butter that a better and more conspicuous place be provided than there is at present. The only place available at present for the display of dairy products is the rear part of a cage. This case has been very much objected to by various creameries on account of its inaccessibility to the public and on account of the tront bein^ labeled with the name of a prominent local creamery. 1 think that a readjustment and a slight addition to slot age lacilities would very n.a terially improve this situation. I might also add that this year tbeie was some contusion and mis - slanding regarding the milch cow testing. This year it was under upervision and yet all rules and i emulations concerning it weie ibed in class B. If there is no objtciion, 1 would suggest that that 3( class B having reference to the milk testing contest be transferred 188 G. 1 might also add that one of the most interesting and novel stunts in connection with the National Daily Show at Chicago was a milking ion list which created possibly as mm h interest as any one feature at the National Dairy Show. In this contest many millionaires and society ladies were listed as contestants as well as the regular people from the farm. If this seems to interest you I would be glad to talk it over with you in detail. Very truly yours, J. H. Franuhen, Superintendent Class O.

            <seg id="p193">nelds along the rlatte and other streams considerable honey has been tond, and the exhibit, while a little short in quantity, was well up ir (juality. Had not one of the railroads failed to deliver a portion shipped over their route every available inch would have been covered. Be honey show was admired by the many visitors and there was a tl good feeling among those competing for the same premiums. The Bilver cups offered in this class have all gone to Cozad, a thing that yesrs ago would have been thought quite impossible. Many visitors were on the ground inquiring for supplies and were not a little surprised that none were on exhibition. In former years it was customary to offer a premium for the best exhibit of implements and supplies. This brought out a general assortment of bee appliances and the small beekeeper of the state visited the fair in order to keep in touch with the advancements made in bee implements. This brought more beekeepers to the fairs and created more interest. I would respectfully recommend that in the future an exhibit of bee appliances be tacked on to the sweepstakes or expert premium offered. This will not cost the association a single cent and will bring more people to the fair and create a greater interest. A typewritten paper proposing that the exhibitors in this class move to the north gallery of the new Agricultural-Horticultural building was handed me. Nearly all the exhibitors visited this building and looked the ground over. The general expression was that it was too dark. It was thought there was not sufficient light and would entail a large expense to install electric lights back of each exhibit in order to show it to the best advantage, that it was upstairs and that the labor of carrying honey up and down was not to be desired at all, besides at Chicago and other exhibitions where exhibits were placed in the galleries or second stories but few had interest in them sufficient to ascend a stair in order to see them. Most people become tired soon on visiting the fair and desire to exert themselves as little as possible. Two or three principal exhibitors remarked that they would not care to exhibit in the Agricul - tural building. I desire to renew my recommendations of last year, that a new roof be placed on the honey building and that the inside be ceiled up to the top of the windows, if not to the plates, and painted white (not whitewashed). This improvement would not be a very expensive one and would refit the honey building for many more years of service. I am satisfied from personal and other observations made during the past thirty years that no state in these United States is giving the public so complete a honey show as is Nebraska. This comes to us from people who are well posted on honey shows and whose opinions are unbiased. In behalf of the exhibitors in this class I desire to thank you gentlemen and the Board of Managers for the many kindly favors shown during the past years and for their cooperation in making the honey shows a success. Very truly, E. Whit&lt; omb, Superintendent Class I. </seg>

            <seg id="p197">PKOOKKL&gt;1NGS NKHUASKA STATK liOAKD OF A'ilili 'LL.TUKK lfrf IMPOHTANCE OF THE SIKE By Prof. R. K. Bliss There is great need of improvement in the beef cattle grown in Nebraska. This fact was very apparent to me last summer when I spent Biz weeks traveling through the state by automobile for the special pur - pose of studying the live stock situation. Every community has its quota of poor cattle, and some communities have more common cattle than any other kind. I do not mean by this that Nebraska has inferior stock as compared with other states; the quality of the stock cattle that come to Omaha indicate that Nebraska is in the first rank as a producer of good beef cattle. There is, however, plenty of room for improvement, and the question that concerns us is, can this improvement be brought about through the selection of better breeding animals at an expense within the reach of the average farm? The sane and conservative, and in the long run most successful, method of improving a herd of cows on the average is through the use of good sires. It is accepted by students of animal breeding that the sire and the dam each exert the same influence upon the offspring. Thus we would get the same results by breeding one good bull to a herd of ordinary cows that we would get in breeding a herd of good cows to an ordinary bull, only, in the case of the good bull and ordinary cows, the expense would be much less than the other way around. In other words, the bull represents half the herd and may, from the standpoint of im - provement, represent more than half the herd, as will be pointed out later. The practical, economical and efficient method, then, of building up a herd of cattle is through the purchase of good bulls. Everyone knows in a general way that this is true. We know that the man who consistently breeds his cows to good bulls makes the greatest success. It is difficult to get exact facts from beef cattle to show just how m h this is true. The dairymen have some advantage of us, and in order lo show the difference between poor and good sires I will quote a paragraph from circular 135, issued by the Ohio Experiment Station: "One Holstein-Friesian bull used in the Ohio Experiment Station herd increased the average production of his seven daughters 1,299 pounds of milk and 40 pounds of butter-fat per year above that of their dams. Forty pounds of fat per year for six years by each of seven cows would be 1,690 pounds of fat, which at 30 cents per pound equals $504. "One Jersey bull used in the same station herd decreased the average production of his eleven daughters of 700 pounds of milk and over A pounds of butter-fat per year below that of their dams. Forty-five pounds per year for six years by each of eleven cows would be 2,970 pounds, which at 30 cents per pound would equal $891; making a total difference between the two bulls, so far as profit Is concerned, of $1,395." Also bulletin 158 of the Wisconsin Experiment Station gives the (ol- </seg>
            <seg id="p198">196 B seems to be the unanimous cpinion of the dealers and commission &gt;f the Chicago market that the draft horse stock shipped to that from Wisconsin is of inferior quality and lacks breed character, mity, size, and weight." lj&gt;ter on in the same bulletin we find the following: Kie work of stallion licensing has disclosed the astounding fact that stallion* known as grades are at present being used for public &gt; in the state, while there are but 1,286 pure bred stallions in Ie first quotation gives concrete evidence of the importance of the &gt;r good or ill, and the second gives broad general evidence of the nature. We have but to look about us to see further evidence on hand as to the importance of selecting the sire. Many a successful breeder, or hog breeder, or horse breeder, dates his success from ne he purchased what is known as a prepotent sire, or one capable nsmitting his own characteristics in a remarkable way to his off K: what points shall decide us in the selection of a sire? How shall nw a good sire when we see him? Here is where the rub conies. j one can give more than a general answer to such questions. It is important to begin with that a man should carefully decide upon the breed which he intends to raise and then buy only sires of that breed. Switching back and forth from one breed to another simply lands a person nowhere and is responsible for much of the scrub stock which we meet with throughout the country. Having decided on the breed he wishes to produce, he should select as good an individual of the breed as he feels that he is justified in purchasing, taking into account the number and type of the cows he i;eeps for breeding purposes. By a good individual I mean a bull that has good size, straight lines, broad back, deep sides, and full quarters. In other words, one of the deep, broad, lowest blocky variety that com - bines plenty of size with fleshing characteristics. With this should be mgpertness and masculinity. It is desirable to select a bull of this type because with certain modifications the law that "like begets like," or the likeness of some ancestor, holds fairly true, and if a man breeds to a bull of that character he has some hope at least of getting calves like I ut it is not enough that the bull should be a good individual. He d also be a pure bred animal. Xo matter how good an individual he be, a grade should not be used, because the probabilities are that he not breed true. If like always begets like, he would be all right, mfortunately this grade bull may not get calves like himself, but ret calves, like some of his ancestors or a combination of his an - rs, which may have been what we term scrubs. Without vouching for the accuracy of Galton's law, for it certainly is not exactly accurate, still 1 am going to use it to explain why it if </seg>
            <seg id="p199">important to select a pure bred sire. It states the proposition in figures, and we can get at it a little clearer through the use of figures. We have already noted that the sire and the dam exert an equal Influence upon the progeny. But the question immediately arises of how much of the inherited characters of the calf are due to the immediate parents and how much are due to the back ancestry. Suppose, for example, that you were mating a beef bull and a beef now. According to Galton's law, the bull and the cow, in so far as they themselves are concerned, would exert half of the influence on the calf; the other half would come from the back ancestry. And, since the bull and the cow exert the same influence on the calf, the influence of the bull, in so far as he himself is concerned, would amount to only one - fourth. In other words, the man who breeds to a grade bull, even though he is a good individual, runs only a chance of getting a calf like him. Tracing this law a little further back, we find that one-half of the remaining heredity influence, or one-fourth, is attributed to the grand - iiarents, one-eighth to the great-grandparents, one-sixteenth to the great areat grandparents, and so on indefinitely. Now, suppose 11 man purchases a bull with no knowledge whatever of his ancestry. There is a good chance that at least half of the bull's ancestry is made up of inferior stock, and the chances of getting poor i-alves are excellent. On the other hand, a man purchases, we will say, a pure bred animal. The bull is an excellent individual himself, and upon investigation he finds that the sire and the dam were both excel - lent individuals. According to the law already mentioned, the probabili - ties of such a bull transmitting his qualities to his offspring would be one-fourth plus the part that comes from his immediate parents, or one - eighth, making three-eighths of a chance of getting a calf like himself. I~!ut suppose that the investigation includes the grandparents and it is found that they were all excellent individuals. The chances of getting a good calf is increased from three eighths up to seven-sixteenths. If the great-grandparents and the great-great-grandparents all prove to be excellent individuals, you reach a point finally where there is approxi - mately half a chance of getting animals like unto himself, or, in other words, we usually have what is commonly called a prepotent bull — a bull capable of transmitting his own characteristics in a remarkable way to his own offspring. Kindly keep in mind that these figures are used merely to illustrate the value of good ancestors. BM first cross of such a bull on common cows often brings about a rkable improvement, due to the fact that he has concentrated in his blood a long line of excellent ancestors. Perhaps half of the an / of the cows evolved by ordinary methods of breeding as we find Swill contain a number of good individuals. Combining these good ters with those of the bull, a remarkable improvement is often it about in the first cross. A pure bred, good individual is then, on the average, the best to breed to However, the name kind of reasoning that makes the pure </seg>
            <seg id="p200">198 bred, good individual the best kind of an animal to breed to would make a pure bred scrub the worst kind of an animal to breed to. For example, suppose that you buy a scrub bull simply because he has a pedigree. We will say that he te thin fleshed over the back and loin. In so far as the bull himself is concerned, the heredity influence will be toward thin fleshed calves. But suppose the parents and grandparents of this thin tiesbed bull are also thin fleshed, it is apparent at once that the chances of setting thin-fleshed calves will be greatly increased, and the pure-bred scrub may possibly, and quite likely, be the worst sire to breed to. Buy a pure bred bull always, but insist on a good individual. ■should be kept In mind that breeding operations are surrounded nystery and occasionally a plain individual proves a great breeder. » usually the exception and not the rule. The beet guide In the selection of a sire is efficiency or performance. This, however, can only be applied to bulls old enough to have progeny of sufficient age to see what they will grow into. Most bulls go to the shambles before we have an opportunity to see what the calves are like This is a mistake. Any bull that proves himself to be an unusually good breeder should be kept in the community until he dies of old age or until his period of usefulness is past. The continued use of young sires is something akin to running an experiment station without making any effort to profit by results. (how are we to keep an old bull in the community? He cannot be n an average sized farm, because there are not enough cows to it keeping two bulls, and his own calves have to be bred, hence I bull is sent to the market and a young bull from 8 to 14 months brought to the farm to take his place. Then there are many farm 10 do not have enough cows to justify them in purchasing a good T%e result of the whole business is that a lot of young bulls, jf them of inferior breeding, are pressed into service each year. It is comparatively easy to diagnose the case, but rather difficult to suggest a good remedy. In this connection, we can learn a lesson from our dairy brothers. In Wisconsin, Michigan, and now to a certain extent in Iowa, there are bull associations, or community breeders' associations, the main object of which is to improve the live stock through coopera - tion. In the bull associations of Michigan, a number of farmers will go together and purchase a bull, or, as is often the case, three different communities will go together and purchase three bulls. After two years' time these bulls, if they prove good breeders, will be passed around. In this way a bull will remain in the community six years. If he proves to be an exceptional breeder, some other association will become inter - ested in him and he will be kept in service as long as his usefulness Such an organization enables the farmer of small means and few cows to have the advantage of as good sires as the man of larger means. The actual working result is a marked improvement in the cattle all along the line. </seg>
            <seg id="p201">Kia my belief that cooperation between farmers in breeding opera - will bring about improvement in live stock faster than by any method. Cooperation has done great things in the dairy business; do the same for the beef business. As long as everyone goes it alone, without regard for hit neighbor, we may expect to have a nondescript lot of stock. For example, practi - cally every community contains several different breeds of cattle. Some will be raising Angus, some Shorthorn, some Herefords, some dairy ani - mals, some scrubs, and so on. There is always much switching back and forth between different breeds. The result is a conglomerate lot of stock. Cooperation means at the outset that a group of stock growers have decided to raise a single breed of stock. By cooperative methods they are able to bring in a superior class of sires and in a comparatively short time the community will have a reputation for breeding one class of live stock. If a community is breeding pure bred animals, buyers will i-ome from a distance because they know when they get there that they will have a large number of animals from which to select thrir breeding stock. If the community is breeding grade stock, buyers will naturally be attracted by the uniformity of the cattle and will pay highest prices on that account. In either case, cooperation is beneficial. Communities that have cooperated or have grown one kind of live stock have made the greatest progress. Lake Mills, Wisconsin, owes its wide reputation as a Holstein breeding center to &lt;ooperation. Henry "•ounty, Iowa, has made progress in breeding Percheron horses, due to the same reason. The Island of Jersey raises only Jersey cattle; Guern - sey Island raises Guernseys; Perche in France ialscs Percherons; and certain sections of England grow only Shorthorns. The remarkable suc - cess of these places has been due to the fact that they have concentrated their efforts on one kind of stock and kept persistently at it. Perhaps the Island of Jersey is too small to grow more than one kind of stock. Be that as it may, the fact remains that Jersey has a world wide reputa - tation because of her cattle. If one community in the state of Nebraska could decide upon one breed of beef cattle and by cooperation bring in and keep good bulls, it would only be a short time until they would establish a reputation for the uniformity and general excellence of their live stock which would be state wide, and which would be of great financial value. This could be done by the continual crossing of food bulls of one breed on the stock now on the farms. The value of cooperation lies principally in the fact that it enables a community to get and keep the best sires, hence coopera - tive breeding associations place ennhasis upon the importance of the </seg>

Hood |&gt;e of the most interesting phases of the world's development is the er in which the people of the civilized nations are utilizing so things which were only recently considered worthless. The in - ; in the population has been one of the reasons why this waste has utilized in the form of by-products. Few people realize the great importance of by-products, especially in agriculture and horticulture. This is not only true from the standpoint of financial gain, but also from the standpoint of supply and demand. When we stop and consider for a few minutes the vast fortunes, to say nothing of the great value, from an economic standpoint, to the people of the nation, that have been made and are being made today from by - products of other commodities, it behooves us to think and think hard. Why is it that the farmer and horticulturist are so slow to make use of the waste products? Why is it that the farmer must, or at least does, take second place in the betterment of his own conditions? Why is he not more constructive and more aggressive? Why not utilize waste products to Increase the returns from the land? If commercial enter prises take into account every particle that comes into the plant and see to it that something goes out to replace that which entered, but in a different form with greater value, then why does the horticulturist per - mit so much waste to be removed from his factory without satisfactory returns? Before proceeding with this discussion let us now turn our attention to the definition of a by-product and then see how we can fit It into horticulture and make use of our waste products. There are several definitions which let us consider. First, a by-product is a secondary or additional product. A something that is produced in addition to tnr principal product. Again we define byproducts as those materials which in the cultivation or manufacture of any given commodity remains over and which possesses or tan be made to possess market value. K order to emphasize the importance and value of by-products I wish iefly review two commercial industries, namely, the artificial gas slaughtering house industries, in which by-products are the great e of income, and at the same time produce commodities of great i to society. Stop and think about artificial gas. This is common and known to all. Not long ago there were only two products utilized from the coal - the gas at one end and coke at the other. Today, if it were not for in. - by-products between these two extremes, artificial gas would be almost prohibitive. Why? Because there was too much waste in the inanii fact lire to continue as prices in other commodities steadily increased. Only a few years ago the thick, black, viscid liquid which conden»e« in </seg>
            <seg id="p203">PEOCBBDINO8 NEHRASKA STATK nOARD uF AOKICITI.TURR 201 the pipes during distillation of the gas from coal was not only waste and useless but its removal was a positive nuisance and a source of trouble and expense. Today the tar is further distilled and yields a series of valuable by-products of which I wish to mention a few, such as parafflne naphtha, benzol, creosote, anthracene, carbolic acid, naphthalene and pitch. The basic oils of coal-tar are still further utilized and they are the source of our aniline dyes, and the various hues of which are due to the oxidation of aniline by means of acids. The utilization of these products have brought into being new industries in the manufacture of dyes, perfumes, antiseptics, paving material and fuels. Perfumes, soaps and even confectionery are now manufactured which are flavored with what is called oil of bitter almond, but which is extracted from the tar which is a refuse of gas making plants. 13 show further the importance of by-products I wish now to mention laughter house. This can be no better illustrated than by what is in our great packing houses of the present day. Some one has said only the squeal of a pig or the bleat of a sheep is lost in the plant Is t true? Is not every particle from the carcass of an animal utilized? also conceded that the by-products of many of our commercial plants rhat determines its profits. Stop and think what this means. How i profit are we making from our horticultural waste products? Let us again analyze further the packing industry. Few Indeed are the industries which have developed the utilization of by-products to such a state of perfection as has the slaughtering industry. From this con - crete example I wish to more firmly impress upon your mind the value of waste products. It goes without comment that the meat is the chief product. It is no exaggeration to say that the animal killed is used from the tip of its horns to the hair at the end of its tall. The carcass as it hangs in the butcher shop represents only 58 per cent of the whole animal on foot. The remaining 42 per cent is waste products utilized by the conversion into by-products. What per cent of our horticultural crop is used and what per cent is waste? Let us look further. There are as many as 175 different articles made from these waste products, and we might mention only a few, as fertilizer, glue, gelatine, hair bristles, oil, bones, glands or membranes from which are obtained pepsin, thyroid, pancreatin, soap, glycerine, albumen, i*t Jl further differentiate, we find the hoofs of animals are utilized according to their color, 1. e., white hoofs are exported to Japan to be made into various ornaments and imported back as Japanese art objects. From striped hoofs are made buttons, while black hoofs are used in the production of cyanide of potassium with which we fumigate our greenhouses. The hide goes to make leather which we wear on our shoes. The hair is baled and used for plaster on our houses. The blood is collected and made into blood K which we feed our cattle, and also is used as a high grade nltro - b fertilizer. The excrement and dirt from the floor is scraped up oes into fertilizer. The bones are all cooked and steamed and the ing product is steamed bone, a fertilizer valued for Its high grade </seg>
            <seg id="p204">202 (lie phosphate. The (at and meat that accumulate when the bones Lined is collected, dried and ground, and we have tankage, another uct of commercial importance. The horns are now made into ntal pieces with commercial value; and so it goes and by a closer 3 of the situation we could still reduce the waste products to ■ things of value which a few years ago were all loss. We must not assume that a by-product is a constant factor in horti - culture, for it is easily seen that it can and must change in some crops. In one case it might be a by-product and in another instance it might be the main product. So we cannot say that a given product is always a by-product especially in horticulture, but that the by-product is deter - mined by the main product and crop in question. In whatever position the by-product finds itself it should nevertheless form a greater source of income, not only from the financial standpoint, but from the economical view-point of supply and demand. I wish now by your permission to enter into a little discussion of horticultural by-products, but this in no way attempts to complete at but merely to give several concrete examples to better illustrate importance as a source of income. I am going to select first the :o crop, principally because I am interested in that plant and also se it affords a condition to show how a by-product can be changed t chief product determined by the individual. We might consider three phases in the utilization of the toiiiato crop: first, canning; second, seed production; and third, catsup. Now it is pure folly to say that any one or all three phases of the industry are chief products or by-products. To further explain, let us take the can - ning industry. Here the tomato as a canned product is the chief com - modity. But with the canned goods we have a great amount of juice which is either thrown away or used for the production of catsup. In this instance the canned commodity is the principal product, while the catsup is the by-product. Let us go further and interchange the process. Catsup now will become the chief product, and is made in enormous quantities as a chief product. Now the seeds of the tomato are useless in the manufacture of catsup. In this case the seeds are removed and sold as a very valuable commercial product, and is probably equal in value to the catsup. Yet in many places they are wasted and a source of loss. Here the seeds are the by-product and catsup the main product. This case can still be further analyzed. Suppose your business is the production of seeds. Now seeds become the principal product and the pulp and juice the waste products. This is exactly what happens in ■ commercial plant. The juice and pulp are saved, barreled up and shipped u&gt;areM«ril*t to be made into catsup, which is now the by-product. From this example I think it can plainly be Been that the by-product, especially in some horticultural crops, is a variable factor and is inter - changeable. Another very interesting and economic commodity that came to my attention a few years ago as a by-product in horticulture certainly bears </seg>
            <seg id="p205">mention at thii time. This case illustrates one phase as a by-product which can never be anything else and is not Interchangeable. It is well known to all present, especially those of us who are inter - ested in horticulture from the standpoint of vegetable gardening or truck farming, that at the close of the season there are many crops, such as cucumbers, peppers, tomatoes, beans, etc., that are killed by a slight frost, and a great amount of green fruit becomes worthless at that time. On a farm of any extent this is a waste, which should be saved and can be made into a commodity of commercial importance. By gathering the green fruit of all the crops such as previously Mnitj and converting them into what is known as "mixed pickles" the crop* become equally as valuable as if they were permitted to ripen. In fact I have known of several instances in which the value of this by-product equaled the main crop, and only a few people even attempted to utilize this material The mixed pickles, composed of the green fruit of the tomato, cucumber, sweet peppers, string beans and in fact any other crop of second grade, such as cauliflowers, etc., are chopped up, cooked and prepared and with the addition of vinegar make a commodity that finds ready sale at very remunerative prices. Another well known crop that furnishes by-products- of rrimmrrin value is the apple. I think perhaps the by-products of this crop arc familiar to all, but a review of the subject may impress you with the great \alue of these commodities. The apple probably is of greater importance than any other one fruit we possess and several times greater than many. Since I wish to talk about the by-products of this crop I will omit any mention of the fruit, because this is all known to you present. Probably the greatest by - product of the apple is cider. I mention this first because this is the trat product of the fruit, and later I wish to speak of the fermentation of the cider. Cider is in practically every case a by-product, since the value of good apples is always greater than the cider, so we utilize the wind - tails and the third and fourth grade fruit in its production. The cider has two avenues to the market: One in the form of prepared or treated cider which finds ready sale as a beverage and commands a good price. The other is in the form of vinegar. This is a staple product and a very important commodity. Few people realize the value of this article, but according to the last census report the value of cider and vinegar in the United States was almost $11,000,000 and for Nebraska $156,613. Accord - ing to the production of apples this output should be doubled, and who is losing? Not the consumer, but the horticulturist. If Nebraska horticul turists do not attempt to supply the state demand other sections of the country will, and the consumer will not lose anything. Another valuable by-product of the apple is apple butter. So far as I can learn there is but one firm attempting to make it in this state, and that on a very sswll scale. Now this is a valuable source of income and is made of waste apples and cider, both by-products, and yet the people go to other slates to satisfy their wants. Why should this condition exist? Stir </seg>
            <seg id="p206">204 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE another byproduct of the apple is evaporated fruit. This has a ready sale and the demand is increasing. Yet Nebraska goes into other states to supply her wants. Evaporated apples can be made from inferior stock, and should be a source of income to the orchardist. In addition, I might call attention to the enormous waste that occurs in a small way from all our fruit and vegetables which should be utilized and more profit made by installing a small canning outfit. These outfits vary in price from $15 to $100, depending on the size. They can be utilized to pre - serve the oversupply at the time of maturity and which cannot be sold in a fresh state. Few people realize how easy it is to can this material and what profits are obtained when this canned fruit is placed on the market in a season after the fresh supply is exhausted. I has been proven by experiment that exceptional perfumes and use - ors that are considered as being obtained from well scented flowers ade from rotten fruit. The oils coming from the waste fruit, such ■ayed pears, grapes and peaches, can be substituted for some of the costly floral odors after being treated with acids and other liquids give a remarkable fragrance. Earning up, I wish to still emphasize the great importance of by - ts in horticulture and urge the orchardist and gardener to look him and make use of the waste products in order to increase his and produce commodities that will be of value to the community. COST OF BUTTER PRODUCTION AT HOME AND ABROAD By W. C. Andreas In preparing an article on the comparative cost of butter production at home and abroad, it would only seem natural that I should try to show that everything points in our favor. It is but natural for a loyal citizen to boost for his home country. I.Ike the Irishman who was visiting the World's Fair at Chicago, in passing the Irish building became so en - thused that he threw his hat in the air and cheered. "Hurrah for Ireland! Hurrah for Ireland!" An Englishman happened to pass by at this time and, disapproving of the Irishman's actions, remarked, "Ah. Hurrah for !" (mentioning the place where bad people go). The Irishman turned, looked at him a moment and then with renewed efforts shouted, "That's right, brother, let everybody cheer for his own country." However, I shall attempt to present facts as they are in making this comparison and try to offer some suggestions along the line of producing butter-fat on a more economical basis here at home. Wherever dairying is carried on most extensively land is highest priced. Such are the conditions here in our own country as well as abroad. The close observer cannot help but notice that there must b* more money in dairying than in any other line of farming, if properly conducted for a number of years. In parts of Europe we find dairying carried on successfully on land worth from $1,000 to $1,500 per acre. We find it impossible for the dairy farmer to pay $50 per acre rent and </seg>
            <seg id="p207">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE 106 come out on the right side of the ledger at the end of the year. Here at home we would consider it the height of folly for a man to attempt to succeed in the dairy business under such circumstances. At the same time, Nebraska offers as good or better opportunities for profitable dairy - ing as any country in the world. If the European farmer can afford to come here and buy our grain at market prices, pay tariff and transporta - tion charges, feed it to his cows at home and make a profit, it seems hard to understand why dairying is not more profitable and carried on more extensively in our own community. ■■t us make some comparisons of the conditions here with those d and try to find some reason for these existing circumstances, does our cost of butter production compare with that abroad? The principal factor in butter production, of course, is the cow. The average cow in Nebraska does not produce more than 130 pounds of butter-fat per year. Herds vary all the way from 80 to 350 pounds. Only about one-third of all the cows are paying a good profit, one-third break about even, while another third are being milked at an actual loss. Several years ago Professor Haecker found the average for 160 records for ten successive years of the Nebraska Station herd to be 284.8 pounds of butter-fat. The ten highest records averaged 414.7 pounds while the ten lowest records averaged only 175.9 pounds of butter-fat. The results of the Douglas County Cow Testing Association, con ducted under actual farm conditions in our own state a few years ago, showed the best herd to average 348.6 pounds, and the poorest herd to average but 174 pounds. While one cow produced 448.4 pounds in one year another cow had but 50.7 pounds to her credit Nearly one-fourth of the total number of cows entered in this association had been sold before their yearly test was completed, because they had proven to be a losing proposition. One cause for the low average yield here at home is the so-called dual purpose cow. Entirely too many of our farmers still idealize a cow that will produce both beef and milk at the same time I remember that ex-Governor Poynter used to aay, "Show me a dual pur poae cow and I will show you a freak." Our European cousins have learned this lesson long ago. It is true that over in England the Shorthorn Is still the favorite cow ; however, there is a sharp distinction between the milk and the beef producing types. The better breeders have long ago abandoned the idea of combining these two traits in one and the same animal. They are not paying particular attention to the Bates and Cruikshank strains, but are developing distinct dairy and beef types in the Shorthorn breed to a very marked extent. As a matter of fact, the milking Shorthorn in Eng - land largely differs only in color from the Holstein-Prleslan cow In Hol - land. The milk records of the Pedigree Dairy Shorthorn show an average production of 7,638 oounds of milk produced during an average lactation period of 298 days. The Lincolnshire Red Shorthorn cows have, daring recent years, occupied prominent positions in milk and butter competi - tions at moat of the leadine English and Irish dairy shows and the </seg>
            <seg id="p208">206 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF" AGRICULTURE tls growing in popularity. Among the breed we find herds to ! better than 10,000 pounds of milk per annum during an average in period of 300 days. On the Lord Rothschild estate, where ISO C Shorthorns are kept, we found a cow that had produced over pounds of milk in leas than ten months. All over England we ; form of the milking Shorthorn to be that of a special dairy type. Ke prevailing dairy cattle in Scotland are the Ayrshire. Over 13,965 and heifers are records as yielding from 7,125 to 8,925 pounds of per year or better, according to the Report of the Scottish Milk d Committee for 1911. I the farm of Mr. Alexander Cross at Knockdon, Scotland, we found Lyrshire cows, and according to the records kept by Mr. Cross. ?ed about 40 pounds of milk, testing 3.8 per cent butter-fat, per day. twelve tons of Cheddar cheese are manufactured on this farm an - r. We weri' informed at the Kilmarnock Dairy School that the Ayrshire cows milked at this station averaged 9,380 pounds of milk 30 pounds of butter-fat per year. The black and white cattle, of course, predominate in Holland. There are in this country three official dairy breeds: I The bla.k and white Friesian — Holland. The black and white headed Gromingen. 3. The red and white Mense — Rhine IJsel. I lie average in the best herds is given as 10,750 pounds of milk per when all animals including those which have calved for the first are included. Some cows have given as much as 26,880 pounds, average percentage of butter-fat is not much over 3 per cent, «J - ;h in some herds this is said have been increased to better than 4 ent. We visiteo several farms where forty to fifty cows were kept, yielding as high as 70 and 80 pounds of milk per day. In parts ■rmany, especially northern Germany, conditions are very similar, — lolsteln-Friesian being the favorite cow. Iording to Professor Boggild, the Danish authority on dairying, :al number of cows in Denmark during twenty years (1880-1900) creased from 15,800 to 2,200,000. Now somewhat over $63,600,000 of butter is exported annually from this little country. The Red i and the Jutland are the two principal dairy breeds. Some 38,000 if the first named breed on the Island of Fyen averaged over 300 i of butter, while individual herds have averaged 400 pounds of per year and better. On the small Jersey Island, covering not more than 34 square miles, there is said to be from 11,000 to 15,000 cattle. Mr. Perry, secretary of the Jersey Cattle Breeders' Association, informed us that the average pro - duction of these cows was better than 6,000 pounds of milk per year, testing 5 per cent butter-fat, while some individual cows tested as high as 7 per cent. Mr. Alfred I^e Pateuerel, a prominent breeder on the Guernsey Island, stated that the average Guernsey cow would produce S.ooo pound* of milk or 400 pounds of butter-fat per ye«r, while his herd </seg>
            <seg id="p209">l'JUH.'iiEl_&gt;lNGS NEBRASKA STATE IHJAUD uF AUK1CUL.TURE lit' I Hi better than ll.uuu pounds of milk. As slated before, the cow principal factor in milk and butter production. The main reason ilrying is conducted more successfully in some European countries t home is largely on account of a better class of cows. However, id, the crops and the man must also be considered in determining ;t of butter production. In the eastern part of our state we have land worth from $100 to $150 per acre, capable of producing corn yielding 10 tons, alfalfa 4 tons, and oats 50 bushels per acre and better. In parts of Europe agricultural land valued at $500 to $1,000 is not capable of producing au equal number of pounds of digestible nutrients per acre. I: our annual meeting last year Mr. Glover, in a very able article on Present Cost of Milk Production," stated that a cow producing 7 "00 Is of milk containing 280 pounds of fat in a year will require on verage about four tons of silage, about three-fourths of a ton of id feed, about one and a half tons of clover or alfalfa hay, about ind a half tons of corn stover and about four months of pasture, cost of producing this feed on the farm is about $30.75, while if ;d at market prices will be double this amount. I cording to Professor Haecker, the average cost of feeding a dairy it market prices, as shown by records obtained at the Nebraska &gt;n in 1905-1906, was about $30 per year. In the Douglas County Testing Association for 1910 we found the average cost of feed per o be close to $37.90, — the feed also being figured at current market Here is something that no European country can compete with; absolutely no country in the world can produce a balanced ration for cows as economically as we can here at home where corn and alfalfa can be grown in abundance. True, one acre of our pasture grass will not go as far as It does in some parts of Europe like the Channel Islands and parts of England and Holland where it practically supports a cow during the summer, besides supplying part of her hay feed during the winter months. But land of this kind cost from eight to ten times M much as our land does, so that at the end of the year we are far ahead in the game, and when it comes to grain and winter feed we have every - thing In our favor. As stated before, the European farmer buys our grain, and in some instances even our hay, to feed to his stock. Mr. Dunlap, Dunor Maines, Scotland, paid $25 per ton for American hay. The corn fed on Lord Middleton's ranch, Malton, England, was all im - ported from the United States at a cost nearly doubling our market price*. Corn imported from Argentine and the United States is exten - sively used for feed in almost all European countries. Over $123,000,000 worth of grain and grain products were exported from the United States But, you wlU My the cost of labor is deddsdiy cheaper o»er tber* than here and that this must also be considered la the coat of tatter pro - duction. The average farm laborer in England and f]i i»&lt;l—«, If married, </seg>
            <seg id="p210">SM PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE UiiAKIl OF AQKIt 'I I.Tl KK receives about $200 to $225 per year, with house furnished. Single men receive from $176 to $190 and board. In Holland and Germany similar wages are paid. However, when we compare the actual work accom pllshed there to the work we do with our improved methods and modern machinery, for the same amount of money expended, I feel satisfied that there is but little if any difference, and that even this is in our favor. On my cousin's farm in northern Germany twenty men and women con - stituted a crew operating a threshing machine that had a capacity of threshing forty to forty-five bushels of wheat per hour. While this labor is cheaper per day and per hour, conservative figures showed that he ;iaid 3 1-3 cents per bushel for labor only to thresh his grain, where under similar circumstances It would cost us but 2*4 cents per bushel to thresh this grain. It requires less work to feed 100 head of hogs here at home than it takes to care for ten head in the old country. Although the hired labor for the actual milking of rows is considerable less abroad, the cost of producing and handling the feed, the caring for these cows, as well as the marketing of the dairy products, is more expensive across the water than here at home. The marketing does not enter into this discussion. Therefore, it is suffice to mention that our manufacturing industries are far superior to those abroad. Such being the case, we ask, "How can the European farmer compete with us in butter production?" And we must answer in saying that this is because he is a better dairyman. This involves that he has a better uniform grade of cows; he knows how to care for and feed these cows economically and also understands how to take care of their products in an efficient manner. Further than that, he has nothing to his advantage. It is time for the American dairyman to wake up to a realization of his natural advantages in cheap feed and good markets. Let us study all the principles of dairying which require thought and skill; let us weed out every "star boarder" cow, build up good herds and feed and care for them well and economically ; let us employ cleaner methods in the handling of our milk and its products and we will soon place ourselves in line with the best of European dairy countries, — we will soon place our state where it belongs, in the front rank as an economical producer of butter-fat. PRACTICAL ROAD DRAGGING BT AFTHTTR W.

Political parties, always on the alert (or issues of popular interest bave all embodied, in their platforms, planks declaring for "good roads legislation," and every candidate for legislative office, state or national, is for "good roads." There can be no doubt but that public sentiment, in the city and in the country, is strong for road improvement. Many theories are advanced and many plans proposed. Some favor the building of a system of permanent roads by the federal government connecting the state capitals and larger cities; some favor doing this partly by the .-tates and partly by the government. Others favor its being done en - tirely by the communities through which the permanent roads run. Still others are opposed to any plan for permanent roads, unless the entire expense is sustained by the property owners on or very near such roads. I'ith these various plans I am not concerned in this discussion. I no quarrel with those who are advocating the cause of permanent i, if we can finally agree on a fair plan for building them. I believe the time is coming when we will begin and gradually extend such a system. I believe that modern methods of business and agriculture eventually make not only necessary, but economical and desirable, a m of permanent roads. But the sentiment in Nebraska at the present time is strong for general improvement of all our traveled roads. Arguments in favor of good dirt roads that may be traveled throughout the year are no longer necessary in Nebraska. We have tried it out and we know that a prop - erly graded and drained road, when kept well dragged, makes a good road almost the entire year. Most of our traveled roads have been graded, and some of them have been kept fairly well dragged. Such roads are practically always good. We all agree that the roads should be dragged, not only occasionally, but at the proper time after rains; not after one or two rains, but after every rain. The trouble has been up to this time that we have had no system or plan for doing this all-important part of our road work. If the district road overseer happened to be pretty much interested in dragging, he has kept part of his roads in pretty fair con - dition by dragging them at the proper time, as a general rule% If Mr. A happens to be an enthusiast for dragging, he may keep the road along his farm dragged so well that it is always good. If Mr. B, living adjoin - ing, happens not to be much interested in roads, perhaps he fails to drag his road at all. On the other side of Mr. B lives Mr. C, who believe* in dragging, in a general way, but is farming so much land that he seldom ever has time to drag his road, though he believes it would be a good thing. When you or I happen to travel over this line of road we find three kinds of road — good, bad and indifferent If all the people along the road felt as Mr. A does, then all the roads would be good, because they would be always properly dragged. In some localities we do find several miles of well-dragged roads. In others some are good and some are bad; and in some others they are practically all bad — simply for the want of systematic dragging. We do not conduct any other line of county or Drecinct work with as </seg>
            <seg id="p212">210 I system or plan, with as little foresight and economy, or with so satisfaction or result, as we do our road work. We all agree that it leas to maintain a road in condition for travel by proper dragging by any other method. We know it is extravagant and wasteful to the money to grade up a read only to see it go down and be worse ever for want of dragging, yet we do it right along — and why? y and only because, heretofore, we have had no method that would I such dragging, no levy made to create a fund for that particular se, and no one with authority to carry out such a system. If you ask the road overseer of a district why all the traveled roads of his district are nut regularly dragged, he will tell you that there is not enough money in his fund to use for that purpose, which would prob - ably be true. He would also tell you that he had other road work to look after, and that, even it he had enough money to pay farmers along the roads to do dragging, still he had no particular authority to do so, and also, that he hadn t time to attend to the matter anyway, — all ot which would be true. In order to insure the systematic dragging of roads there must be authority placed with some one who has the time and the money to use and a systematic plan for carrying the work into effect. Just such a plan was devised by the last session of our legislature and put into a law known as House Roll No. 288, and to which I desire to call your atten - tion, and for the enforcement of which by your county board I sincerely hope you will all use your influence; for it is often one thing to pass a law, but quite a different matter to get it enforced. This bill passed both houses of the legislature practically unanimously and had the sup - port of those members who opposed all other roads legislation. Very briefly it provides as follows: Places the authority for dragging with the county board with power to levy a tax of not more than one mill to provide a "dragging fund." The county board to appoint a "superintendent of dragging" in each precinct of the county, whose duty it is to travel over the precinct and select men who have teams and who are willing, when paid, to drag the roads. The county board is to divide up the graded roads of each precinct into small dragging districts, and the superintendent is to hire farmers living along the road (if they will do the work) and pay them 75 cents per mile for each mile dragged both ways, if they use an eight-foot drag with four horses, and 60 cents per mile for a seven-foot drag with two or three horses. The superintendent is to begin his work of making con - tracts for dragging March 1. He is to receive $2.50 per day while actually engaged in doing this work. The roads are to be dragged when - ever the superintendent directs. If the superintendent fails to get results, he may be discharged by the board. The superintendent has authority to discharge any man he has hired who falls to do dragging when directed. The county is to furnish the drags for doing the work. The idea is that when the board makes a levy for this dragging fund, they will decrease the general road levy somewhat — possibly to the </seg>
            <seg id="p213">amount of the dragging levy, depending, of course, on the amount of general road work they expect to do. The reason for placing the authority with the county board is that it must be placed somewhere so we will know who to look to for its enforce - ment and hold directly accountable if it is not enforced. The reason for having superintendents in each precinct is that the county board could not possibly cover the whole territory of a county, so must select some good man in each precinct whose heart is in the work and who will get results. It would probably require his services two or three weeks dur - ing the year. He may be one of the road overseers, if he is qualified for the work and wants to do it. The reason for dividing up the precinct Into small dragging districts is so that the farmer living along the road may be hired to do the dragging along his own place, with perhaps a little more added close by, in case his neighbor, Mr. B, will not agree to drag, even if paid good wages for it. Mr. B may be opposed to dragging at all, or he may favor it, but on account of his large amount of work at home be unable to drag when dragging is most needed. It makes no difference what he believes if he will not drag. In any event the dragging money, which is levied and raised from taxation all over the county, la spent right in the county and it is paid directly to the farmers who do the work. We cannot expect to get something for nothing, and we can - not expect that any great number of men are going to drag roads unless they get fair compensation for it. If a farmer refuses to drag his own road, when offered fair pay for so doing, he cannot reasonably complain if he is taxed a small amount so that another farmer, his neighbor, may be paid for the work. If a farmer does not drag at all, he will at least have a good road when he travels, and so will you and I, and that is exactly what we are after. It seems to me that this law offers the fairest, most economical and practical plan for accomplishing what we all want In Nebraska, but what up to this time we have failed to get and will fail to get until we use the same kind of order and system in road dragging that we use in all other lines of work. We are now spending enough money on our roads to have them well dragged, for if they were dragged when dragging is needed they would rarely ever require grading after the first time. It is true that we have better roads now than we did ten years ago, but they are very far from what they would be if systemati - cally dragged. Iider the new law I have referred to, the proposition is put squarely i the county board in each county. While they have many other 3 to perform, yet one of their most important duties is that of g for our roads. We can never have good roads unless the county I is composed of men who know something about road work and are rapathy with it. Talking about better roads and giving advice on to get them is interesting and, possibly, instructive sometimes, and quite generally indulged in; but there is no way in which we can along the cause and get results more quickly and surely than by t to It that none but competent road men are elected to the county </seg>

MAKING COLONIES OF BEES BY THE NUCLEUS PLAN By H. C. Cook, Omaha, Nebraska. K writing on the subject assigned to me, that of making nuclei for production, I will endeavor to give the members of the association !t I can from some of my own experiences. K begin with, I make my nuclei in August, after the summer honey over, and as I winter in the cellar, have no fears about their through O. K. Here I would like to depart a little from the subject and say a few words about the cellar. Prom my own experience, I have found that it would pay a beekeeper with fifty colonies or more to have a cellar, if it was necessary to build a new one every year rather than winter on summer stands. I-ast season I wintered sixty-four colonies, weighing them In and out with a shrinkage of an average of eight pounds and two ounces per colony. Here is a saving in honey enough to pay for the construction of the cellar, besides the feeling of security from loss of bees which the beekeeper can have. I say this because I have only lost one colony each year for the past three winters, and I have wintered colonies of two frames, made of two one-pound sections to each and not more than an ordinary teacup full of bees. I return to my subject. Take an ordinary ten-frame hive and divide 3 three compartments, by making a division board of three-eighths material, similar to the ordinary board, only it should fit down to the bottom and extend up even with the top of the hive so that a piece of canvas is spread over the top the compartments are bee from each other. This will make three three-frame nuclei. Make itrances very small, not room for more than two or three bees at a and make one entrance at each corner and the other In the center. Now, to make the nuclei. On looking over the apiary in August, there will be found several colonies much stronger in bees than the others, and as the honey season is now practically over so far as surplus honey la concerned, these colonies will be none the worse the first of next April for having taken a couple of frames of sealed brood and bees, bo we will take two frames from each of these colonies. We will suppose we hare </seg>
            <seg id="p215">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 111 twelve of these colonies that can be used in this way, and we will make four of these three-frame nuclei by giving each two frames that we took from the colonies and a frame of honey. As to queens for these, we should have made preparation for these ten days before, by making some colony queenless, and giving this colony some nice young brood and eggs from the best breeding queen. Then by the time the nuclei are ready these cells will be ripe and ready to cut and graft into the nuclei. This queen cell should be grafted on the (enter comb of brood in each nucleus, and should be in a protector to keep the bees from cutting it down, as they sometimes do. When every - thing is ready, they should be put in the cellar for five days, during which Hme the queens will have hatched and also a considerable quantity of brood. They are then taken out and put in any convenient place, and very few bees will return to the parent colonies, provided the brood has been taken out in the middle of a warm sunshiny day, when most of the leld bees are out in the field. In a very short time there will be a nice young laying queen in each nucleus, and In this way they are left until the time arrives to put them in the cellar for the winter. If the fall 1» an average one for bloom, they will gather enough honey, together with the original frame given them, to carry them through the winter. |&gt;me may say, "Why not make these nuclei in the spring?" Because can be made in the fall from bees that can be spared just as well as while in the early spring every bee counts, and they are all needed, &gt;esides, we could not get good queens in this locality so early. About the first of April the nuclei are taken from the cellar and put on their summer stands. They will get along all right with a little pro - tection from the cold winds. There are so many bees together that they keep warm, and these young queens build up very rapidly as the days grow warmer, and soon there will be enough bees to make larger quarters necessary. This is done by placing a hive on each side of the nuclei hire. Close the entrances to about one inch, and have this on the sides next to the nuclei. Now lift out each outside nucleus and put them in these new hives, closing their old entrances up, and the new one is so close they will have no trouble in finding it. This leaves the center nucleus in pos - session of the entire old hive. Take out one of the division boards to make a little more room, and give each of the three colonies another frame or two, if they can use it, and continue to add a new comb when - ever they need it. If the spring is not favorable, It will probably be necessary to feed them a little between fruit bloom and the clover flow. If the work has been done properly, and the bees cared for as they should be, they will be in condition to commence storing in the supers about the 15th of June, or at the commencement of the sweet clover harvest, and these colonies will not swarm and will probably give as good a surplus of honey as any of the colonies in the apiary. There is also another plan of nuclei, generally used to make increases for the next season, and it is not expected that they will make honey the same season, but we will change the old plan of a one-frame nucleus left </seg>
            <seg id="p216">214 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Kf, to build up a colony for next year, and see if it is not possible e some surplus honey and have the colony in as good condition t spring. Make a three nuclei hive, the same as in the other plan, and make the nuclei as early in May as it is possible to find colonies in the apiary strong enough to spare the brood and bees. The nuclei are made in a similar manner as before, except that only one frame of brood and bees is taken. Put one of these in the center of each nucleus, grafting a queen cell on it, the same as in the other plan, and put a comb of honey on one side and an empty comb or a full sheet of foundation on the other. If no frame of honey is available, it will be necesary to feed them. This can be done by taking an old comb and filling it with sugar syrup, by laying it flat in an ordinary wash-tub and pouring the syrup from a sprinkling can held about four feet high. This dropping of the small streams of syrup from the sprinkler will go down into the cells and fill them just as if put there by the bees. Lift the comb and turn the overflow of syrup in the tub back into the can. Then put the comb back with the empty side up and fill it the same way. You can get four or five pounds of syrup into a comb in this way, and it will not leak out It should be hung over the tub for a short time to allow the syrup to drain off the outside before giving it to the bees. These nuclei, being three in the same hive, will keep warm and build up much faster than if they were in separate hives. About the only care they will need is to look them over occasionally to see that their queens do not get lost in mating, until about the 20th of June, when the sweet clover will be in full bloom. Then go to these hives, take off the canvas and put on a slotted honey board. This board will fit to the division boards, so the queens cannot get together. Put on an extracting super of old combs, and the bees will all work together in the super, and the queens will keep up their work in the brood chambers. I have often had two full depth supers filled by such colonies. In the fall there will be about as many bees in each of these compartments as there would have been if they had worked separately, and in that event there would have been no surplus honey. These colonies will winter better together than they would separately, and will do better the next spring if kept together until the weather is settled, when they can be put into three full sized hives and given more room. This should be done as soon as they commence getting short of room, and done in the same way as they were divided in the first plan. Eve taken it for granted that all here are beekeepers and on that t have not gone into details and explanations as fully as if I were ; to a beginner in the business. </seg>
            <seg id="p217">I'KuCEKDINij.s NEUKA8KA STATE BUAK1) OF AUKlCUi.TUKK Mi GROWING ALFALFA AND ITS FEEDING USE ON THE DAISY FARM Bit E. P. Brown Some years of experience in the growing of alfalfa has convinced the writer that certain considerations are essential to success. It is desired briefly to consider these. Good seed is the first and most important of these essential conditions. In the writer's Judgment good seed is, first, home grown seed. This is seed which, if not actually grown upon the farm where it is to be sown, yet comes from a comparatively short distance. Experimental data In - dicate conclusively the great hardiness and productivity of the crop resulting from native seed. It is also thought desirable, if not essential, that seed be purchased from the grower. By this it is not meant to imply that seedsmen intentionally deceive their customers, but often in the very nature of the case they are unable accurately to state the source from which their seed comes. Passing as it must through many hands before it reaches the retail dealer, its history is often lost, and the buyer desiring native seed is often supplied with seed imported from a distance. Testing of the seed before sowing is essential. This testing is now done for a small fee by the department of the state pure food commis - sioner, or equally as well can be done by the purchaser himself. A small quantity of the seed to be tested is put between two cloths, kept moist and warm for a week or ten days and the percentage of germination determined by count of the resulting sprouts. Mere ocular examination is inadequate to determine the viability of alfalfa seed. Such examination discloses only the purity of the sample. It frequently happens that seed of great purity is low in viability. Three samples tested by the writer not long since showed, respectively, 98, 98 and 99 per cent in the purity test. The germination test showed them to rank 95, 80 and 54 per cent. It is obvious that in this case the low testing seed costs very nearly twice the price of the high testing seed; and if there were no other reason than the saving of this cost, a germination test would be necessary. How - ever, when we consider that these low tests are usually due to the presence of many so-called hard seeds, another and even more important reason for the germination test becomes apparent. These hard ■nodi, aa is now well known, require considerable time before germination can occur, due to the fact that the outer coating of the seed Is impervious to moisture, the seeds often in the case of fall sown alfalfa falling to sprout before the following spring. Suppose August 15 to be the desirable date for seeding, and suppose all conditions at that time to be favorable. If the seed sown be full of hard seeds, it may well occur that germination dees not take place until sixty or eighty days from seeding, which In the majority of cases is too late for a successful outcome. Hence, whether seed be purchased or home grown, it is equally important that its char aeter should be determined by test before it Is town. </seg>
            <seg id="p218">216 Next in importance is the condition of the seed bed. The nature of the seed, the small quantity of plant food stored in it for the use of the little plant, the impossibility of deep planting, all indicate a seed bed prepared with greater care than is usual for ordinary farm crops. The ideal seed bed for alfalfa is one that is fine and firm underneath and tine and loose on the immediate surface. How these conditions are to be obtained depends upon the soil, the season and several other factors. It often requires muifa labor to reduce the plowed field to the desired con dltion. Some seasons no amount of labor will produce the desired con - dition. In other seasons heavy, packing rains may give the proper com - paction with the minimum of labor. But whatever the conditions of weather may be experience and observation alike agree that the condi - tions mentioned must be present before a full measure of success can be hoped for. Another element in the seed bed is of equal importance, although less generally appreciated. I refer to the amount of moisture it contains. I'nliss at the time of seeding there is a considerable body of the subsoil moist, agriculturally considered, the chances of success are greatly di - minished. 1-et us suppose that at the date of seeding there be twelve inches of the soil sufficiently moist to permit plant growth. Inspection of the surface only will indicate a favorable condition for seeding. Seed sown on such ground, if germinating promptly, should under favorable conditions produce plants with roots reaching to the lower limit of mois - ture in a few weeks. Roots will no more grow into or through dry soil than through stone, hence will cease their downward growth when the dry line is reached. The result in the given case will be a shallow rooted plant. The stand may be perfect, but, lacking the depth of root which ia characteristic of the normal alialfa plant, will be unable to endure drought or to produce profitable yield. The chance for the lack of moisture In the subsoil afterwards to be made good is remote. In the given case the resulting stand would probably be sufficient to use the subsequent rain - fall without permitting much if any of it to reach the dry subsoil, thus making the condition of superficial rooting a permanent one. It is sug - gested that better practice in the matter of alfalfa growing would indicate the necessity of examining the subsoil as to its moisture content before sowing. If this examination, discloses the lack of sufficient moisture to insure a continuous growth by the tap root of the alfalfa plant, it would be better to defer planting until more favorable conditions obtain. It is believed further that on most soils and in most seasons broad - casting is preferable to drilling the seed. Usually one inch is about as deep as the seed can be planted without danger. On most soils and with most types of drill it is impossible to avoid deeper planting. Also, with drilled alfalfa the plants germinating as they do at the bottom of the drills are liable to be covered by rain washing the earth from the inter - mediate ridges into the drills. In the writer's experience, broadcasting has proved practical and better than drilling. Where care has been exercised to obtain the necessary conditions above </seg>
            <seg id="p219">217 I led, namely, good seed, a well compacted and sufficiently moist d, the writer has for some years found it possible greatly to reduce ount of seed sown per acre without diminishing the resulting stand d of hay. Ten pounds of such seed sown on a seed bed as de - has proven ample. However, it should be said by way of caution is is true only when both seed and seed bed are of the best. As to the matter of harvesting and oaring for the alfalfa crop, time and space permit the briefest mention. Generally speaking, however it is thought well to cut when the crown of the plant exhibits the formation of the buds for the succeeding crop, without reference to the stage of bloom. The stubble left by the mower should be long to Insure the swathe lying away from contact with the damp earth and permitting circulation of air under it. Since of course the leaf of the alfalfa plant contains the greatest amount of nutrients the aim of the haymaker should be to preserve it in the best condition. Hence, the hay should be handled in such a manner as to prevent the undue drying of the leaf until it has I in formed its natural function of exhaling the moisture in the stem of the plant. Also, the hay should be handled so as to break and shake the leaves as little as possible. To this end, the modern side delivery rake has be&lt;&gt;n found most efficient. As compared with the ordinary dump rake, it permits the making of a better quality of hay in shorter time. The writer's practice is to rake the hay in small windrows as soon as it is well wilted and then, according to the prevailing weather, to invert these windiows once or oftener with the same rake. In this manner it is often possible to cure hay from twenty-four to forty-eight hours quicker than by the use of the dump rake. Storage in barns or sheds is in most case* far preferable to stacking in the field, especially in the more humid por - tions of the state, although by the use of wooden or canvas stack covers or a long slough grass the hay may be stored in the field without great The limits of this paper permit but the briefest reference to the matter of feeding the hay. This is the less regretable, because the main trouble of the dairy farmer will be not to feed the alfalfa profitably, but to pro - duce the hay in the first instance. Hence, the greater portion of the tlmr ;ii my disposal has been spent upon the questions relating to production. It may be said in general, however, that alfalfa in the dairy has but one use, namely, for feed. It makes mighty poor bedding. It is thought that the better practice requires supplying the dairy animals with alfalfa in unlimited quantities. That is. they should be fed all they will clean up. It is the writer's experience that where possible it is well not to Insist too strongly on the cows making too dean a clean up. If the coarser portions rejected by them arp fed to other stock, especially to horses, It will be better for horses and cows alike. Especially when combined with well made silage is alfalfa to be commended 10 the dairyman. Doubtless, in this audience there are none who have not a sufficiency of alfalfa. But the writer's observation is that hundreds if not thousands of Nebraska formers an attempting to conduct their dairy operations without alfalfa. </seg>
            <seg id="p220">This may be done, perhaps, and still yield some profit, but that the profits can be greatly increased by the judicious use of alfalfa hay is demon - strated by the practice of every successful dairyman. In many cases its value, doubtless, approximates that of bran, pound for pound, but in all cases in the writer's judgment will its value be found very high. A com - bination of better cows, more alfalfa and silaee seems to be all that is necessary to make Nebraska dairying the most attractive and the most profitable form of agricultural efforts. THE NEBRASKA FOOD LAWS By E. L. Redfern Uwb are passed for the protection of society against the individual who desires to take advantage of his fellow. This desire is so strong in man that our courts are kept busy trying to obtain the truth in oases and punish those who are guilty of violating the law. This is not a modern affliction, but has been the condition down through the aees Food laws were enacted to protect the consumer from injurious and dishonest adulterations. The passing of food laws beean parly in the 17th century, for it was immediately following the "Middle Aees" that food adulteration became common and it became necessary to pass laws to restrict the practice. Penalties for law violation were severe in those times and history records instances of men being put to death for adul terating foods. Bakers in England adulterated their bread and meal, which resulted in the enacting of the "Bread Assize" in 1634. In the United States food adulterations were practiced for many years with very little restriction, with the result that many manufacturers had grown rich and powerful, so that when a state or congress tried to nass a law regulating the sale of food stuffs there was organized onoositlon. which in many cases was successful in defeating any laws aimed at their nracttce. It took twenty years of organized effort to get a federal pure food law. It took several years in Nebraska to convince our legislature that a pure food law was necessary. Men of good standing in business and their communities were daily turning out adulterated foods, and any laws that would reflect upon such men's business were not to be tolerated by an all-wise legislature. After the passage of the federal pure food act in 1906, public senti - ment changed and the legislature of 1907 enacted a pure food law, but only after much heated debate and personal references among that law - making body. The large food manufacturers had their hired lobby in Lincoln, which was also true of the patent medicine organization. Thesp powerful influences brought much pressure to bear upon the leaders ia the legislature to make the law ineffective. While this law was not per - fect on first passage it has been remedied by subsequent legislatures until we now have a good working foundation, and no doubt in a few years any defects will be adjusted and tho law will give &lt; omplete protection to the consumer. </seg>
            <seg id="p221">219 The Nebraska food law now governs the sale, handling and distribu - tion of all food products. It has forced the injurious adulterator out of business and makes business hard for the fraudulent adulterator. The law defines food as any article used for food, drink, confectionery or condiment by man or animal, whether simple, mixed or compound. This definition corresponds with the federal definition and is sufficiently broad in its scope to cover anything that man uses to nourish his body. The law defines adulteration of foods as follows: ■If any substance has been mixed or packed with it so at to lower luriously affect its quality or strength. The adding of water to would be a case in point. BIf any substance has been substituted wholly or in part for the \ as in mixing Rio coffee with Mocha and selling it for Mocha. :!. If any valuable constituent of the article has been wholly or in part abstracted. The skimming of milk would be a violation of this Kit be colored, powdered, coated or stained, whereby damage or ity is concealed. The coloring or staining of any food to make It tter than it really was would be in violation of this section. .".. If a food contains anything injurious to health. This would cover ttu- use of injurious preservatives. 6. If it consists in whole or in part of a filthy, decomposed or putrid animal or vegetable substance. This section covers the sale of rotten vegetables .r meats or fish that have passed the fresh stage, and the department has occasion to enforce this part of the law as much as any, and many of the complaints received are for the sale of putrid food. Klf it consists of any part of an animal unfit for food, whether manu 3 d or not, or if it is the product of a diseased animal or one that ed otherwise than by slaughter. Efectionery is adulterated if it contains any mineral earth, chrome paraffin or poisonous color or flavor, or any malt, spirituous or liquor. Ice cream is adulterated if it contains less than 14 per t in plain cream or 12 per cent in fruit cream. Misbranding consists in offering for sale an imitation under the name of another article. If labeled or branded so as to deceive or mislead the purchaser, or purport to be a foreign product when not so, or if contents of any package has been removed and other contents substituted, or if the label fail to state the proportion of any alcohol or habit-forming drugs. At present certain foods in package form must be labeled with the net weight, and after March 4, next, all packages must bear the net weight statement. Our legislature has seen fit to go a step beyond the federal law and require that all compound syrups must show the per cent of each ingre - dient. Our state supreme court has upheld this part of the law, and we now know how much corn syrup is in our Tennessee sorghum or New Orleans molasses; also, how much maple syrup is In your cane and maple syrup. This is a good provision and only gives the consumer the information he is entitled to. </seg>
            <seg id="p222">220 You now buy your oysters without added water, no longer paying oyster prices for water. Your sausage and hamburg steak is free from injurious preservatives. .Your milk and cream is free from formaldehyde and contains the legal amount of fat. There is no longer danger in feed - ing the baby cow's milk. El fancy jars on the grocers' shelves that once bore the label "Pure Jam or Preserves" is now labeled "Fruit Jelly, strawberry flavor, sed of fruit juice, torn syrup, sugar and phosphates," or perhaps ound Fruit Jam, made of apple, raspberry, and cane sugar." Im Nebraska food law is one of the best and deals justly with pro and consumer. The man or woman who buys food products is en - ii) know exactly what he is buying, both in quality, quantity and )siticn, and no honest food manufacturer or dealer will deny him ight. The watchword is, "Read the labels on the foods you buy," ■ end that you may receive the protection the law contemplates you have. Iie sanitary law, while being a separate statute and having been d two years after the pure food law. is purely a pure food statute, regulates the conditions under which foods are kept, handled, pro I or eold. This is one of the best laws which we have, being copied the Indiana law, and is far reaching in its scope; in fact it covers eld of handling and producing foods so completely that it has never changed since its passage nearly five years ago, and those who hare o enforce it are unable to suggest any improvements. While it is of first importance that food be free from injurious adul - terations and be properly labeled, it is no less important that foods be produced and handled in a sanitary manner, free from dirt, flies and contamination. This law provides that the floors, walls, ceilings, recep - tacles, implements, machinery of every establishment or place where food is manufactured, packed, stored, sold or distributed, and all cars, vehicles and trucks used in the transportation of food, must be kept clean and free from flies, dirt and dust. All refuse from preparing food must be removed daily and all machinery and utensils used in food factories must be kept clean at all times. Likewise the clothing of all persons handling food must be clean. With all these regulations this law goes still farther and requires that the walls and ceiling of every bakery, confectionery, creamery, restaurant and hotel kitchen shall be of brick, cement, plastered, wainscoted or ceiled with metal or lumber and shall be oil painted or kept well lime-washed. Floors in all these factories must be made of some impermeable and non-absorbent material which can be flushed and washed clean with water. The windows of all food places handling food must be well screened and the doors must be fitted with self-closing screen doors. Convenient toilets are required for employees, but they must be separate and apart from the room where the food is kept or handled. When this law was passed it was a common thing to find a toilet in a restaurant kitchen with only a half partition around it. This law protects the health of the employees by requiring sufficient light and ventilation. </seg>
            <seg id="p223">The handling of any food by a person afflicted with any venereal or contagious disease is forbidden under penalty. Employees are forbidden to expectorate upon the floor or walls of any establishment where food is handled. The application of this law to the country slaughter bouse hag resulted in the building of proper buildings, well floored and screened. If any of you have ever visited the country slaughter house of a few years ago you will agree with me that there was urgent need of improvement. If you wish to see the effects of this law, notice the plate-glass counter rases In the Lincoln or Omaha confectioneries where the candies are pro terted from flies and dust. These stores at one time had most of their candies spread out on open counters exposed to flies and dust and the breath of the purchaser or passerby. Often fans operated above these counteis blowing all the dust that was stirred up by customers down onto the candy. Observe the plate-glass covers at the soda fountains for pro - tt ning the dishes of crushed fruits from flies and dust. Lunch counters which displayed their food in individual dishes on the open counters have built glass cases to protect the food from possible contamination. And last but by no means the least, every loaf of bread is being wrapped so as to protect it from contamination by dirty hands and the dust and dirt of the streets. One encouraging thing stands out to encourage those who enforce this law, and that is, in practically every instance, after attractive caws are secured for the protection of all these foods, or a ceiling, wall or floor has been ordered to be painted, or repaired, the parties contend that they would not think of going back to the old condition, and in many cases it has required several hundred dollars to make the improvements. We are truly living in a progressive age and the time is near when the person who produces or handles food in an unclean or unsanitary condi - tion will be eliminated. The greatest impetus the department has ever had was when our present governor advocated and the legislature put into law the con - solidation of the food and oil departments. Prior to this step the depart - ment had been hampered and curtailed in its work by lack of funds, but now the department is self-sustaining and . has in excess some 140,000 with the state treasurer. At the same time the number of inspectors has been doubled and the number of inspections greatly increased. Another law which is of primary importance to the housewife is the new weights and measures law. This law requires that all scales over which you buy your foods must be accurate. The dry measures in which your potatoes, apples, etc., are measured must contain the exact quantity which they are supposed to represent. The liquid measures which meas - ure your vinegar, etc., must be true to standard. How many of you are buying cranberries by liquid quart instead of dry quart? There are 9.5 cubic inches difference in favor of the dry quart measure by which they should be sold. It is quite essential that you check the quantities of the foods you buy. in regard to weight and measure, as well as reading their I HI)* IS". </seg>

Bushnell Pmost important steps taken for the advancement of dairy ■braska was that inaugurated and carried out in September ; of the first Nebraska dairy train. Nothing has been done lied so much to the farmers of the newer section of the iting the opportunities for dairy farming to them for build ipment in agricultural lines. The dairy train was conducted by the Agricultural Extension Depart - ment of the University of Nebraska and the State Dairymen's Association, the initiative being taken by the Dairymen's Association, which found in the experimental station willing and ready co-operation of the largest kind. This first dairy train was new to Nebraska. In other states they have been a feature for a number of years, and the illustration of what they were doing in sucn states as Wisconsin undoubtedly had an influence in causing the officers of the Dairymen's Association in this state to take upon themselves an experiment of the magnitude that the running of this first dairy train in Nebraska involved. I second co-operation was secured, without which it would have been sible for the trip to have been made, and that was the co-operation I Burlington and Northwestern railroads which furnished the train quipment for the six days' run on each of their lines. The train left In on September 17, made a circuit of northern and western Ne a, covering some 1,200 miles, reaching Lincoln again on the evening ptember 28. 13 not the purpose at this time to go into detail regarding the train, ient and the routine work that was accomplished each day. That en covered in a complete log of the dairy train that was kept h the two weeks and afterward furnished to the Dairymen's Asso - , the Agricultural Experiment Station and the other interests di - contributary toward the success of the undertaking. The most striking characteristic of the running of this train was the cordiality of its reception at every point visited and the eagerness with which the thousands listened to the instruction and information given and the attention which they gave to the exhibits. It was not unusual — in fact, it was a common occurrence all through the northern part of the state — to have farmers and ranchmen coming thirty, forty and as far as fifty miles to be present at the arrival of the dairy train and to be present at the meetings where the train stopped. We have, in different lines of publicity work, been on many trips over the state similar in character to this; in commercial life, trade excursions do a similar work, and in the direct farm lines, the seed corn trains covered a great field, but in none of these was there ever the Intense and universal interest taken in them that was taken in this dairy train. Certainly, the development of a proj- </seg>

These people, with few exceptions, have not the time or the means to visit the University and see the work done there or attend the lectures and witness experiments at the agricultural farm. It was worth while to them to have taken to their local towns a train of exhibits, the strong men in the agricultural school and have at their homes an hour's session of dairy inspection such as the dairy train afforded The agricultural college would count it as a wonderful increase In their student body if students additional enough came to the school to use the hours that thirty thousand people out in the state used in visiting the dairy train. Reduced down, it would mean the addition of hundreds to the agricultural college, and, measured in this way, the instruction given to the people put in touch with the working of the school could not N&gt; duplicated for an expense two-hundredfold greater than the coat of this dairy train. It counts for the future tremendously to put thirty thousand people- upon farms and homesteads to thinking along the pro - gressive ways of modern agriculture and farm life. It counts in unnum - bered ways. It opens a new view to those who have been long on the tarn s and who have not kept pace with modern development. It opens to the boys upon the farm new vistas of the possibilities of farm develop - ment and renews interest on the part of everyone in those things they have around them which have not been appreciated and understood at their full worth. This is state development; the increase in dairy production, the in - crease in farm stock, the increase in the better growing of crops, the increase in products to be manufactured and transported, and all of these were splendidly stimulated by the visit of the dairy train to the far sections of this state. Ask any of the professors who were with the dairy train for the two weeks; ask any of the railway officials who accompanied it and lent their assistance; ask any in touch in any way with the first dairy train and its results, and there will be but one response, and that is, that a work so profitable and that created such universal interest and that carried so much to an enthusiastic people ought to be continued and made a definite plan of work on the part of this association for the It many state organizations have a record in the past year of such re development work as has this association. Not many state ations could gather such admirable assistance as the running of iry train gathered. It means something to have a corps of splendid ctors and the interest and support of the entire faculty of the state ltural college enlisted in a movement of this kind reaching out to better touch with the people; and it means something for the State lien's Af*o&lt; intion and for the agricultural colleee. when th&gt;"y get to </seg>

Outside of the results direct in the way of the dissemination of information that the dairy train took to the people — outside of the wonderful interest that was exhibited by the thousands on every hand — outside of the glimpses of instruction that came to thousands of school children — outside of all these large features of worth, it ought not to be forgotten that whenever are brought together three such interests as the dairy interests with its already great development and wonderful future, the agricultural eolleee with all it has to offer to the farmers of this state, and the transportation companies that mean so much in reaching the markets of the world with the products of the farm, that in such coming together the whole state has taken a united step forward and shows to its peonle that these great interests can work together, can develop together and can build for the future together, working in harmony for a greater state and a greater prosperity among the people. So. in the list of the good results to be ac - corded to the first dairy train, let it not be overlooked that the railroads that did so much for its success are entitled for their full credit in the results that follow an educational work of this kind, taken to the most 1 emote confines of this state where there is a waiting field of development hardly appreciated and little understood. rLING VS.

            <seg id="p227">practiced very extensively in European countries. In America, where conditions are radically different as regards cost of labor and the price of the product, the use of soiling has not been generally adopted. However, even in Nebraska, if it is desired to get large and uniform returns from a large herd throughout the whole season, it will be found desirable to grow at least some green crops or provide a summer silo to help tide over the poor grass period that practically every Nebraska dairyman experiences during part of the summer. Silage or Soiling Crops With a view of securing some data of local value in regard to the advantages of soiling crops as compared with silage, an experiment was planned by the Dairy Department early in the spring of 1913. The ex - periment is planned to extend over a period of years. One year's results cannot be considered in any sense conclusive. They may, however, be taken as a likely indication of final results. The cows used in this ex - periment were as nearly representative as it was lossible to get them. They were divided into two groups. Group No. I was this year fed on soiling crops and Group Xo. II was fed practically the same grain and hay ration as No. I, but silage was substituted in place of soiling crops. The soiling crops and scheme of rotation for a tetnow experiment was nlanned and used as a basis for this work. in each plot was plowed, harrowed and disked and the seed bed prepared in the bfst possible manner.

The seed was drilled in rows forty inches apart. In spite of the best care being taken in selecting seed the stand from the Evergreen corn was so poor at to make replanting necessary. Pride of the North corn was accordingly sub - stituted in its place. Thorough cultivation was given the corn and on August 6 it was ready to cut. The supply lasted from the 6th to the 26th of August, the supply for each day's feeding being cut daily. This plot averaged 7.8 tons per acre, or 1.5 tons dry matter per acre. Plot II On the 7th day of May Plot II was seeded to peas and oats, 26 pounds of peas and 14.5 pounds of oats being used. Warm weather caused the oats to head out before they reached the usual height and on account of the extreme heat many of the peas died before reaching much growth. The peas that survived the heat and drouth were badly burned at the bottom. This crop was used as soon as the peas and oats neared maturity. It was harvested from June 25 to July 13. It yielded at the rate of 3.5 tons per acre. On July 29 this plot was plowed, harrowed and rolled and the bed appeared for another crop of peas and barley, which was sown July SI. The little barley that had sprouted by August 25 was burned off by hot winds. Rains in September Induced the remainder to sprout, but the growth was insufficient for use as forage. Plot III After careful preparation this plot was seeded to rape on the 13th day of May. One and three-fourths pounds of Dwarf Essex rape, the beat variety, was drilled in with a hand drill in rows eighteen inches apart. On July 17 the rape was first used for forage. The three days between the close of the peas and oats period and the beginning of the rape period the cattle were fed the second cutting of alfalfa. The yield of rape was 3,596 pounds, or at the rate of 6.3 tons per acre. On account of the dry weather there was no chance for a second crop of rape. Plot IV I May 24, 4.6 pounds of St. Charles white corn was drilled In. The 'as harrowed on May 29 Just as the corn came through the ground, me 9 the corn was cultivated.

The balance, owing to the drouth, was dried up to the . that it was deemed best to rush it into the silo. The plot yielded pounds of green matter, which was at the rate of 6.8 tons per acre. Plot V Plot V was sown on May 29 to early amber sorghum. It was sown at the rate of one bushel per acre. The cutting of this crop began September </seg>

About half the crop was cut by September 10, when the soiling experiment was drawn to a close. The yield of the crop was 5,210 3 green matter, or at the rate of 10.8 tons per acre. Plot VI Plot VI was devoted to alfalfa, but for some reason the stand was so poor that it could not be accepted as at all average, hence no mention is made of it here. Good Crops for Soiling Peat and Oats, Cane, Corn, and Alfalfa. — Some other experiment sta - tions have done considerable work on this subject, and in going over the results obtained by them we find that peas and oats is one of the most satisfactory crops and can generally be counted on for two sowings. The first crop should generally be sown as soon as the ground is ready for oat seeding in the spring, and the second probably about two or three weeks later. Generally the early maturing variety of oats is most desirable in i he first sowing and a later maturing variety in the second. Fodder Cane has generally been found an excellent forage plant for soiling purposes. It yields very heavily and is palatable and nutritious. B'alfa. — Green alfalfa may be used for soiling three times each season. , generally be counted on late in May or early in June, just before its and peas, and again just before the corn is ready for use. The cutting comes on just after the cane. Table No. 2 gives in condensed form the yield in tons of green and dry matter per acre In addition to the actual cost per ton as fed. Table No. 2.

Table No. 4 gives the results of one season's feeding experiments with four cows where silage was substituted for soiling crops. It will be noticed from this experiment that the average cost per pound of pro - ducing the butter-fat was 21.5 cents, or a difference in favor of silage of 3 cents. Attention may be called to the fact that the cost of producing butter-fat in both of these experiments is somewhat higher than would be the case on the average Nebraska farm, which is accounted for by the fact that the cows had to be very carefully watrhed in order to make the ex - periment of the greatest value and also by the fact that the soiling crops were grown on exceedingly high priced land adjacent to the State Farm. This, however, does not affect the comparative value of the experiment as all the ciops and the cows were kept under the same conditions. The following advantages and disadvantages of the use of the soiling crop are given so that you may judge for yourself whether they apply to conditions under which you labor : Advantages of Soiling ■Permits of a more intensive system of dairying and the keeping of er number of animals. 2. Permits production of milk free from flavors due to pasture weeds. ■Furnishes a succulent ration and maintains a continuous milk t when pastures may be seriously affected by drouth. 4. Decreases the necessity of a heavy grain ration and purchase of concentrated feeds. Disadvantages of Soiling 1. It requires a man and team daily to cut and haul a supply of forage to the feeding yards, interfering with the regular farm work. BEven with careful planning the season may be such as M hinder ivelopment of the crop with subsequent shortage of feed. ■Soiling crops must be gathered in all kinds of weather.

Requires a number of small diameter silos in order to feed enough silage from the surface to prevent loss by decay. </seg>
            <seg id="p233">Conclusion From a practical standnoint we must of necessity proceed slowly In the matter of turning to the sniline system. There is absolutely no ques - tion but what the farmer can raise more crops and keep more cows per acre by an intensive system of soiling crops; that to, if preen feed is brought to the cows rather than the use of pasture. The American farmer, however, is rightly concerned chiefly about the profit for the year's work rather than in the privilege of handling a larger number of cows. A complete soiling system is entirely feasible and practical In Europe or near our large cities where labor is cheap and land is very high However, as conditions here are materially different, it is quite likely that for most places in Nebraska the growing of green crops should for the present at least be limited to that period of the year when they are so much needed to tide the cow over the dry, hot summer months. Ictlcal experience has shown that when pastures are depended unon I main source of feed during the summer months, the cows do not their maximum yield. It has been shown also that when the milk i once diminished by unfavorable conditions, it is Impossible to the cows back to a normal yield when conditions again become The solution of this problem which confronts nearly all Ne!&gt;rask» dairymen lies in adopting preventive measures. In other words, Ncbra»k» farmers must be prepared to supplement the pastures by means of soiling crops or by the use of silage. Owing to the cost of labor and the rela - tively low value of the land and the crop, soiling, with the exception of alfalfa, apparently Is less efficient than silage under Nebraska conditions. The important point, however, is that in a section in which hot, dry sum - mers are the rule, as is the case in certain sections of Nebraska, such soiling crops as can be grown cheapest or silage should be provided for the dairy cow so that she may be kept up to her maximum yield during the critical period so often experienced. GOOD ROADS AS A BUSINESS PROPOSITION Read Before the Nebraska Hardware Meih Hants' Association, Omaha, February 7, 1911, by George R. Chatburx. Professor of Applied Mechanics, The University of Nebraska Many of the most important things in the world cannot be measured by the ordinary medium of exchange. For example, good health, the air we breathe, the education we get in the common schools, the roads we travel upon. We know and realize that poor health is a direct source of expense and indirectly the cause of great money losses. Men have given thousands of dollars to prevent the erection of high buildings which would cut off the supply of sunlight and fresh air. The lack of an education is so great a handicap to the individual and so detrimental to </seg>
            <seg id="p234">2SS PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the welfare of the nation that we pay our biggest taxes to keep up the school. Bad roads are stagnation and even death to trade and commerce, resulting in large losses of time and money. While we realize all this — the great blessing that comes with the enjoyment of these things and the serious disadvantage their absence means — we are not sufficiently ac - quainted with the underlying data and do not well enough understand the intimate relationships existing between the various interests of life to set a definite value in dollars and cents upon any one of these useful and necessary elements. In fact, they cannot have the same value for all persons. Local conditions, individual differences, sentiment and many other elements must enter into anyone's estimate of what a thing is worth. But notwithstanding this many efforts have been made by road economists to evaluate the benefits of good and the losses due to bad roads. For instance, the United States Office of Public Roads several years ago published a bulletin in which an effort was made to show that the cost of hauling on the country roads was annually about $900,000,000; and that with the uniformly good roads there might be a saving of over $600,000,000. Professor Chase of our own state makes a very plausible calculation to show that the average Nebraska farmer would save each year $147 if all the roads leading from his farm to his market were dragged after each rain. He also calculates that the average farmer would make a further saving of $30 per year by using broad tires upon his The chief value of good roads is not in the actual saving over bad roads in dollars and cents, but they are desirable for the same reason that a man buys a carriage or a carpet; that is, they appeal to one's desire for comfort, for beauty, for pleasure. In an early day Nebraskans lived in sod houses, they could no so today if they so wished. A man could go to church wearing overalls and juniper, but he prefers other styles of clothing. In a great many things economic considerations are of minor importance. But as I am asked to speak upon Good Roads as a Rusiness Proposition I shall mention a few economic advantages. Good roads decrease the cost of transportation by allowing larger loads to be hauled or by a saving in time. It is upon this argument that Professor Chase's calculation mentioned above is based. Good roads save in the wear and tear of wagons, harness and horse- Good roads and the possibility of daily marketing allow the cultiva - tion of crops not otherwise profitable — of intensive farming, if you please. I have known whole families to support themselves upon small patches of five or ten acres by gardening. Other crops would require forty acres and still others one hundred sixty acres. As a rule, the smaller the number of acres required to support a family the more perishable the crop raised and the consequent greater need for goad roads and quick n.arketlng. The same rule applies in mercantile pursuits.

Still few large fortunes are made without assuming some risk. We occasionally read of fruit crops bringing $500 per acre; strawberries, watermelons, tomatoes, like high returns. Ordinarily with such crops the risk is great. Early frosts, insects, drought, glutted markets, and bad roads may cut down the profits. The safer we can make such crops by improved roads and stable markets the more persons will go into this intensive farming. The rural districts, due to the combining of farms brought about by the use of improved machinery and the piosperity of the farmers, are decreasing in population. Make it profitable to diversify farming and raise more per - ishable crops and instead of farms growing larger and the population smaller, the farms would become smaller and the rural population larger. Itd roads give a wider choice in the time of marketing. Taking 1 connection wiih the possibility due to good loads of the rural •y of mails, making it possible for the farmers through his daily to keep in touch with the markets and take advantage of high may mean considerable to the farmer In the course of a year, the report of a iirst assistant postmaster general we quote: I his incitase of the value Lot' farm lands reached by rural free ryj has been estimated as high as $5 per acre in some states. A -ate estimate is fiom $2 to $3 per acre. In the Western states ally the construction of good roads has been a prerequisite of the iahrutnt of rural free delivery service. Better prices obtained for products, the producers being brought into daily touch with the of the markets and thus being enabled to take advantage of infor - u heretofore unattainable." And then he forcefully adds: I&gt; these material advantages may be added the educational advan - conferred by relieving the monotony of farm life through ready to wholesome literature and the keeping of all rural residents, ing people as well as their elders, fully informed as to the stirring of the day. The moral value of these civilizing influences can too highly rated." But how will all this affect the urbanite, the business man of the town? In various ways, almost too numerous to mention. Savings in transportation will be more or less equitably distributed among the pro - ducer, middlemen and ultimate consumer. Bach will receive a portion. But suppose the whole or a major part remained with the farmer. As his profits increased so would his expenditures; he would buy lumber, nails, etc., to build larger and better farms and houses. He would install the modern conveniences, water, light, heat, and sanitary equipment; he would buy a new range for the kitchen, a new carpet for the floor, new furniture for the parlor, china and silver for the table, a piano for the daughter, a gold watch for the son and an automobile for the whole family.

Usually the poorest roads are just on the edge of town a large volume of traffic converges to enter the city.

A single mud-hole might be the means of turning traffic to a neighboring town, thus unduly building It up at your Because marketing of crops must be confined to periods of good roads, there is at such seasons a glut in the market and a consequent reduction in prices paid the producer, but usually no corresponding reduction to the consumer. Warehouses and elevators have to be built larger than would be necessary were roads uniformly good the whole year around. A greater number of railroad cars is necessary to take care of the congested traffic, only to lie idle on side tracks in seasons of bad roads. Iniciesi and overhead charges upon these extra buildings and equipment must eventually be paid by the producer, middlemen and consumer, re - ducing the piofits of the liist and second and increasing the expenses of the last. Not only elevators and railroads feel the depression of bad roadj, but all commercial and financial interests are affected. The United States is said to be "handicapped in all the markets of the world by an enormous waste of labor in the primary transportation of our products and manufactures, while our home markets are restricted by difficulties in ruial distribution which not infrequently clog all the channels of transportation, trade, and finance." Two farmers live some distance apart. The first devotes his time to dairying and makes butter and cheese, the other does not wish to bother with cows so he raises grain. The first man says to the second, "1 need your grain, you need my butter and cheese; if you will build a good road between our farms, we can do business with each other." Do you not think the second larmer would insist on the first helping to construct and maintain that road? Ridiculous as the proposition of this farmer seems, that is the attitude of many merchants, the railroad or other busi - ness and professional man of the city. Here is a merchant with a stock of goods; he wants the farmer to come and buy his goods, but he is not interested in the roads over which the farmer travels to reach his store and seldom thinks of him except when he pays his taxes; then grumbles because of the amount of the road and bridge tax. He virtually says to the farmer, "I have the goods you want, you have farm products I need; if you will build a road and keep it in good condition, I will sell you my goods and buy yours." And he is more magnanimous, he further says. or his actions imply, "I will drive for pleasure upon the roads you have made and kept smooth," and he puffs himself up and pats Mr. Farmer on the back and says, "You are doing a good thing for the country, your savings because of these roads will be several times their cost;" never once thinking that the town man is also reaping financial benefits because of the farmer's energy. On the other hand, the farmers should not ex- </seg>

Only a short time ago I heard a country merchant complaining that while the farmers of his community had grown more wealthy than the average merchant, they refuse to give of their wealth to keep up the village church, to support a lyceum bureau, or even to pledge beforehand a small amount to secure the success of a farmers' institute. He said they, the farmers, expect the village merchant to do all these many things that make for the social uplift of the community and still sell them goods at prices quoted by mail order houses in distant cities. It is a question of common fairness and the square deal. Each member of a community, whether he live on a farm at in the town, should be willing to share in the responsibility and ex - pense of those agencies which make for the best interest, financially, so - cially or educationally, of the public at large. I tie I personally do not own an automobile, or at present a horse, other thing that uses the road except the two feet that I was for - enough to be born with, I nevertheless do not feel it a hardship to y poll or road tax.

The idea of a "special train exhibition" of any kind, I presume, arose from the specialty made by the world renowned "show king," P. T. Bar - num, who presented to America the wonders in the animal kingdom and the ability of men and women as trained gymnasts. This idea trans - ferred to an advertising scheme to assist merchants and real estate men to present their "wares" to the world and to advertise their localities was so successful that the University saw an opportunity to do some extension dissemination of knowledge among the farmers with the "seed com train." This was such an efficient undertaking that the dairy train was sent out with one of the best dairy cows in the world and with up-to-date equipment for the dairy farm. As will be told by extracts from letters from superintendents and pupils, a deep impression was made upon the minds of those who had an opportunity to visit the exhibition. The lectures were very valuable to the students who are studying agriculture, and aided the farmers to understand better the value of the dairy cow, the beef cow, and the row to be used for both purposes. Objective teach - ing has been the means of securing knowledge by all classes of people throughout the ages, and there Is no better way of establishing the truth than by demonstrating it with the actual object at hand. ■ am giving here a few extracts from letters received from some of chools where the milk cow train stopped.

Edith Thrasher, eighth grade, Eustis: "They told us the way to tell a rood cow is by the long chest, wide body, and large veins near the surface. An ordinary cow gives five cans of milk a month, and a Hol - stein cow gives about twenty-five cans of milk a month." E. Robert Frady, student Oakdale hirh school: "It has helDed the agriculture class in its study of animals and their feeding. It has helped them to distinguish between a good milch cow and a poor one; a good steer for beef and a poor one. It has aided in the study of rations; what are good feeds and what are bad. The class now knows the use of a silo and the best to have. There are several stock raisers and farmers in this district who have seemed to get the same results from the lectures, as evidenced by their dairy and beef herds. The several silos in this com - munity were put Into more use this year than ever before. Cattle do not stand in mud to their knees about the water tank, and are given dry beds in warm sheds at night. Hogs have also been treated to warmer and drier sheds." Iuperlntendent C. O.

S interest aroused by the work of this train caused Superintendent Neff of Phelps county to take up with the Beatrice Creamery ny a plan whereby the Babcock milk tester might be used in a few schools of her county. The company replied in this manner: "We are willing to do something along these lines, and contribute something to the placing or installing in schools a tester for the purpose of educating the boys and girls of our schools in the use of the Babcock tester. * * * I am writing this superintendent that we will contribute five testers. Perhaps she can get along with that number for Phelps county, but whM they should have is one for each school, and a regular course of Instruction." Much enthusiasm has been aroused in all communities where the dairy special train stopped and instructors gave a series of lectures. This will add much to the material welfare of the state, because a higher standard of dairy cows will be secured for financial reasons. Likewise, a more profitable strain of beef cattle will be produced, for when farmers have a knowledge of better ways to advance their resources, they proceed at once to put that knowledge to practical use. The school people of Ne - braska appreciate very much what the University School of Agriculture has done through extension work for the farmer boys and girls, and we hope the Nebraska Dairymen's Association will send out another train this fall, covering points not reached last year, and wherever a demand Is made, repeating the demonstration in places heretofore visited.

The ship itself is a marvel of construction; the crew, from captain to stoker, a marvel of efficient organization. You pass from the harbor out into the broad Atlantic. Very soon the shores of America fade away. The horizon seems boundless. You are alone with sun and sky and moon and stars, and wind and water. If there is anything in the world that will impress one with his own littleness, it is to stand on the deck and think of this immensity above him, before him. behind him and below him. It is the greatest lesson in humility that a man can have. Your craft is of 20,000 tonnage. A little over 400 years ago Columbus came across this self - same ocean in three little boats — one of 50, one. of 100 and one of 300 tonnage — destination unknown. What a marvel of Initiative! What a marvel of courage! What a great step into the great unknown! Truly, the world owes Columbus much and the debt is constantly increasing. In due time, on the left, land appears — the green clad hills of Ireland. The harbor of Queenstown is reached. It seems good to see the land. A little later to the right appear the fields and farm houses of northern Wales. A little later you enter the river Mersey and you are at Liver - pool. — England — that wonderful island empire, the source of our language and our race; but after landing you know that you are in another country, among another, but kindred people. Everything is new, the people, their customs, the streets, the street railways, the steam railways — all are different. You don't know a single soul, and yet you are on the shores of an island empire having 44,000,000 people. You try to understand things, to grasp them, to comprehend them, to find out where you are. Details Forgotten In the swirl and whirl of these new forces and the many new scenes presented you hardly know what to do first. In this condition of mind you feel the necessity of comprehending the general outlines, and details are forgotten. Liverpool Ierpool is one of the four largest shipping cities in the world, situ - a the eastern bank of the Mersey, with Birkenhead across the river west. In the two cities are something less than a million people. re find the finest docks in the world. The products of every climate rtered, sold and exchanged.

While here you first begin to he forces that have made this little Island the center of so much com ial activity on the seas. You see that it was absolutely born of isity. Its extent of territory is small; but the sweep of the seas Is and the old Anglo-Saxon blood was at home on the sea; and Liver - had the harbor to receive and protect its commerce. </seg>
            <seg id="p243">Berpool was the home of the Ill-fated Titanic. It is the home of the ic, the Lu3itania, the Mauretania and the Aquitanla. It is these marvels of ship construction that make the crossing of the Atlantic lay and a source of pleasure. Manchester I Winchester is thirty-one miles or so from Liverpool and is connected the sea by the Manchester ship canal, costing more than $80,000,000, -by ships, all but the largest draft, can deliver their cargoes on the &gt; in Manchester. Within the municipal boundaries of Manchester orated three-fourths of a million people; but the municipal boun - s contain but a small part of Manchester. Manchester is a railroad center, lines radiating in all directions, con - necting all the cities of the kingdom, surrounded closely by dozens of manufacturing cities, ranging from 40,000 to 150,000 people. There are factories everywhere and coal mines everywhere. Innumerable smoke - stacks fill every valley. It is the most densely populated industrial, textile manufacturing city in the world. The manufacturing in all lines is done largely outside of Manchester, while inside Manchester her capital and her energy are devoted to the distribution of the vast output of the mills and looms of the surrounding cities. K American consul informed me that, taking Manchester as a center, thirty-five miles of where we sat there were nearly 5,000,000 in - 1 people. Cheshire and Ayr South of the county of Lancasttr, in which are situated the cities of Liverpool and Manchester, lies the county of Cheshire. Passing from Lancaster to Cheshire the scene changes from ships, factories, chimneys and smoke to meadows, grassy fields, woods, cottages and clear skies; and such lanes, and such roads and such grass and such cows and so many of them — an agricultural country, with deep, rich soil — an agri - cultural population, industrious and thrifty, where agriculture is in - tensive, but not extensive. This is where the Cheshire cheese, so famous in the market of England, is produced. It is largely made on the farms, and placed for sale by the farmers with a central selling association; and each farmer's make is sold on its own individual quality. There is as much diversity in Cheshire cheese as there is individuality in farmers. Iheshire and the county of Ayr of Scotland are the finest in the lorn in dairy lines — Cheshire for cheese and Ayr for milk; and you find the finest grass, pastures and meadows in these two counties, lie county of Ayr the Ayrshire cow naturally predominates. In hire there is not that distinctive type. Cheshire, all over England, is famous for its grass, its milk and cheese and its salt mines. The cow population in these two counties is very large, possibly the largest of any like territory in the world. ■and in all these dairy sections is very high, and rents are also high; the cows are owned and the milk is produced by renters largely. </seg>

London I: pass from Cheshire to London. London is about 200 miles south ast of Liverpool and Manchester, in the south of England. It Is ed on a level plain, which is divided by the river Thames. The Thames rises in the interior of England and is made up, before it is London, of many minor streams. The minor streams are the ! of a part of the water supply for the people of London. The ebb le flow of the tides of the sea are seen and felt westward of the The harbor of London is to the eastward, extending to the city of Tilbury, about twenty miles from London; but the broad estuary of the Thames, from London bridge to its opening in the sea, is really one great harbor and port. Greater London contains nearly 8,000,000 people. It is not only the capital of England, but of the British kingdom— but, more than that it is the capital of the British empire, comprising 400,000,000 people. Eadon is one of the four great shipping centers of the world. There peopled place so small or so insignificant on the face of the earth hows of and feels the influence of London, in government, in com - and in finance. London is not noted for its beauty, it is not noted for its art, but it is noted all the world over for its utility and common sense, and the longer you stay there, the more the power of utility and common sense im - presses you; and the longer you are away from it, the more that is the part of London that stays with you. You can't help but admire and be impressed with the intelligence, the energy, the thrift, the industry, the initiative— everything that makes for development, back of this great city. It is a great magnet, drawing all humanity and the most vigorous and best thoughts of humanity — Londonward. Other cities of the world are great in special lines, and in those special lines impress you much and overshadow London; but London, while not as supremely great in some things, is simply the all-around universal city — the pulse city, not only of the British empire, but of the The center of the city of London is the Bank of England, and this, in turn, simply represents the accumulated thrift of a great people, wisely In this island empire we have described four unique phases of her national life: Liverpool represents the domestic and foreign commerce; </seg>

Bnt beyond and outside of these external evidences of growth we must look below to the national spirit — to the race — to the human spirit, which make such developments possible. Looking backward to her history and looking forward to her future, commerce, finance, manufacturing and agriculture are to her supreme necessities, each to be developed to the limit. It would seem that those four great lines of development had not developed equally — that finance, commerce and manufacturing had forged ahead and that agriculture had lagged behind — that the growth of these four lines had not been proportional. This fact is true of England, Prance, Germany and all the countries that I visited. It is true of the United States. The evidence of this fact is seen in the increase of population in the cities, in comparison to the population in the country. Further erl - dence of this is seen in the increase of prices for food. Perishable foods are the results of agricultural activities. While the units in manufactur - ing and commerce are gradually being cheapened and financial operations are being transacted on a constantly decreasing scale, yet agriculture seems to linger. The demands on production are much larger than the supply from production. We think it is an acknowledged fact that there is a constantly growing demand on the perishable food production of agriculture, beyond the present power of agriculture to satisfy. Climate The climate of the British kingdom and the continent, while seasonal, does not have those great fluctuations of temperature that we have in this country. Another fact that imnresses one very much is the absence of files. If they had in these countries the extreme heat and the flies that we have in this country, their whole system of markets would be Impossible; and we must bear these two facts in mind, In studying market conditions. Markets It was our good fortune to be able to visit and soend more or less time in the city market of Manchester, in the Smithfleld market of London, in the Central market of Paris, in the market place at Lucerne, and In the principal markets of Munich, Dresden and Berlin. Of all these markets, the Smithfleld in London stands out the great market, from almost every point of view. These are all perishable food markets. The sanitary conditions of all these, excepting Smlthfleld's, were not such as to commend themselves to the American ideal — no matter whether you take into consideration the goods, the utensils, the facilities, or the people handling the goods. The conditions for cleanliness and sanitation were behind the times. At Smlthfleld's they were up to the time* I will describe to you as a very good type of the markets the Central market of Paris, and that description will apply more or less to all these public markets — aa to their general features. This market 1« situated </seg>

A part of this market is conducted in buildings part on the open streets. The market opens early in the morning — &gt;r four o'clock perhaps. On the open streets, outside of the buildings, you find a vegetable and flower market. There may be a few stands, but for the most part the vegetables and flowers are on the bare pavement. Every vender has a little space and the vegetables as well as the flowers are gathered in that little space. There is no protection from dust, or dew, or sun, or wind or rain. This occupancy of the streets, of course, is what might be called an overflow market. Sometimes you will find fruits sold in this part of the market. These vegetable and flower spaces are, in a great many cases, managed by women. The sanitary conditions under which those vegetables are sold, both as to the preparation and condition of the vegetables themselves and the handling by those selling them, are very poor. The quality ranges from the finest to the most doubtful; and after the market is over, the unsold portion presents a very unappetizing ap - pearance, and is sold at the lowest prices to meet the lowest grade of restaurant and family trade, making a loss to the producer and only an apparent gain to the consumer. Ede and under cover in the buildings are the booths for meat, eggs, butter and some vegetables. Inside, the people doing the have stands and all the conditions are much superior to those I should estimate there are between 5,000 and 10,000 people on this et selling produce. Each vender sells only a small quantity, so there is a great waste of effort and a great waste In the left-over. ; is no control over the inflow of food in these markets. There is ay In which its capacity to absorb food supplies in each line can •termtned. If there is more food on sale than is required, it must &gt;ld at any price, and thus losses in price and losses in waste In - bly follow. In this market, as in nearly all of the markets of Europe, there is very little. If any, provision made to take care of what is left when the market closes. This surplus or left-over is a problem and there is no way of handling it except by selling it at a loss and supplying the cheap trade. This is done, of course, at the expense of the producer, and at the expense of quality and increases the risk of doing business very much. It may be argued that the consumer, on a mere quantity basis, is bene - fited, but from a quality basis it is fair to say he receives no benefit. This loss does not occur in the regular private methods of distribution, because when the goods come in, no matter whether the amount is large or small. they have facilities for conservation, and only the amount that the trade will take Is placed on the market. Now, on the other hand, since there is no means of controlling the Inflow of goods to these markets, sometimes there lg too small a quantity </seg>

From a sanitary of view, the public markets of Europe, outside of Smithfield's, are edly weak on everything that relates to cleanliness and sanitation, is a pleasure to visit the Boston market after having seen those of ontinent. B private markets and the shops on the continent were of a much grade — the food waa on sale in a much more appetizing condition, iditinn of the people was cleaner, and the parties in the shops on the trade were not only cleaner, but cleaner dressed and more in was paid to the general condition surrounding food products the public markets. Iie conditions under which public as well as private markets in Eng - and on the continent conduct their business would be impossible on account of the heat and on account of flies. It is the absence of two that make it possible to even tolerate the present method of ft distribution.

Butter as Received in Paris In order to present a specific view we will describe how butter is handled in this Central market. Supposing it Is Monday. The French i&gt;eisant or the French creamery churns the butter, without color and with - out salt. In the soft condition that it comes from the churn it is packed in little muslin sacks, possibly holding from twenty to thirty pounds. These in turn are put in little wicker baskets, having a cover which can be closed and clasped, perhaps locked. They are taken to the train. They come to Paris In the night-time, they are in the market in the morning. They are consirned or sold to this or that receiver. The first process is the weighing. This parcel of butter Is taken out of this wicker basket and the weight put on the sack and then put back into the hamper. This is done to each and every package for each and every receiver The parties on the market who deal in this butter are called blenders They purchase the butter, examine it. trade it. put all of the same kind together, and pack it in packages suitable for the 'trade that is to receive It The fanciest grade goes to London. Some of the next grade below that may go to London to a slightly different trade. The other grades go to different places It arrives in London on Wednesday. This butter, when strictly fresh, four or five days old, has a very slight, delicate aroma — </seg>
            <seg id="p248">246 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE sends it out immediately upon receipt. The retailer receives it and see* that it goes to the trade immediately, so that by Friday or Saturday this Monday's butter has gone into consumption. If by any circumstances they should keep it any considerable length of time, it loses all the elements of desirable quality that it ever possessed. I tasted this butter in London before I saw the market in Paris. I noted the peculiarity In the butter, and when I saw the market, the people and the conditions under which it was handled, this peculiarity was explained to me. I did not see the farm or the creamery or the surroundings from which it came, but in my judgment this Normandy butter from France is not a desirable butter for general use under our conditions. In a greater or less degree this is a peculiarity of all the butter In Europe, outside of the Danish. The Danish butter will keep; still, it lacks texture, grain and character. We are speaking of it as we saw It on the market and as we ate it at the table. The butter most like our own that we saw was made in Devonshire. England. Our conclusion from what we saw in regard to butter was that it had the merit of being fresh, and that was all the merit that it had. either in regard to the conditions under which it was produced or the methods of Its manufacture. This again does not apply to Danish butter, for there the conditions under which t is produced are ideal: but the manufacturer does not seem to recognize the necessity of what may be called texture. or grain, or body. Eteurizatlon is one of the distinguishing characteristics of Danish and they are pasteurizing more and more efficiently every year. Is method, taken in connection with the Ideal conditions of pro - i, causes their butter to be pre-eminently the butter of Europe. I: had a chance to visit one of the largest wholesale houses in I^on- On the floor. In company with Professor McKay, I saw butter from countries, produced under many different conditions, showing In ods; but outside of the Australian and New Zealand there seems to it universal presence of salvy or greasy appearance — the universal :e of texture, grain and body. Ider the condition of production in these countries, we do not stand why they do not make better butter. In my judgment, in acturing butter, England and the continent, Siberia, New Zealand ustralla are very much behind this country. Aroma, as a factor In jsirabillty of butter, seems to be more highly valued in America n Europe. We note in our American trade papers some remarks about under - g&lt;ade butter in the United States and the impression is conveyed that undergrade butter is a peculiarity of the United States. Now. this Im presslon should be corrected. They have their share of undergrade butter in Europe and on the markets in Europe; and I have no doubt but those of you who have examined the foreign butters now arriving in this coun - try h&amp;vp nntvN) ■ tfrpflt variation In nimlitv so *« a world mutter we are </seg>
            <seg id="p249">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE M7 up against the question of quality in our butter, and the sooner we can improve our condition the better shape we will be in competitively. Prices It would be impossible to give you specific prices on specific dates for specific articles; but to make a general statement that we think will very nearly represent the truth in a general way, we will compare at the same time — to-wit, months of June and July, 1913 — two markets in this country — Chicago and New York — with the market in London, England, in Paris, Lucerne, Dresden and Berlin. We will take five market baskets in the United States, each containing the same quantity and quality of food products: I Vegetables. — If you were to fill the vegetable basket in Europe these conditions and one in the United States under these condi on a comparison of price, we think the market basket In Europe be filled perhaps for 90 per cent of the cost of the one in this 2. Meats. — You take the market basket containing meats and there would be very little, if any, difference in the price. K Dairy Products. — Take the market basket containing dairy prod - butter, eggs and cheese — we think the European basket would 0 to 95 per cent of the American basket. K Fruits. — You take the basket containing fruits and it would cost early twice as much in Europe as it would here. Perhaps, by way jlanation, it should be added that this year fruit was very scarce rope and of poor quality. 5. Fish. — We think this market basket containing fish would cost slightly less in Europe, say, 80 or 90 per cent of the American basket. Kyou add up the cost of the five market baskets in Europe and the tarket baskets in the United States, I think the total cost In Europe equal the total cost in the United States. Wages I think further, if you were to take the average wages of the laboring le in Europe and compare them with the average wages of the le in the United States, you would find where the American received le European would not receive more than 45 cents. I will just draw one illustration to support this statement: I was in the Lime street depot of the London and Northwestern railway in Liver - pool at the time the fast train was making up for London. I scraped up an acquaintance with the engineer, a man about sixty years old, and during the conversation he informed me that he had been thirty-eight years in the service of the company, twenty years of which were spent in various lines of train service, leading up to the position of engineer and he had been engineer for eighteen years. The train he was then running made only one stop in a distance of approximately 200 miles, </seg>
            <seg id="p250">248 Keived approximately In our money between $15 and $16 per week, ler learned from him that the fireman and guards and others in the service were paid correspondingly low wages. You naturally ask rith 45 per cent of the wages they can pay these prices for food? nswer to this is that they do not use neither the quantity nor the 1 of the food that we do. They eat, both in the British kingdom l the continent, food that we throw away. Ksh to call your attention to a few facts that have great bearing on t of living. In France there are about 470,000 youth between twenty and twenty - two years of age in the army withdrawn .rom production and constituting a burden on consumption. In the middle of last year there was a law passed making the term of service three years, this raising the army up to 700,000 youth withdrawn from production for three years. In Germany there are about 840,000 youth between the ages of twenty and twenty-three in the army withdrawn from production and constitut - ing a burden on consumption. It is fair to say that in England and on the continent there are over 4,000,000 youth in the prime of productive life withdrawn from production and made a burden on consumption. The flower of this youth cornea mostly from the agricultural districts. Remember that these soldiers are physically perfect, leaving the physicially imperfect to work with father and mother and the children. Is it any wonder that agriculture lingers'' Here are two burdens placed upon agriculture: 1. The burden of supporting these soldiers in their non-productive 2. The withdrawal of this source of energy from production. You are further impressed with the fact that in England and on the continent the use of labor-saving machinery on the farm is not as prev - alent as it is here. But everybody on the farm, from the feeble old man walking with a crutch to the toddling child, are expected to do something in the way of working. The cow, as well as the ox, has to earn a living. In many parts of Europe you will find the family cow working alongside of the ox. The women and the children work in the field. They are producers or earners. It is really a "cradle to the grave" proposition. Wealth of the Sea The production of food on the farms not being sufficient to supply the needs of the people, they have resources to the sea, and an increasing amount of attention is being paid to sea foods. In the market they in - formed me that during the last twenty years there were forty or fifty different kinds of fish, from the smallest shell fish up to some of the larger kinds, that were now used for food that twenty years ago were not even considered fit for food, and that this fish food is eagerly sought for, at prices that are approximately near the prices that the choicest fisb food brings, while others are much cheaper. This problem of feeding the people is uppermost throughout the whole </seg>
            <seg id="p251">Eland and on the continent. It is the problem, but there is danger the future years the land and the sea will be severely taxed to e food to supply the increasing demands of the manufacturing and rcial world; and while the land is being exhausted in some cases, is also being exhausted of certain kinds of fish, and laws are now made and enforced protecting certain kinds of fish. The only ■ for this is lesB waste and more intensive methods of agriculture.

Ki portion of the United States that more nearly resembles the rn part of Germany, so far as my knowledge goes. Is the southern uarters of New Jersey. Kween Berlin and the river Rhine we understand that the soil be - better, but from Berlin eastward to the Russian frontier we under - that this description applies; but here again everything that Is le to be done in the way of using fertilizer is done. The wonder Is that with the soil we find in France, in Germany and In Switzerland, and with the amount of it and the character of it, they are able to produce the crops they do. Fertilization of these soils is to them a stern necessity. There is no choice about It. Some of the fertilizers they use are taken from the sea. Guano from the Island of South America, potash from the mines of western Germany and the excreta of animals on the farm. Now, all of these different kinds are used and all are saved. Sometimes these fertilizers are applied in solid, sometimes in llnuid form; but you are Impressed with the poverty of the soils In Germany. You are, however, impressed, on the other hand, with the wonderful crops produced by means of this Intensive agriculture, notwith - standing the scarcity of help and the lack of labor-saving machinery. One cannot help but be Impressed with the fact that wherever you find dairying, wherever you find poultry and eggs and butter, and milk and cheese produced, you find a more prosperous country than where grain alone Is produced. You find the most prosperous country where grain is produced and then fed to the animals on the farm and the fer - tilizer from the animals remains on the farm and becomes a part of It. Wherever you find the dairy Industry developed to the highest degree you find a prosperous community. You find people who always have something to do, you find people who always have a market for what they produce, and you always find people that have cash. This Is true, no matter whether you are In England, or France, or Holland, or Belgium, or Switzerland or Germany, and from other sources of knowledge, I believe that it is more true of Denmark than of these other places men- We must remember in this connection that land in all this country Is high in value, that rents are high, that taxes are high, that cattle are high and feed Is high. We must also take into consideration that these people, in order to make dairying pay, have undertaken the task of breed - ing up their cows for milk, butter and cheese production; of breeding up their poultry for egg production, and that they care for their cows and their poultry — which will include ducks and geese — almost as well as they care for their children. They consider it their duty, and their duty it would seem to be, since that is the means by which they provide for their own necessities and their children's necessities. It is this in - dustry that lies at the basis of their homes. But, notwithstanding all this, there Is not enough milk, butter, cheese. </seg>
            <seg id="p253">poultry and eggs produced to supply the growing demand for these necessary food products. It is true in that country, it is true in this country. It is reflected in the steadily advancing prices in that country and in the steadily advancing prices in this country. There may be a few countries like Siberia, Russia, Italy, Argentina, New Zealand and China that have more production than consumption; but the demand of the world is much greater than the supply. The prospects for the future are that dairy products — meaning the items above mentioned — will bring a good fair price and that of all the lines in agriculture, dairy - ing is the most desirable and the most profitable, when viewed from every angle. Iraska is about 400 miles east and west and 200 miles north and The soil in Nebraska is of the glacial and loess type. It has the of holding moisture. The humus is greater in the eastern than western part, but the soil is of great depth. There is more crop - ing soil in gome counties than there is in the northern half of ay. There is more crop-producing soil in Nebraska than there is of Germany. E rainfall in the eastern half of the state will range, speaking lly, from 20 to 30 inches, averaging possibly 25 inches. The I in the western half of the state will range from 12 to 20 inches, average 14 to 16 inches. in agriculture, heat, sunlight and water are free and the soil is reasonably cheap; in western Nebraska especially, considering the quality of the soil, it is very cheap. The men and women of this country are the men and women that want homes and want to take advantage of these factors, and there are many of them. The element in the problem that gives us trouble is the assumed scarcity of water; and the problem is how to conserve the water that nature gives us free, and cause it to enter the soil, remaining in the soil, producing while there the many changes making for crop growth, until needed. A man takes his wife and family from the East and secures 160 to 640 acres of this Western land. He builds on this land a house and establishes a home. Now he has the purpose, he has the land, he has the heat and the sunlight and he has a certain amount of water coming to him a* a free gift. This annual amount of rain has fallen on this land for ages and the surface is hard and it acts as a roof and a very large part of this rainfall goes into the draw— into the sea. A small part only penetrates beneath the surface, into the soil and it is not sufficient to produce anything except the scant production of natural grasses. This does not make a home possible. The mere fact of the man going there and settling the country in this way doesn't change it from a desert into a garden. There is something yet to be done, and that is to save more of this gift of nature — save it when it comes, be It in the winter, be It in the spring, or in the summer or in the fall; save it and see that it enters the soil. Make it so that the surface of this soil is not a rainproof roof. This soil and subsoil below it is thirsty for water and when water enters it has great holding power. </seg>
            <seg id="p254">282 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ■ would seem as though the first thing to do would be to break up roof and allow the rain — not a part of It, but all of it — to enter the fully realizing that the part that does not enter the soil does not for a farm, does not make for a home. There is a system of farming called contour farming. It consists of a line of furrows at right angles to the lay of the land, the object being to intersect the water and make it as difficult as possible for it to run off and as easy as possible for it to run into the ground. The more there are of these furrows the greater chance there is for this water to enter the soil. There is a too prevalent style of plowing and of cul - tivation of soil, that has become a habit to those coming from Eastern countries, where the rainfall is heavy, to plow and cultivate so as to facilitate and accelerate the surface drainage of the soil. The error with this system lies in this, that conditions East and conditions West, as to moisture, are different, in one you have to have surface or sub - son drainage to take away the surplus. In the West, there is no need for surface drainage and possibly very little, under any circumstances, only in localities, for subsoil drainage. By following the simple process of adapting the cultivation to the soil you can make the wonderful soil deposits, as well as the subsoil deposits of western Nebraska, a source of wealth. The only thing is to save the water, to save what's given you. Your reservoir to hold it is already built. All that you have to do is to guide it, by the simplest process possible, into this great natural reservoir formed by nature, the soil and the subsoil. Now, if this is done, then you have a farm, you have a home, and what is true of one little farm and home may be true of thousands and thousands of homes, until all western Nebraska is settled with a happy and prosperous people. Then we will have real settlement and not a shadowy and desert settle - ment, that is too often the case now. It does not need any expensive system of irrigation. It simple means taking advantage of the natural gifts of nature. Iiere still remains the problem of selecting the plants that will i best and produce the most food on soils of this character with imount of moisture. Some plants might not thrive if all the niois - was conserved, but many plants will produce good results. Some s have their roots on the surface and take their moisture from the ce. Some have roots and rootlets, not only deep down into the ind perhaps into the subsoil, but spread way out and draw their ure from a large area. This is a matter for study. Iju can make your selection from corn, Kaffir corn, wheat, oats and from sugar-beets, potatoes and other root crops, from the various *s, of which clover and alfalfa are a type. These plants will pro - food for both man and animals. At this stage the farmer may a surplus and may have something to sell. If he chooses to sell, he ling the fertility of the soil and he has a farm on which the raising ops is the end of his cycle of activities; but the more far-sighted er may look farther and the problem up to him will be. What kind </seg>
            <seg id="p255">PBOCBBDIMOfl NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 2S3 of animals can I profitably raise on this farm? I have saved the water, I am producing this food and I think I should feed this food to certain animals and have them consume it and restore in a large part the fer - tility that the plants have taken from the soil, in producing this food. Sheep, steers, cows, chickens, hogs and horses are all capable in a greater or less degree of consuming the food of these plants produced. If the farmer follows this course, instead of having only one crop a year, he has two. Instead of having intermittent work on his farm, he has constant work on the farm; and agriculture, in this constant form of employment, approximates manufacturing and commerce in its constant employment of labor. To illustrate: Supposing this farmer, as a type of all the farmers, keeps a herd of cows — not poor ones, but a herd of cows well bred in milking lines. He feeds these cows the alfalfa and the clover and the grain he raises. What does the man get from his herd? He gets — 1. Calves. 2. Milk. 3. Excreta The cow goes on for a series of years in this cycle, producing a calf, producing milk and producing excreta. The calf that is produced replenishes the herd and has a cash value. The excreta replenishes the soil and has a cash value. The milk that is produced has a cash value and divides into two parts: 1. The skim-milk. This furnishes the best of food for the calves, the pigs and the chickens. 2. The cream, of which the essential part is butter-fat. &gt;in addition to the above, grain is produced, hogs may be raised. • is no more profitable animal on the farm, where grain and alfalfa jduced, than the hog. Where you produce grain and alfalfa and on the farm, it is the ideal place for poultry. There are no animals on the farm that clean up the odds and ends of things that have no market value better than the sheep, the chicken or the cow. The end of the cycle is cash, so let us look at it from the cash standpoint. You can always find a cash market for sheep and the products — mutton and wool. You can always find a cash market for a hog and its products. You can always find a cash market for chickens and eggs. You can always find a place to put to advantage the skim - milk that there is on the farm. You can easily find a place to put the excreta on the farm to restore the fertility that these food products have taken from it. You can always get a market for your cream. You can turn these other products over, at least, once a year; but you can turn your butter-fat into cash twice a week, making 104 turnovers in the year. Now, to this farmer who has his land, and his house and his home, this Is the cash with which to purchase these things that make for happiness in that home. He has a market already provided for him, in </seg>
            <seg id="p256">K4 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE cash market. He does not have to sell his goods on credit, but he gets the money, almost immediately at the end of the sale, whatever it may be. He has no carrying charges, burdening the items of his production. In this view of things, his milk, butter, cheese, poultry and eggs form the basis of the dairy industry, and the dairy industry will form the basis of the prosperity of western Nebraska when it is carried out along these lines. But what I have said about western Nebraska is true in part of eastern Nebraska; and what I have said or western Nebraska is true of the whole western plateau, and, in part, is true of all the land that borders either side of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. Moreover, it is true, in a greater or less degree, of the whole great Missouri and Mississippi valleys — the great food valleys of the American continent. The capacity for production, or the soil's capacity is produce,- and the -capacity to make the soil produce and turn its products into cash, in this great valley, are too great for human comprehension. When all this western portion of Nebraska and Kansas and the Dakotas, that we in early days were taught was part of the great American Desert, is handled along these lines, it will become the Cheshire, Holland and the Denmark of America — a paradise regained. But somecne will say that this is an idle dream — a fantastic dream. Let me tell you a little circumstance. I rode along the dikes of Holland for a great distance. On the right was the Zuyder Zee, covered with fishing boats of all sizes and kinds, filled with fishermen, and from these boats numberless lines extended into the sea. The dike itself was above the waters of the sea. It might have been eighteen or twenty feet. On the left, some twenty to twenty-five feet below the surface of the dike, were the grazing lands and farms and happy homes of the Holland peasants. There was a time in years gone by when the sea swept over ail this land where these homes are now situated. It was no common enemy that those Hollanders had to meet — it was the fierce, relentless sea, moved by the tides and the winds from the north, but they faced the problem. They built the dike. They shut out the sea — they conquered the winds and the tides. iiese formerly overflow lands have more cows to the acre than ie would ever dream of in Nebraska, and more people to the re mile than we have ever thought of in our picture of the future of ?rn Nebraska. Their problem was to conquer wind, and tide and Your problem is a simple one. It is simply to save every particle oisture that comes to you freely from the clouds and cause it to ■ the soil and lock it up in the soil, that it can only escape through producing plants. The Hollanders met their problem. The future tell the story how we have met ours. </seg>
            <seg id="p257">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 266 THE HORSE'S FOOT By Prof. C. W. McCampbell Something over twenty-two centuries ago Xenophon, realizing the im - portance and value of good feet in a horse, gave to us the axiom, "No foot, no horse," and it is just as true and aoplicable today as It was then. That the average quality of the feet of our horses is very poor, irrespective of breed, cannot be denied. Evidences are seen upon the streets of our cities, upon our farms, \&gt; here the wear and tear is much less severe, and even in the show rine, where only the best individuals are shown. These de - fects of conformation and quality are physical characteristics and as such are transmitted to the offspring. It almost seems that this character — poor feet — is being intensified in all our breeds of horses, especially the draft breeds, because, in our endeavors to obtain size, quality and the other desirable characteristics, we have been overlooking the very first and most important requisite of a good horse— well-shaped, strong, and durable Iesibly the reason the feet have been so badly neelected is due to a f understanding of their structure and the functions of their various Surely no one who thoroughly understood the anatomy and physi - of the foot would so persistently ignore such a vital question, fore, a brief discussion of the anatomy and physiology of the prin - structures of the foot may be of interest and may possibly help to more clearly why feet of one certain conformation stand the wear ;ar of work-a-day life, while those of other conformations do not. The word "foot" implies the hoof, together with the bones and soft structures contained therein, and we may regard it as consisting of three well-marked portions — the base or bony core, the non-sensitive protective portion, and the sensitive or fleshy portion lying between and closely adherent to the other two. The non-sensitive protective portion — the hoof — may be divided into three parts for the purpose of study, the wall which supports the body weight; the horny sole, which protects the sensitive sole; and the frog, which acts as a buffer. If the wall were a complete circle, it would be a rigid body and of little value in overcoming the jar and concussion in - cident to locomotion, but nature intended that it should be a yielding structure and accomplished this purpose by causing the circle to bend upon Itself to form the bars. The wall is thickest at the toe to com - pensate for the friction and strain due to the compression of propulsion which is greatest at this point. The thickness of the wall gradually de - creases from the toe to the heel, thus giving the foot more elasticity in the posterior part. The wall varies from three-eighths to five-eighths Inches in thickness at the toe, and from two-eighths to three-eighths at the quarters. At any particular point in the circumference of the wall It will be found to bo of the same thickness from the coronet to the ground edge. The wah grows from the coronary band, a convex cushion-like </seg>
            <seg id="p258">256 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE band, about three-fourths inch wide at the upper inner edge of the hoof. The rapidity of growth of the wall is quite variable, but one-third inch per month might be suggested as a general average. Hind hoofs grow faster than front hoofs, unshod faster than shod, and mares and geldings faster than stallions. The external surface of the wall is covered by a varnish - like layer, called the periople, which is thickest at the top. This is a protection nature has provided to check evaporation and consequent crack - ing of the horn, and it should not be rasped away in shoeing. I the inner surface of the wall there are five or six hundred parallel or processes of horn extending from the coronet to the sole. These or laminae are separated from each other by deep fissures and are iled securely into similar laminae of the sensitive or fleshy portion foot, each of the non-sensitive plates fitting in between two sensi - ates to which it is securely cemented. In this manner the most ; union is brought between the horny wall and the inner sensitive or structure, which is securely cemented to the pedal bone. The sole of a normal, well-shaped foot is concave, the concavity being greater in the hind than in the front feet. One peculiarity about the growth of the sole is that its fibres grow downward from the sensitive sole within, and after reaching a certain length the ends break off, thus nature automatically determines how thick the sole shall be. The union of the sole and wall is marked by a white line extending completely around the inferior circumference of the hoof. The part of the sole im - mediately within this white line is capable of bearing weight, as this part is not directly under the sensitive vascular sole, but it is not intended that the remainder of the sole shall carry weight. Its purpose is to afford protection to the sensitive structures Just above it. It is interesting to note that the frog is one of the most important parts of the anti-concus - sion mechanism of the foot. It acts as a buffer, and to serve its purpose best it must be healthy and large, and its inferior surface must rest upon the ground. If it does not come in contact with the ground, it wastes away, the heel contracts, the foot is rendered smaller, and the pad becomes diseased. The frog has the same microscopic appearance as the horny wall, but its rubber-like character is due to the amount of moisture it contains. The per cent of water contained in the different structures of an average normal hoof is as follows: wall, 25 per cent; sole, 37 per cent; frog, 42^ P er cent. The sensitive portion of the foot is located immediately within the hoof, completely covering and securely united to the pedal bone, the plantar cushion and most of the outer surface of the lateral cartilages. It is known by various names, such as the corium, the vascular structures, laminal tissue, fleshy structure, "quick." etc. It is remarkable for its abundance of nerves and its great blood supply, which gives it the ap - pearance of muscle tissue. It is very susceptible to congestion and in - flammation as soon as the hoof, which surrounds it. loses its physiological properties, and any inflammation of this structure is always accompanied by intense pain, as 8 piling of these parts become impossible incased as </seg>
            <seg id="p259">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 1ST I ire in such a resisting envelope. This sensitive or fleshy structure lposed of a sublaminal base and 500 or 600 fleshy leaves or plates, r in form to the plates of the inner surface of the wall, extending the coronet to the lower edge of the pedal bone. Microscopic ex - tion shows that each of the fleshy plates, as well as the horny plates, jrojecting from their edges from 120 to 200 smaller secondary laminae Lying within imd forming a base or support for the sensitive or fleshy tissue of the foot we find the three bones forming the foot joint — the pedal bone, resembling a small foot; the navicular bone, slender, but very dense; and the os coronse or short pastern, partly within and partly above the hoof. The other structures associated with these bones in forming the core of the foot are the lateral cartilages and the plantar cushion. Aa the weight comes on the foot, the pedal bone descends slightly, to rise again when the weight is taken off. As the pedal bone descends, the horny sole also slightly descends and comes nearer to the ground. This is one leason why the sole is concave instead of flat. Attached to the heel of each pedal bone is a plate of cartilage, forming an elastic wall to the sensitive or fleshy foot and affording attachment for the fleshy laminae or plates. They may be felt just within and extending above the hoof at its postero-lateral as'ieet. These cartilaginous plates constitute a very important part of the anti-concussion mechanism of the foot. When the foot expands at the heel, these cartilages carry outward the attached sensitive lamina 1 , thus preventing any disturbance of the union of the sensitive and non-sensitive structures. Large venous trunks miss through and close to the lateral cartilages and the movement of these cartilages assist in the venous circulation of the foot. Between the lateral cartilage and just above the frog is located the plantar cushion. It is a fibro fatty, rubber-like mass shaped like the frog and lies in the posterior part of the foot. I'nder the influence of the body weight the frog is compressed and becomes wider, the plantar cushion with which it is closely in contact is also compressed and becomes wider. The effect of this increase in width is that the frog presses on the bars, while the plantar cushion presses on the lateral cartilages, both of which, yield - ing laterally, force apart the walls at the heels. When the weight is taken off the foot, the heel returns to its original position. While the increase in width which the foot undergoes is comparatively small, it still makes all the difference between a yielding and an unyielding block of horn striking the ground, it "gives" instead of offering resistance and it is this "give" which assists in overcoming concussion. Ie entire weight of the body Is supported by the union of the non- Ive horny laminae of the inner surface of the wall and the sensitive lamina?, covering the pedal bone and lateral cartilages, so the weight by each foot is carried on 500 or more primary laminae and 73,000 ire secondary lamina?. One-half this attachment is over cartllagi - and one-half over bony structures. The portions attached to car - ious structures are situated just where elasticity is required. 9 </seg>
            <seg id="p260">158 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Kr, at the posterior part of the wall ; thus one function of the lateral ge is to afford a movable wall attachment to the sensitive fleshy e and enable them to be carried outward during expansion. When lateral cartilages becom? ossified this function is destroyed. This us the cause of lameness after sidebones have developed. It is interesting to note that while the foot presents a small circum - ference, in reality It encloses a vast supporting area, due to the an - atomical arrangement of the lamina?. By this folding and forming of leaves or laminae, the supportlne surface of the foot is considerably In - creased, yet kept within reasonable limits. The supporting surface of an average sized foot is pbout eight square feet, giving a horse a total supporting surface or foundation of thirty-two square feet. The weight carried on each fore foot, while the horse is standing squarely on all four feet. Is somewhat more than one-fourth the body weight. During locomotion it varies from half the weight of the body during certain stages of the trot to the whole body weight during certain stages of the gallop. Therefore, the study of the physioloey of the foot resolvs itself Into a consideration of two prlnclnal functions — weight supporting and anti-concussion. The weieht-supporttne structures are the wall and the bars, while the anti-concussion mechanism may be sum - marized as follows: first, the yielding articulation of the pedal Joint within the hoof; second, the Increase In width of the foot at the moment of Impact, when the heels come to the ground, known as expansion, made possible by the flexible elastic lateral cartilages, the bars, and the thin - new of the wall at thp heel; third, the elastic pads — frog and plantar cushion; fourth, the slleht descent of the r&gt;edal bone and with it the sole; fifth, the slight compression of the wall from top to bottom. This mechanism not only protects the body from the serious consequences of concussion and shock, but also contributes to a lleht and elegant ealt and maintains a vigorous circulation of blood In the sensitive structure of the foot, thus Insuring a healthful and rapid growth of horn. If the foot is of the proper conformation, then the parts which form the anti-concussion mechanism serve their purpose best, and such a foot will stand the ordinary wear and tear Incident to hard work. If the foot 1* not of such conformation as to allow these parts to perform their func - tions freely and properly, all kinds of trouble and diseases are sure to result. To give an exact description of a foot having the proper con - formation would be Impossible, but. In general, the front feet should be large, well proportioned and almost round, the outer aspect being a trifle more rounding than the Inner. Tt should be as wide as long on the ground surface, and the toe from two and one-half to three times as long aa the heel. The anterior portion of the hoof should have the same slope as the pastern, which should be from forty-five to fifty degrees. The hoof head should be large and strong, but not open and coarse. A straight edge placed upon the wall at any point in the direction of the horn tube* or "the grain" should touch at every point. There should be no trans verte or longitudinal cracks or fissures. Rings which pass around the </seg>
            <seg id="p261">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATS BOARD OF AGRICULTURE It* entire circumference of the boot parallel to the coronet usually indicate nothing more serious than distill bances of nutrition of the hoof, but if these rings are not parallel to the coronet, or if these rings are more pronounced in onu part of the hoot' than another, then the hoof cannot be considered sound, l he sole should be arched and the frog large, full, well shaped and in contact with the ground. The heels should be wide apart, strongly developed, equal in size and of the same height. The hoot should be elastic, tough and waxy, rather than hard, brittle and shelly, and there should be a iirm union of all the parts. In the hind foot, we 100k lor practically the same things, except that it is a trine longer than wide and a triile more straight, having a slope of from fifty to nfty-fl ve Some natural defects of the foot that should be avoided are: Feet that are small, narrow, unequal in size or that are flat spread- ing. Feet that are base wide, base narrow, crooked, pigeon-toed, coon- footed, or that have high, low, or sloping heels. Feet that are cylindrical in form; that is, tending to be the tame size from coronet to the ground. Feet in which the horn is sott; also those in which it is hard, dry brittle, and shelly. As volumes have been written upon the diseases of horse's feet, I can only call your attention at this time to the more common of these diseases, with the hope that you will give them due consideration and study at some future lime. Every live stock owner should have in his library a good, reliable book upon the diseases of live stock. He should study this book carelully that he may render intelligent, first-aid to the injured, and, if necessary, be able to treat the more common diseases and injuries of live stock. But generally the cheapest and safest plan is to call a com - petent graduate veterinarian, if one is available. The seriousness of thrust, quitlor and nail puncture is due to infec - tion and in treating these diseases the aim should be to destroy the in - fection and promote nutrition of the parts involved. Immediate treat - ment lessens the severity and increases the chance of recovery from these diseases. funs, sole bruises, cracks and contracted heels result seriously if cted. The first thing to do is to remove the cause and then see that receive the proper care and treatment. Founder is most common in badly formed, flat and pointed feet, and is caused by a variety of conditions, such as errors of diet, chills, con - tinued standing without exercise, etc. It often occurs as a complication of colic, influenza, and parturition. Prevention is a great deal more economical and satisfactory than treatment, but if a case develops In spite of preventive measures, the important thing to remember is that If proper treatment is begun within the first twenty-four hours, recovery is generally complete.

            <seg id="p262">260 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OK AGRICULTURE The diseases of the feet, which are probably of most interest to the breeder, are those which are generally considered to show an hereditary predisposition to develop in the offsprings of animals having these troubles. To be on the safe side, we should include in this list navicular disease, ringbones, and sidebones. Navicular disease occurs meat frequently in light horses, especially those having nanow feet, shoit hoofs, and short, upright pasterns. The immediate cause is due to the excessive strain and jar to the perforans tendon and navicular tone, due to the faults of conformation just men - tioned, lit. cause of the tact that these peculiarities of conformation are practically always associated with uavicular disease, it should be looked upon as one showing a strong hereditary tendency to develop in the oflspring. Some authorities claim a direct hereditary tendency to na - vicular disease aside from defects of conformation. W hile ringbones are nut a condition involving the foot strictly speak - ing, they are so closely associated with the foot that they will be con - sidered at this time. '1 hey are bony growths in the region of the coronary joint with which natuie is trying to brace up a weak joint. They are most common in horses having long, weak pasterns, which result in greater stiain on the many ligaments of this region, but they are also found quite frequently on limbs having short, upright pasterns, due to the greater concussion and consequent irritation and inflammation. The immediate cause of 1 ingbones is undue strain upon the ligaments of the region. This undue strain results from faults of conformation of the parts involved and this conformation being transmitted to the offspring predisposes it to the development of ringbones. As has already been noted, sidebones are simply the lateral cartilages that have become ossified or "or turned to bone." There is no other un - soundness which is so common as sidebones and none are more strongly hereditary. Yet there is no unsoundness which is so often overlooked and about which the average farmer-horseman knows so little. In the living horse they may be felt as hard, unyielding, bony enlargements on either side toward the back part ot the foot just inside and projecting above the hcof. Sidebones are found principally in heavy horses and the fore - feet suffer most frequently. They produce clumsy, constrained action and often lameness. The principal cause is poor conformation and quality of the feel and the reason we have so many sidebones is simply because we have so many poor feet. We all admit the necessity of shoeing, and yet, strange as it may teem at first thought, shod hoofs are subjected to more injuries than unshod hoofs, because of the fact that shoeing interferes with all the physiological movements of the foot, prevents normal circulation of the blooa, causes the hoof to grow more slowly, and, as you have all observed, causes a general shrinking of the entire hoof. No specific directions for shoeing can be given that will cover all cases and conditions, as each case is a problem in itself, yet, when we consider the functions of the various parts cl the foot, we find certain general principles which apply in practically every case. </seg>

Ihe foot axis should be kept straight. ■ The shoe should be fitted to the foot, rather than the foot to the as is often done. 3. The shoe should be level and true. 4. The sole and frog should not be touched with knife or rasp, except to irim off sparingly the ragged edges. 5. The bars should not be cut away; they are a part of the wall, and nature intended that they help carry the body weight and brace the foot. KThe wall should not be rasped after shoeing. The horseshoer may it makes the job look neater, but in so doing he is destroying the tion, which nature provided to prevent evaporation of foot moisture. ■ As few nails as possible should be used, and it should be remembered high nailing is ruinous. v Nails should enter the white line and pass through the horn straight, not in a curve, as nails passing through horn in a curve do not remain tight and are very likely to press upon and injure the inner sensitive portion of the foot. 9. Shoes should be reset every five or six weeks, if best results are to be obtained. In. Exaggerated action may bo secured by allowing the hoof to grow long, and adding weight. Many show horses are made to "climb" by using shoes weighing from 30 to 60 ounces upon hoofs an inch or more longer than normal. Weight when properly placed also increases length of stride. While weight may serve many useful purposes, we must re - member that it cuts speed and devours endurance. The feet of colts and young horses should be looked after very care - fully, for feet that are allowed to become ill-shaped, twisted or uneven often result in permanent distortions. The heels must not be allowed to become high, narrow or rolled, or the toes long, or short and 'stubby.' It is best to allow horses to remain without shoes whenever possible, but see that hoofs of unshod horses are rounded to prevent cracking and breaking, and also kept level. Exercise is absolutely necessary to insure the best health and development of the foot. Continuous standing causes contraction of the foot, as does extreme dryness. Too much emphasis cannot be placed upon the necessity of keeping the foot clean and moist. Many people use hoof ointments without knowing why, how or when they should be used. The only reason for using hoof ointments is for the purpose of preventing evaporation of the foot moisture, and it is worse than useless to use a hoof dressing unless the hoof Has been thoroughly cleaned before applying. There are a great many proprietary ointments on the market, but vaseline makes a very acceptable dressing. If condi - tions are such that the feet become too soft, rosin added to the vaseline will often be beneficial. It is well to remember that no hoof ointment na-s a direct influence upon the growth of the horn. They are simply protective agents. The foot is the foundation of the animal machine, and this fact should always be remembered when selecting breeding, pleasure, or work horses. </seg>
            <seg id="p264">»&gt;2 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE It is a region about which we cannot be too particular. If the foot is defective, either in conformation, quality, or health of tissues, one can foretell the speedy wearing out and ruin of the horse, besides the expense of shoeing and continual treatment. If the foot has the proper conforma - tion and quality, we may expect the horse possessing such a foot to resume each day without discomfort or loss of energy the work of the day before. It is time for us all to awaken to the realization of the ne - cessity of good feet in all classes of horses, for a horse with poor feet is practically no horse at all. THE LOESS SOILS OF NEBRASKA By G. E. Condra, Director of the State Conservation and Soil Survey. Nebraska's leading physical resource is the loess soils. This fact ia becoming generally known throughout the state, yet with. many persons the name, loess, has little significance. Some think of it as standing for a single kind of deposit and a soil derived from it. This usage of the term is an error since there are four soil forming loesses in Nebraska. Bs paper classifies the loesses on a basis of their origin and dis - on, and also describes the soils derived from them. Loess in General. — Most Nebraskans who have been in Omaha, Platts - mouth or Nebraska City remember the steep massive bluffs and the streets excavated in the buff colored subsoil. This subsoil is loess of one or more kinds. It may be one kind or it may be a combination of two or three kinds. Similar deposits occur at many places in the state and are known as "yellow clay." Technically the loesses are not clay. They con - sist mostly of silt with smaller amounts of clay, very fine sand and fine sand. The loesses are further distinguished by their buff color, massive appearance and fine texture. The color varies between gray and yellowish brown. Finely disseminated oxide of iron gives to the loesses their buff and yellowish brown colors. Where this stain is leached the color is lighter, often grayish or bluish gray. Ie loesses usually have a weak cement of calcium carbonate and iron This causes them to stand nearly vertical in bluffs and excava - and gives them a massive appearance. Upon examination of these ires, one sees that the whole body of loess is permeated with root and that it is broken by vertical cracks or fissures. These features ss noticeable 4n the main body of an undisturbed deposit Ea rule the loess is composed nearly wholly of fine sediment. It contain coarse materials, however, such as sand, pebbles, light d calcareous concretions, pencil-like ferruginous concretions and snail-like shells. E Loess Region. — This was so named because of the prevalent de- Its area, about 37,300 square miles, occupies most of the southeast the state (Figure 1) and is bordered on the west and northwest High Plains and Sandhills. The region is made up of the following </seg>
            <seg id="p265">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Mi type* of land: (1) Loess plains, 16,000 square miles; (2) loess and drift hills, 15,000 square miles; (3) loess canyon areas, 1,500 square miles; (4) loess bluffs, 1,000 square miles; and (5) the valley plains or bottom lands, 4,000 square miles. The above figures are only approximately cor - rect. The exact area of each division is known only in counties where detailed soil surveys have been made. In other counties the extent has been approximated. Ip largest and most typical area of the loess plains is between Dundy utler counties. Its general boundaries are the Platte. Republican lg Blue valleys. The loess and drift hills are best shown in Sher- Thurston, Dixon, Lancaster and Cass counties. The canyons are is in parts of Lincoln, Frontier, and Hayes counties. The bluffs along the Missouri, the Platte and several other valleys. They are owever, clearly set off from the hilly lands. The valley plains are Figure 1. Sketch map showing location of the Loess Region. of two kinds — flood plains or first bottoms, and terraces or higher bottom lands. The flood plains contain little or no loos. The loess deposits of the above named land areas are classed as CD upland or plains loess; (2) valley or terrace loess; (3) bluff loess; and (4) loess formed by the weathering of Kansan drift. These are named in the order of their importance. Small bodies of loess occur in the Kansan drift, but they have no importance in soil formation. ■He largest deposit of loess In the United States is in the loess plains hills of Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri. It is a distinct gical formation. E Loess Plains. — Some of the typical locations on the largest of ilalns are at York, Fairmont, Hastings and Holdrege. Smaller called "flats," occur in most counties of the Loess Region. They ated as follows: On the divide north of Ogalalla; south of the .•alley at Sutherland, in southwestern Lincoln county; southeastern county; northeastern Dundy county; northern Frontier county; estern and southeastern Ouster county; part of the upland between </seg>
            <seg id="p266">M4 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ■ n Bow and Sargent; in northern Buffalo county; small areas north venna; four miles west of North Loup; six miles south of North ; much of the upland between St. Paul and Boelus; west of Wolbach; west of Spalding; southeast of Spalding; the nearly flat uplands of Boone, Madison, Wayne, Cuniing, Washington and other northeastern counties. Several areas also lie east of the Big Blue, as in eastern Seward. northern Gage, southern Lancaster and central Cass counties. Kg thought to be of this age and kind occur at a number of places southwestern and southern parts of Iowa. Examples of these are •ola, elevation 1,130 feet; and at Humes ton, elevation 1,100 feet. Th- highest of the loess plains in Nebraska is the divide northwest of Ogalalla with an altitude of about 3,700 feet. The highest in northeastern Nebraska is about 1,900 feet. The lowest in the southeastern part have elevations between 1.200 and 1,300 feet. Those of southern Iowa are about 1,100 feet. The following elevations show the general slope of these plains in Nebraska: The upland south of the city of North Platte, 3,000 feet; southern Dawson county, 2,750 feet: western Phelps, 2,500 feet, Holdrege, 2,350 feet; Minden, 2,200 feet; about half way between Broken Bow and Loup City, 2,200 feet; five miles north of Fullerton, 1,840 feet; Hastings, 1,940 feet; Fairfleld. 1,780 feet; southwest of St. Paul, 1.940 feet; between Nelson and Superior, 1,800 feet; Arborville, 1,740 feet; York, Fairmont, and Geneva, 1,640 feet; David City and Gresham, l,(«20 feet; Germantown, 1,560 feet; northern Gage county, 1,480 feet to 1.500 feet; western Douglas, 1,300 feet; central Cass county, 1,270 feet. From the above, we see that the plains slope southeastward on the Nebraska side of the Missouri and more to the south on the Iowa side. The sur - faces of the plains are quite even, yet they are modified to some extent by low knolls, shallow basins and small poorly established drainage ways. Their edges are roughened by erosion. The knolls appear to have been formed by wind. Some of them rise but little above the general level; others are broad hill-like elevations, 20 or more feet high. No one knows Just how the basins were formed. They vary greatly in form, depth and size. Some are only a foot or so in depth and but a few rods across; others are 5, 10, 15 or more feet deep, and occupy areas of 40 to 1,000 acres. It seems that the basins are not due to local sinking of the land. Probably most of them were formed by wind erosion. The indication for this is that there are places where the sediment thus derived from a basin is built into a mound nearby. Probably some of the depressions represent low places left in the old plain at the time of its construction. All of the depressions hold water after heavv rainfalls. The lakes thus formed, grow larger and deeper during periods of wet weather and dwindle at dry times. Pro - tracted dry weather causes the deepest and largest of these lakes to dts- My observations warrant the following statements regarding the plains, flats or residuals, as they may be called : ( 1 ) They are capped with loess and underlain by Kansan drift.

No representative spot of our state could have been selected. It la e of great physiographic interest since its story includes chapters ling with glaciation and extending to the present. Much of that is outlined in this paper. Development of the Original Loess Plain. — We are convinced that such a plain existed. It must have been formed in some way. Evidently </seg>

These be - fllled and the upbuilding then spread out over the higher lands, pposit is now thickest in the fllled-valleys. The base of the forma - ! quite uneven because of the eroded surface on which it rests, pper surface remains comparatively smooth where it is preserved original condition. We must now account for the loess and the plain. What were the source;) of the sediment, and v hat agencies produced the formation? Some believe that loess generally is a wind deposit. Others maintain that running water is the most important agency. A few claim it to be a lake deposit, Let us see what appear to be the facts, so far as the plains or upland loess is concerned. No one is now seriously advocating its lake origin. The silt is very much like a lake deposit, yet it cannot be proved that a lake occupied this region. So we may dismiss this part of our discussion and consider the theory of wind origin. This loess was not derived from the bars and beds of rivers in the region. We know this because the deposit was made before the present valleys. The valleys we see were developed In the loess. It is self evi - dent that the loess, which is the valley filling, must have been derived from sources outside the valleys so filled. The wind might have trans - ported the sediment from other places, filled the old valleys and aegraded the general upland. If so, the sediment was secured from a large supply perhaps to the westward. There is only one outside source of any sig - nificance in that direction. It is in the Sandhill Region. That region is in the right direction. No doubt some sediment is now coming from that (source. But we know that the loess plains are older than the bordering sandhills. So this fact destroys the force of our theory, and we conclude that this loess is not a wind made deposit. The upland loess has been acted upon by that agency, but wind was not the important factor In making the formation. Two agencies remain for our consideration. They are glaciers and running water. Th • Loess Region is bounded on the north and northeast by the Iowan and Wisconsin drift sheets of South Dakota and Iowa. These glacial deposits are much newer than the Kansan which underlies the plains loess. Named in order of their age the glacial deposits of the central west are the Nebraskan. Kansan, Illinoian, Iowan, First Wis - consin and Second Wisconsin. The Illinoian glaciers did not produce deposits in Nebraska. They were too far east. It is sunnosed that at that time the Kansan drift plain of our region was being eroded by rivers which opened up valleys and made parts of the surface hilly The loess of our plain lies on the Kansan drift in much of its area, and grades Into the Iowan drift on the northeast. It is evident, then. that it is of later origin than the Kansan and probably Is of Iowan age. This will hold true regardless of the agency that formed It. E Iowan glaclation extended into northeastern Iowa and probably South Dakota to near the northeast Nebraska line or farther. Its i border ta not very definite because It was obscured by later </seg>

So we the foregoing discussion that after the Kansan, two well marked ■es of the northern glaciers came close to Nebraska and that one m may have entered the state on the northeast. We will later show lfse were related to the origin of the loess. In the meantime we are to consider an unusual feature of Knoz, Cedar and Dixon counties. There high channels extend across the divide between the Missouri and the Elkhorn drainages. They are large and well defined and must have been occupied by rivers at some former time. The channels are now practically without streams. The abandoned water - ways are underlain with sand and drift and bordered mainly by sand and loess. Their beds lie a few feet below the loess plains level. The loess spreads out from them on the south. This causes us to believe that the streams which flowed through these channels must have carried a con - siderable quantity of the sediment now in the loess plains. Prof. J. E. Todd. former state geologist of South Dakota and a member of the I'. S. Geological Survey, has studied these channels and the drift deposits. (See Bulletin 158 and Geological Atlas 156, U. S. Geol. Survey.) He states that at one time drainage was from the Missouri to the Elk - horn, passing throueh the lower NIobrara and the Verdigris past Creigh - ton to Norfolk and beyond. Other hieh level channels, but lower than this one, cross the divide farther east, nast Hartington and Coleridge to the Ixigan, and through Aowa Creek to the Missouri. There may have been channels farther west than Creighton. Another thing that should not be overlooked, is the presence of sand immediately under the loess in the region of these divide channels. It is a stream deposit, extending southward for a considerable distance and westward beyond the loess boundary. But returning to the subject, high channel drainage, we ask what caused rivers to flow southward in these positions? Our answer is quite definite. A glacier lying to the east and northeast diverted the western drainage southward through the chan - nels. For a time all of this water from the west was carried through a single channel and water between the lobes of the glacier overflowed through other channels farther east. As the glacier retreated northward, thp main overflow dropped to lower and lower levels crossing southward uniil the lowest point south of the lone ice front was occupied. The sur - face of the land between these channels and points In Iowa on the east was much higher then than now. There is some dispute as to when these overflows occurred, and which glacier caused them. It may be that the retreating ice of the Kansan </seg>
            <seg id="p271">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE M» •\gi\n advanced and retreated northward. More likely, however, the lee 4am wag the Iowa glacier, but of this we have no definite proof. Anyway, the last staees in the retreat of the Kansan nreceded the advance of the lowan, which appears not to have reached farther south than the border of Nebraska. In either case, the effects would have been about the same, except that, if the overflows were from the front of the Kansan, there may not have been time enough for the erosion of the Kansan drift be - fore the loess was deposited. On the contrary, the drift may be less dis - sected than is usually sunposed. We know of places away from the main valleys where it is comparatively smooth, forming a drift or till plain beneath the loess. It Ooea seem that the large loess plain was not formed during the retreat of the Kansan. No doubt sand and silt were deposited then, but not over such a large area. If they were, the record has been largely destroyed by erosion, unless certain portions of the high upland border - ing the sandhills of northeastern Nebraska are of that age. We have no definite proof in sunnort of our conclusion, yet it does seem that the lowan glaciation caused the overflows which brought In the loess sodi - ment from the north. This loess deposit is older than the Wisconsin. 80 it will not be necessary to discuss its relations to that drift. Though we cannot definitely decide which of the glaciations was so closely related to the old channels, we do know what must have haD - pened. The rivers occupying the channels were overloaded at first w'th sand ,and gravel and later with silt. These materials were carried south - ward in a general outwash of flooded rivers resembling lakes. During the retreat of the ice due to melting, the main drainage from the west passed throurh a succession of lower channels, thereby building the mantle of sediment between altitudes 1.900 and 1.500 feet on the Nebraska side. Similar drainaee must haw occunied the whole area south of the glacier front between these channels and central Iowa. It was a great complex of sluggish streams rather than a trunk stream like the Mis - souri. The glacial mud of these streams became a mantle on the Kansan drift, making the loess plain. This accounts for the plain and its slope. It gives an acceptable exnlanation also for the laree quantity of sediment in the plain. This is necessary, for the formation had an area of at least 60,000 square miles, and an average depth of about 25 feet of silt. It must have contained more than 285 cubic miles of loes. The silt of the plain may not all have been derived from the mud of the glacier. We face another problem. It is to account for the southwest - ern part of the plain which now rises to an altitude of more than 2.000 feet It could not have been formed by glacial wash from the north if the land had its present slone and was elevated above the divide channels. The southwestern part of the plain now slopes more eastward than southward. It may have risen westward after its formation, otherwise its grade is one of construction. Probably both forces have operated. It should be noted that a glacial climate tends to cause all streams in a region to change their character. Thev become overloaded, whether </seg>

If this condition main i in central and southwestern Nebraska, and we have reasons to re that It did, it would have caused all rivers coming from the north - and west to aggrade their courses and the upland, thus finishing that of the plain. 1st when the plain was formed is not positively known. Further - there may have been two stages in its development. We are quite however, that it is of Iowan age. The loess Joins up with the Iowan sheet of Iowa and it is older than the Wisconsin. Ee Loess and Drift Hills. — These are distinct land forms eroded the loess and drift plains. The largest areas of loess hills in Ne - i are in the northeastern counties. The drift hills occupy much of .ers, Lancaster. Cass, Otoe, Nemaha, Richardson, Johnson, Pawnee age counties. The steps in the development of these hilly areas were about as fol - lows: (1) Trunk and tributary valleys were established in the original loess plain; (2) the valleys deepened and widened; (3) the flats disap - peared as the heads of tributaries extended into them; (4) under the influence of run-off water, wind and gravity the surface became rounded into hill form. Wl These stages in hill development are shown by Figure 4. In it, number 1 represents the original plain; 2, a valley in its first stage of develop- Figure 4.

I he materials out of which the hills were eroded are loess, sand, and bed-rock. (Figure 6.)

One of the hills (3) has a thin cap of loess, as hills at 4 and 5 are wholly of drift. This figure represents con - ditions that occur at many places in Nebraska, as at Germantown, Brain I and Princeton. Standing on the plain at Germantown, one mar eastward across a billowy land of loess and drift hills. The views ainard and Princeton are similar to that at Germantown. In each the loess and drift hill areas are lower than the plain, and this is ule generally, except that in a few places, as in the southeastern of Seward county, where drift hills form islands in the plain. Kl base of the mantle rock, especially the loess, is not now as high hill slopes as it formerly occurred in the plain. This is because faulting and creeping. In this way, the drift and bed-rock of hills is covered, though the valleys are deep. At places where all of the K5.

They are shown gure 6. In it, A, B and C show the structure. The original plain is represented by 1, the loess hill by 2, the drift hill by 3 and the lill covered by residual soil and coarse drift by 4. It is plainly evident that the general surface of these areas lies below the level of the plain from which and out of which they were carved. Stating it in another way, the hills are remnants of the plain, and the southeastward slope is due in part to the progress of erosion. The slope is therefore from loess hill to drift hill to rock hill. Terrace or Valley Loess. — Terraces, often called benches, occur In most large valleys of the Loess Region (Figure 7). The Missouri, Loups, Elk horn. Platte, Salt Creek (Figure 10) and Big Blue valleys have a two- </seg>

Ashland, Havelock, Lyons, north of Srhuyler and Columbus, and at Oxford and McCook. These are all capped with silt and underlain with sand or sand and gravel. The silt is even textured, buff colored and con - tains calcareous concretions. The basal sand varies much in texture. It / Figure 6.

The silt or loess cap is 20 feet or more thick. E'he origin of these terraces is quite well understood. Their develop - t was about as follows: The cycle of erosion which began with the wtion of the loess plains continued until the time of Wisconsin iation. The rivers made valleys to depths below their present flood Figure 7. A diagram showing loess plain, terraces and flood plain. </seg>
            <seg id="p275">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 273 II. With the Wisconsin ice advancing to northeastern Nebraska, and the shifting of climatic zones the rivers began upbuilding, passing i new cycle. They deposited first, the basal sands, and last the slit. ig their growth the flood plains elevated and widened against their ' slopes, making broad plains. The period of aggradation continued some valleys were nearly filled. The rivers, then, started to deepen courats. The trenches widened by side cutting. Finally terraces, rom overflows, were left bordering the streams. They now stand as ints of high flood plains. Bst large valleys have high and low terraces (Figure 7), represent - o cycles of upbuilding and down cutting. The higher level is the Erosion in it formed a valley which was later partly filled and renched. These two developments appear to correlate in time with isconsin stages of glaciation. I lobe of the glacier must have extended down the Missouri beyond City. Wash from it and from the ice front to the west and north - carried vast quantities of sediment southward. This filled the uri valley many feet deep. At the same time rivers not fed by rs were also filling their valleys. The Republican, Platte. and rivers are of this division. The terrace development was related to the hilly areas and for that matter to all of the upland in each drainage basin. The sediment, except that derived from the glacier, came from the uplands. As the terrace surfaces elevated in the valleys the slope lands decreased in area. The terrace deposits filled the mouths of ravines, leaving their upper courses open. Such forms are now very noticeable in places where terraces are bordered by steep slopes cut with small canyons or ravines. They are amphitheater-like forms on the lower slopes bordering the terraces, but having their mouths or lower courses buried under the terraces. § -races have been modified at places by the deposition on their sur - of fine sediment washed from the upland. This deposit occurs as alluvial fans at the mouths of ravines, and as low colluvial slopes the slope line. The materials of these forms are loess-like. Kthe terrace sediments were derived from land and glaciers and ted in valleys by rivers. The streams were strong when transport - id depositing the basal sands and gravels and weak when the silt is formed. We would expect to find the silts derived from the two s to be very different, yet they are not. Both became valley loess, is nearly identical with upland or plains loess. Comparing the loess of terraces with that of the old plain or upland, we find the two kinds to be nearly identical. They were formed in about the same way. The terrace loess is restricted to valleys. It was de - veloped on a smaller scale. Had its deposition continued long enough, however, the valleys might have been filled and the upland aggraded about as they were before Today the only differences of any consequence are In age and position. </seg>

In a general way all lands bordering valleys and having steep slopes and scattered bare are called bluffs. Bluffs proper, however, are steep parts of valley formed on loosely consolidated deposits. Such forme are produced ver a river erodes against heavily mantled upland. E bluff lines of Nebraska are quite straight. They are modified by &gt;U8 spurs and ravines. Missouri river bluffs rise 100 to 250 feet the valley bottom. From the top downward, they contain loess, id rock. At places the rock outcrops high above the river, whereas r points the bed-rock is mantled to the river level. ■;ss and drift of the bluffs not only creep on the slopes, but large of them break off, forming landslides. The presence of clay or at the foot of a slope tends to develop these slides, especially so there is seepage. The bluffs contain three kinds of loess, the plains, terrace, and wind - blown types. Each of these has some importance, yet the first named one makes up the main body of the bluffs above the drift line. The terrace silts and sands have become bluff formers at places. Both of the silts just named are intimately mixed with loess gathered from the beds of rivers at low stages and blown onto the slopes. There may be places where the wind deposition exceeds the amount lost through water erosion. If so, such surfaces are rising. This appears not to be true on the bluffs, at least generally, for they are in the process of destruction rather than construction. It now appears that the great mass of silt In them became thick because It is a valley-filling, much older than the wind-blown loess. So the argument that the loess thins away from the bluffs has no force in explaining the wind origin of the great mass of silt in the bluffs. The thickness and thinning are due primarily to the form of the valley or basin in which the deposits were made and not very much to the thin mantle of loess of later origin. Iinyon Areas. — In the western part of the Loess Region are areas In 1 the upland is trenched by deep, steep-sided valleys. These valleys ributaries of the Republican and the Platte. It is plain to be seen they are in the young or early condition of development. Most of hides are fiat or nearly so. In places, the canyons are so close ss parate the plain into small, block-like flats. This condition inter with farming and road making. The canyons are dry most of the but they have torrential streams after heavy rainfalls. riss Soils.— I will give a brief review of the soil conditions in the Region and follow it with a description of the leading kinds, called It is to be hoped that this may be of some value to farmers.

It) forms a border line between dune-sand on the west and the silt loams on the east. Thoueh the silt loams occupy most of the loess plans, there are also areas of fine sandy loam on these unlands. The leading tyre on the loess hills is known as Marshall silt loam. The principal distinction between this type and the flat phase is one of topography and is shown in the name. The thin lighter colored soils of the bluff lands are called Knox silt loam. I lilt derived from the drift belong to the Shelby series. Formerly were classed under the names Marshall and Carrington. So persons read the older reports should note the corrections. The Shelby soils in the Loess Region, yet they are not derived directly from the This series includes silt loam, sandy loam, gravelly loam, and I'-ry loam. This is because the drift varies so much in texture and ture. Several types are developed on the bed-rock where it is ex - . in the southeastern counties. Kir types occur on the terraces. They are the Waukesha silt loam, gilt loam, Scott silty clay loam, and the Sioux fine sandy loam. ■scriiition of some of the leading soils of the Loess Region follows: Ei Silt Loam. — This type occurs in the depressions or basins of s plains and terraces.

It becomes calcareous ■ 3 feet. I its natural condition, the Scott silt loam is covered with water, , grasses or weeds. Under cultivation it grows the usual farm but not so successfully as the better drained types. Many farmers is type for pasture and hay production. When plowed it is difficult nape, because water may stand on it after a rainfall. This type ts a problem in reclamation. Several of the basins have been drained by open ditches and tile. The attempt to drain by means of wells, though tried at a number of places, has not been successful. The wells soon become clogged with sediment. Endeavor in this line should not be given up entirely, however, for the basins are underlain with sand at depths between 40 and 100 feet and the permanent water table is in these sands. So it may become possible to reclaim the land by using wells if the trouble with nlllng-ln can be over - come, and if it will pay to do so. Some are now dynamiting the "clay pan" believing that drainage can be perfected in that way. Our survey is to conduct experiments along this line next year. The Scott Silty Clay Loam.— This type is found in some of the basins in association with the silt loam. It is a heavy type in which the subsoil </seg>
            <seg id="p279">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 277 immediately underlies the upper soil. There is no ash colored silt be - tween them. This soil has a very limited distribution. Ie Marshall Silt Loam, Flat Phase.— This is the type of largest Mition on the l.oess Plains. (Figures 8 and 9.) It was derived from ess. Though on a plain this soil is quite well drained. Most of the .11 soaks in and there is good underdralnage in sand, at depths of 100 feet. The surface soil is grayish brown to dark lirown in the eastern areas and lighter colored farther west, the difference being due to the amount of organic matter content. The depth of surface soil varies from 6 to 15 inches or more. The texture is quite uniformly that of silt loam. Mtvhanical analyses show a large per cent of silt and smaller amounts of clay and fine sand. There usually is a heavy compart layer just below the upper soil. It contains considerable clay and is known as "hard pan" or "clay pan" where it is stiff. In some localities this compact layer Is thin or poorly developed. The lower soil becomes yellowish and passes into pure loess below. Kginally this type was covered with prairie. Some tracts in the regions remain in their native sod of short grasses, but in other ies the whole of this type is cultivated, except the parts set aside ids and other purposes. The Marshall silt loam, flat phase, grows a variety of crops. It pro - duces most of the state's wheat and heavy yields of alfalfa, oats and corn. It will grow practically all crops of this latitude when the rainfall Is sufficient and favorably distributed during the growing season. The land yields readily to farming operations because of its favorable texture and smoothness. It is, therefore, splendidly adapted to wheat raising. The western distribution of this type occurs under a rainfall more favorable for wheat than for corn. This is another reason why there is a large acreage of wheat. Alfalfa is an Important crop generally on this soil. Corn does best in the eastern distribution because rainfall is heaviest Some difficulty is experienced in dry years and especially so where the hard pan layer is thickest. It would seem that farmers would think more obout correcting this condition of the upper subsoil. It Is difficult to get a stand of alfalfa and maintain it where the heavy layer is near the surface. Aside from this and the difficulty experienced in maintain - ing humus on the type where the rainfall is lowest, this soil has prac - tically no unfavorable conditions. Land values range between $25 and $75 per acre in the west where the rainfall is least and $200 per acre in the eastern areas. The average farm on this type has ICO acres and it is well improved. tl Marshall Silt Loam.— This is the prevalent type in the loess hill of northeastern Nebraska. I Figures 9 and 11.)

Apparently less trouble with the subsoil on this type than on the flat phase. rs that the creep'ng, so noticeable on the slopes, assists in main the mrllow condition. A feature of this soil is its comparative freedom from washing and gullying, even on steep slopes. Most of the rainfall appears to soak into the ground. This type is the state's most valuable soil for corn raising. It is well located with respect to rainfall and the hilly nature tenda to prevent the free sweep of wind. Alfalfa is a leading crop; oats, wheat or other small grains are grown on most farms. Fruit and vege - tables do well. When first taken up most of this soil was covered with prairie and some with forest. It is now practically all under successful cultivation. The land is well improved and valued at $100 to $200 or more per acre. I rift Hill Bolls. — These are classed with the Shelby series. (Figure rhey were derived nearly wholly from the Kansan drift sheet We that the loess mantle formerly covered the drift and that it was &gt;yed by erosion. Some of the loess must have been incorporated the drift during the process of soil formation. Furthermore, a nearly area of fine drift weathers into a kind of loess. So we see that it is lways easy to distinguish between loess and drift soils. If pebbles owlders are present, they serve to show the drift origin.

Shelby silt loam is the finest textured and Shelby bowldery i coarsest type. Most of the soils have importance in agriculture, the Marshall silt loam, the Shelby silt loam is the state's most it corn producer. The Terrace Soils. — Five types occur here. They were produced from the silt and sand of the benches. Portions of some of the terraces, as south of the Platte at Kearney, and south of the Loup at Fullerton and Genoa, have been eioded by wind and piled into small sandhills, making dune-sand soil. The origin of dune-sand at these and similar places is due to tnick bed of sand beneath a comporatively thin covering of terrace loess. As the rivers deepened their courses in the benches, the sand be - came exposed to the wind. This action of the wind, once started, dis - lodged the sand and silt and blew them into hills. A fine sandy loam is also formed from the benches. It is closely associated with the dune-sand but is a more stable soil. </seg>

E Waukesha silt loam was derived from silts, built up by the flood of streams when they flowed at high levels. At many places the 3 are capped by small alluvial fans and a colluvial wash from the s. Such forms make good building places. Typical Waukesha silt loam is grayish to dark brown. It is underlain at depths of 12 to 15 inches with yellowish brown silty clay loam. This may become lighter with depth. Below this light colored zone the subsoil is less compact, being loose and mellow. The silt gives way to sand at variable depths of 10 to 25 feet. Ko type was formerly covered with prairie. Most of it is now in a state of cultivation and valued at $100 to $200 per acre where ibly located. Alfalfa has a large acreage on this soil.

This paper is preliminary to special reports which are to follow each HONEY-PRODUCING PLANTS By Chaki.es K. Bkssky Twenty-nve years ago I read a paper on this subject before this Association, which was printed in the Annual Report of the Nebraska State Horticultural Society for 1887-8. and then six years later I published in Bulletin 40 of the Agricultural Experiment Station of Nebraska "A Preliminary List of the Honey-Producing Plants of Nebraska." This is the most complete list that I have ever prepared, and it includes no lew than 157 species of plants. As the edition of this bulletin was small it is now difficult to secure a copy, and so in the preparation of my present paper I shall make free use of my earlier paper, bringing down to date the information we now have in regard to the names of the plants that are of interest to the beekeepers of the state. Eever, before taking up the list of honey-producing plants in Ne it may be well to discuss some general questions relating to this KWhat it Honeyt — At the outset we must clearly understand that by we mean the sweet substance produced directly by the bee, from substances which it has swallowed, and later deposited in the cells honeycomb. 2. What it Nectart — While we often speak loosely of the "honey" in flowers, it is not quite accurate to do so. Strictly speaking it is "nectar" until it has been somewhat modified in the body of the bee. In the flower the nectar is a sweet, more or less fluid mixture of water and some plant sugar, with the addition of other soluble matter peculiar to the particular plant. It is these other soluble matters that give the different qualities to the honey yielded by different plants. For this reason the beekeeper prefers to have his bees obtain nectar from certain plants that yield good tasting honey, to others whose honey product does not have as good a taste. In the body of the bee the nectar is changed into honey, but it always retains enough of the peculiarities of the particular nectar to be readily recognized by the experienced beekeeper. 3. Purpose of yectar. — We may profitably ask for what purpose do flowers produce nectar, and we soon find that it is a lure or bait to tempt </seg>
            <seg id="p286">284 PROCEEIHMIS NEBRASKA STATE KdAKI) OF AGRICULTURE 1:8 to come to the flowers. Many flowers must have help in having 1 properly placed on their stigmas so as to accomplish fertilization, nsects are the most available helpers for this purpose. Now there lany kinds of inserts that are thus brought to visit flowers, and the ' bee is ouly one of them. This will account for the fact that flowers so many different shapes and sizes, as well as for some of the things 1 refer to a little further on. 4. IMM Plant* Are "Gap Draiiirs." — It may as well be noted here that some flowers have the odor of nectar so well developed that insects of various kinds, including bees, are induced to visit them, when as a a matter of fact they yield no nectar whatever. The flowers accomplish their purpose, however, even though they do not repay the insects for the service rendered. 1 can imagine the indignation of an honest bee when lured to a flower it finds that it will not be repaid for the work it has done. Fortunately for us there are not a great many flowers that act as dishonestly as this. KS'ight Bloomimj Plants. — Again, there are some plants thai open floueis only at night. Of course this is to secure the visits of noc- I insects of which there are very many. But the honey bee is not a flying insect and so all such flowers are of no importance to the bee beekeeper. 6. Flouers Closed Against Bits. — Strange as it may seem to us there are some flowers that are closed against honey bees, as definitely and decidedly as we close our houses against certain persons that we do not want to enter. It is comforting to know that many of these are shut against other insects also than the honey bee, so that there is no indica - tion of any particular animosity against bees. Such flowers merely admit only the insects that do their work, barring out all others, just as the owner of a big shop freely admits his workmen, but puts up a "No Ad - mittance" sign for all others. t Paucity of Flower*. — Now it is to be noted that there are some that have good wide-open flowers, with an abundance of honey h flower, but there are not enough flowers on each plant to make nh the while of the bee to try to gather the honey. Or it may n that there are not enough of the plants themselves in a particular y to make them have any importance in their honey crop. Thus are many places in Nebraska where Basswood trees are so few and tween that they become unimportant to the beekeeper. 8. Flowers with Bad Sector. — It has been known for a long time that the flowers of some plants produce nectar with unpleasant or even poison - ous properties. Thus it is recorded in history that many centuries ago a great Grecian army was poisoned by eating of the honey collected by bees from certain shrubs {Rhododendron and Azalea) in Asia Minor. A few years ago a beekeeper near Lincoln brought me a frame of as pretty honey and comb as I have ever seen, but it was so strongly filled with the acrid principle of the Smart weed {Polygonum hydropiper) that it could not be </seg>
            <seg id="p287">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE XU I Pollen-yielding Flowert. — As every beekeeper knows, bees visit many ■s (or the pollen they find there, and not (or nectar, and such plants high value to growers of bees. Yet. as the product obtained is not , I need not take time to more than mention the matter at this Many of these pollen-yielding plants will be enumerated in the natic list at the close of this paper, since they are of enough im - ice to the bees 30 that they spend a good deal of time collecting . from them. I. Waxy Substances. — Many plants produce waxy products that bees for their use in the hive, so that they are frequently seen busily en - in scraping the surfaces of buds, twigs, and leaves for this purpose, again 1 may be allowed to pass over the topic after briefly mention - . You who have spent your lives in watching your bees know far - than I the importance of these waxy products in the hive, and I not pursue the subject further in this place. 11. Nectar-Producing Plants. — Here we come to the plants that yield sweet substances out of which bees can make honey, and it must not be forgotten that nectar is principally a mixture of water and some plant sugar. So wherever in the plant we find such a mixture we have a pos - sible supply of honey. Thus the sap of many plants is sweet, and ac - cordingly whenever bees can get access to it through a wound they greedily feed upon it. This is true not only for the proper sap of the plant as a whole, but more especially of the fruits also. Who has not watcb&lt; d bees sipping the sweet juice from plums, cherries, peaches, apples, pears, grapes, strawberries, raspberries, etc., etc. Kjt it may be said that suth supplies of sweet are not quite legitimate, they are naturally covered up by more or less tough epidermis. But are many surface glands on the stalks of plants which exude nectar bees collect and use in making honey. Similar glands are found in ' leaves, and these also are visited by bees and other sweet-loving In regard to the nectar produced by the flowers themselves, I may repeat what I said in my address to this association twenty-five years ago. "It is upon the proper parts of the flower, however, that nectar glands occur in greatest abundance and perfection. There is no part of the flower which in some plants does not bear nectar glands. Thus, they may occur upon the outer flower leaver (sepals), as in the buckwheat, or upon the inner flower leaves, as in the buttercups; in some cases they are on the stamens, and again they are on the pistils. In many cases nectar glands are merely flat expansions of a soft tissue, from which exudes the sweet fluid, while in other cases they are curiously contrived structures, as in the long narrow sacks or spurs of a plant known as Uarcgravia nepentkoides. Wherever found, nectar is a solution of sugar in water with the addition of other matter peculiar to the plant in greater or less quantities. It is these additional matters which give to the honey made from particular plants the well known and well marked characteristics." We may now proceed to make a list of the plants that contribute their </seg>

Mellob (Paper Read at 1914 Meeting of the American Association of Fairs and Expositions.) Is take our subject to mean the county collective exhibit at the lal, state or interstate fair, and will confine our discussion to this of interpretation. In the treatment of our subject we will try to be and yet give you something which may be of future benefit in the ing of county collective exhibits. At the Nebraska state fair our two important county exhibits are in our educational and agricultural de - ients, and I will mention first the method which we use in procuring isplays. The county superintendent of public instruction either constituties him - self a committee of one or appoints a committee to have charge of an educational display collected from the schools of the county for the purpose of exhibiting such products at the fair. The committee first writes the facts of the showing to the teacher, urging participation. Teachers who really strive for the best interests of their pupils answer as to their will - ingness to assist. The up-to-date, progressive teacher who urges her pupils to participate is inculcating a spirit of high alms for excellence in the mind of her pupils, and the benefits derived to the individual participant </seg>
            <seg id="p297">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MS cannot be measured by the premium offered. The best things in life come without money or price. When the specific work is completed it is forwarded to the committee or superintendent who sends to the superintendent in charge at the fair. During the preparation days of the fair the superintendent, with his as - sistants, arranges the exhibits in place and when finished it is labeled aa the county exhibit from the county making the display. The space devoted to Nebraska's 1914 public school educational exhibit covered 7,149 square feet of wall space and was a department in which the teachers and schools of the state felt a justifiable pride. In addition, we also had a University exhibit completely filling a building covering 7,500 square feet of ground E shall not dwell on the amount of labor necessary in securing educa - exhibits, but wish to call your attention more fully to the county tural displays. In Nebraska we divide our state into three districts in the department of county agricultural exhibits. These three districts are called eastern, central and western. We justify this from the fact that Nebraska, being 420 miles long east and west and lying immediately east of the foot-hills of the Rockies, contains land lying at altitude from 800 to 5,000 feet; there - fore, natural agricultural products of the eastern and western parts of the state are foreign to each other and make fair competition impossible over any certain scale of premiums offered. In this department we offer to the county collective exhibits $2,650 in premiums, also $75 for best display of same. In addition we permit each article to compete for premiums offered for that specific product. In 1914 our total premiums paid in the agricul - tural department amounted to $4,366.55. Our judges score each county exhibit, and all participating in the pre - mium money must score within 60 per cent of the best score made in each district. This rule eliminates the eleventh-hour exhibitor, but aids in uniform excellence. All counties coming within this percentage divide equally 60 per cent of $2,350 of the offering and the balance is divided as to number of points made above the minimum. Did you ever consider the amount of detail necessary to secure a really first-class agricultural exhibit to place on exhibition at one of our fairs? The successful exhibitor must begin work right now for next year's fair. He must settle in his own mind the varieties of grains, grasses, vegetables, etc., which he must have for a foundation. It will not do to attempt a first - class exhibit with only two weeks to a month's special attention; if he does, some other exhibitor walks off with the valuable premium. In our comments regarding an agricultural display, we will be governed by our experience — gathered from a Nebraska county collective agricultural ex - hibit, which experience may be of benefit to all intending exhibitors. Our fair, like many others, comes early in the season when many of the integral parts of the display are not fully matured. Take corn, for instance; in Nebraska the last week in August finds corn still green, passing out of the milk stage. This fact compels the exhibitor who would excel to make </seg>
            <seg id="p298">IM PSOCBB1MNG8 NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE careful preparation. About ten days or two weeks before the display corn is gathered he takes an ideal measuring stick, so that all ears selected may be of uniform length, and with a number of squares cut from old newspapers and a ball of twine, or a box of small rubber bands, hies him - self to his corn field. As he walks through the rows of corn he carefully draws back the husks of typical ears and on all which come up to the standard the husks are drawn back, paper wrapped around the ear and bound thereon with twine, or rubber band, to protect it from the elements. Two or three days later the ear tints so as to definitely settle its color and within a week or ten days hardens sufficiently for exhibition purposes. For a superior display of small grain he goes to the field Just before the grain fully ripens, oats a little greener than wheat, and selects uniform, well filled heads, not necessarily in a low. rich place where the straw is the longest, but rather where the heads are just as good or just as even. Extreme length of straw is of little value. He cuts the sample close to the root carefully with a knife, hangs head downward in a dark place, not tied together, eliminates moisture of the plant or from outside sources. Shut out the light, as even a small amount of light discolors. When dried prop - erly, he strips off the husks and finds the stalks nice and straight. If straw is colored, he carefully lays out on the grass on bright, sunshiny days until suitably bleached. Success lies in beautifully bleached sheaves. Grasses always form an attractive part of the exhibit and we have seen more than 100 varieties used by a single county collective exhibit. To gather a complete showing means constant perseverance to secure various specimens, at the proper time Grasses for exhibition should be cut when fairly well matured, otherwise when dried they will shrivel and appear inferior. A safe way to judge as to proper time to cut grasses is just after the pollen has fallen off, when the plant has reached a stage of maturity proper for good keeping qualities. The way to cure them is to cut the ideal plant, take a long string, tie a common single knot around the base of a few of the plants at lower end of stem, continuing one bunch after another on the same string, then hang up in a dark attic. For clover, the gathering should be done when the seed heads begin to turn brown in the middle, with the foliage green. Hang up in a dark room, in the same manner as grass. Alfalfa is more difficult to cure; after it has died suffi - ciently it is necessary to pack it away during a damp period in order to retain the leaves. If the weather is dry. take a sprayer of oil and water and thoroughly spray the ceiling or inside roof — not the plant — then the following morning the plant will have absorbed sufficient moisture so that it can be handled and still retain the foliage. Ee have briefly treated on only a few of the many things which go to up a successful county collective exhibit. We might continue and ibe the growing seed, the selection of vegetables which make up a part of the exhibit, but think that we have already covered the subject sufficiently. Many of us, when looking over the agricultural ex - hibit at the fair, are prone to wonder why it is not more complete, but if </seg>

It has been our experience that it takes several years' constant ; to make a successful exhibitor in this particular department In paration of a really first-class agricultural exhibit, like other things we receive considerable education in the school of actual experience inot expect to excel at the beginning. Time, patience, careful attention to detail and an intimate knowledge of the principles of practical agriculture are necessary for building an artistic 1 agricultural county exhibit. The requirements are most exacting, and the results of a successful display can hardly be exaggerated or over estimated. Bthe hands of an experienced exhibit builder the county exhibit takes rm of a striking demonstration of the resources of the county by of the object lesson. Here is an index to production that cannot be sned or disputed. It is well worth the time and effort for the advertising effect alone. As the results of the exhibits at the 1914 state fair many of the counties In western Nebraska reaped a generous harvest of publicity. This was un - sought and unexpected. Feature and human interest stories were written by the column about some of the counties which made surprising showings in agricultural products. The county exhibit is especially the ideal advertising feature for the undeveloped section, which is awaiting capital for expansion, or seek - ing settlers for vast tracts of manless land. To the homeseeker the county display is the beacon which allures and attracts, for in the work of the designer his experienced mind reads the local history of the county, out - lines attractive conditions and visualizes advantages. While the labor in - volved is tremendous the successful county exhibit is an undeniable boost for the region represented. A group of county exhibits forms the best possible foundation for the missionary work of an ambitious publicity artiBt. By means of photographs, arguments can be clinched and the doubting ones convinced months after the exhibits have been shown. And this publicity campaign can be tarried out after thousands have seen the exhibits and have formed conclusions concerning the areas from which they originated. i.s an educational feature for our state fairs the county exhibit system a place practically at the head of the column of exhibit attractions, county collective booster is nearly always a man of broad experience deep insight. He is frankly an enthusiastic booster for his own com - ity. Such men have ever been invaluable workers in the ranks of that e army that is fighting the battle of improved agriculture. Give the ity exhibit hustler, the man with the "collective bug," a chance to reach public. He brings an important addition to the curriculum of the iers' short course in practical agriculture — the modern state fair. When changing conditions are considered I do not believe that we have given undue emphasis to the value of the county exhibit at our fairs. We </seg>

SAMPLING OF CREAM AND ITS RELATION TO THE BABCOCK TEST By E. L. Redfir.n An accurate sample of cream or milk is the foundation of an accurate Babcock tost. Too much care cannot be taken in securing a sample for testing, in fact the test might as well be discarded, for the result is mere guessworK, and one can guess without going to the trouble of making the teat One has gained little if he has learned how to make a Babcock and still does not realize the importance of taking the proper sample for the test and using every precaution to see that the sample fairly represents that material being tested. Dairymen are liable to get incorrect samples from individual cows or the herd unless they fully understand the physical properties of the fat .nd the milk minus the fat and the influence of temperature and time •ipon them. I have had dairymen bring me samples of milk from indi - . idual cows for testing and upon asking them how they took the sample, have been informed that they filled the bottle, usually three or four ounces, the first thing when they began to milk. Others have said they took the samples just before they finished milking. They were surprised to kM that there was a great difference between the fore milk and the after milk. In sampling cream the necessity of great care becomes more important. Cream varies greatly in its fat content, ranging from 15 per cent up to 60 or 55 per cent, and the slightest negligence in observing every precaution In obtaining the sample will make an error in the test and accusations often arise involving the tester's ability or honesty or that of the company by whom the tester is employed. It is not difficult to obtain an accurate sample of sweet cream which is smooth and tests from 15 to 25 per cent provided the man sampling realizes the relation the sample bears to the During the winter months much cream is marketed which is so rich in fat that it congeals and becomes almost of the consistency of butter. In such cases stirring is next to impossible, although I have seen at - tempts made to stir such cream and samples taken from it for testing. In such cases the cream should be warmed until it can be stirred to a fluid condition. Lumpy cream or cream with lumps of fat suspended in it obviously cannot be sampled while in this condition and it is necessary </seg>
            <seg id="p301">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tM that these lumps be broken up and the cream brought to a smooth, even consistency before accurate sampling is possible. Composite sampling requires just as great care as sampling a single can. It is essential that a proportional amount of cream be taken from each can and guessing at these at proportional quantities cannot give accurate results in the test. The use of McKay sampler eliminates many of the difficulties in taking an accurate sample, but it must be properly manipulated to obtain correct results, and since these samplers are quite expensive It is not possible for every one sampling milk or cream to possess one and resort must be had to the stirring and pouring method. Too much stress cannot be made upon the methods of securing accurate samples and the samples relation to the final test. I producer of cream has a certain responsibility to perform in hand - 3 product so that many of the difficulties in securing an accurate will be eliminated. He should see that his cream is in the proper ilcal condition when it is delivered to the factory or its agent, er conditions are due to carelessness, thoughtlessness, or ignorance proper methods of handling their product. Ieping the cream cool in summer and from freezing in winter, with onal stirring, will go far in assisting the sampler in securing an ite sample. The delivery of small quantities of cream in large cans i it to churn and an accurate sample cannot be taken. Accurate ing can obtain only where there is honesty of purpose, proper edge and necessary equipment. As Professor Hunziker has said, sampler of cream should know the why of his work as well as the d order to do his work intelligently and take an Interest In It" PUBLICITY BULLETINS ■ ring the year of 1914 the bulletins of the state board of agriculture been widely printed in the state and eastern press.

Strawberries Valuable "Farmers should not neglect the strawberry," said Secretary J. R. Dun - can of the State Horticultural Society. "Every family should have a strawberry patch large enough to supply the household with fresh fruit throughout the berry season and enough surplus to ran and preserve for winter use. Strawberries are the easiest fruit grown and bring quickest returns for the labor and money expended. Three hundred plants set out and well cared for ought, during an average season, supply a family of ordinary size with all the fruit they can use." Educational Mission Education as well as amusement should be the aim of the state and county fairs, declares Dewitt C. Wing of Minnesota. In an address to the Minnesota Agricultural Society he declared, in speaking of the broadening scope of fains: "They are now called upon to perform a more vital function. A higher average intelligence Is to be interested. A richer and more critical social life is to be reached. A larger and finer spirit is to be recognized and satisfied. Adults are to be entertained and cheered; young men and young women are to be inspired, directed and enthused; children are to be de - lighted, exercised, charmed and developed. Urban people are to be at - tracted, and Interested and challenged to think; farmers are to be ap - pealed to and dealt with as citizens, with aspirations and ambitions that do not lie entirely within their own fences. Women from the country are to be drawn out of their silence and slavery into the sunshine and open air of a larger freedom and Joy." Alfalfa Seed Industry The production of high grade alfalfa seed promises to become an Im - portant industry in Nebraska. Last spring the amount on hand was re - ported at 438,333 pounds. The season of 1913 was marked by a tremen - dous increase in the growing of this seed which was pronounced excellent in quality. He Makes Good George Borges of Eldorado township, a few miles southwest of Alma, has made good, according to the Harlan County Journal. In 1902 he bought his first quarter of land, and went into debt for it. He now owns 520 acres of productive land and has it well improved and stocked.

Warren for $11,000 in cash. Dona hoo, a prosperous farmer of Nuckolls county, bought this land fifteen years ago for $2,600 and has farmed it since the date of purchase. The farm has shown a good profit each year in addition to the Increase in value. The Humble Hen The North Nebraska Eagle says: "The comparative value of a wagon load of wheat and a crate of chick - ens was demonstrated recently by E. H. Gribble, one of Dakota precinct's up-to-date farmers. Mr. Gribble marketed a load of wheat in Sioux City for which he received a total of $42. On the top of the load he carted to the same market a coop containing 36 chickens for which he received $1 a piece, or $36. His crate of chickens brought him $6 less than the load of wheat. As a money maker on the farm chickens surely can claim a superi - ority over anything else as ordinarily their keep costs but little and after the first few weeks after hatching they raise themselves as it were. The farmer who looks after these little side issues on a farm is the one who succeeds such as Mr. Gribble is doing." Value of Grapes Grapes should be very generally grown and better cared for, says Secre - tary J. R. Duncan of the fitate Horticultural Society. The vines should be trimmed long enough before the sap begins to flow to allow the cuts to heal so that bleeding may be prevented. The season for pruning is al - ready near to a close. All dead wood should be removed. The prevailing mode of pruning is the renewal system. By this method one or two of the older main canes are removed each year allowing new canes to take their place, thus renewing the entire vine every three or four years. Grapes are produced on the current season's growth coming from the buds on the canes produced the previous year. Each bud will produce from one to three bunches. The vine should not be allowed to produce more than 50 or 60 bunches. Spring Spraying Ie first gprayine of apples should be applied at -the time the blossom show pink and the cluster commences to open. This spray is di - against apple scab, rust, curculio, canker and worms.

An acre of ground fenced hog and chicken tight should bt ipart to grow the vegetable garden, says J. R. Duncan of the State icultural Society. A succession of vegetables beginning with radishes, ce and including peas, beans, beets, tomatoes, potatoes and other tables suited to taste of the person may be kept growing during the entire summer by proper rotation and attention. Three Horse Markets Ibraska is making phenomenal progress as a horse market state, St. is regarded as the largest market in the world, while Chicago claims I place. Then comes Grand Island, South Omaha and Kansas City, iking claims for the third place. Lincoln also has a flourishing mar - hich is rapidly expanding in importance. With spirited sales every at Grand Island, South Omaha and Lincoln, the market possibilities iraska cannot be emphasized too strongly to horsemen. In breeding animals, the Percherons seem to be the strong favorites as 53 per cent of all the pure bred stallions are Percherons, with all the other breeds trailing below 12 per cent. Why not make it unanimous and have Nebraska recognized as the Percheron breeding ground of the world? Our natural advantages equal those of any country on earth for this industry. </seg>
            <seg id="p305">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE IOS Nebraska's Opportunity. Will M. Maupin in Midwest Magazine. On March 1, 1917 — lees than three years ahead — Nebraska will have been fifty years a state. When that day comes Nebraskans may look back and point with pride to a state history not equalled by any other state In the sisterhood of states a half century of unparalleled achievement; a half century of development that cannot be equalled by any equal expanse ot territory in the whole wide world. In the short span of fifty years — but a moment in the life of nations — Nebraska has developed from a practical desert with a handful of men and women along the eastern border, into a state with a million and a quarter of people, and acknowledged to be the most productive state in the union. Fifty years ago marked upon the chool geographies of that period as the "Great American Desert;" today he fourth largest corn producer, the fourth largest wheat producer, the second largest allalta producer, the third largest sugar beet producer, the hird largest oats producer and admittedly the feed yard of the nation for cattle and hogs. Then a desert, today one of the greatest dairying states n the union. Then without a factory chimney; today with factories with a working capitalization of more than $350,000,000 employing more wage - earners than the state had population when it was admitted to the union, and turning out finished products worth $300,000,000 a year. Less than fifty years ago without a school; today ranking at the head of the educa - tional column, with a permanent interest school fund ot $10,000,000, and school property worth scores of millions. Less than fifty years ago un - known in the markets of the world; now producing every year agricul - tural live stock and dairy products worth more than $500,000,000. Without a mine of precious metals, her hens every year lay eggs worth more than the gold and silver output of any state or territory. Her an - nual wheat crop is worth more than the annual gold and silver output ot all the states and territories, Alaska included. Her annual corn crop ia worth more than the nation's copper output. Her annual grain crops are worth more than the nation's output of crude petroleum. Her bhti"b' butter output Is worth more than the iron output of any state. Ne - braska has more dairy cows per thousand of population than any other state; raises more corn and oats and wheat per capita and per acre than any other state, and spends more per capita for education than any other state. Every year Nebraska produces more agricultural wealth per capita than any other state, and although she does not mine any coal, her fertile farms produce enough wealth each year to purchase the annual output of the nation's coal mines, bituminous and anthracite. If Nebraska's output of butter for a single year were packed in pound cartons, and the cartons laid end to end, the line would reach from New York City to San Fran - cisco. The annual output of her farm, factories and feed lots would, it loaded into standard freight cars, make a train reaching from St. Peters - burg, Russia, westward until the engine would be a thousand miles out In the Pacific ocean beyond the Golden Gate. Less than fifty years ago a </seg>
            <seg id="p306">304 Battered herds grazed upon the unfenced prairies; today Nebraska e third largest cattle market and the third largest packing industry the world. Fifty years ago Nebraska did not have a single mile of id; today more than 6,500 miles. The history of Nebraska is the story of progress that has no parallel in the world's history. Alfalfa Pays Wm. H. Smith, of the Seward Independent Democrat, is responsible for the following item: "L. E. Ost, who arts as agent for the Burlington railway, in Seward, and raises a patch of alfalfa on the side, is convinced that no crop grown in Nebraska is more profitable than alfalfa, and that good alfalfa land is dirt cheap at $150 per acre. "Mr. Ost has five acres sown to alfalfa, from which four cuttings were made last year, the yield amounting to 21 tons and 680 pounds, and for the crop he has received $238.20. He hired all the work done in caring for the crop, and this cost him $51.55. which made the net receipts from the flve acres $186.65, or an income of $37.33 per acre net, which Is equivalent to almost 25 per cent on $150 land." </seg>
