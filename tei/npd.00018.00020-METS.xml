In other words, the fact that the steer is an for the conversion of roughage as well as • ■ef and that this part of the ration should be much consideration. It was the desire on the part of the Station to secure data on the relative value of rough n in the West that led to a feeding test with n during the winter of 1904, the results of which published in Bulletin 85.
