The statistics bearing upon the public school ■] are for the school years ending July in, 190S, and July 9, 1906, but before the naport was published we were able to include much informa - tion of a later d;r We have thought it well to include the principal school legislation enacted by the ].-. of 19n7. Some information was incorpo - rated in this report as late as June 1, 19n7. There has been an unavoid - able delay in the publication of this report, but we trust the new matter it contains will atone for its lateness. er in the history of the state was the interest in public school matters greater than now. During the biennium many modern school buildings have taken the place of old ones.

            <seg id="p006">fHE NEW CERTIFICATION LAW. AUTHORSHIP OF LAW. The new certification law was framed by a committee of seven county superintendents appointed by the County Superintendents' Section of the Nebraska State Teachers' Association at Omaha, Decem - ber, 1904. The following county superintendents comprised this com - mittee: Supt. A. Softley of Perkins county; Supt. Charles Arnot of Dodge county, Supt. A. E. Ward of Cedar county, Supt. J. A. Stahl of (Turning county, Supt. R. C. King of Otoe county, Supt. Etta Brown of Cherry county, and Supt. Eugene Brookings of Burt county. The bill drafted by the committee was introduced into the House by the Hon. Charles J. Warner of Lancaster county. Great praise is due Mr. Warner for his diplomacy in securing the passage of this law. In section 16 of the original bill as drafted by the committee of county superintendents a fee of $2.00 was required from each appli - cant for each examination, one dollar of which was to go to the insti - tute fund and one dollar to be remitted to the office of the state super - intendent to defray the expenses of the examination. But as the law did not go into effect until October 1, 1905, and as some of the mem - bers of the legislature favored a direct appropriation by the state to cover the necessary expenses of the examination and the cancellation of all fees so far as the teachers were concerned, a compromise was made for a fee of $1.50, one dollar of which goes to the institute fund of the proper county and fifty cents of which is remitted to the office of the state superintendent to defray in part the expenses of the exam - ination. This makes it necessary, as was understood by the legisla - ture which passed this law, for an appropriation to be made each bi - ennium sufficient to meet the deficit in expenses on account of the small fee of fifty cents which comes to this office and the great amount of work to be done here. THE LAW (Subdivision 9a, School Laws for 1905.) Section 1. — Xo ex-post facto. — Nothing in this act shall be con - strued to invalidate any certificate heretofore granted under the laws of the state of Nebraska, but the same shall continue in effect until the expiration of the time for which such certificate was granted, and any contract made in good faith by and between any teacher and any board of education under the provisions of the school laws of this state heretofore existing is hereby recognized as a valid contract during the life of such certificate, the same as if made under the provisions of this act. </seg>

The revocation of the certificate shall terminate the employment of such teacher in the school where he or she may at the time be employed, but such teacher must be paid up to the time of receiving notice of such revocation. The authority revoking such certificate must immediately notify the director of the school district or the secretary of the board of education where such teacher is em - ployed. And the authority revoking such certificate shall notify the teacher of such revocation, and must enter his action in such case in the books or records of his office.

It is evident that sufficient time has beien given for meeting the re - quirements on normal training for county certificates. This law will not apply to any teacher with one or more years' expt-rienee at the time it goes into effect. September 1, 1907.

The question has been ra &lt;&gt; what schools are governed by ilidivision 9a. This ! il by the Senate committee on education and the H umittee on public schools. Ir was undoubtedly the intent of the legislature to have this law interpreted literally. It will apply only to high school districts organized under subdivision 6 with a board of six members, and to ■schools in ci' High school teachers, high school principals, and city superintend - may obtain a first -:ood for three years as inination in August, 19"7. which will make them eligible to teach in any hiph school district or city school district in Nebraska, until September 1. 19 This is ample time for evi ho is worthy a place in any Nebraska school to meet the provisions of this law. QUALIFICATIONS FOR (1RADE TEACHERS. These qualificatii ■ &gt;rt h in section IS. subdivision 9a. also apply only to high school districts organized under subdivision 6 of the school laws with a board of six members and to It will b) '1 that in section 18 no persons shall be eligible to in the grades below the high school department in any high school district or in th. below the high school department in any ■i hool district who does not hold at lemtt a weOBi gMde county cer - tificate issued in Nebraska. I have conferred with the attorney gen - eral's office on this section, and am authorized to say that it is not the intent of this law to require a teacher holding a certificate supe - rior to a second grade county certificate to literally and actually hold a second grade county certificate. For example, if a teacher holds a first grade certificate she would be eligible to teach in said grades ich school. If she holds an elementary state certificate or a life certificate she would not be required to hold a second grade county certificate. If a teacher holds a city certificate equal in subjects, scholarship and professional interest to that of the minimum standard for the second grade county certificate in the county wherein such • </seg>
            <seg id="p014">18 STATE SUi S REPORT school district is located, she would not be required to hold a second grade county certificate. The city superintendent and the county superintendent should confer on this matter and come to an agreement as to what city certificates shall be considered the equal of the second grade county certificate. Some county superintendents may take issue with this interpre - tation, but they must dispute the state's attorney if they do. There is another provision of law relative to county superintendents that will make our interpretation of section 18 clear. Section 1, subdivi - sion 7, school laws for 1905, contains this provision relative to the qualifications of the county superintendent: "No person shall be el - igible to the office of county superintendent who does not hold at least a first grade county certificate issued in this state and in force at the time of his election." It would be absurd to say that a county superintendent who holds a certificate superior to a first grade county certificate should be forced to earn or hold a first grade county certifi - cate. For example, a life certificate would exempt him from holding a first grade county certificate in force in order to be entitled to said office. SUMMARY OF THE NEW CERTIFICATION LAW I quote the following from our Letter to All Teachers of Nebras ka on Matters of Educational Interest, October 15, 1906: We have been confronted with two extremes at every step in the inauguration and enforcement of the new certification law. One ex - treme has been blindly radical and rigid. The other extreme has been ludicrous in its leniency. It has been our effort to strike a golden mean between these two extremes. We have tried to mark out for ourselves a path of duty and to walk in it fearlessly. We have given no thought t* what would be the best for this year's campaign, but have tried to do that which will stand the test of time and square Itself before the bar of a candid, conservative, yet progressive, intelligent public opin - ion. While the new law provides that the state superintendent shall prescribe all rules and regulations for the conduct of all examinations, we have not made a single rule without first taking counsel with county superintendents and city superintendents before it was made our rule. In fact we have made no rule without first being appealed to by many county superintendents for such a rule. In all of these rules, made after taking counsel with our co-workers, there is but one imit placed upon the county superintendent, except as provided in the law itself, and that is the minimum grade below which he cannot go in the certification of his teachers. Under the new law the county su - perintendent is the supremest authority in the state. Neither the state superintendent nor His Excellency, the Governor, nor the supreme court Itself can force the county superintendent to accept any grade or lrsue any certificate to any person his judgment would not approve. </seg>
            <seg id="p015">19 We have been both commended and condemned for our rulings giving credit for attendance at approved summer schools. Nearly 1 teachers have attended approved summer schools during the past summer, who will return to their schools inspired with higher ideals. We believe this is sufficient vindication for our ruling on summer school attendance. We believe it has been a square deal policy for the experienced teacher holding a good county certificate when we recall the courtesies given amateur teachers on elementary state certificates. However, on and after October 1, 1906, no credits whatever from any high school, or any public or private institution, will be accepted or ap - proved by this department in the certification of teachers under the new law. We are convinced that the new certification law, when car - ried out in letter and in spirit, will do more for the advancement of the public schools of Nebraska than any other law upon the statute books. We have had two specialists for the examination of the answer papers in each of the five essentials. For example, two different ex - aminers have graded the reading papers of all teachers, two different examiners have graded the arithmetic papers, two different ones the grammar papers, and so on. In addition thereto, the president of the examining board has reviewed every paper of every teacher. This means that those who have taken the examination in nothing more than the five essentials have had their papers carefully examined by ten different persons and carefully reviewed by the president of the committee. The consensus of opinion of these eleven examiners is safer for the teacher and the public than the opinion of any one person. Our examining committee is absolutely non-partisan and non-sectarian — Republicans, Democrats, Populists, Prohibitionists, Catholics, and Protestants have been represented thereon. Nearly 12,000 teachers have taken the examination for county cer - tificates under the new law since October 1, 1905. This means an average of at least five subjects for each teacher, a total of 60,000 answer papers, with over 300,000 pages of manuscript to be read. Each paper will average nine questions which means a total of 540,000 answers, which have been read and graded, the markings recorded, and the results of the examination reported to the county superintend - ents. But this is only one-half the amount of work, because each paper was read by two different examiners. For one examiner it would mean a total of 1M.I answer papers, over 600,000 pages of manu - script, with a total of 1,080,000 answers, which have been read and graded. This is some evidence of the herculean task which has con - fronted our examining committee. We do not hesitate to say that the efficiency of this committee will equal that of the United States Civil Service Commission. The work of this office is an open book. We invite, we urge county superintendents, teachers, school officers, and the general public to visit our office and see for themselves that the examination of the </seg>

Downey, Adams county: I h;: reason to believe that the new certification law has made our tea* ter qualified for their work than were those who held the same positions a year ago. We certainly have more teachers who have had special training and this, of course, means improvement. The records of the office show that the teachers are drawing an aver - age of about $3 per month more than they did in l!&lt;&lt; Supt. Sadie Bakewell, Logan county: I wish to express my pleasure at the success of the new law on the certification of teachers. We have better teachers, and salaries in near n • ■ n raised $10. </seg>
            <seg id="p017">SCHOOL LEGISLATION 21 Supt. Nellie Z. Vandling, Thomas county: The new law has cut out teachers who lack professional spirit, for which the little western counties should be very thankful. Previous to the new certification law too many persons were in the schoolroom merely for a livelihood. Married women, who really had schools at home, were seeking employment in the schoolroom, and boards of education hired them because they pitied them or because they would teach for less pay than those who were prepared for the work. To some extent the new law debars them — those who have been out of the work for fifteen or twenty years. Salaries are much better, yet they do not come up to those of many of the western coun - ties. The rural districts are all paying $40. Salaries in the rural schools are really better than those of the village schools. Supt. Eda C. Nelson, Burt county: I know the new certification law has raised the qualifications of teachers and will continue to do so. Salaries haven't improved very much yet, but the public is beginning 'hat salaries must be higher in another year if they wish to retain their good teachers. Supt. Geo. J. Boucher, Dakota county: Of the teachers who held certificates under the old law in this county, one is unable to get a certificate under the new law. Some had grades lowered, some rai aries have raised an aver - age of just $» per month. This raise was procured chiefly by publish - ing early that we expected the supply of teachers to be short, and helping the young teachers hold out for decent salaries. Supt. D. G. Hopkins, Saline county: I am satisfied that the new certification law has very materially aided in bettering the qualifications of the teachers, and has ad - vanced the wages of the teachers of Saline county about $10 per month. When we become adjusted to its workings, as we evidently will be next year, it will be more satisfactory still in my judgment. It caused some worriment to superintendents for awhile, but I see noth - ing in it now but benefit to superintendents, teachers and schools. Hold on to the law as it is. Supt. Wilhelmina Rydberg, Polk county: The new certification law has proved satisfactory in our county. Our teachers all qualified and all our schools are filled. Of two begin - ners who failed, the one has secured a permanent position where edu - cational qualifications were not a requisite, the other one is working and hopes to get a certificate this fall. Inasmuch as teachers have been materially strengthened, and no school board has been discom - moded by the change, we have every reason to believe that the pres - ent law fulfills our needs in every particular. Our boards have met the demands for higher wages cheerfully. We have but few teachers who are working for less than $40 per month. The highest salary </seg>
            <seg id="p018">22 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT paid in any country school is $60. Those beginners who took normal twining and came back with state elementary certificates held out for $40, and most of them received what they asked. The teachers have been fired with an ambition to advance. Many who have only "satis - factory" grades are determined to receive "With Credit" or "With Honor" before the close of the year, while a number are planning to spend next year at some normal school. Supt. Agnes Lackey, Scottsbluff county Perhaps the new certification law has had less effect upon the sal - aries and qualifications of teachers here than in any other county. At least, for this year it is less apparent. There are a number of reasons why we have a very much better class of teachers than ever before. We have five very excellent teachers here this year who are here to live upon their homesteads. There are a number of schools where the salaries have been increased. Five school boards have raised the sal - ary $5 per month, and three have raised the salary $10 per month. Four increases have been on account of the new law. Whether the raise will be permanent will depend upon the success of the teachers in those positions this year. Twenty-three teachers of this county have attended summer school. Supt. E. M. Avery, Pawnee county: The new law has been the means of making many of our teachers more professional. About fifty of our teachers spent six or eight weeks at the summer schools. Probably not more than fifteen or twenty would have gone to school had it not been that they must make grades in the 'five essentials." They not only made the necessary grades, but received inspiration and determination to be teachers in the best sense of the term. Every one (about thirty) whom we have visited so far this fall we find doing splendid work. I have not found or heard of one of them doing unsatisfactory work. A number of teachers who did not go to summer school did "Home study" work. This has been helpful. The wages in this county have advanced between $7 and $8 per month. I know of but one teacher in this county who is teaching for the same wages she received last year. She is one who neither went to summer school nor did home study, or anything else of a professional character. The school boards, as a rule, have offered no objections to paying the advanced wage. They are becoming more and more con - cerned about getting a "good teacher" and less about wages. One board paid $30 and $35 last year and are paying $50 now. The direc - tor said to me a few days ago: "We are having the best and cheapest Bchool right now we ever had." Last year they had three inexperienced teachers (so-called.) This year they have a lady with several years' experience and one and one-half years' Peru normal training. Supt. John Borky, Sioux county The new certification law has placed well qualified teachers in every district maintaining a school. The law seems to work a hardship </seg>
            <seg id="p019">23 SCHOOL LEGISLATION upon this county with regard to salaries. The teachers are demanding higher salaries than ever before, and the eastern teachers will not come west for the salaries which the districts are forced to offer. Almost all of the districts are voting the limit, twenty-five mills, and even now some of them cannot hold school the length of time required by law. The fact is that the districts are paying all they can afford, and as it is they are now gradually falling behind. This makes it hard to sup - ply the districts with teachers, for the teachers from further east will not come west for the short terms and low salaries. Yet the terms of six and seven months are too long for one teacher to teach two terms in one year. Prin. B. S. Hayden, of Palmyra, Otoe county: The new certification law is going to do more for the schools of Nebraska than any other law that has ever been passed. I have talked with men who are on school boards of the country districts and they are willing to pay more if they get better teachers. They have been paying all the teachers were worth. A man told me yesterday that he was willing to pay the teacher that they have now f 50 per month for next year. He said that they had had all the teachers at $35 they wanted. Supt. Frank Pilger in a letter to the school officers of Pierce county, dated August 6, 19m', : Some of the teachers have failed to have their certificates renewed. I expect a shortage of teachers September 1, but by November 1 there will be plenty. This year the passing grade is over 10 per cent, lower than ever before in this county, and I see no reason why our teachers cannot obtain good certificates. The papers are now graded by the state examiners, and I note that our teachers are getting better grades from them than they did from me. I am well pleased with the results. I believe that the teachers have done better in the summer schools this summer than ever before. All who are competent will receive cer - tificates if they will try. As in former years, many who taught last year do not desire to teach this year. Supt. J. W. Gamble of Cass county: In Cass before the law was understood there was a little tendency to criticise. But at this time we are past the experimental stage. We have had an educational revival, the influence of which will be felt for some time. Our progressive teachers have met the requirements, se - cured certificates, and contracted for schools at from five to ten dol - lars' increase in salary, not because they could demand it on account of the scarcity of teachers, but because they are worth more. Our boards of education say. "We want a good teacher, — we are not caring about the price." Of course, there are exceptions, — we always find knockers — but for the most part our people are more than satisfied. We realize that the new law may be weak in some respects, but as time poes on it will become better. As a school man of ten years* </seg>
            <seg id="p020">'PKKINT1 - RKPOBT 24 experlenoe, I can unhesitatingly say that I think it the best thing for -&lt; hools that we could have in the way of a good law. I note that other states are imitating us in this matter. We have experienced no scarcity of teachiers, and will be able to open our schools with a fine set of teachers, teachers in every sense of the word. I hope to see every county superintendent help to get this measure in good working order. Supt. B. E. Dill of Johnson county: At first I thought this law was working a sort of hardship on the but now my judgment, based on the following facts, is that the law will do more to raise the standard of teaching and to promote the efficiency of the public schools than any other law upon the stat- The teachers of Johnson county have qualified themselves under the new law, many of them making better grades than they had before. There h;i no more failures than under the old law. Our schools, with but three or four exceptions, are filled with legally certifi - cated teachers. I have enough applications on file to fill these va - cancies. The salaries for good, experienced teachers are from $5.00 t&lt;"&gt; $10.00 a month higher. Johnson county employs 101 leathers. Out of the ninety-three certificates so far earned, ten are third grade; fifty-two are passing second grade; twenty-five are "Credit" second grade: three are ■Honor" second grade; three are first grade; and three are "Honor" first grade. There have been but eight failur - far, only two of these had ever taught. Now. in view of these fads. I rannot see how this new law is any hardship to teachers who are prepared. In Johnson county, this law has had very little, if anything, to do with the scarcity of teach - ers. There was a shortage before this law had anything to do with the certification of teachers. This new law has caused an educational awakening all over Nebraska. Hundreds of teachers have tzunv to summer schools to qualify thei As a result, teachers an ter prepared, more enthusiastic, and have more confidence in own powers. The boys and girls of Nebraska will reap the benefit of this forward educational movement. The results here in Johnson county convince me beyond the shadow of doubt that this is an excel - lent law and that the efficient teachers have nothing to lose but much to gain by it. It is equally true that the inefficient and unqualified have been kept out of the profession. Supt. Geo. D. Carrington, Jr., of Nemaha county: House Roll No. 4S, the new law providing for the certificating of teachers, in my humble opinion, is one of the greatest measures a Nebraska legislature has ever enacted. I can hardly understand the situation in Richardson county, for I cannot believe it is the new law that is causing the shortage of teachers there. We have a greater supply of teachers in this county than we had last year, notwith - standing the fact that the training class of the state normal school has </seg>
            <seg id="p021">SCHOOL LEGISLATION 25 provided as many and more applicants in preceding years. A greater number of teachers failed last year in the examination conducted in this county under the old law than have failed this year under the new. I have watched carefully the questions sent out by the board. While in a few instances I could not approve certain questions, I whole I am sure no like board could be fairer. I have examined the answer papers of the teachers of this county after they had been graded. I could not have graded them differently. With one or two exceptions, where I knew the teacher's worth, I should have given from two to five points more, and this very thing the state superintendent authorizes the county superintendents to do with the grades of teachers who have done creditable Keadin. vork. — he has made a ruling in regard to this It goes without saying that teaching school is a serious busi - and to give one man. a county superintendent, who might be unscrupulous, the power to grant eertifieai rovided under the old law, is granting that person an opportunity to indulge in favorit - ism and in practices which in no way would rai indard of the schools. ( It was the state superintendent's ruling under the old law that merely the county superintendent's name on a certificate without a single grade legally certificated that person.) This feature of the law is certainly a protection to the worthy teacher. The point is often raised that the grades made in an examination do not determine the person's fitness to teach. This is only in part true. There are teacher* with high grade certificate! who cannot and never will be able to teach successfully. There are others with attractive i&gt;ersonality, win - ning ways and manners, and in fact having every qualification for a teacher except a knowledge of subject matter, for which reason they actually do the children they teach an injury by inaccurate teaching, and at the same tlnit isidered good teachers. A law which forces this kind of material to prepare for teaching is a good law. The intent of the law, as I understand it, is to furnish the state with better qualified teachers, and that it will surely do if given a chance. I have every reason to believe that Nemaha county has a stronger corps of teachers for this coming year than at any other time since I have been acquainted with the teaching force. All our schools are supplied except a very few, which have not definitely contracted each having applicants for the position. Just as I write I received a 'phone message from a lady at Nemaha. complaining for fear she would not be able to get a school, all being taken in this county. She has a certificate from the state normal. I told her to go across the line into Richardson county, where there were "fifty vacancies." I am among those county superintendents of the state who think that the state superintendent has been even too lenient in his late i tilings: but viewed in the light of the varied sections of this vast state, rather than from a Nemaha county view, I can readily appre - ciate his position. I am sure the new law will accomplish great good </seg>
            <seg id="p022">26 STATK Sri'KKINTEXUKNT'S REPORT for the schools, and the teachers will find it to their advantage if we can but hold up under it this year. The State Department stands ready and willing to act on the advice of the county superintendents in any reasonable, legitimate requests regarding the certification of their teach era. A teacher certificated now does not have to worry about exam - inations in the succeeding years, for the certificate is good anywhere in the state and is good as long as she is a successful teacher, thus placing teaching on the same plane with other professions. EFFECT OX TEACHERS' SALARIES. The aggregate increase in teachers' salaries in Nebraska for the school year 1906-7 over the school year 1905-06 will be at least $350,000; and for the year 1907-8 over the year 1906-7 at least $200, - making an aggregate increase in teachers' salaries in two years of over half a million dollars. It is evident, therefore, that the new certification law is in behalf of the true teacher as well as the child to be taught and the public to be served. QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENCY. The legislature of 190 5 passed the following statute relative to the educational qualifications of the county superintendent: "No person shall be eligible to the office of county superintendent who does not hold at least a first grade county certificate issued in this state and in force at the time of his election. It shall be the duty of the county clerk to notify the state superintendent of the election of the county superintendent at the time said election is ascertained. The pro - visions of this act so far as the same relate to the certificates of county superintendents shall not apply to counties having less than 1 ,&lt;i00 inhabitants." Since the county superintendent must hold a certificate in force, he is subject to the same moral and educational qualifications as the teacher. A county superintendent's certificate may be revoked in ac - cordance with section 13 of the new certification law (subdivision 9a &gt; the same as any teacher's certificate . We in Nebraska are to be con - gratulated on such a high class of county superintendents, both educa - tionally and morally. It is to be regretted that one or two superin - tendents during this biennium have not conducted themselves in a manner becoming their high office. It became our unpleasant duty to notify one county superintendent that unless he quit frequenting the saloon and the pool hall his certificate would be revoked. On his sol - emn promise to refrain from such unbecoming conduct he was per - mitted to continue his office work. At the present writing we are informed that he has signed a petition for a saloon in his home town. If this charge be found true we shall require him to take his name from said petition or revoke bis certificate. </seg>

This su - perintendent was the holder of a life certificate. He had even filled the pulpit and administered the sacrament of the Lord's Supper.

SCHOOL LEGISLATION FOB 1907-8, WITH EXPOSITIONS THEREOF. The school legislation enacted by the thirtieth session of the Legislature of Nebraska is of far-reaching importance. Never before have the common schools had so fair a hearing. Special commendation is due the Senate Committee on Education, composed of Hon. L. Good - rich of Fillmore, Hon. R. M. Thomson of Buffalo, Hon. C. L. Saunders of Douglas. Hon. A. Wilsey of Frontier, Hon. S. H. Huck, of Otoe: «nd the House Committee on Public Schools composed of Hon. J. F.

Metzger of Cherry. These committees gave intelligent and careful consideration to every pro - posed measure affecting the common schools. The school people of the state are grateful to the members of the legislature, individually and collectively, for their deep personal interest in educational affairs, and for their recognition of the needs of the common schools. The extraordinary success in wholesome school legislation is largely due to the united efforts of the school men and school women of the state The State Teachers' Association in December, 19o6, appointed a com - mittee to formulate plans and draft bills for introduction into the legislature.

Ten other school bills of considerable import - ance were enacted into law.

Three laws have been passed by the legislature, — the first in 1816. the second in 1899, the third in 1901. — all of which have been declared unconstitutional by the supreme court. We believe that in the King-Killen free high ■ 1 law we have one that will stand the test of the courts. The purpose of this law is to provide four years of free public high school education for all the youth of this state whose parents or guardians live in public school districts which maintain less than a fcur-year high school course of study. Every pupil to be entitled to free high school education under the provisions of this law must present a certificate from the county superintendent showing that he has completed the course of study for the grade below that to which he seeks admission and that he is unable to secure the desired grade of work in the public school district of his residence.

This certifi - cate must state that the pupil has completed the course of study for a specified high school grade. This "course of study for high school grades shall be the Nebraska High School Manual issued jointly by th« I'niversity of Nebraska and the State Superintendent of Public Instruc - tion or a course of study approved by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction." 9. It becomes the duty of the county superintendent to give such notice of the requirements of the law that teachers, school officers and patrons may acquaint themselves with the provisions of the law and be prepared to perform their respective parts in meeting its require - ments. 10. The making and announcing of regulations for the county examinations are in the hands of the county superintendent. With the privileges of free high school attendance before him, the county eighth grade examination now means more to the eighth grade pupil than ever before. In making regulations for the county eighth grade examination the following named conditions should be kept in mind. (a) All eighth grade pupils in the county should be given a fair chance to take the examination. </seg>
            <seg id="p031">35 -SCHOOL LEGISLATION (b» The integrity of the examination should be carefully guarded, otherwise inefficient pupils may i - and lie permitted to enter the hinh school to the detriment of both them - selves and the high school entered. (c) In many rural schools some members of the eighth grade class must leave school about April 1st. An examination in March rly April will accommodate these pupils and at the same time allow other pupils to take a part of the examination, thus avoiding a part of the rush of a single final examination a ! f the school year. (d) In regular nine months rural schools and in town schools, many of tike pupils will not be fully prepared for examination in all the subjects until the close of the school year. unination held as late in May as consistent with the grading of the papers and getting reports to pupils as early a^ iry to meet requirements of closing exercises and filing of applications by parents for free high school attendance for the ensuing year, will accommodate those who need the full time for completing their work, or such part of it as may not be completed at the time of the first examination. Thus, the county superintendent, in this capacity, becomes the county inspector of high schools for all high schools of the county which maintain less than the full four year high school course. Be - lore signing a certificate for any such high school pupil, he will need to satisfy himself by inspection and such other means as he may de - sire on the following points: ( a ) That the high school course of study includes the proper amount and kind of work for the grade completed. (b) That efficient teachers, proper apparatus and other neces - sary equipment have been provided. ( c ) That the work outlined in the course of study has been carried out, that the pupil has done efficient work, and that he has completed all the work in a manner which entitles him to receive the county certificate. This means that some one, two and three year high school courses of study will have to be revised before their graduates may receive recognition for free high school attendance at another high school of more grades. Each county establishes its own percentage for passing grades in the county eighth grade examination. A number of counties require a general average of seventy-five per cent., with nothing below sixty - five per cent. The required per cent, depends a great deal upon the marking of the papers. If the papers are marked closely the re - quired average grade should be lower than where liberality in grading is practiced. So far as possible a uniform and impartial system of ex- • </seg>

This makes the matter of opportunity to show his qualifications until the last possible date of much more importance to the pupil than it has been heretofore. The county superintendent who feels the re - sponsibility of holding in his hands the future of these young people will modify any arbitrary rulings he may have made under other con - ditions in order that justice may be meted out to all. (Jualitications for entrance. — Present qualifications govern the entrance of the pupil for free high school attendance. If the pupil holds a certificate properly executed showing that he has completed the work of the first eight grades he is entitled to the benefits of the law.

For the purposes of the free high school law the Illinois Course of Study for Common Schools has been officially adopted for the first eight grades of work in the public schools of Nebraska. The minimum requirement for graduation from the eighth grade course of study and for receiving county certificates for free high school tuition is evidence of completion of the work in the following named sub Reading, grammar and English composition, arithmetic, mental arith - metic, geography, history, physiology, writing and spelling.

In addition to the ii financial rap - port coming from the high school which meets the requii- if the law, the adva re felt in the attendance of these non-resident pupils acknowledged to lie a stronger body of pupils, as a class, than the average high school student.

This confirms me in the belief that we are not dealing with a temporary makeshift to meet an emergency, but are in the midst of an upheaval the tremor of which will not subside till the whole problem of secondary education has </seg>

A basis of common right must be found for diverse educational ini' to be antagonistic. To put matter as a question tha i^d only delays the day of our o'j undoing. Fixity in a great school organization becon Flexibility and adaptation to present and pr&lt;. needs is the true measure of the vitality and worth of any human institution. The university had a hearing more than fifteen fttn auci and won on practically every point. The high schools became at once prepara - schools. The tax paying factor responded to the increased burden ously. but here and there a protest was lodged against what seemed !■ snap judgment, and the university hits yielded some to the pre-empted ground, not in quantity but in the matter of flex - ibili- Just now for the first time in the history of our state is another ■•low the high school, getting a hearing. The great common school of the state through its superintendency stands with outstretched hands appealing to the high school for aid in re - turn for the humble service of being its foundation and support. Will the high school give it bread or will it give a stone? Stating the case briefly and broadly in behalf of the common school, the least that may be said is that the common school may demand of the high school the same nurture in the form of a qualified teaching force that the high school may demand of the college. To answer this by saying the preparation of teachers is the function of the normal school Is simply to prejudge the case against the high school. Function as such is not inherent in the high school or in any other school for that matter. A school becomes functionally what - ever its creators choose to make it. When a school adopts a course of study leading to college entrance it begins at once to perform the function of preparing students to enter college. When a school adopts a course of study leading to the degree of Bachelor of Laws it imme - diately begins the function of preparing candidates for the practice of that profession. So with a school of medicine. So with a school of pedagogy. So with a school of commerce. And I can see no in - consistency in bestowing two or more of these functions upon the same school, — a thing in fact with which we are all more or less familiar. Already many of our high schools not only prepare students to enter college, but to enter some of the more simple callings of active life. And mar not teaching in the elementary schools of the country with statistical propriety be called a common calling of our high school pupils? Will the better equipment of these pupils be the result of local pressure upon the devotees of tradition, or will it be the result of en - lightened leadership; a leadership which sees in our present scheme of </seg>
            <seg id="p043">47 SCHOOL LEGISLATION organization such elements of sustenance and growth that each part may be made to contribute strength to the whole; a leadership that will make of the high school the same sort of stimulant for the elementary school which the college has proven itself to be for the high school; a leadership that will make the present educational agencies mutually helpful to each other, thereby bringing service to a maximum while keeping the expense at a minimum. Th" university performs its highest service to tb- a the trained t. -«»nt into the high schools, and the high school will perform its best service to the community when it sends a body of its graduates into the elementary schools trained to teach. Thus will the community receive its right and the high school fulfil a function no less high than that of preparing students for college, or for busim- The second general proposition to which I would call your atten - tion is thie right of every person whose school nurture approxim;r reasonable maturity in point of age to be given some instruction in the theory and practice of education. This statement includes much more than is included in the question as to whether pedagogy is in the high school to stay or not. The proposition may on that account be readily assented to but in my opinion no less defensible, i have come to look upon the question under discussion as being only a part, and the smaller part at that, of the larger problem in which it is involved, namely, whether or not the study of education should be of - fered to all students whose school life ends with the high school. The claim of the individual about to graduate from the high school to the instruction in the theory and art of education can be justified by the following considerations: first, the fact that so large a per cent, of students cease their school attendance at the close of the high school course; second, the fact that the student of the twelfth grade is mature enough to understand some interpretation of the work of the eleven previous years of his school life; third, that nearly 40 per cent, of the graduates are quite sure to become teachers while more than 90 per cent, are just as sure to become parents. These points are somewhat interdependent and the development of each by argument and illustration would extend this discussion beyond a rea - sonable limit. The first of these points raises the old question as to whether the high school should be made primarily to serve those who intend to continue their education in some higher school, and incidentally to serve those whose school life ceases at the end of the high school course or vice versa. Preparation for college and preparation for life have been the slogans of the respective parties to this controversy for some time. The debate at times waxes warm. Tradition and inertia favor the "preparation for college" ideal. Applied knowledge and Innovation favor the "preparation for life" ideal. I shall ever recall with admiration how adroitly the onslaughts of those favoring a high school course more in harmony with the occupational life of the com- </seg>

But to return from this digression suffice it to say that bei the high school is ot le finishing school for so hir part of its students, the study of education should be offered of their equipment for life. It . objected bow 1 too immature to profit by such instruction. This brings real vital point. In support of the idea that high school graduates are mature enough for a brief and concrete study of education only a few facts will be cited. First, the community at large, as a matter of fact, permits — rages nine out of twenty-three of them to assume the re - ible function of teaching. Second, it is a matter of common knowledge that members of the eleventh and twelfth grades are en - couraged by county tend county institup they are contemplating teaching after graduation. Third, the aver - ge is not far from nia&lt; &gt;rs which is above the legal limit of infancy for girls in most civilized countries, and within two years of such limit for boys. Fourth, six out of twenty-three are sent by their Ilege often many miles from home. Fifth, they have ined to be mature enough to be instructed in the science and art of language, both living and dead, with profit, in the science and art of mathematics with profit, in the science of government with profit, in the of life with profit. Now if these students have pursued the foregoing from one to eight semesters each with some profit, it would appear presumptive if not conclusive as to their ability to get some profit from a study of the way in which their own minds had to be used in the long journey through the grades and into the high school. A study with the text of his childhood in hand re - calling how his own mind behaved as well as noting what sort of stim - ulation the teacher is giving before his eyes is not only within his grasp, but is of immense value whether the individual ever becomes a teacher or not. Finally while contending for pedagogy in the high school valuable study, far be it from me to assume that the student can get as much value from it there as if he took it two years later in a normal </seg>

R. 356, by Doran of Garfleld, Henry of Holt, Metzger of Cherry, and Wilson of Custer, appropriates $50,000 for the purpose of provi - ding at least seven months of school each year in the first eight grades for all the youth of this state whose parents or guardians live in pub - lic school districts whose funds are not sufficient to maintain school for at least seven months. The state treasurer, upon a voucher drawn by the state superintendent in accordance with reports furnished him by the county superintendents, shall pay to each district which shall have voted the maximum tax levy authorized by law, such an amount as is necessary to maintain seven months of school with a legally quali - fied teacher at a salary of not less than thirty dollars a month. No district shall iid from the state in any one year in excess of one hundred twenty dollars, which amount shall be applied exclusively to the payment of teachers' wages. During the past year there were 3u6 school districts maintaining three, months of school or less; 140 districts maintaining from three to six months of school. There will be about 1,000 districts in the north - ern and western counties entitled to state aid under this measure. The average number of pupils in th»- districts is about fifteen, which would mean that 16,000 boys and girls will receive at least seven months of free school privileges under this law. This mat possible for all boys and girls in the state t. in eighth grade education, which means at least two years more than they are now receiving. In due time a bulletin will be issued, setting forth the requirements for securing state aid under H. R. I This is not an attempt to build society. ! ;|&gt;t by so - ciety to build the individual. Such a policy holds that the state is strong in the proportion in which every individual in the state is free, large, educated, independent. The policy too long pursued may have given us a finer educated upper class, nobler and deeper thinkers in greater numbers than we would have were we to bend our efforts along this new line, but we have educated the top long enough at the ex - pense of the bottom. Let us unite to educate society from the bot - tom to the top.

The school board of every public school district is required to set aside annually from the general funds of the school district the sum of ten cents for every pupil enumerated in the district at the last annual school census, which amount shall be annually invested in books other than regular textbooks, which books shall be suitable for the school library, by vote of the school board of any district in which a free public library is maintained and to the support of which at least |S0( :ided annually, this law is inoperat. Teachers may secure lists of books approved by the Nebraska Teachers' Reading Circle Board by addressing their county superin - tendents or the leading book companies. Books will be sent in a single parcel, transportation prepaid by the publishers, to any teacher or school officer in Nebraska on receipt of the money for the books offered. A $5 library, a $10 library, or a $25 library may be secured according to the funds at command. For "A Graded List of Books for School Libraries," or for information relative to a free library, write Miss Charlotte Templeton, secretary of the Nebraska Public Library Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. We wish to caution every school district against purchasing any books whatsoever from traveling agents. Many school districts in Ne - braska have been imposed upon by chart sharks and fake agents. An agent cannot pay his railroad fare, hotel bills, and livery hire, allow - ing him nothing for his salary, and visit rural school districts at an average cost of less than $5 to $10 per district. Then you —ust usually pay such agent at least two prices and oftentimes four prices for his books, which are as a rule not suited to the average rural school dis - trict. The actual expenses and profit of the traveling agent will secure for any district a good library by dealing direct with reputable publish - ing houses. REPEAL OF THE STATE SCHOOL TAX 6. F. 226, by King of Polk, repeals the state school tax, which under the old law was not less than one-half mill and not to exceed one and one-half mills upon all the taxable property of the state. It was found that practically the same amount of money was returned to the several school districts through the state apportionment as was raised from their taxable property by the one-half mill levy, and that the clerical work thus placed upon the state and county treasurers was unnecessary. A school district needs only to vote one-half mill more local tax in order to have as much as it had under the state school tax The direct appropriation by the state of $50.noO tor normal training in high schools and i :or state aid to weak districts will do vastly more for the common schools than did the proceeds of the one-half mill state school tax.

            <seg id="p062">IE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT M HISTORY OF JUNIOR NORMALS. Junior normal schools were first established in Nebraska by the legislature of 1903. This law provided for five schools, three of which were located by the legislature at Alliance, McCook, and Valentine, and two of which were to be located by the state superintendent. These two schools were located at Holdrege and North Platte by State Su- I-erintendent Wm. K. Fowler before the location of the state normal school at Kearney by the board of education of the state normal schools. The appropriation of the legislature of 1903 for the maintenance of the junior normals was |1] During the first biennium for these schools all of this appropriation was expended and in addition thereto over $6,000 was contributed for their maintenance by the pa - triotic people of Alliance, Holdrege, McCook, North Platte, and Valen - tine, and the counties in the territory of these schools. In addition to this donation, these towns placed at the disposal of the state their school buildings and grounds, books and apparatus, which in the ag - gregate represent over |176,0O0 in school property. In December, 1904, Superintendent Fowler recommended to the legislature of 1905 that an appropriation of |18.6*9 be made for these schools during their second biennium. The governor and the state auditor in that year presumed to have the right to pass upon this esti - mate and scaled it down to $12,000, but the legislature of 190 5 raised the appropriation to $15,0oo. This appropriation was all expended during that biennium and in addition thereto the good people of Al - liance, Holdrege, McCook, North Platte, and Valentine again contrib - uted over $7,500 for the maintenance of these schools. The first junior normal law made the term ten weeks. The law as amended in 190" makes the term not less than six nor more than eight weeks. The length of term at these schools for 190 7 will be seven weeks. This gives the teacher a short rest between the closing of her school in the spring and the opening of the junior normal, June 17th. The term will close August 3d. This gives her a month for vacation before the opening of school in September. It is too much to ask teachers to attend a summer school for ten weeks after teaching nine months. Iron will break if too severe a strain is put upon it. The teacher must have sorii ,d vacation. The new law makes ample j&gt;rovision for this. The junior normal law as amended by the legislature of 1907 pro - vides for eight junior normals, three of which were located by the legis - lature at Alliance, McCook. and Valentine. This left five to be located by the state superintendent. March 30, 19o". applications for a junior normal school had been received from the following places: Albion, Alliance, Alma, Broken Bow, Central City, Geneva, Holdrege, McCook, North Platte. O'Neill, Ord, South Sioux City, and Valentine. On that date we made the following announcement: "No application for a junior normal school will be considered if received at this office after </seg>
            <seg id="p063">JUNIOR NORMAL SCHOOLS April 15." Up to that date no additional applications were received, and on April 15 we proceeded to a careful consideration of the applica - tions of all the aforesaid towns. After due deliberation, we decided to locate the five junior normals at our disposal at Alma, Broken Bow, Geneva, North Platte, and O'Neill, provided that these towns would meet the legal requirements. About April 23d we received an applica - tion from Superintendent Perdue with a strong endorsement by S tor Randall for a junior normal school in Madison. Alliance, Alma, Broken Bow, Geneva, McCook, North Platte, O'Neill, and Valentine having met all legal requirements, in accord - ance with the authority vested in us, junior normal schools have been located at these places for the year 1907. It will be observed by the junior normal law, as amended, that the state superintendent may change the location of a junior normal school in any year for reason - able cause. It is not necessary here for us to enter into a discussion of all the reasons which prompted us to locate these schools as we did. It may Lot be out of place to give some of the reasons. There was not sufficient patronage apparent from counties adjoin - ing Boone to locate a junior normal at Albion. Alma was selected in - stead of Holdrege on account of the latter being so near the new state normal school at Kearney. Central City is the seat of the Nebraska Central College, a church school, under the management of The Friends. Then, too. Central City is only 64 miles by rail on the main line of the I'nion Pacific from Kearney, the seat of the new normal school. At Ord thei'.- was not sufficient sentiment in sur - rounding counties, on account of private summer schools at Spalding and St. Paul in adjoining counties, to warrant locating a junior normal there. The Nebraska Normal College at Wayne offers ample opportuni - ties for teachers in northeastern Nebraska, and we did not deem it wise to locate a junior normal at South Sioux City, just across the river from Sioux City, Iowa. Madison's application came in after we had practically decided upon othei rail from Wayne. At each place where we have located a junior normal school we have letters on file from the county superintendents in the neighbor - ing counties pledging a hearty support and co-operation to make schools a success. At each of the other places making application for a junior normal school there was no expressed sentiment in behalf of any of them from any county superintendent in a neighboring county. We realize that the responsibility placed upon us in the location of these schools will bring with it some criticism, no matter where we were to locate them. We stated frankly to every member of the legis - lature who conferred with us on the location of these schools that we would much prefer that their location be made by the legislature, but the legislature placed the responsibility upon us. We have mad location in accordance with our best judgnv (oiifiden 1 </seg>
            <seg id="p064">STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT that these schools will vindicate us in the matter of their location. Five of them are north of the Platte river and in the big sixth congressional district: three of them are south of the PWitte river, — two in the fifth onal district, and one in the fourth congres - sional district. We h. ivored to give the gr&gt; od to the greatest number of teachers who would patronize these m -iving careful consideration to the location of private, denominational and state schools already establish! Alma is 1 &lt;i 7 miles by rail from Kearney ;uid temchi ; from there to Kearney have to stop over one night at Oxford. There will be a large attendance at Alma from the home county. Harlan, and from the neighboring counties of Franklin, Furnas, Kearney, Phelps. and Webster. Alii. 'he logical educational center of northwestern Ne - braska. The junior normal there will give ample opportunity to the teachers of Box Butte county and the neighboring counties of Dawes, Cheyenne. Banner, Kimbal Bluff, the south half of Sheridan, the north half of Deuel. Grant, and Hooker. It is 123 miles by rail from Broken Bow to Rearm - county is four times the size of the average county. It requires teachers for its public schools. It is more than twice the size of Rhode Island. It is evident tlvat Custer county alone is entitled to a junior normal school, but there will be teachers in attendance from the counties of l.ouan. Thomas, Blaine, I&gt;oup, Garfield. Valley, and Sher - man. The success of the union normal institute at Geneva last year is sufficient reason for a junior normal there this year. There wen •T8 in attendance at the union normal there for six weeks last summer. There will be a large attendance from the home county of Fillmore, and the neighboring counties of Clay, Jefferson. Xuckolls. Saline, and Thayer. Geneva is about midway between the two normal s&lt; Peru and Kearney, and will accommodate a great number of teachers in the south central half of the state. ook is the unquestioned educational center for southwestern Nebraska. There will be a large attendance of teachers from the home county of Red Willow, and from the neighboring counties of Frontier, Furnas. Gosper, Hayes, Hitchcock, Chase, and Dundy. with Hayes and Hitchcock uniting under the union normal institute law. This will be a great school. North Platte is the county seat of Lincoln county, which is four times the size of the average county in the eastern half of the state. At North Platte there will be a loyal patronage from the home county of Lincoln, with a good attendance from the neighboring counties of Keith, Perkins, Dawson. MePherson, Logan, and the south half of Deuel. There was a strong plea made in behalf of North Platte from neighboring counties. </seg>
            <seg id="p065">71 JUNIOR NORMAL SCHOOLS O'Neill, the county seat of Holt county, which is the fourth county in size in the state, will have a large attendance from its teachers. 2no in number, with a good patronage from the neighboring counties of Antelope, Boyd, Keya Paha, Rock, Pierce, and the north half of Gar - field and Wheeler. Several county superintendents entered a plea in behalf of a junior normal school at O'N'eill. Valentine, the county seat of Cherry county, — a county four and one-half times the size of Rhode Island, — has been one of the most successful junior normal schools since their establishment. There will be a large delegation of teachers from Brown and Sheridan counties in attendance at Valentine, and a loyal patronage from the home county, Cherry. State Superintendent Win. K. Fowler wrote the first junior normal law, which was introduced into the legislature of 1 9 1&gt; ;j by the Hon - orable David Hanna. a representative from Cherry county. To Su - perintendent Fowler belongs the honor of the junior normal school idea. To the Honorable David Hanna belongs the honor of enacting it into law. Among the true friends of the junior normal schools in the legislature of 1 9&lt;»5, special mention should be made of Representa - tives Currie of Dawes, McAllister of Deuel. Perry of Furnas. Horton of Keya Paha, Luce of Harlan. Gliem of Red Willow, and Douglas of Rock. The junior normal law. as amended by the legislature of 190 7, was introduced in the Senate as Senate File No. 2')-. by Senators Hanna of Cherry and Phillips of Holt. It was simultaneously intro - duced in the House as House Roll No. 19:!, by Representatives Gliem of Red Willow, Green of Holt. Logsdon of Fillmore. Henry of Holt, Snyder of Harlan, and Wilson of Custer. The Senate, being composed of thirty-three members, worked more rapidly and the bill was passed there first. When H. R. No. 19:! came up for consideration in the House, S. F. No. 232 was substituted therefor. This gives Senator Hanna the honor of being connected with the authorship of both the junior normal laws. All these members of the legislature of 1907 worked in season and out of season for the junior normal cause. Great praise is due them, individually and collectively. ior the suc - cess which crowned their efforts. The legislature of 1907 appropriated only $1.j.imiii for the mainte - nance of these schools for the ensuing biennium, but as the new law requires the county in which a junior normal school is located to give three-fourths of its institute fund to the support of a junior normal school, we shall have an appropriation of about 1 16,0X1 for the bien - nium. This with the local patronage and the enrollment fee for the lecture and musical course will give us about $25,000 for the biennium. The average number of persons in the faculties of these schools for the past four years has been seven! The average number of per - sons for each faculty during the next two years will be nine. Char - acter, scholarship and fitness for the particular work to be done has been the sole criterion in the selection of these faculties. Politics and </seg>
            <seg id="p066">STATE SCPERINTENDENT's REPORT church have been disregarded. Superintendent Softley, our opponent two years ago, was a member of the junior normal faculty during the past two years under our appointment at North Platte. Superintendent R. H. Watson, our opponent in the last campaign, served as the princi - pal of th&gt; :ie junior normal school under Superintendent Fow - t rat Ion, and Mr. Watson held the same position dur - ing the last two years under our appointment. We tendered each of gentlemen positions in the junior normal faculties again this and we are pleased to announce that Superintendent Softley could t, but regret that Sui&gt;erintendent Watson could not. During the past four years, the enrollment in the five junior normal schools reached nearly 4. in- r did the state do so much good with 127,000 in the training of its teachers or any other field. W( '» find that some members of the legislature, on their t thought that it meant the erection of normal ■ I buildings in which to hold these summer terms. A careful read - ing of the law shows that no junior normal school can be established it any place unless the board of education gives the free use of its school buildings, apparatus, and all equipment to such school. This means that the school districts of Alliance, Alma, Broken Bow, Geneva, MeCook, North Platte, O'Neill, and Valentine will place at the free disposal of the state for the work of these schools, at least $250,000 in buildings, books, and apparatus. Some ask. "Why do we need these junior normal schools when we have two state normal schools, two private normals, and private colleges and uni\. iving normal training for teachers?" The normals and these private are now crowded to their ut - most capacity. President Crabtree had to telegraph several county su - perintendents last summer not to send any more teachers to Peru. The state normal school at Kearney had all it could properly care for. The same was true of the Fremont normal college and the Nebraska normal college at Wayne There is an ini]&gt;erative need for these eight junior normal :-&lt; The state never had a more economical way for training its We shall have nearly 1,000 teachers enrolled in these eight junior normal schools this summer. Many county superintendents have testified to the better work accomplished by their schools as a I of th* professional training given their teachers in the junior normals. The hearty support given th unty superin - tendents, the attendance on the part of teachers, the liberal patronage and the generous donations from each place where junior normals have been located, the excellent rendered the state by the principals and instructors, the heroic efforts put forth by the teachers thenir - make a record full of credit and honor. </seg>

The minimum entrance requirements for admission to the state junior normal schools shall be a teacher's certificate, or a certificate from a county superintendent that the applicant has completed the eighth grade course of study, or a certificate from a city superintendent or high school principal for admission to the high school, or the pres - entation of evidence of other equivalent academic work. </seg>
            <seg id="p071">JUNIOR NORMAL SCHOOLS ENROLLMENT AND FEE. The maximum amount of work a student may take shall be four full subjects (with forty minutes recitation), and in addition any two of the following drill subjects: Drawing, music, course of study for rural schools, reading circle work, or other subject not requiring study outside of the recitation period. Tuition is free, but an enrollment and incidental fee of $2.00 will be charged each student. This will entitle the student to a season lecture course ticket free of charge. Those who enroll for the institute will be charged an institute fee of $1.00, and will be entitled to a free ticket to whatever number of the lecture course may be given that week. The aforesaid fees do not entitle one to the rights of an examination for a teacher's certificate. The examination fee for a teacher's certificate is $1.50 as provided by law. No examination fee will be charged for the junior normal school examination for junior normal credit. JINIOR NORMAL EXAMINATION AND CREDITS. The junior normal school examination for credit at the state normal schools and at schools authorized to grant teachers' certificates will be held the last two days of the normal school, August 2 and 3. A uniform set of questions based on the junior normal course of study will be submitted at all schools for the examination of students desir - ing junior normal credits. The answer papers will be examined, graded and reported back to the respective junior normal school prin - cipals by the state board of examiners for county certificates. In determining the final junior normal credit for six weeks' at - tendance, the final examination grade as given by the state board of examiners shall be counted as one-third; the class instructor's daily markings and occasional tests, averaged, shall be counted as one-third; and the class instructor's judgment of the worthfulness of the student - teacher's endeavors and capacity to instruct shall be counted as one - third. Before a student is entitled to a junior normal credit in any suo - ject he must pass with an average of at least T'l per cent, in these three points, and must be in attendance upon instruction in that subject for at least thirty days. ELEMENTARY STATE CERTIFICATES. A student who has been in attendance at a junior normal school four sessions of not less than six weeks each may be granted an elementary state certificate upon the completion of the entrance re - quirements as provided by law at the state normal schools, and the completion of the junior normal training course together with reviews of branches included in the entrance requirements.

            <seg id="p077">NEBRASKA'S FREE TKXT-BOOK LAW FROM SUPT. H. R. CORBETT'S REPORT In the Fourteenth Biennial Report of the State Superintenden of Public Instruction to the Governor of Nebraska (1895-6), Supt H. R. Corbett gives the result of a special investigation of the result and popularity of the Free Text-book Law. I give herewith a few o the questions submitted by him to the county and city superintendents principals, and country school teachers, and the replies received thereto In some cases I include comments made by Supt. Corbett in his report Is the average condition and care of books better or worse than it was in the same schools under individual ownership? Of the 164 answers received, eighty-six indicate "better," thirty-five "worse," and forty-three indicate no difference. I the free text-book system lead to any increase in school en - rollment? Of the 172 answers, 129 say "yes," thirty-seven "no." and six are doubtful. Does it promote regular attendance? Of the 161 answers,, eighty - nine answer "yes," fifty-eight "no," and fourteen are doubtful. Is there any marked decrease in the entire cost of books to the community as a whole? Of the 168 answers, 12S are "yes. 1 thirty-three no" and seven doubtful. Do school boards as a rule furnish books more promptly and in sufficient quantities? Is the supply more full and prompt and satis - factory than when pupils furnished the books? Of the 176 an* 161 are "yes," twelve are "no,' and three are doubtful. What means are employed for securing good care of t» Among the significant answers to this question are the following 'Regular inspections, books being inspected and their conditioi: ing recorded by the teacher." (This is one of the most effective means, and if systematically done requires but very little time. "Books numbered and charged to pupils in text-book register." "Tact and care on the part of the teacher." (This suggestion gives the ke&gt; to the situation.) "Pupils required to purchase books lost or ear - ly injured." (A requirement eminently proper under the law.) "The covering of books." (A fresh new paper cover at the beginning of the term will go a long ways toward making the books uniform and at tractive.) "Careful use of bookca Care insisted upon by the school boards." "Talks to teachers in institutes and associations.' "Circular to teachers." In conclusion, Supt. Corbett says: "I have taken pains in compiling the answers received to report favorable and unfavorable replies with equal fairness. My desire has been to enable the reader of this summary to gain from it in brief com pass an accurate idea of the esteem in which the law is held by the school people of the state. </seg>
            <seg id="p078">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT "The«e are its advantages, briefly stated: it is a logical sequence tc the free school idea, diminishing still further the barrier between rich and poor, removing an obstacle which stands in the way of at - tendance of the very class the common schools are chiefly designed to reach; it reduces largely the cost of books to the community as a whole; it enables the management of the school to secure a more sat - isfactory and seasonable supply of books and materials; when properly administered, it freely ]&gt;ermits the use of books which are needed for study at home and helps the teacher to inculcate habits of neatness and care in the use of books. "The chief objections to the system come from two sources: (1) from those who oppose all taxation for school ymipom from places where carelessness in the administration of the law has resulted in unnecessary destruction of the books, and in careless habits on the part of the pupils. "I consider it safe to affirm that wherever proper attention has been paid to the administration of the law, the results have been highly gratifying to school authorities, teachers and patrons. It is furthermore safe to assume that having once come to understand the advantages of this logical extension of the free school idea, the people of Nebraska will not willingly go back to the system formerly in use." FROM SCPT. W. R. JACKSON'S REPORT In the Fifteenth Biennial Report I, Supt. W. R. Jackson ihe result of his inquiries and observations as follows: The free text-book law has been in o]&gt;eration in this state since Of the 6,703 school districts in Nebraska, .".TTj own and furnish text-books to the pupils free of cost. In many districts it is mutually agreed among the patrons of the school not to take advantage of the provisions of the law. While all within the district are satisfied with this plan, they may, of course, furnish the books individually, or the district may plan to secure books at contract price and sell to pu - pils ct cr.=* but if anyone living within the district demands free text-books for his children who attend school, the law not only "em - powers" the school board to furnish them, but makes it "their duty to purchase all text-books necessary for the schools of such districts." On« of the features which commends our present law to the favorable consideration of the taxpayers is the provision regulating the cost of the books, as follows: "That the contract prices of such books shall ■ 1 the lowest price then granted to any dealer, state, county, township, school district, or other individual or corpora - tion in the I'nited States, to be determined as hereinafter provided; and provided further, that ntract shall guarantee to such districts any further reduction that may be granted elsewhere during the life of such contract." It will be seen by the above extract that school dis - tricts in this state, regardless of size or financial ability, may obtain text-books on as favorable terms as the largest and most influential district or corporation in the United States. </seg>
            <seg id="p079">NEBRASKA'S FREE TEXT-BOOK LAW M Another strong feature may be noted. The law does not restrict the district to purchasing books from one firm or company. This gives great latitude in the selection of books and is a very desirable feature. The law as a whole is a good one. perhaps one of the best found in any state, and scarcely needs any amendments. About twenty of the leading book companies of the United States have filed bonds, together with sworn statements of their lowest contract prices for books. Some districts have contracts with five or six of these com - panies and thus are able to select the best books put out by each company. The advantages and arguments in favor of In iooki may te summed up in the following: 1. They increase the school attendance. 2. They save time in the organization of the school 3. They secure complete uniformity of text-books within the school 4. They enable teachers to control better the organization and administration of the school. They spread a richer course before pupils in the lower grades. 6. They will render more frequent changes possible. 7. They are much cheaper to the community. Reports having reached this office that our present free text-book law is not giving satisfaction, it was thought expedient to canvass the views of the people generally throughout the state for the purpi taining the ■ tus of this matter, thus enabling me to uniend such measures for the consideration of the legislature as might be best for the educational interests of the state. For this purpose the following questions were submitted to school officers, principals, and superintendents throughout the state. 1. In your judgment, has this law had the effect of improving the school work in your communit 1'. Are the people of your community satisfied with it? 3. Has it, in your judgment, had the effect of reducing the i if school books? 4. Would you favor a change in the law? if so, in what respect? Would you favor a repeal of the law altogether and a return to the old plan of the individual purchase; that is, where the pupils purchase the books themselves? 6. Additional remarks and suggestions. I have received replies from over 3,000 persons. Of this number, only five out of 132 town and city superintendents favor a repeal of the present law. But one or two county superintendents are op] to the law as it stands, and a vast majority of school officers reporting </seg>
            <seg id="p080">M PERINTEXDENTS REPORT for their districts say they are in favor of the present law. Eighty per cent, of the school officers answer the first question in the affirma - 83 per cent, are satisfied with present conditions; 76 per cent, inform me that the present law results in a reduction of the cost of books; 28 per cent, favor some change in the law, but the changes proposed are almost as numerous as the persons suggesting them, many suggesting points already covered by the law; while is per cent, favor a repeal of the law altogether, the reason given by the major portion is "that individual ownership would result in better care of books." Under "additional remarks and suggestions," the statements made would indicate that in some districts too little pains is taken in the care of text-books; while on the whole these remarks would in - dicate that the present law is about as satisfactory as it would be pos - sible to make It. At the end of another two years, in the Sixteenth Biennial Report (lttt-lMt), Supt. Jackson says, relative to the free text-book law: The law enacted in 1891 providing that the text-books for use in the public schools of the state shall be furnished free to the pupils ie still in force and effect. It has not been modified in any way. The purpose of the law is to secure to the people of each district the widest latitude in the management of their schools. The object of the law in authorizing the school districts to contract for the needed text-books was two-fold. 1st, to insure to the district the right to purchase the books at the very lowest wholesale rates offered on such books anywhere in the United States, thus securing to the district the benefit of universal competition throughout the country, and 2d, to protect the people of the district against the expense inci - dent to too frequent changes. Preparatory to entering into a contract under the law, the pub - lishers must first have filed with the State Superintendent of Public Instruction a sworn statement of their lowest wholesale prices of books, and must be willing to execute a bond for the protection of school districts contracting for the same. By this provision of the law, each district secures not only the benefit of competition in this state, but in all other states where the said publisher's books are used. The protection of the people of a district against too frequent changes in text-books is sought to be secured by the provision in the law authori - zing school boards to enter into contracts with publishers for their books for a term of years. I might add that experience has shown that teachers moving from one district to another frequently feel it incumbent upon them to dis - card some of the books in use for others of the same kind but of dif - ferent authorship. This disposition often exists where there is a large supply of the text it is proposed to throw out in good condition; and where the change 1b made, under such circumstances particularly, it results in large expense to the people of the district. The correct procedure for any school board, in my opinion, is to exercise discrim- </seg>
            <seg id="p081">NEBRASKA'S KKKK TKXT-BOOK LAW lnating care in making its first selection of books: being solicitous to get the best that the market affords at the lowest obtainable | then to keep its teachers informed from year to year as to the it of the books selected in the different gi that when handing in their requisition to the school officer charged with keeping up the sup - lilies, none but the regularly adopted books will be called for. Of course, this suggestion is not intended to apply where new studies are added to the course, or where the books in use need to be supple - mented in the judgment of the teacher, acting with the board, in i to secure the best results.

See the case of Ambrose Affholder et. al. v. State of Nebraska ex. rel. Peter McMullen. 51 Neb. 91. In this case, in the district court of Burt county, Peter McMullen made application for a peremptory writ of mandamus to compel Ambrose Affholder and others consti - tuting the school board of district No. 5.S of said county to purchase and furnish to the children of school age of said district the necessary text-books in accordance with the free text-book law. An alternative writ was issued, and for a return thereto the school board Inter; the defense that said act was unconstitutional. The writ was i^ as prayed, and the school board appealed the case to the supreme court. The supreme court sustained the district court. A writ of mandamus will not issue where it is not within the power of the respondent law - fully to comply, or where it would otherwise be unavailing 46 Neb. 857. Funds for purchase. — Text-books may be paid for out of any funds rhand belonging to the general fund, to the incidental fund, or to fund especially provided for this purpose. </seg>
            <seg id="p082">« STATE SUPERINT1 S REPORT Iih linl«— -u|ipl ■•■&gt;. — In passing ui&gt;on the constitutionality of the free text-book law, in d - the word "supplies" the following lan - guage is used by the judge rendering the decision: "We do not think the term "text-books' should be given a technical meaning, but that it is con. . • .. enough and does include globes, maps, charts, pens, ink, pap- and all other apparatus and appliances which are proper to be used in the school in instructing the youth, and we con - clude, therefore, that the act under consideration is not broader than its title, and th^e term 'school supplies' found in the tenth section of the took*' found in the title of the act, but is germane to and comprehended and included within the term 'text-books.' " Loaning Iwx.ks. — The law provide* that text-books shall be loaned to pupils while pursuing a course of study in the schools. It is the duty of the board of education to place books at the disposal of pupils who need to study in the evenings. If. however, in the judgment of the teacher and the board, pupils of certain classes cannot study profitably outside of school hours, it is proper to place reasonable restrictions upon the use of books at home by such pupils or classes. It is not within the authority of the school board to loan text-books, which are the proj&gt;erty of the district, to be used in schools held outside the dis - trict. 1'upils mftMMe for. — Section 9, subdivision is of the School Laws, provides that all books purchased by the district board shall be held as the property of the district and loaned to pupils of the school while pursuing a course of study therein, free of charge: but the dis - trict board shall hold such pupils responsible for any damage to of, or failure to return such books at the time and to the person that may be designated by the board of such district. FROM SUPT. W. K. FOWLERS REPORT A bill was introduced into the legislature of l»0! to repeal the free text-book law. After a brief discussion in a committee the bill was reported for indefinite postponement. Experience nroTM that, where proper care is exercised by the school board and the teacher, this law is popular and satisfactory; but it becomes a detriment and a nuisance whenever pupils carelessly soil, mark, deface, or destroy the books. See th rg appeal to the pride of their pupils: that they insist on habits of neatness and cleanliness; that they make a regular inspection of books at least once a month— no other agency is more effective than a regular book inspection. Teachers should also hold pupils responsible for preserving and returning books in good condition, by a proper use of the permanent text-book record. School boards should furnish each schoolroom with a bookcase. We . urge upon school officers the importance of furnishing their schools with up-to-date text-books. You should no more expect pupils and </seg>
            <seg id="p083">NEBRASKA'S FKKK TKXT-BOOK LAW teachers to work with text-books that are behind the times than you should think of throwing aside the self-binder and check-rower to re - turn to the implements used by your fathers. Modern text-books are as necessary as modern farming implements. Relative to the difference in cost of text-books when purchased by parents individually and by the district as a whole, I will say that under normal conditions the a\ r child (including children from the kindergarten to the end of the high school course I for books when purchased by the individual parent would not be less than two dollars per year. Figuring on the enrollment in the schools of the state for the past five years and the amount expended for text-books and pupils' supplies for the same time, an average of sixty-four cents per child per year la the cost under the plan of district purchase. The number of districts in the state is 6666; the number of dis - tricts furnishing free text-books is 6066. The 600 districts not now furnishing free text-books could be compelled to do so upon complaint by any one tax payer in each of said districts, provided it is within the power of the district to furnish said books. PRESENT STATl'S A bill was introduced into the legislature of 19^7 to amend this^ law by making the purchase of text-books by school districts optional rather than mandatory. The vote in the House of Representu - was very decisive apainst this measure, only one member voting for the proposed amendment. The following letter to the members of the House of Representar If- explanatory: Lincoln, Nebraska, March 14. 1 To the Members of the House of Representatives: Gentlemen: — The la^ a of the Nebraska State Teachers' Association appointed a Committee on School Legislation to pp to your honorable body the consensus of the opinion of the school i&gt;eo - ple of the state on all matters of school legislation.

In view of the foregoing facts, we appeal to your honorable body to indefinitely postpone H. R. 4 •' 9. just reported on the first sifting list. L. P. Ll'DDEN, Chairman. By order of the committee. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: I was present at the meeting above referred to and gave the above resolution my official endorsement. I hand you herewith a copy of our present free text-book law with the opinions of three of my predecessors In support of this law. Note what State Superintendents lackson and Fowler said in behalf of this law. Note also the decisions of the supreme court as to when districts must furnish nooks and when they are exempt, pages 6 and 7 of said cir - cular. While this bill only makes the furnishing of free text-books optional instead of mandatory, it is just as reasonable to make the holding of school optional instead of mandatory. During the past six years many school districts in Nebraska voted at the annual meet - ing to have no school. The last legislature strengthened the manda - tory feature of the law compelling a district to provide free school privileges. Make it optional for school districts to furnish free text - books and you will make school matters chaotic in hundreds of school districts in this state. I wish to add my appeal in behalf of the in - definite postponement of H. R. 409. J. L. McBRIEX, Superintendent.

An unusual event was celebrated in Grand Island yesterday. Prof. Robert J. Barr. superintendent of the public schools, had com - pleted twenty-five years of continuous service in that capacity. It is a rare record, and the significance of such an event was not lost to the corps of teachers associated with Mr. Barr in his fine profession, to the members of the board of education, nor yet to the patrons of the schools. It was fittingly observed by his collaborators of city and state and two generations, beneficiaries of his tutelage, joined in do - ing honor to him whose influence, as stated by the St-.ite Superintendent of Public Instruction McBrien. has distinctly or indirectly encircled the globe. "Let the soldier &gt;ad if he will" — it has been writ - "he can do nothing in this age. There is another personage — a per - sonage less imposing, in the eyes of some perhaps insignificant. The schoolmaster is abroad, and I trust to him, armed with his primer, against the soldier in full military array." And indeed, there is much truth in the tribute. Valorous are the services of the volunteer in specific time of need, and grand and glorious as Is the victory of an army, battling for the right over an opposing force. The conquest. neverthel' uly over the inimical army; "the schoolm abroad," however, is victor over war itself; and a quarter of a century of continuous service as the head of one great system, indeed, is a nota - ble achievement. It is without a parallel in this state and is certainly one of which not only the jubilant may feel proud, but one which the patrons of the schools of this city may felicitate. For In this time young men and young women have been sent out as graduates into all walks of life, strong factors in the world's work. Cordially does The Independent join in the congratulations tendered and in the hope that Mr. Barr may be spared in health and strength to continue his labor and that he and his estimable wife may live long and contentedly in the knowledge and enjoyment of the fact that their life's work has had magnificent results. The board of education, in conjunction with the teachers had ar - ranged a public reception to take place at the court house yesterday afternoon, between the hours of 2:30 and 4:30, all patrons and pupils being especially invited and the general public being urged to partici - pate. The event was made doubly attractive when the teachers, four days before the event, decided to exhibit in the corridors of the first floor, specimens of the work done by the various grades. This feature was, to many, a revelation. There was work in drafting, map drawing. </seg>
            <seg id="p090">M pencil sketching, spelling, language, arithmetic, etc., which spoke high - 1} not only of the general management of the schools, but also of the efficiency of the forty-five individual teachers employed. During the afternoon Becker's orchestra furnished music in these corridors and the children were given a treat of fruit. Before the inspection, con - gratulations were extended to Prof. Barr, the receiving being in the rotunda on the first floor. Many of the teachers added to the pleasure oi the caller by explaining the various lines of work, pointing out the various exhibits and, in many cases, going over with parents par - ticular details of the work. In some instances, regrettable as it is to admit it, it was the first acquaintance of the parent with the teacher. The reception was all the more valuable for this feature. Between two and thre- md parents and pupils called during the two hours and there was a continuous flow in and out of the county's handsome building. In the evening at the A. O. V. W. hall, which was splendidly dec - orated for the event, a formal reception and banquet w;ts tendered to the honored superintendent. In the reception parlors of the hall there in the receiving line. Prof, and Mrs. Barr, the toastniaster of the evening, Prof. J. \V. Searson, of Peru, State Superintendent McBrien, Prof. Thomas of the Kearney normal school.

The banquet was one of six courses, daintily and beautifully served by the ladies of the Presbyterian church. Prof. Searson. a graduate of the Grand Island schools, who has made his way steadily forward until at present he is at the head of one of the departments at the Peru normal school, acted as toastmaster, and before calling upon the first si&gt;eaker gave a brief review of the life of the man to do honor to whom the associates of the profession, former pupils and friends were assembled. Prof. Robert J. Barr was born in Grand Rapids, Mich., October 1'9. 1S49. About 1852 his pa - i to Greenville, Mich., where the father followed the oc - cupation of farming throughout the summer months and lumbering during the winter. Prof. Barr remained on the farm until he was 18 years of age, but at the age of 12 he had entered the high school of Greenville, and being studious, industrious and intelligent he made iapid progress. Not being entirely satisfied with his knowledge of books, he, after teaching school near Greenville, in the spring of 1869 entered the state normal college of Michigan, at Ypsilanti, and this institution he attended four years, completing the full classical course, and graduating ii During the fall of 1873 he engaged for a few months as teacher in a district school in Washtenaw county. </seg>

In the fall of the latter year he became principal of the high school in Big Rapids, Mich., a position he held until March, 1876, then returned to Algonac and again had charge of the schools there. In September, 1878, he was married at Ypsilanti, to Miss Eva A. Bellows, daughter of the professor of mathematics of the Michigan state normal. In the fall of 1878 Prof. Barr took charge of the schools of Oscoda, Mich., where he remained for two nd for the two years following had charge of the schools of Au Sable, Mich.

The toastmaster, as in all cases. w;is at his best, and in introducing Mr. Paine gave various scintillating explanations of the meaning of "X X X X." Mr. Paine reviewed school days in a most pleasurable vein, recalling days when the superintendent seemed more stern to him than now. Miss Margaret Brown responded to "The Ninety and Nine," but declared at the outset that she was not going to search for the other one to-night. In connection with her response there were a few valu - able suggestions as to the successful training and development of the child's mind. Principal Matthews, responding to "A Great Art," addressed him - self to the profession of the pedagogue. Incidents of a witty nature were interwoven. Mr. Matthews, a member of the committee on ar - rangements, read in connection with his response a number of con - gratulatory letters received from superintendents of other cities.

Our war-club, or may we call it our peace-club, is: Every Ameri - can child should secure at least a common school education. We here use the term "common school course" as applied in its limited sense to only the regular course below the high school. To the individual whose ideal of the proper degree of training for citizens leads him to _nize as a first requisite no less than a high school or university training as necessary equipment for every embryonic citizen, our siogan, — the "common school education" — may api&gt;ear narrow and short. But we must face actual conditions and meet on a field where in command at least the attention of those whose interest we would enlist. Our uni normal schools, academies and bn 'lieges are extending the invitation that the freshman may come, receive, and then pass on to better things. These educational institutions are doing a good work when they seek out the young man and the young woman and lead them to a desire for better things; when they help to create higher ideals and assist in shaping the life course toward better citizen - ship. These educational institutions complain of the rawness of the product they receive and also find fault with the apathy of the public in recognizing the need of higher education, as exhibited by the fail - ure of the multitudinous number of young people who cannot be led to see their future in a proper light.

We too often point to the crown and decry the individual who fails to see it because his attention is riveted to his feet which are struggling in a mire that he has been taught to recognize, — or from lack of teaching, recognizes as a proper or I I ■ -ary condition, and one in which his limited vision sees no element not in harmony with a well ordered life. When we fill the eighth grade, demand efficient work and in proper form and spirit recognize the work done; we are not only open - ing the doors of the high school, university and college, but we are opening the eyes of those who need and who will seek the advantages offered by entrance therein. A form of myopia affects the vision of the public school super - visor who stands aside — he may erroneously consider it above — and criticizes the effort of the energetic supervisor who recognizes and emphasizes in proper time, place and degree the need of higher educa - tion, yet who gives largely of his time, thought and strength to the en - couragement of a general foundational education for every child; who -tiizes th&lt; \ of encouragement and direction at the proper time in the child's life, if the child is to be held to foundation prepar - atory work until he can recognize the need of a higher education. It is the hesitating first step that requires persuasion, direction, coaxing and encouragement. There is time for the second step after the first has been taken. And the best time for the second step is soon after the first step has been measured: when parents and friends have said "well done," and while the flush of victory may be turned to account by direction to the yet unmeasured distance toward a new point of vantage. The county superintendents of Nebraska have not only recog - nized the need of the big boy and girl to remain in — or get into — the school, but have so organized and systematized the work that it has become a fixed policy and practice in nearly all counties to conduct examinations and exercises in encouragement of the work. Although the plans followed in different counties vary somewhat they all contribute to the general result in securing better attendance and better work by pupils in the upper grades and in sending each year to high school and college many young people whose first ambition may hrnve been awakened through desire to complete the work of the first eight years in the common school course of study. </seg>

County eighth grade examinations as conducted in the various counties may be included under the following general divisions: Plan 1. — The county superintendent appoints a date or dates for the county examination, designates certain points at which examina - tion will be held, and appoints conductors of the examination at the different points. These points are generally the different towns or cities of the county, with occasional examinations at central rural school buildings in townships too far distant from any town; the principals of the town schools and the teachers at the central rural points acting as conductors. The applicant attends the point most convenient. No pupil's name appears on the manuscript he hands in. is and figures are used to designate the papers belonging to the different applicants. The papers are all sent to the county superin - tendent, who sorts them by subjects and distributes them among mem - bers of an appointed examining committee. When the examining com - mittee reports, the county superintendent completes the record and mails report of result to each applicant or to his teacher.

The younger pupils who attend the eighth grade graduating exercises are led to feel that the completion of the work of the grades is an accomplishment worthy of effort. The fear in the minds of some good people that public recognition of the completion of the grade work may influence pupils to become content with what has been accomplished, is not warranted by results as shown by the </seg>

Reports from county suj&gt;erintendents show that nearly the entire number of county eighth grade graduates continue their edu - cation the following year. Many who never would have completed even the eighth grade work but for the recognition given those who do complete it are led by the associations of the closing exercises to further education and become the most earnest advanced students in high schools and colleges, which they never would have entered but for the recognition given to themselves and to others of their com - munity when they took the first definite step toward securing an edu - cation.

Plan 3. — School district • at which the graduates of the district generally take a part by recitation or reading of composition. e counties combine one or all of these plans with modiflca - to suit the locality; the purpose being, to encourage those who graduate from the eighth grade to continue their education, and to stimulate a desire among younger pupils to remain in school until nipleted at least the first eight grades of work of the common school course of study. The one great object in this work is to encourage every young person to do his part toward getting the best education possible to him. Pilling our eighth grade classes means filling our high schools and filling our colleges. We can now aay to the grade student in any school in the state: "Complete the work of th« grades and you will be admitted free to the privileges of a high school edu - cation," and we shall find the way much easier in inducing rural school pupils to continue their work. But there will still be the necessity of tnatically planning and encouraging the work of the grades. The faults of our i ■ of conducting this work will be eliminated as our experi- eases To successfully establish and conduct the work of the county eighth grade examinations and exercises re - quires hard work, patience and perseverance; but the results justify all these. </seg>
            <seg id="p107">LITERATURE AND THE COMMUNITY. Professor S. H. Clark. University of Chicago, beturt' the Nebraska Library Association. Lincoln, December, i • Education to-day is largely in the hands of women — at any rate, the practical side of teaching. Men are practical in educational matters, and they have their usefulness. They insist on seeing to It that the taxpayers are protected, even at the sacrifice of their children's education. Men want to stay down on earth, women like to soar. While possibly they deviate somewhat from what is called by men the practical in education, they impart to the system of edu - cation that which, in the true development of the man or woman, is in reality the most practical and adds the most to life — the spirit cf beauty. It would seem that women are left to bear the burden of culture alone. It is, therefore, with great pleasure that I speak to you on what I consider a fundament of education. Literature is a vital element in the home and in the community. This relationship is not generally recognized, but it exercises a great influence on our lives. The true joy of life is a love for the beau - tiful. This is demonstrated by the sight so often seen of the so-called successful man, unhappy through his wealth. To him the accumu - lation of his money has become so much a part of his life that it is his only pleasure. On the other hand, many a poor man enjoys his life from day to day, sees all that is beautiful in it. This is true .success. Every one is crying out for "practical education." "What is It going to bring me in?" is the question asked by the young man considering a college course. The question is most apt. Practical education is what we want, but the world is fast learning a new definition for the word "practical." It is not a mere matter of dol - lars and cents. The tendency of boys now is to get away from edu - cation as soon as possible. This will in time have an evil effect on the whole political prosperity of the country. The first attack of the "practical" was upon the humanities, "which I believe," said Professor Clark, "to be the fundamentals of educa - tion." He insisted, not upon abrogating the practical, but upon us - ing it side by side with the ideal. He said to teach a child some study he does not wish to learn, as book-keeping or mathematics, may be the very best thing for the development of his intellectuality and his moral character. He said: Let him have this most excellent discipline, but do not deprive him of the beautiful in life! The larger a man's knowledge, the </seg>
            <seg id="p108">96p STA1 [•OUT greater his capacity for seeing things and for deciding on moral ques - tions; and the better his preparedness for the higher duties of citi - zenship; and the more apt is he to fulfill his duty as a member of the communr The practical can give to us just only the practical. If we cul - tivate the realm of the spirit, the imagination, the sentiment, the poetic feeling, we have a store of riches of which business failures cannot deprive us, and which will prove a solace in time of sorrow. By the spirit, or spiritual, I do not mean religion, but that higher part of us which soars above the mind, is elevated above the body. It is of more consequence that a community should read good books — not necessarily fiction — than that It should do anything else in the world, except to make Christianity practical — of more conse - quence than social functions, business functions, even women's clubs — and they are the greatest single function to-day in the upliftment of the ideal in America. We are not tested by our vocations, but by our avocations. We i II have to work at something or other. Thank Heaven that we do. What are we going to do with our leisure? This is the test of the community. What are you preparing your boys and girls — not to Know, but to be? The tastes you develop in them will determine ?heir manhood and womanhood. What are your boys and girls go - ing to do after the day's work? There are only a few things that they can do. Mr. Clark then showed that while this leisure might be spent in philanthropic, religious, or social service, most of the leisure of the great majority of people might be spent in the companionship rf the great writers, from whom alone higher inspiration can come. He said: What is the use of the telegraph, telephone, fast trains, unless the time they save us Is put to good use?If the time saved by the eighteen hour trains is devoted to more business, so far as higher things are concerned we are no better off than with slow trains. The value of books to the community lies in the fact that they present higher intellectual and moral ideals. Books have very often obscured the real world, but this is the exception. The power to iive greatly is enhanced by the ability to handle the printed page intelligently, and many men and women have been impeded by their inability to do this. Then, too, it is the book that must give to the mass of men all the education they will receive after they leave school. I grant you that the book alone may not bring success, but the ability to read is a great help, and the only means of growth the man and woman" will have after school days. Let me say again, that many who have a knowledge of books fail, but they are the exceptions. , Granting the exception, we shall find, then, our only means of growth will be through books. The great writers have done the </seg>
            <seg id="p109">LITERATURE AND THK COMMUNITY 96q great things of the world. We don't go for an uplift to thr entitled "How I Made a Million" though the doing of this I nl a development of moral fiber. The lives that end there are not the completest sip ho have seen life wholly and truly have left the result of their vision in literature; they are the greatest benefactor* of the race. It is granted that moral finer comes from life itself, yet a great influence in the community comes through reading. Ha) 1 ask if we appreciate what the character of t) we do means. Do we not approach literature sandy store or the soda counter? the Bible or the (lei Rich S - doesn't make much difference. A fact that is utterly for we never can be the same after we have read a book You cannot stand still. Every book you read demands a moral judgment. Is it of consequence that a book should turn out "right?" 'l lie book written simply with an eye to convention, to satisfy popu - lar demand, the book that ends with a sentimental snivel, is demor - alizing. Those who do not see the falseness of a false teaching are being dragged down morally No influence may be stronger in the making of character than the Influence of literature. No matter what our object in reading may be, no matter whether we have an object or not. we are either better or worse after reading a book. Consciously, or in that mys - terious subliminal part of ourselves, every book we read and every thought we get from it demands and receives from us approval or disapproval. Mi Clark closed with the following lines from Lowell, which, the speaker said, are a pitiful portrait of one who has sold the ideal for the purely practical: "When I was a beggarly boy. And lived in a cellar damp, I had not a friend nor a toy. Hut I had Aladdin's lamp: When I could not sleep for cold, I had fire enough in my brain. And builded with roofs of gold My beautiful castles in Spain. "Since then I have toiled day and night. 1 have money and power good store. Hut I'd give all my lamps of silver bright For the one that is mine no n» Take, Fortune, whatever you CBOO You gave, and may snatch again; I have nothing 'twould pain an For 1 own no more castles in Spain." </seg>

            <seg id="p115">99 NORMAL TRAINING IN HKJH SCHOOLS THE SCHOOLS OF TIIK PKOPLh The high schools are the schools of the people, and not prepara - tory schools for higher institutions. This statement should in no way interfere with the division of work of the high school, where feasible, into different lines of work. Let the high school course of study, where it is feasible, be differentiated so as to give our young people the greatest opportunity possible to fit themselves for the work they must do upon graduation from the high school before they can ever have the means to go to college or university. It will be interesting right here to know what becomes of our high school graduates. Knowing this we may plan better the work the high school should do. After a careful study of this question from letters received from city superintendents of the sixty strongest high schools in Nebraska, we find that during the past three years 600 of the graduates went immediately to college, 800 immediately entered business, including such work as farming, banking, clerking, house - keeping, and like occupations, 900 immediately took upon themselves the responsible business of teaching; and all this in spite of the fact that these sixty of our strongest high schools have been straining themselves almost to the breaking point for credits at college or uni - versity. Let us so far as possible fit for college and university. Let us give . the young men and the young women who must enter the business-^ world immediately upon graduation from the high school the best preparation possible. Let us also train the still greater number of young men and young women who will teach school immediately upon graduation in the art and science of school management. By such training we do not mean normal school work, but such work as will t them for the special business of school teaching. We admit the meagerne8s of such training, but it will be infinitely better than no training at all. Bear in mind what becomes of our high school graduates imme - diately upon finishing the high school course of study. Commissioner Harris is authority for the statement that less than ten per cent of those who enter college and the university finish the course. Then remember that a cardinal principle of American government is the greatest good to the greatest number. Is it not high time, then, for us to give some consideration in our high school courses of study to the three-fourths of our high school graduates who have heretofore been sadly neglected? Let us put our courses of study in touch with the avenues open to young men and young women who graduate from </seg>
            <seg id="p116">100 our high schools. In this manner we can hold the boys and girls for graduation who would otherwise drop out before the senior year, and ultimately more would graduate from the high school and more would enter the college, university and normal school than to hold to a course made dry and Impractical with the dust of ages. The American high school should be the poor man's college. I^et us make it so. Let us demand that the higher institutions re-arrange their credits and requirements more nearly along modern lii What have we done as a nation in the amount of schooling we have given to each inhabitant? The scale gradually ascends from to 1905, having for tli* &lt;led five jrean of 290 days each as the average education given to each member of the entire pop - ulation of the Vnited States. The maximum was reached in 1900 in about five years and a quarter of 200 days each: that is to say, I.1M6 days would have been given to each individual in our country at the of public instruction for that year. For Nebraska it would mean almc ;irs of ISO days each. Do you get the force of figures? It means this: The average education of all our |&gt;eople — old and young, illiterate and learned, in both state and nation - short of finishing the sixth grade. Theoretically, then, we give 100 per cent of our people almost six years' schooling, but in reality we do not afford fift; :it of our people this amount of education. Of the number who enter the first grade less than thirty j finish the eighth grade, and less than ten per cent enter the hi^h school. Of those who enter the high school less than ten per cent graduate. Of those who enter college or universit ian ten per cent finish the course. David Felmley, president of Illin&lt; Normal University, in his address on the modern high school curriculum before the d&gt; ment of normal schools of the National Educational Association at Asbury Park in July, 1 9 0 r&gt; , said: "It probabh irred to of you that this paper is sketching an educational I'topia, and that no high school ever has produced, or ever will produce, graduates of the quality indicated within four years. The writer does not proi&lt;' lengthen the course, but to eliminate useless subjects and im existing methods. The chief obstacle is the study of Latin. In the programs of most of the high school graduates that seek the normal school Latin has engrossed one-fourth of the recitation periods, and from forty to sixty per cent of the time spent in study. Since argu - ments on this subject are mainly expressions of opinion based upon a priori considerations, I shall venture to say that Latin contributes lit - tle to the prospective teacher, unless indeed she proposes herself to be - come a teacher of Latin. The place of Latin in our schools is purely tra - ditional. Since schools are no longer confined to the clergy, and Latin has ceased to be the language of scholars and diplomats, as in the days of Bacon and Milton, schoolmasters are put to it to invent arguments for the study, chief among which is the resulting mental discipline. But modern pedagogy rejects the dogma of formal mental discipline. </seg>
            <seg id="p117">101 NORMAL TRAINING IN HICK The discipline acquired in studying a foreign language is helpful in the further study of foreign languages. The knowledge of Latin help little in the study of the Romance tongues. We usually recognize new words in those tongues from their similarity to English cognates, no from their Latin derivation. Whatever aid the derivation of Englls words affords any one of us is due, not to his study of the of Caesar or Cicero, hut to his independent study of Latin roots. To gain a knowledge of Roman literature and life, it is no more neces sary to study Latin than to study Hebrew to understand and appreci ate the Bible. Lastly, the constant translation of Latin into English as actually conducted does not with one pupil out of ten contribute to the growth of a vigorous idiomatic English style. We hear almos everywhere, 'Caesar said himself not to be about to be made mor certain,' or other atrocities scarcely less flagrant. With Latin eliml nated, there will be time for further study in arithmetic, English gram mar, geography, and American history — studies commonly relegated to the grammar school, but needing in many of their vital aspects th maturer comprehension of the high school period. Room may be found, too, for the studies in reading, in hand work, including art, fo which now so little time is afforded." In the discussion of President Felmley's paper, Professor Frank Mi-Murray of Teachers' college, Columbia University, would omit much of algebra as well as Latin in the high school in order to more time for other studies. In the old civilization the few led, the many followed. And am led to believe that our system of education, like the old forms o government, forgets the many to care for the few. If it be so, it is a grievous fault, and grievously must we answer for it. Therefore, le us inaugurate a system in our education that will prepare the ninety per cent for the actual problems of life and the everyday responsi bilities of American citizens, rather than to create crowns for the few make educational aristocrats, and kingly interpreters of the more for tunate ten per cent. "The people must needs take thought of wha they shall eat and wherewithal they shall be clothed. And the educa tion that fits them best for this is, from necessity, the best; at leas until they are so developed and improved that the people, the grea ng. struggling, hungering, needing, hoping, despairing, an&lt;! unyielding people, shall not need to take thought only of what they shall eat and wear." </seg>
            <seg id="p118">102 I'EKINT - REPORT HISTORY OF TIIK SCHEME IX NEBRASKA. / This scheme was first recommended by State Supt. W. K. Fowler in his Seventeenth Biennial Report, from which we take the following extracts: "I would recommend the organization of training classes in col - leges, normal schools, and such academies and high schools as are able to meet the requirements for such a class. These training classes should be under the unrestricted supervision of the state superintend - ent of public instruction. On or before the first of July of each year, application for appointment to instruct training classes should be nted to the state superintendent by the trustees of the institu - tion desiring such appointment on blank forms provided for the pur - pose. No high school should be recognized as meeting the require - ments for a training class except those organized under subdivision 1 4 or 17 of the school laws of Nebraska. These applications should set forth the various facts or information regarding the school, giving the number of teachers employed, the enrollment in the different depart - ments, opportunities afforded for observation and practice work, the nanics, qualifications and salaries of instructors, etc. Before being forwarded the application should be approved by the county superin - tendent of the county in which such school is located. The idea of permanency is an important factor to be considered in the approval of such schools, for it is essential to retain, as far as possible, the same institutions year after year and make them educational centers for this vork. Certain specific requirements should be prescribed in the regulations issued by the state superintendent as a requisite for approving these institutions, among which are the following: the institution must furnish as an instructor (or instructors) a college graduate or a normal school graduate with three years' experience aching since graduation, or the holder of a professional state certificate with three years' experience in teaching; all instructors of such classes must be approved by the state superintendent: a minimum salary of $500 must be paid instructors: the school must provide op - portunity for (he members of the class to observe methods of teaching In the several grades of common school work and to teach in Fuch grades under proper supervision; it must conduct prescribed recitations in the subjects belonging to the training class course sep - arate from all other recitations: and it must maintain a legal class, that is, a class of not less than ten nor more than twenty-flve members for each instructor for at least thirty-six weeks in the year. "Candidates for admission to the training class should possess </seg>

They should be at least sixteen years of age at the time of •■trues. They should also subscribe in good faith to the following declaration: 'We, the undersigned, hereby declare that our object in asking admission to the training class is to prepare ourselves for teaching, and it is our purpose to engage in teaching in the rural schools of Nebraska at the close of such preparation. We pledge our - selves to remain in the class during the year unless prevented by 111 - or excused by the state superintendent of public instruction.' "The special mission of the training class is to provide the rural schools, that are not in a position to engage normal graduates, with teachers who are proficient in the common branches and have devoted at It. ,ir to special preparation — largely in professional work. The province of the normal school and the province of the training therefore, clear and distinct. The two are supplementary agencies and are not to be regarded in any sense as rivals. 1 am of the opinion that many training class graduates after teaching a few years will be enabled to complete a course of study in a normal school, a st°p impracticable before they gain a foothold from the training class. The normal school proper cannot supply the demand for teachers in the country districts. Moreover, the graduate from the advanced nor - mal course is, as a rule, beyond their reach, owing to the financial con - dition of a large majority of the rural school districts. The training class is the only means of providing trained teachers for the country schools." THE LAW. The law relative to normal training in the high schools of Ne - braska is very brief, somewhat indefinite, yet comprehensive. It was enacted by the legislature of 1905. It reads: On and after September 1, 1907, no person shall be granted a first grade county certificate who has not had at least twelve weeks' normal training in a college, university, or normal school of approved standing in this or in another state, or in a state junior normal school of Nebraska, or in a high school of Nebraska approved by the state superintendent of public instruction as Ix-inn equipped to give such normal training. One or more yeai -sful experience as a teach - er may be considered the equivalent of the normal training required by this section. — Sec. 7, Subd. 9a, S.

While the statute empowers the state superintendent to prescribe all requirements for high schools qualifying for normal training, we hesitated to inaugurate a law of such magnitude without the help of the school men and women most deeply interested in the results to be obtained by a proper application and enforcement of it. Therefore, at the Association of Superintendents and Principals of Graded Schools at its session in October, 1105, we requested that a committee be ap - point of the president of that association, one member at large, one member from each congressional district, the presidents of the state normal schools, and the head of the department of education of the University of N with instructions to consider the sub - &gt;f normal training in the high schools of Nebraska in accordance with the law, and to report to the State T relation.

At the meeting of tl: association in December, 1905, the committee made the following report, which was unanimously adopted: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS. 1. A high school in order to be approved for normal training must be a school accredited to the University of Nebraska, with a four years' course of study. is exclusive of the city superintendent shall give thpir entire time to instruction in high school branches. 3.

ARITHMETIC As the teacher takes up this work let her bear in mind these things: First, a teacher can teach only that which she thoroughly understands, and as she is sending from her classroom those who shall without further study attempt to teach this subject, let her see to it that they have a eli of every topic taken up. In the second place, keep constantly in mind as she prepares her work and as she presents it, that no matter what fine spun theories she may present, the method her pupils will use will be the methods she exemplifies before them. They will teach as she teaches and not as their grade teacher did, for when they were with the grade teacher they were not old enough to notice method. Let some such plan of a recitation as follows be con - sistently used: \sMgning next day's lesson, indicating difficult points, with suggestions as to how to prepare. K.niinn to-day's lesson, consisting of— (a) Testing individual preparation in various ways. (b) Correcting false and clearing up doubtful im- pressions. (c) Drilling on essential points by whole class The work of the class should be along two lines: Academic work which must constitute the major part, and Methods and Devices. The committee do not think it best to separate this work in detail, but yet </seg>
            <seg id="p127">111 NORMAL TRAINING IN HIL.H the teacher must so plan her work. For convenience we shall here set forth what we think should be done in each, but do not recommend that it be so done in the classroom. ACADEMIC WORK In the academic work one recitation each week should be given strictly to Mental Arithmetic. Select some good text and furnish each child with one. Assign definite lessons and expect the same prepara - tion as you do for written work. One of the reasons that mental arith - metic has fallen into dl»r&lt; made what little work we did offer desultory and fragmentary. In addition to this regular period use five or ten minutes of each recitation for easy oral problems, bearing directly upon the topic under consideration and introducing the topic for the next recitation. Since it will be im - possible to cover all classes of work in the nine weeks given to the subject, we recommend that the following be offered: 1. Rapid combination drills in i fractions and denomi - nate numbers. 2. Problems dealing with ordinary business transactions such as small bills; involving fractional parts of one dollar; discounts and Interest. 3. Measurements. 4. Ratio, with special reference to its application in solution of problems. Analysis. — The present generation of pupils have h:id no train- Ing along this line and to this phase of the work the teacher must give special emphasis. The state superintendent declares that the papers now coming to his office prove clearly that themselves have no real conception of mental arithmetic. They are forced to solve simple problems algebraically. This must not be countenanced in mental arithmetic. It would seem to us that it would be well to carry this work almost daily by assigning one or two problems just for analysis. Have many handed to the teacher in writing that she may see that each pupil has a clear form of analysis of the ordinary prob - lems that should be solved without the aid of pencil and paj If no text is at hand for this work, we recommend Dr. Brooks's "New Mental Arithmetic," published by Christopher Sower Co., Phila - delphia. Make a careful study of his preface and all suggestions to teachers. In the written work we think the following topics should be cot - ered first, then if time permits, others may be added: 1. Notation and numeration. Merely a rapid glance at the two methods of notation, the principles underlying each and the advantages of the Arabic over the Roman. There should be some drill in numer - ation of Roman notation. Do not allow the class to leave your hands until they habitually read the ordinary Arabic correctly. One-half of </seg>

A short review of the fundamental operations. The emphasis heif should be placed upon checking. Give problems that arise by use of the technical terms applicable to these operations. More will be said of this topic under Methods and Devices. 3. The three special forms of Division — (a) Fractions, Common and Decimal. (b) Percentage and the most important of its appli- cations, (c) Ratio and Proportion. As suggested by the arrangement above, these subjects are really only different forms of division and should be treated as very closely related. They should be divested of the mystery that is usually thrown around them. Common sense methods should be used in teaching them. Percentage should be tauglr in fractions. The sub - jects should be carried along together and thus prepare the would-be teacher to so present them to her classes. 4. Measurements. (a) Review of common tables. (b) Actual use of ruler; yard stick; measures, both dry and liquid; and scales, wherever possible Much work in areas and capacities — too much work can- not be offered here. Plastering, carpeting, and prob - lems requiring number of bushels, gallons, etc., are invariably stumbling blocks. iuare Root and its applications. METHODS AND DEVICES It is meant that this work shall be done in connection with the regular class work. Of necessity some time must be given wholly to this phase of the sub.. 1. Teaching the fundamental operations Pupils should leave this class with a clear distinction between counting and adding. That is to say, they should be given enough work in rapid addition and subtraction to learn the value of knowing combinations as soon as they see the figures. No better way can be suggested than to drill ui en combinations of two figures; then three, four and five. Such columns should be added at sight cornttly. When they find the value of such practice, that they will use it in their classes is unquestionable. Methods of presenting and drilling upon the multiplication "tables" should be given them. If not already using the "Austrian method" of arrangement in Division they should be taught it at the start and not be allowed to use any other method in this class. By this method we refer to the placing of the quotient above the dividend and any digit in the quotient exactly above the last digit of the dividend used or "brought down." The value of </seg>
            <seg id="p129">NORMAL TRAINING IN HIGH 113 checking subtraction by addition, and multiplication and division by each other, should be firmly flj 2. Visiting the grad' some of the strong teachers present the most vital topics. This should be done under the direction of the superintendent of the schools, that only best methods be observed. There should be one hour spent in each of the lower grades. After these visits there should )»■ a conference, in which the teacher, the superintendent, the class and their high school teacher, may discuss the recitation observed. This means that these conferences must be after hours' meetings, but we believe this will be gladly done by all concerned. 3. Each pupil in tin mild have an opportunity to present to his cla one or more t oj . i i^n this work several days in advance that the pupil-teacher may make careful preparation for his maiden effort. After his part of the work is done, the teacher and class should discuss the pupil-teacher's work. 4. There should be a careful study of the problem something as follow Reading the problem -olving by indicated pi only. iiing by approximate computations, fd) "Blocking out" the probl. Making of problems in &amp; the recitations. It h I that we amplify thl &gt;mewhat. We mean by reading the problem that the primal difficulty in problem work is that the child does not read it. He glances at it and proceeds to do maethtag with ptmeU and thinks that he is solving the problem. For preparation have a great many problems read carefully and the recitation consi fly telling how to solve; "b" is only the written form of "a." On other days assign many problems and require the work to be merely indicated. Do the mechanical work in the classroom. The use of approximate results is scarcely ever used to any advantage. When a child has read a problem let him mentally estimate by use of approximate numbers about what his answer should be. Then as he goes through the process of computation he will have something to tell him he has made some fatal blunder in his work. By merely misplacing a decimal point he may have an answer ten times too large. Suppose it is one of those in percentage, as: A house costs $850.00. The yearly taxes are $1S.OO, the water $5.00, repairs $13.00. It rents for $8.00 per month. What per cent does the owner realize on his investment? The child reasons thus: He receives $96. 00, but pays out $36.00; this leaves him $60.00. Now if his house had cost him $800.00, he would have exactly 7 V£ per cent, but since it cost him more than $800.00 his investment will pay him a little less than 7 V4 per cent. By blocking out the problem is meant only the sketching of the conditions to help visualize them. It will be the in- </seg>

OUTLINE OF COURSE. I. General discussions to show what Geography is; its place in the schools; and how it is related to other subjects. (Time 3 weeks.) 1. The View Point — Definition of subject. Why classed as on of the five essentials? What are geography facts? What are th purposes of geography instruction? How is the subject related t nature study? To Agriculture? Botany? Zoology? Reading? Ex plain the definition, "Geography is the study of the earth as the hom of man and of life in general." How does the earth influence man What is meant by the terms "relation," "control," "type?" Give ex amples to illustrate each. 2. Parts of the Earth or the Spheres of Influence — Study eac sphere in general, giving its position, form, mass, extent, physical an&lt; chemical character. Compare the atmosphere and the water spher (Hydrosphere) in motion, compressibility, elasticity, resistance to mo - tion, etc. Can you see, weigh, and hear each? How are the atmos phere, hydrosphere and lithosphere related? To what sphere do liv ing things belong? In what sphere are most plants and animal found and why? 3. Geographic Influences — Define. How are animals related t air, to water and to the ground? As shown by its structure to wha spheres is a duck adapted? A fish? In what ways does the atmos phere influence (1) crops, (^l animals and (3) man? Note some o the effects of sunshine, temperature, wind and rainfall. Why do w study these weather and climatic elements in geography? What rela tions exist between mineral industries and the rock formations? Be - tween topography and travel? Drainage and disease? Soil and ag riculture? Harbors and cities? Make an outline to show the princ pal geographic influences. Which of these affect people most? 4. Departments of Geography — Compare; give relations of each to the other. A. Physical — Define, facts of B. Industrial — Define, facts of C. Commercial — Define, facts of D.

Enumerate the home geography relations. B. The Primary Text — When introduced. Relation to home geography. Foreign relations in geography. How use the text. C. The advanced text. When introduced? Why follow Primary text? Do we spend too much time on the primary or advanced texts? Why cover about the same ground in each? In what respects do the texts differ? How use text? D. Regional Geography — Define. Purpose. How like home geography? Why follow advanced text? 6. Study of Geography Texts. Compare the Frye, Dodge, Nat - ural and the Tarr and McMurray series, noting in each the illustra - tions, maps, exercises, questions, style, plan, continuity of plan, se - quence of subjects and the fitness of each book in its series for the prades for which it was written. Which series emphasizes physical features most? The Industrial? Which is best adapted to country schools? To town and city schools? Which is written most from the view point of children? Of the geographer? Which is easiest taught? Which gives the best notion of geography as a whole? 7. Illustrative Materials and Methods of Instruction. Give a few periods to the use of specimens with which to illustrate the forms of industries; the handling of globes; making and interpretation of maps, and to field excursion. II. Comparative Study of Continents. (Time two weeks.) Study and compare continents as to position, form, area, coast line, mean annual temperature, heat belts, wind systems, rainfall, re - lief, drainage and topography, vegetation, native animals, people, po - litical divisions, governments, resources, products, industries, com - mercial centers, methods of transportation and trade routes. III. Geography of the United States. (Time, two weeks.) Use Russell, Dodge, Powell, Frye, and Tarr and McMurry as references. Follow outline in Complete Geography by Tarr &amp; McMur - ry or in Dodge's Advanced Geography. See library references. Do laboratory work with weather and topographic maps, climatic charts, wall maps, etc. IV. Geography of Nebraska and Home Geography. (Time, three weeks.) Use topographic maps, geological atlases and folios, and illus - trative material. Text — Geography of Nebraska. Follow outline of text. Discuss method of teaching text and subject. The questions at the end of each chapter of text will serve to bring out geographic re - lations and as a basis of home studies. Make frequent use of library and of McMurry's Excursions and Lessons in Home Geography. </seg>

Those who can teach history well in the rural schools can teach it in any grade in the town school. But the reverse is not true.

            <seg id="p141">125 IAL TRAINING IN HKill Ing in the course of school instruction. Unless he has definite on this, his work is liable to be aimless, scattered, and result in no definite accomplishment. 1. He should know the definition of history and under - stand it thoroughly — so thoroughly that he can continually :iis work by it, and point out its application as the study pr&lt; Hi- should know, too, that in our country, where the welfare, stability, and efficiency of the government primarily on the intelligence of the citizens, the most important part of this intolli^. from the study of history. B. He should li of the portion of history he I ■ h. Thi.- he whole of Amer - ican history, including the biographies of the prominent char- 1. t'nli his know inning to a. He will with the daily prepa - ration of lessons. b. He will go wrong continually in guiding the student, 1 . r view of the goal to attain. This does not mean that he should know all the minutiae of that history, but the broad lines of develop - ment, the important features, the prominent characters and events, and should be able to trace the development of our principal institutions, mov and activities, able to give briefly a comprehensive outline of the whole subj- C. The teacher of history should be a student of history, and as a student he should know how to proceed — - 1. To find materials — the sources for his study. 2. To collect and sift facts, and estimate their relative worth. 3. To group them into logical form. 4. And to present his accumulated facts in what seems to him a truthful account of the subject considered, based on the evidence at his command. He should know something of the value of the works he has at his command, or has access to. He should become acquainted with at least a few of the better au - thors, know the difference between the original sources and the secondary writers, and the peculiar value of each. D. The teacher of history should have some knowledge of the relative importance of the various portions of history as found in the text or outline, so that he may wisely select, if </seg>
            <seg id="p142">126 STATE SCPEBINTENDENT'8 RKPORT for some reason his class should not be able to complete the book, or outline, or course prescribed. E. The teacher of history should have some knowledge of the work that may be, and ought to be, done in the various grades. He needs this knowledge, not only in planning the de - tails of regular course work, but in order to arrange harmoni - ously the lower grade reading, supplementary work, e' aa to produce the best results when the. regular study of his - tory is taken up later. F. The would-be teacher of history should have some defi - nite ideas of assigning lessons, directing pupils in the prepara - tion of their lessons, and hearing recitations. G. He should know that he will probably not find things ideal in the school which he engages to teach, but that he must fit his plans to the pupils and equipments until he can induce or produce changes for the better. While this is a general cau - tion it should be made especially in the History department, where so commonly conditions are far from what they ought to be. III. What the teacher of history should feel — A. The subject of history is the most important of all, so far as making intelligent citizens of a free democratic govern - ment is concerned. B. He must have a real desire to teach the subject well if he is to accomplish results. C. The lessons from the study of history are numerous and valuable, but it rests largely with the teacher to make these apparent. IV. What the course should include — A. A consideration of the aim and purpose of history. 1. The definition — not a formal definition, but a con- crete realization of its meaning. Emphasis to be placed on the evolutionary nature of history, its unity, and the relation of events to each other; interpretation *of events and movements should be especially emphasized in this normal course. 2. An amplification of the definition and purpose of the subject in the classroom work. A careful study of the main features of American history. 1. This should not be a am mlM or a substitute for the regular course, but a new course so planned for each school that the student will receive a distinct addition to his knowledge of the history of the United States. So much here depends on the teacher, the pupil, and the previous work accomplished, that a definite specified course might result in disappointment so far as results are </seg>
            <seg id="p143">127 NORMAL TRAININii IN HKJH SCHOOLS concerned; however, your committee ventures the follow - ing recommendations: a. The subject should be taught by outline, rather than by following a single text-book; other methods are approved, as the "multiple text" plan; also the use of a single text with assigned readings from the sources and more advanced narrative works. All the recognized approved methods may be used, and ought to he explained. b. "The Outline of American History by the New England Historical Teachers' Association," should be taken as a standard, but not slavishly followed. c. The use of texts faulty either in fact or method of procedure should be avoided. d. Since the whole of American history cannot be covered in one semester's work, only the most im - portant points should be considered previous to 1763: (1) A very brief study of old world conditions that led to the movement may be made; (2) territorial claims by the various European nations should be noted — extension and extinction followed in general outline; (3) colonial development previous to 1750 should be confined mainly to Massachusetts, Virginia and Pennsylvania — and here only the principal insti - tutional features should be noted; (4) the French- English rivalry, 1 t&gt;no-l 750, and its culmination in French and Indian war should be studied in its broad outlines. In the period after 1763 all purely military operations of the wars should be omitted, and such other topics as the particular conditions of the case may require. e. A short review of the Constitution of the United States should precede the study of the con - stitutional period. f. The other topics of Civil Government should be reviewed as they occur in connection with the history. g. The reference books used should be of the sort that may be used in the rural schools, rather than the larger works. C. At least one paper should be prepared, showing the re - sults of the intensive study of a short period or institution in - volving all the steps from the finding of the material to the completion of the narrative. D. Chronological tables should be prepared by the student to indicate the steps of the development of all important in - stitutions, etc. </seg>
            <seg id="p144">128 ■ I'KKINT - REPORT E. Sketches of a few of the best authors should be given to show who they are, or were, position occupied, methods of work, so that the student-teacher has a familiar feeling with the works of an author, and can take an interest in his works that only conies with such familiarity. F. The work that may be done in the lower grades may be taught by referring to the course of study in the home school and in the State Cours? of Study. This work should be out - lined for each grade. Instruction and practice should be given in laying off the work, assigning the lessons, giving direction for their prep - aration, and even hearing recitations. In connection with this Id l)f paid to the lower grad&gt; where possible to some rural schools. H. Short readings from some good elementary work on the teaching of history should be made, not so much for the in - formation gained from the book as for inspiration, and for ing them that there are such works. McMurry, Kemp, Hinsdale, Macy, Bourne and the Report of Committee of Seven are good. fV. The teacher of United States History should know more than expects to teach. He should not only have a good understanding of American history, but also some knowledge of European history, es - !ly that of England from 1500 on. The more he knows of Eu - ropean history the better he will understand and teach American his - tory. Throughout this course the instructor should constantly keep in mind the preparation of - and the student should have his notebook ready at all times to note helps and suggestions. An able teacher with an earnest desire to instruct, and a diligent student with an earnest desire to learn, cannot help but make a change in the teach - ing of history in the rural schools. OUTLINE The American History department of the University has, at the request of the state superintendent, attempted a suggestive outline of a Normal Course in American History. Being intended as supple - mentary to and interpretative of the regular high school course, and not a substitute for it, the outline aims mainly at the bringing out of only the most important and significant items of the various periods covered, trusting to previous study and the daily preparation of the teacher for details and background. The department expresses its willingness to aid teachers of the state in adapting this outline to the varying needs and conditions of the different schools, and to make clear to inquirers, either in person or by letter, any portions of the outlined course that do not make themselves understood.

Owing to the age and preparation of the students, the purpose of the instruction, and the limited amount of time to be devoted to the study, it was thought best to confine the work to a few lines in which the teaching can be made most concrete and practical. For these ■us it is advised that no attempt be made to teach technical ped - agogy, psychology, history of education, and other subjects belonging to the more comprehensive work of the normal school and university. The subjects considered most appropriate under the circumstances are: 1. A course I in the Theory and Practice of teaching including a brief outline of the fundamental principles of elementary education. 2. A course I &gt;ns) in method of instruction and dis- trict school organization and management. 3. At least twenty-six observation lessons under grade teach- ers and three to five practice lessons with high school classes in which the pupil teacher teaches all or part of the period of a class of which he is a regular member, or in lieu of the latter actual teaching in the grades under direct supervision. All observation and practice lessons should be carefully planned, reviewed and discussed. The teachers giving the lessons should meet subse - quently with the observers in order to aid in the study of the aim and various facts of the lesson. The pedagogical instruction should be given in cl;i i ially organized for that object, membership being restricted to those hav - ing serious purposes of fitting themselves for teaching in the grades and country schools. In order to give clearer direction to the work different members of the committee were asked to make brief sug - gestive outlines of different phases of the work. Dr. W. A. Clark outlining Course 1, on Theory and Principles; Professor W. R. Hart, Course 2 on Methods and Management; and Professor W. R. Jack - son the course on observation lessons. The outlines are intended only to be suggestive and must be enlarged and filled in by the teacher. Dr. Clark has outlined only the last half of Course 1. It should be pre - ceded by the first 133 pages of White's, The Art of Teaching; or some other good book as Roark's Method in Education; Page's Theory and Practice of Teaching; Parker's Talks on Teaching; DeGarmo's Es - sentials of Method; Hinsdale's The Art of Study; McMurry's The Method of the Recitation; Arnold's Waymarks for Teachers; Put - nam's Manual of Pedagogics, etc. The committee is of the opinion that the pedagogical work herein outlined should cover at least five recitations per week for one half year, or preferably Course 1 two hours' per week the first semester. id </seg>

The process of teaching an individual how to teach is far more difficult than the ordinary process of instruction and requires scien - tific as well as experiential knowledge. To assign this work to a tyro means to invite failure from the beginning. The teachers of this subject should have had actual experience in the fields in which these pupil teachers are preparing to enter and should have supple - mented their :'ial knowledge by scientific study of the sub - jects they are to teach. Anything short of this should be discouraged by everyone h in the advancement of education. It is not intended that this course of professional study should be accepted in any sense of permanency. It has seemed to the com - mittee the best for t li • but it should be modified as time and conditions show need of chai There should be a teacher's library in every high school offering this normal instruction of not less than twenty books such as: Talks on Pedagogics, F. \V.

The subordinate points in the outline are suggestive only. They are not intended to restrict the teacher, nor is it intended that all sub-topics should be exhausted. The lesson ti - tles, however, are considered sufficiently vital in their aim as to be deemed a fair working basis for those having charge of this work, to approach a desirable uniformity in the amount and kind of work given in different schools. The order in which the lessons are taken up is a matter for each teacher to settle. The following suggestion is offered: So far as possible a good arrangement would be to study the lesson in Method in connection with the Common Branch which is being reviewed, or which the class has an opportunity of observing in the grades. The lessons in management should be grouped if possible. The lesson on the Teacher should come late in the course, COURSE 3. Observation Lessons. OUTLINE FOR DISCUSSION. The following outline is used in the discussion of each lesson taught. It is to be worked out in a series of preliminary discussions before any lesson is presented. As great stress is placed on the discus - sion as on the lesson itself, the lesson may take twenty minutes and at first the discussion may take three periods of forty-five minutes. Without discussion, the lesson is of very little value. These lessons are merely suggestive and are not to be slavishly followed. The teacher must have had special training and must have originality or the work will be a farce. </seg>

            <seg id="p172">normal training in iikjh schools. Paper read by R. H. Graham, of the Wymore city schools at the Southeastern Nebraska Educational Association ;it Beatrice, April, 1906. The superiority of the modern Normal schools over those founded In early times, or other educational institutions for the instruction and training of teachers, must rest after a reasonable degree of scholar - ship upon the practice or training school idea. Eliminate this feature and you may have a school or college of pedagogy, but not a teachers' normal school. We would repeat that preceding the normal training of all must be a requirement for a reasonable scholar - ship on the part of those under the tuition of normal schools. After a brief in &gt;n of the courses of study in those institutions which issue two rmits in Nebraska, we would suggest that this re - quirement for scholarship had better be increased than remain at the present maximum requirement. Only a few years experience in the position of superintendent or principal, in one with the fact that scholarship on the part of teachers covers a multitude of weak poii Our Peru State Normal does not admit pupils to the training or practice year until they have had two or more years work in a good high school. This means that the candidate must have pursued studies covering at least fifteen points credit found in the average high school. In addition to these fifteen points credit, the pupils are given a review in eight of the common branches, but the work in four of thesa eight studies, is credited by the University and Colleges of Nebraska when pursued in high schools. This makes a maximum amount of thirteen points credit outside of the common brand i for granting a two year permit to teach, or a sum total of not to exceed eighteen high school credits. In addition to this, the above mentioned school requires five hours ra work per week in the observation and training school for thim-six weeks. It is to !&gt;.■ noted that the stu - dent teachers at this tion have for preparation sixteen lessons per week, and twenty-one hou which is practice or observation work. One of the sectarian colleges of Nebraska requires eleven points of high school work, and four additional points, two in botany and two in physics, being optional, and reviews in six of the common branches for a two | two year permits on a mininn;m of twelve joints of high s( liool work, and </seg>
            <seg id="p173">NORMAL TRAINING IN HKiH SCHOOLS 155 the above mentioned reviews, together with practice teaching and criti - cism five hours a week for thirty-six weeks. Students in this course have eighteen hours preparation per week. It is to be noted that pu - pils completing the common school course from the eighth grade can enter this course; a more lenient requirement than is offered at the Peru State Normal. In two of the private normals of Nebraska, pupils from the eighth grade may enter what they call their "Two Year State Certificate Course. ' In these two year courses, one gives twelve and the other thirteen points that are the equivalent of high school credits recog - nized by higher institutions. In addition they give agriculture and reviews in eight of the common branches. The reviews in mental and written arithmetic are repeated for two terms. In one of these normals, pupils are permitted to carry twenty-seven hours per week besides two hours per week in physical culture. This brief review of the courses of study in those institutions issuing two-year certificates reveals the fact that these two year per - mits, up to the present year at least, are based on scholarship ranging from two to three years' work in accredited high schools of Nebraska. None of these institutions require practice teaching and criticism to 1 five hours per. week for thirty-six weeks. Please remember that reference to the scholarship obtained has to do with the two year permits or certificates, and not life certificates. Can the four year high schools throughout the state meet the above requirements, first in scholarship? And if they can meet the re - quirements, do conditions throughout the state justify a course in Normal Training in those institutions having a full four years high school course? As previously stated the scholarshp of a teacher will in many emergencies cover a multitude of weaknesses. Mind, matter and me.aod are factors with which educational thought has to do; yet method without a mind well trained in systematizing and differentiating the matter at its command is like a ship without a rudder. So the query, can our four year high school graduates with from twenty-five to forty per cent more scholarship than those meeting the requirements for a two year certificate, and then with from eighteen to thirty-six weeks study in methods, as well as practice teaching given by experienced and well-qualified high school teachers as required by the new law going into effect in 1907 — can our graduates with this scholarship and train - ing, on writing the examination — be granted a certificate to teach in our rural schools? The recommendation made by our State Superintendent in con - junction with a committee appointed by him, was certainly conserva - tive in limiting Normal Training to those schools carrying a full four years course, and employing three regular teachers or instructors besides the Superintendent. By inquiry, it is ascertained that these four year schools graduate pupils on a basis of from twenty-six to </seg>

Now with five hours | devoted to a study of methods in the various branches as they are reviewed, and observation work in the grade departments and some practice teaching, we venture the assertion that these graduates will be equal in equipment to those hold - ing two year permits. Remember that with equal or better scholar - ship, the step toward high school Normal Training does not ask that such pupils be given a two year permit, or be exempt from examination, but that on evidence of a minimum amount of professional work being completed, the plan proposed does ask that these student teachers be allowed to take an examination, and let the results of that examination be the best evidence of their fitness to teach. The question has been raised that the time required to do this professional work will not permit the completion of as many Universi - ty credits as has been mentioned above and as is now completed by the average four year high school. This may be true of those taking Nor - mal Training, but it need not be true of those who contemplate enter - ing a college or uni\- Those not desiring to teach need not take the Normal Training, but can continue the regular college accred - ited course. It can be said with equal emphasis, that those who cannot take up a regular college course and whose school life must end on their high school graduation, that they can take up Normal Training, or su :en hours work per week of this training instead of those subjects that especially prepare for college, and in the end are infi - nitely better prepared to teach than if they had adhered strictly to the college accredited course. And in the event of substituting Nor - mal Training to the extent of ten hours per week in their senior year, these student teachers will lose not to exceed four college credits, and their work in the History of Education, elementary Mental Science, and a study of methods, will largely compensate for the omission of Vergil, Chemistry, or some other subject that prepares for college en - trance only. So the "stock-in-trade" argument that our high school course will be weakened in that we cannot as adequately prepare those desiring to enter college is not well taken. The plan will only help to enrich, broaden, and differentiate our courses of study to suit and meet the demands of individual students. It is time that our high schools were so differentiating their work that they may give some preparation to those who are compelled to earn a living on leaving their home school, as well as manifest solicitude for those who are financially able to enter college. If a high school devotes one-eighth of its efforts only, to a utilitarian purpose, and that by training pupils to teach, it is by no means a sign of deterioration in ideals or standards. The spirit of the new law requiring that all candidates to teach, have a minimum amount of Professional Training, is to raise the standard of teachers' qualifications in the rural schools. The plan of permitting the high schools of a certain standard, to do this work, </seg>
            <seg id="p175">157 NORMAL TRAINING IN HU;H SCHOOLS will assist in bringing about the desired result. In as much as Normal Training is limited to those pupils of the twelfth grade, none but grad - uates will go directly from the high schools to teach. In previous years, pupils have discontinued their work in the tenth and eleventh grades, have obtained a third grade, and in many instances a second grade certificate to begin teaching. According to the recommendation of the committee none but those in the graduating year of a four year high school course shall r &lt;lit for Normal Training. By a circular letter to County Su|.erintendents in middle and ern Nebraska, it was ascertained that four-fifths of the rural teachers enter their work of teaching on graduation from some one of the town schools of their county. And of these four-fifths, many are gradu - ates from a three year, and some from a two year high school course. It is this condition that the new law seeks to remedy. By its pro - visions eight weeks Normal training is necessary to obtain a second grade certificate, and twelve weeks is the requirement for a first grade certificate. But Normal trainin- icted to four year high schools, and only the graduates of these are given credit for the professional work done. So unless pupils from a three year course of study or less attend some one of the Normals for the minimum time mentioned above, they will be excluded from entering the work of teaching. Thus the proposed plan will in a measure meet the demand for better trained teachers in our rural schools. At the same time it will tend to hold in school until they graduate, those who never expect to do any more than meet the minimum requirements. One question asked in a circular letter to city superintendents was, do you consider the opportunities for observation work as good in your grade departments as in a Normal School. Of the fifteen an - swering, all were of the opinion that the opportunities for observing organization and discipline were much better in a real school than in a practice school. One superintendent gave the following reasons: because the student teachers i ill the grades at work; con - ditions are normal as they are those of a real and not an ideal school; the pupils do not know that they are being inspected; the teachers know the student teachers and can give them many valuable sugges - tions on organization and discipline. </seg>
            <seg id="p176">THE STATUS OF NORMAL TRAINING IN HIGH 8CHOO1 Paper read before the Nebraska Schoolmasters' Club at Its meet - ing in Oi 1906, by Prof. J. W. Searson, Peru State Normal. In i k normal training in the secondary schools, I have discussed the subject as excluding the work of city training schools, the work of the normal school and teachers' college, and that of the pedagogical departments of our great universities; and as including such professional training of teachers as is offered in the regular courses of study in public secondary schools. For convenience, the topic is developed under related headings as follows: 1. A biief summary of the development of the normal idea as applied to education. 2. The function and aims of normal training. rmal training in the high schools of the different states. 4. The attitude of leading educators toward normal training in secondary sch&lt; 5. Summary and conclusions. The normal idea is as old as the teaching spirit. The schools of Philosophy in Greece, the Hebrew schools of the prophets, and the ecclesiastical and -rhools of the early church are the re - mote anteced- r the training of teachers. Side by side with the ecclesiastical schools sprang up the great Mediaeval univer - sities offering practical training in three different lines — law, med - icine, and theology. The aspiring young advocate was trained to expound the law. The student of medicine was fitted to practice his art. The theological student was especially prepared to teach men the dogmas of his creed. In the field of theology, the Mediaeval universities turned out teachers well trained for their special work. From that day to this, every theological school has been an institution &lt;i which men have been trained to teach. When the Holy Church be - -came the patron of elementary education, she was compelled to train her teachers to teach children on exactly the same theory as that upon which she trained her ministry to teach adults. Thus the normal school is the lineal descendant of the Mediaeval theological seminary. A further evolution of the training of teachers is shown in the schools of the Jesuits, an order founded by Ignatius Loyola in 15J4. That the Jesuits were the real founders of teachers' training schools </seg>
            <seg id="p177">NORMAL TRAINING IN HIGH 159 is not now disputed. Part IV. of their extensive ten-part constitution formed the basis of the "Ratio Studiorum," or pedagogical system, which comprised among other departments, a series of well-organized training schools for teachers, or "Nurseries" as they term them, to insure the perpetuation of their system of instruction. The "Provin - cial," or monastic superior of the province, was compelled, in the se - lection of to "take heed to those who seem to be best fitted for the place," and to procure from among the most promising students "as many life-long teachers as possible," exhorting those espti fitted to form a ' 'Nursery' for the preparation of teachers, undc; direction of trained professors. Meanwhile Luther was laying the foundations for a better s of pedagogical instruction in Germany. The labors of Luther to im - prove methods of instruction were continued by Trotzendorf, Sturm, and Neander, whose schools were all normal schools in the original acceptation of that term — pattern or model schools. These schools for better methods of instruction sprang up throughout the various Ger - man states. In 1681, the celebrated Abbe de la Salle, catching the true Jesuit spirit, established a theological teachers' training school at Rheims, France. His efforts bore prolific fruit in the Schools of the Christian Brothers, to-day the most progressive of the schools of the Holy Church. A little later, the pattern or model school idea of Germany was given new meaning when Herman Franke appeared to breathe a new spirit into the German system. With the foundation of the Orphan House at Halle, in 1696, and the schools connected with it, arose the necessity for trained teachers. To meet this need, Franke, in 1697, founded a teachers' class "by providing a table or free board for such poor students as stood in need of assistance, and selecting, a few years later, out of the whole number, twelve who exhibited the right basis of piety, knowledge, skill and desire for teaching," and con - stituting them his "Seminarium Praeceptorum." In return for this gratuitous training, these pupil-teachers bound themselves to teach for three years in the schools of the Orphan House after completing their course. This was the first regularly organized exclusive teach - ers' seminary In Europe. From all parts of Europe, students flocked to Halle to catch the inspiration of Franke's spirit. Back to all parts of Europe was carried the idea of the teachers' seminary. Hecker, a pupil of Franke, founded the first seminary for primary teachers in Prussia in 1735. Thirteen years later, he established a similar school in Berlin. The graduates of this school were considered so far superior to untrained teachers that Frederick the Great enjoined by special ordinance that no others should be employed on the crown lands of the kingdom. What the Jesuits had done for the training of superior teachers, the teachers' seminary accomplished for the better - ment of elementary instruction. Rousseau in France, Locke in Eng - land, Pestalozzi in Switzerland and Germany, Felbiger in Austria, </seg>
            <seg id="p178">160 and Kindermann in Bohemia are among the great missionaries who pted and glorified the seminary idea. The teachers' seminary for the elementary schools was not long divorced from the pattern or model school. Both had sprung into existence from the same impulse. The normal schools of both France and Germany combined judiciously the seminary and pattern school idea, thus offering the study of a definite body of pedagogical thought in the academic courses, aid an opportunity to illustrate, test, and originate theories of education in the "pattern" school, which thus rue the correlating center of the normal school. The modern normal school with its collegiate department constructed about the model, or practice school, is the finished product of long, steady devel - opment. The effort for improved training of children in Europe was based on the conviction that, "As the teacher is, so is the school," and the American colonist, thoroughly impregnated with European ideas, early sought to improve school conditions by providing for better trained teachers. Harvard College began as a theological seminary the object of which was to provide the church a trained ministry. Other colleges, academies and seminaries sprang up under church control. The logic by which men were trained for the ministry led the more progressive spirits to consider the needs of trained teachers. Far-sighted leaders advocated the establishment of schools wherein teachers might be trained for their work. In 1749, the University of Pennsylvania had its beginning in an academy established in the city of Philadelphia with Benjamin Franklin as one of its founders. Although this academy was designed partly as a school for teachers, it is apparent that Franklin never dreamed of professionally trained teachers. Both private and public schools generally attempted to draw students by announcing that their graduates were especially fitted to teach school. The primary effort was to make scholars who might or might not afterwards become teachers; but for the most part there is no intimation that more than scholarship was needed. The Rev. James C. Carter of Massachusetts, a graduate of Harvard College, did more than any other one man toward the estab - lishment of permanent normal schools in America. He memorialized the Massachusetts legislature to provide a seminary for the education of teachers. The committee to which this memorial was referred re - ported favorably on the measure. "Our schools" said they, "are not what they ought to be. The cause of failure is the incompetence of teachers. To have competent teachers, we must instruct them in the business of their profession." The logic seemed irresistible, but neither the logic nor the eloquence of the committee prevailed with the leg - islature. The recommendation of the committee was lost by a major - ity of one, but the professional need remained. Carter was voted down, but he had not failed. Rev. Charles Brooks, of Medford, returned from a European trip </seg>

On June - te Board of Education was organized with Horace Mann as secretary. The year following, upon the recommenda - tion of the board, the far-famed Massat ' ornial Bill was passed, and under its provisions, the first permanent state normal school in America was established at Lexington, inl839, just twenty-seven years before the first state normal was established in Nebraska. Two other state schools were soon organized, and these schools, regarded first as doubtful experiments, soon became recognized as a i: part of the system of public instruction. The opening of the first normal school in Massachusetts quickened the movement in other states. New York, Connecticut, Michigan, and Pennsylvania followed. Scarcely however was the new movement for state normal schools born when aggressive opposition appeared. With - in less than a year after the first school was established, the house of representatives of usetts directed its committee on education to consider the expediency of abolishing the board of education and the state normal schools. The religious press assaulted the Infant; thirty - one Boston schoolmasters openly denied its right to live; and the quiet, conservative influence of Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth, and Brown gave the aggressors hope. The arguments of the committee are worthy of more than a passing notice inasmuch as they contain the germ of all that has since been said in opposition to the normal movement. 1. Normal schools are imitations from France and Prussia, po- litical rather than educational in influence. 2. Academies and high schools are fully adequate to furnish competent supply of teachers. 3. There is no need of professional instruction. "Every person who has himself undergone a process of instruction must acquire by that very process the art of instructing others." ii </seg>

The normal school idea is not an exotic growth. inherent in any complete system of education. "A normal school is a school established for the academic and professional preparation of teachers. It is a technical school, differing from academies, col - lege* and uni in its objects and methods of work. The ob - of the academy and college are general culture and the acquis - ition of knowledge; the object of the normal school is to impart cul - ture, ne, skill, and learning to its students for the specific techi.. ose of fitting them to teach others." The university is a gold mine in which its pi are at work far down in the depths to the heart of the world's truth. The normal school is a mint preparing the nuggets to paaa current among men. Both institutions must exist without conflicting claims, for ench has its own peculiar function to i&gt;erform. It is interesting to i the same arguments orth for the establishment of the first state normal schools are now used in these days in support of a teachers' training course in high schools. Professional training for teachers, which shall reach every rural and graded school in the land is still recognized as a vital means of, improving our system of elementary education. We can - not get far away from the Prussian theory, "As the teacher is, so is ihool," and the utilization of our secondary schools in providing training for rural teachers is one of the results of the professional re - awakening. In order to ascertain the extent to which normal training is done in our secondary schools, the following questions were sent to the heads of the st; ma of education in the various states: </seg>
            <seg id="p181">NORMAL TRAINING IN HICH SCHOOLS 163 1. To what extent is normal training work done in the secondary schools of your state? How many high schools are doing such work? 2. What were the conditions which led to the introduction of such work into your secondary schools? When introduced by lav 3. To what extent is the work accomplishing the desired end? 4. What difficulties have arisen in carrying on this work? 5. What objections h; io high schools doing this work? Forty states and the District of Columbia replied to the communi - cation. Number of states giving normal training in high schools a legal status, six. Number not giving this work a legal 'hirty-four. Vermont, Michigan, Minnesota. Kansas, New York, and Nebraska authorize normal training in connection with their secondary schools. The only way to form an adequate idea of normal training in secondary schools is to study the conditions in the states authorizing this or kindred work. The statutes of Vermont provide that a graduate of an academy, seminary or high school in a four-year course, following an elementary course of nine years, having included at least thirty weeks of daily study and recitation in the principles and methods of education, may receive, after successfully passing an examination on the educa - tional course, a certificate of the second grade. This certificate en - titles him to teach two years in the public schools without further examination, and is granted upon the presentation of both a certifi - cate of graduation and a certificate of completion of the educational course. Requiring students to complete both the educational course and the high school course at the same time has naturally confined the educational work to the stronger students of the class. State Superintendent Mason S. Stone gives the purpose and workings of the law as follows: "In 1X96 provision was made for the introduction of the study of education into secondary schools. The purpose of this was to stimulate our normal schools to greater activities in certain lines. The purpose of the law has been served and there is not the demand for its provisions that there was ten years ago. Consequently the number of schools that adopted the provision has been lessening. Previously, there were approximately twenty schools that accepted the provisions of the law, probably to-day there are not more than ten. The difficulties arising under the law are chiefly the lack of ad - equate teaching force and the lack of competent instructors in the work; and of adequate time for pupils preparing for teaching." The output of teachers reported under this law in 1904 was seventy - nine. </seg>
            <seg id="p182">164 STAT I INDEN1 - In Michigan, no normal work is done in the high schools proper. In 1903 a law was enacted providing for a system of county training classes. The expense of the county normal training classes is borne ate. The training class is a department of the school where located, but is separate and distinct in management, having its own rs and pursuing its own policy under the direction of the county normal board.

Applicants for admission to these courses must be at h is of age, intention to teach in the public schools, possess good moral character, and in addition must have completed at le;ist ten grades of work in a graded school, or held a second grade certificate, or paaaed a second grade examination, or had at least two years of ssful experience in teaching.

In Minnesota thiB work takes the form of special instruction in the common branches in the state high schools.

The superin - tendent may, at his discretion, enroll mature students of the high school or experienced county teachers recommended by the county superintendent. Instruction is required by law in reading, writing, literature, geography, arithmetic, English grammar, American his - tory, and civil government. This law was enacted in 1895 and was brought about largely through the influence of county superintendents who felt the lack of training for rural school teachers. At present twelve high schools are qualified under the law. State Superintendent Olsen says: "In a few places the results are gratifying. On the whole, it has been a disappointment. County teachers have not availed them - selves of the privilege of attending these classes. The attendance has been small. It has been difficult to get trained teachers to take charge </seg>

No study of methods or theory of educa - tion is authorized, and Superintendent Olsen urges that students should distinctly understand that this department is not designed to take the place of a professional school. In the state of Kansas, professional work was introduced into the county high schools as early ;■ The Kansas law provides for a four year normal course in every county high school in the state The students in this course are not isolated from the students in other courses, and the work is carried on under the regular high school in - structors. The normal course is designed for those who intend to teach or for those who expect to enter the first year of professional work in the State Normal School. Students in the last year of the course may be employed in practice work with the pupils of the first year; and model scl. In 1904 there were sixteen high schools doing the work. State Superintendent Dayhoff says: "No objections have arisen so far. A better grade of scholarship for rural teachers has resulted. Lack of funds has been the chief difficulty in carrying on the work." Upon graduation from this course, the student ret • ond grade certificate good for two years without examination, a c rtificate ranking with the elementary certificate of the State Normal School. The New York system of teachers' training classes has attracted wide-spread attention and has been the inspiration for most of the Normal training work done in connection with the secondary schools of the country. Four years before the state of Massachusetts estab - lished hi normal schools, the state of New York established departments of instruction for common school teachers in eight acad - cmit's, one in uitoiial disti i h academy thus designated &lt;'d $500.00 for the purchase of books and apparatus, and an an - nual appropriation of $400.00.

To get an estimate of this work in wider per- from the larger experience of some of America's leading educators, letters were solicited from Professors of Pedagogy, Presidents of State Normals, Superintendents of Public Instruction in metropolitan cities, and Col - lege n answer to the question, "To what extent should normal training work be done in secondary schools?" A few typical extracts from these letters will be of interest. The professors of peda - gogy speak with no uncertain ring. Prof. Paul H. Hanus of Harvard University says: "If normal training is given in a high school, it must displace some of the pupil's general training, to his great loss. To give normal training in high schools seems to me, therefore, at best, only a makeshift; and at thp worst, it is quite ineffective and a per - version of valuable opportunities." Dr. Julius Sachs, Head of the De - partment of Secondary Education of the Teachers' College, Columbia University, replies: "I should consider it desirable to separate com- pletely normal training from the secondary school. * • * It is my conviction that even an elementary teacher ought at least to have com- pleted the secondary school before undertaking training as a teacher." A few representative answers from city superintendents: Supt. C. If.

Had letters been solicited from thoW who have to employ teachers in the rural schools, the results would doubtl. been far different. Summing up the results of the work in the states where it has been carried on, we find in New York after seventy-two years. 102 high schools turning out annually about 1,200 trained teachers: in Vermont after ten years, an annual output of less than eighty in ten high schools; in Minnesota after eleven years, twelve high schools turning out annually about ninety teachers; in Kansas after seventeen years, sixteen high schools with an output of nearly 500; in Michigan after three years, twenty-five high schools turning out about 400 teachers. Viewing the question from both a local and a general view-point, the following general observations seem admissible, at least for pur - poses of discussion: 1. The movement to establish normal training in high schools cor part of a larger movement for the professional training of teachers. 2. T'nless wisely directed, lowered standards of normal train - ing will result. From the view-point of the city superin - tendent, this movement, improperly directed, may increase the difficulty of maintaining a teaching corps of high standard.

            <seg id="p191">NORMAL TRAINING IN NEW YORK IIKill SCHOOLS. Address delivered before the superintendents of Michigan at their annual meeting in 1901 by Frank H. Wood, M. A., supervisor of this department of work for the State of New York: The cardinal duties of the state in education are three in number: To insure efficient teaching, to provide free schools and to make at - tendance compulsory. Efficient teaching is the key to the situation. Without it free schools and compulsory attendance avail little. An important lesson lies concealed in Garfield's definition of a college — "A log with Mark Hopkins on one end and a student on the other." These fundamental principles were early recognized by the far-sighted statesmen of Xew York. In this connection I must make special men - tion of the name of DeWitt Clinton, for ten years governor of the state, a noble specimen of vigorous, sturdy manhood, brilliant, broad-minded and aggressive, quick in intellectual perception, keen of penetration and unerring in judgment. In 1819 he said: "Ignorant and vicious preceptors and injudicious and ill-arranged systems of education must have a pernicious influence upon the habits, manners, morals and minds of our youth, and vitiate their conduct through life. Liberal encour - agement ought to be dispensed for increasing the number of compe - tent teachers." The drift of public sentiment from the outset seemed to favor the utilization of existing institutions of secondary Instruction, the old - line academies as they have latterly been termed. In fact these insti - tutions had already proved the principal agency in providing teachers for the common schools and had done pioneer work in training teach - ers without state aid. Some on their own initiative had been offering special subjects for teachers in their courses of study. The academ - ies have therefore been fittingly termed the nurseries of the teachers' training classes. Necessitating no outlay for special buildings they could do the work with least delay and expense. Favorably located in different sections of the state they could most conveniently meet the local needs. The first legislative act tending to further this idea was passed in 1827 and provided permanent funds "for annual appropriations to common schools, to increase the literature fund and to provide for the education of teachers." The increased appropriation resulting from this act strengthened the academies and was thus indirectly a help in training teachers; but the first direct act of the legislature to </seg>

During this period of sixty-eight years financial aid from the state has been continued uninterruptedly save for I &gt;f five years immediately following the establishment of the first normal school at Albany in 1844. It would be instructive to trace the growth and development of this branch of professional training; to note the difficulties which from time to time were met and the remedies which were applied; to examine the course of study and the frequent changes and modifica - tions that were made: to observe the different methods adopted for conferring financial aid; and to consider the qualifications prescribed from time to time for membership and the conditions which led to the abolishment of all qualifications for a period of thirty-two years. This is ), iside from our purpose here. It is the training class as now organized and conducted to which we must give our undivided attention. to organization: The training classes are under the unrestricted jurisdiction of the Department of Public Instruction and : as distinct departments of the high schools or union schoolB with which they are connected.

Certain specific requirements are at present prescribed in the regulatioi : by the iperintendent as a prerequisite for appointment, among them the following: The institution must fur - nish as instructor or instructors a college graduate or a normal grad - uate with thn experience in teaching since graduation, or the holder of a state certificate. All instructors must be approved by the superintendent the - hers employed in the normal schools of the state, and a minimum salary of $500 must be paid. The institution must also furnish a suitable room or apartment sep - arate from all other departments of the school, in which the training members shall be seated; it must provide opportunity for mem - of the class to observe methods of teaching in the several grades of common school work and to teach in such grades under proper criticism and direction; it must conduct the prescribed recitations in the subjects belonging to the training class course, separately from all other recitations: and it must maintain a Jegal class, that is, a class of not less than ten nor more than twenty-five members, for at least thirty-six weeks in the j The school year is divided into two terms of not less than eight - een nor more than twenty weeks each. New classes are organized in mber only, but candidates may be admitted at the beginning of the second term providing they intend to remain in the class an entire year. Four periods of thirty-five minutes each every school day must be occupied with instruction on the topics as prescribed in the course of study. Adequate time must also be given the instructor for the proper supervision of the observation and practice work. In addition to the recitation work prescribed members may by special permission enroll in one or more high school classes, but this is rarely found prac - ticable save where a student proves weak in some subject of the course and needs to take supplementary instruction in it, or where in case of failure to complete the course in the allotted time a student is re - quired to take an additional term in the class and has time and ability to pursue new work. The qualifications for admission are as follows: Candidates must be at least seventeen years of age at the time of entrance; they must subscribe In good faith to the following declaration: "We, the sub - scribers, hereby declare that our object in asking admission to the training class is to prepare ourselves for teaching, and that it is our purpose to engage in teaching in the public schools of the State of New York at the completion of such preparation. We pledge our - selves to remain in the class during the year unless prevented by illness or excused by the superintendent of public Instruction." Can - didates must hold as a minimum qualification one of the following credentials: A second or a third grade certificate; or a standing of </seg>
            <seg id="p194">176 &gt; at least seventy per cent in the following subjects, attained in a uni - form examination for grade certificates: arithmetic, composition, geog - raphy, grammar, penmanship, physiology and hygiene, American his - tory and civil government; or a regents preliminary certificate and fourteen academic counts, four of which shall be in English, two in American history, two in civil government, two in physiology and the other four optional. The regents' preliminary certificate includes the eleni' and fourteen academic counts is regarded as equivalent to somewhat more than a year of high school work. All of these credentials for admission are secured upon examination given by either one or the other of the two educational departments of the state. As may be inferred from the scholastic qualifications, member - ship is made up from two general classes: First, high school students, composing upwards of three-fourths of the aggregate, and second, 1 the need of special training in order to secure a higher form of license. As but one third and one second grade cer - tificate is allowed a U ntly is a choice between drop - ping out permanently from the teaching ranks or taking a special se of training. And, in this connection, permit me to say that it is the polity of our state superintendent, through the uniform exam - ination system, to create a healthful scarcity of second and third grade thereby rendering a course of study in a training class or in a normal school more and more a necessity. The following is the course of study prescribed, for the comple - tion of which the minimum time of one year is required: First term, first period, arithmetic; second period, psychology and principles of education, school management and art of questioning; third per - iod, history of education, American history; fourth period, drawing and general review. Second term, first period, language, composition and grammar; second period, geography, physiology and hygiene; third period, reading, civil government; fourth period, school law and general review. Penmanship and spelling receive attention in connec - tion with the other work of the course, also general lessons in nature study. The work in all subjects of this course, save the purely pro - fessional ones, includes subject matter, underlying principles and meth - ods of teaching. In reviewing them as subject matter it is the spe - cial aim to take them up from the standpoint of the teacher, rather than of the student; to approach them from the science side instead of the art side. The syllabus which is provided in the various subjects of the course is broad in character and calculated to serve as a general guide. In order that the teachers may become familiar with the best works on professional subjects, numerous topical references are made to various authors and texts. This also serves to indicate the scope of the required work. Included as an indispensable part of the course is the observation </seg>
            <seg id="p195">NORMAL TRAINING IN HIGH SCHOOLS 177 and practice work. Each member is expected to devote at least seventy-five periods to observation, witnessing the practical work of pupils brought from other parts of the school to receive a model les - son from the critic teacher, and also of pupils in recitations under their regular grade teachers. In visiting other departments it is or - dinarily as individuals rather than as a class, and a program of visi - tation is usually prepared sometime in advance, thus giving due and timely notice to the students who are to observe and to the teachers whose work is to be observed. Reports of the results of observation are commonly required, sometimes oral, sometimes written; oc - casionally general in character but usually along some special line suggested by questions under discussion in class, as indicated on the program. The practice work consists of two parts or steps — the preliminary or preparatory practice and the formal, consecutive practice. It is quite common at the outset to begin this phase of the work by having the members practice on each other, which if properly conducted re - sults in much good, as they thus form a general notion of what it means to conduct a recitation and do it without victimizing any but themselves. They are then in position intelligently to take charge of small model classes brought from the grades and later in the term of larger classes. Soon after the opening of the second term consecutive practice is in order. For this purpose each student is assigned to a regular school class. Before assuming management he observes for some days the work of the teacher in charge and is then in position to proceed to assign lessons and conduct recitations in the subject con - secutively under the immediate supervision of the grade teacher and the general supervision of the training class instructor and the prin - cipal of the school. Having had a sufficient amount of this practice he is prepared to act as substitute teacher when occasion arises. Owing to local conditions the amount and character of the practice work is of necessity subject to quite a degree of variation. The im - portance of it is, however, clearly recognized and increased attention is given it each year. Inefficiency in it is regarded as a sufficient reason for the discontinuance of an appointment. At the close of each semester an examination is submitted by the state superintendent in all subjects included in the course of study. The question papers are prepared as follows: Each of the four state inspectors is assigned certain subjects in which he is to prepare ques - tions to be presented to the training class board for acceptance, mod - ification or rejection. The training class board consists of the super - visor of training classes and the four inspectors. An objection by the supervisor or by two inspectors is sufficient to reject a question. After a sufficient number of questions are accepted they are copied and then carefully read by each member of the board, who indicates any fur - ther objections that he may discover and then endorses the paper with his signature. The questions are again copied and presented to the state superintendent for his acceptance. They are then ready for print- 12 </seg>

Regular attendance upon high school, normal school or college receh 111 in the renewal of these certificates as though the time wen I to actual work in teaching. Prior to the issuance of a training class certificate the principal or superintendent of schools must certify that the candidate has shown sufficient skill in teaching to warrant his receiving such tiflcate, that he is a person of good moral character, and worthy to be employed in the schools of the state. The three indispensable qualifications of a teacher are thus recognized and insisted upon — scholarship, teaching ability and moral character; or, as our late Dr. Sheldon, of the Oswego normal school put it — 'The scholar, the te and the man." Membership in a training imited to a period of two years, and the candidates are entitled to combine the standings earned in four nations. Tl ives the right to dismiss a member at any time for improper conduct or unsatisfac - tory work. From sixty-fix- 'nty per cent of the mem - bers on the average prove able to complete the course in the minimum time of one year. From five per cent to ten per cent need to take the full two years and a few prove unable to complete the course in that time. The various requirements to which I have alluded are minimum reqm hool may prescribe additional qualifications for admission to the class, add to the course of study, lengthen the min - imum till ibed for the course, and require a higher examina - tion standard than that prescribed. This is in keeping with the gen - eral policy of our state in education. As it insists upon free schools supported by general tax, and upon the education of all of the chil - dren, it is in duty bound to see that the taxpayer has value received for his money and that the children who are for the time being re - moved by law from parental care are placed under the charge and di - rection of teachers who are possessed of the requisite attainments. Properly to safeguard these interests therefore, there is established a definite uniform standard of proficiency which all candidates must reach before they can be licensed to teach in the public schools of the •tate. At the same time any locality is authorized to prescribe such additional qualifications as its more favored condition and environment may warrant- </seg>
            <seg id="p197">179 NORMAL 1 IN HKJH Three agencies are employed in supervision — examinations, visita tions by department inspectors and visitations by school commissioners The examinations have already been described as a final test of pro - ficiency. They are also an important means of supervision. It is the aim to make the questions suggestive and directive— teaching questions if you please as well as test questions. In the examination and rating of ai&gt; &gt;ers great care is exercised to make the answers a means of determining the character of instruction which a class has received. It is astonishing to note how clearly at times the answers of differen - show contrasts In teaching, reflect alike excellencies and defects. The examiners who are teachers of experience under permanent employment, are required to submit each day in written form a critical report of the papers ex - amined — school by school — class by class. The principal of the school is notified by official communication of any marked excellency or de - fect of his class or of its instruction as indicated by the answers The inspectors are required to devote at least two weeks at the end of each term to the examination of answer papers, for two reasons: First, to familiarize themselves with the general character of the work as evidenced by the examinations, and thus be able to reinforce or modify impressions gained regarding the general condition and status of the work from their previous visits of inspection and discover what special features need to receive increased attention. The second ob - ject is to afford them an opportunity to read the answers to their own questions, which is the best kind of training for future question making. Each. Inspector also studies with care the reports of the examiners on the work of the classes which he is assigned to visit during the ensuing term and makes notes thereon to use for their benefit. After the reports of the examiners are all in, a circular letter based on them is issued to the principals, training class instructors and school com - missioners, containing general criticisms and suggestions; also a table of results showing, subject by subject, the total number of papers submitted, the total number of papers accepted, the total number ninety per cent or above, the number below sixty per cent, and the per - centage of accepted papers. At least once every term each training class is visited by a state inspector who submits a written report of the class covering the fol - lowing points: membership, attendance, average age and appearance of members, credentials of admission, room and equipment, names and qualifications of instructors, charaeter of instruction both sub - ject matter and professional, and observation and practice work. School commissioners are expected to inspect every class under their jurisdiction as often as once each month during the term and submit a report similar to that required of inspectors. Commissioners have also other important duties to perform in connection with this vork. As Ion to know who are fitted and qualified to </seg>

As they are in close touch both with the schools and with the training classes they can accomplish much toward placing the best teachers in the most desirable positions, a most practicable and efficient way of building up the rural schools. Let us next consider the benefits that result to the institution con - ducting a training class. First, the financial side: Each school rom the state the following compensation: A fixed sum of per year; an added sum of $100 as teacher's quota; a pro rata allowance for each member in excess of ten, ranging from ten dol - lars to forty dollars — depending upon the annual appropriation of the legislature and the total excess. Warrants for payment are issued at the close of the second term but not until after the daily register of attendance and yearly report of work h. . received and ex - amined. Another benefit is the added rank, dignity and tone imparted to the school. This is not a theory but a condition, not a sentiment but an actuality. The influence of a training class properly conducted is felt in every department of the school with which it is connected. It makes progress a necessity; for when a teacher understands that his work is to be observed from day to day by wideawake, alert stu - dents, who are making a special study of the science and art of teach - ing, it is certain to put him on his mettle, to place him where he must grow and develop, where he must do his best work. It also arouses a professional spirit in the school, it begets a feeling of esprit de corps which makes itself felt throughout the school and throughout the community. Moreover the training class tends to make the school the educational center of the locality. The outlying schools to which it sends its graduates to teach naturally become feeders to the parent school. Many boys and girls are encouraged to enter the high school who under other conditions would be content with the opportunities offered by the district school. As the graduates are for the most part engaged in teaching in the immediate locality, an interesting and valuable feature is the oppor - tunity afforded the school to keep in touch with its graduates, to give them needed counsel and advice, and to help, aid and assist them in their work. In many schools much is accomplished through the me - dium of personal correspondence. Some schools hold annual associa - tion meetings of their graduate teachers. This idea is also sometimes furthered by issuing circular letters periodically, calling for definite information regarding important phases of the work, encouraging the reading of professional books by offering a loan list, and inviting a free interchange of thought on questions that trouble and perplex. While this phase of the work is of comparatively recent development it is accomplishing important results. It is, however, yet in a large measure a field full of promise to be cultivated. </seg>
            <seg id="p199">181 IAL TRAININli IN HH ;H .SCHOOLS The special mission of the training class is to provide the local schools that are not in position to engage normal graduates with teach - ers who are proficient in the common branches and have devoted at ■ year to special preparation — largely in professional work. The province of the normal school and the province of the training class are therefore clear and distinct. The two are supplementary agencies and are not to be regarded in any sense as rivals. Many training class graduates after teaching a few years are enabled to complete a course of study in a normal school, a step seemingly impossible before they gained foothold through the training class. The normal school can not supply the demand for teachers in the common district schools. Moreover, the normal school teacher is as a rule beyond their reach, for the assessed valuation of a large ma - jority of the districts is so low as to render the engagement of nor - mal graduates an impossibility. The training class is the only means of providing trained teachers for such schools. With the standard at present established for teachers' licenses the schools could not with - out it be provided with qualified teachers. The converse of this prop - osition is also true, namely, that the present standard of teachers' ■ (jull not be maintained without the training class. The number annually graduating from the training clas. - nearly the same as the number graduating from our twelve normal schools, about 1,100 in each case. For the past five years each has shown an annual increase of 100. Nevertheless it is more difficult to supply the demand for teachers both in the rural schools and in the primary and grammar schools of the cities and villages than it was five years ago. In this connection it would, I think, be interesting to give a brief itical summary in evidence of the progress which has been made in our state during the past seven years toward making teaching a profession in fact as well as in name. Preliminary to this it will be to explain two matters that have material bearing on the question When training classes were first established there were no pub - lic high schools or free academies as at present. Being connected r'ore with private institutions they were placed under the super - vision of the regents of the university. Gradually however the old - line academies had either been absorbed or superseded by public high schools and academic departments of union schools until latterly the public schools were very largely assuming the management and in - struction of training i Moreover, the regents could not grant i) teach; had no jurisdiction over the elementary schools, and only certain supervisory privilt - 'he public high schools. Hence in 188», after an existence of fifty-five years, the training classes were by common consent transferred from the board of regents to the de - partment of public instruction. For obvious reasons the instruction prior to this date had been </seg>
            <seg id="p200">182 confined mostly to preparation for examination in subject matter. All members desiring to teach except such as might have had previous ex - were required to enter the commissioner's examination for a third grade certificate, which was restricted entirely to subject matter work. As the standard for admission was at no time high it naturally followed that the time was very largely devoted to scholastic prepar - ation. Though important changes were made in 1890 It remained for our present honor* superintendent, Charles R. Skinner, on assuming office it, to reorganize the work throughout and to make it strictly an agency for the professional training of teachers. The other matter referred to is the law enacted by our state leg - islature known as chapter 1031 of the laws of I nder its pro - visions in mployed or Iicens ,ch In the primary and grammar schools of any city who has not had successful exper - ience in for at least three years, or in lieu thereof has not leted a tl ourse in and graduated from a high school or academy having a course of study of not less than three years ap - perintendent of Dublic instruction, or from some institution of learning of equal or higher rank, approved by the same authority, and who subsequently to duation, has not graduated from a school or class for the professional training of teachers, hav - ing a course of study of d&lt; an thirty-eight weeks, approved by ■■ndent of public instruction.

The fact that there Is this reserve power will in itself render its frequent employment unnecessary. Cen - tralization here is to be desired, not feared. Another condition essential to success is unity and harmony be - tween the different department interests — represented with us by the different bureaus.

            <seg id="p204">186 STATE 'KXI'I COMMISSIONER DRAPER'S OPINION. Normal training in high schools is no longer an experiment or a temporal in New York, where it has been tried for nearly three-quarters of a century. This is evidenced by the opinion of An - drew S. Draper, LL. D., commissioner of education for the state of New York, in his annual report for 1905. He says on this subject: "For a long time the state has maintained training classes for teachers in the high schools and academies. These were in charge of the Board of Regents until 1889, when by voluntary action of the Board and then by legists their management was transferred to the State Su - perintendent of Public Instruction. T isses are not intended to do the work of the normal schools. They are expected to provide limited instruction in pedagogical courses for beginners in such work who resi&lt;: lghborhood. It often happens that students who begin in these classes acquire an interest in the subjects in which they have been drilled to an extent which leads them to go to the normal schools or to pedagogical courses in the colleges and universities. There are over 100 of these training classes in the better academies and hi.ch schools in various parts of the state. They are distributed under ap - pointment by the ■ of Education, with sonif rci the ability of the schools to care for them and to the convenience of Intending students. The expense of these classes to the state is a little more than $100,000 annually. In the last year they instructed 2,921 stude: In his annual report for 1906 Commissioner Draper says of this work in the high schools of New York: "The most fruitful if not the most hopeful source of good teachers for the district schools is found n the training classes. It is confidently believed that this agency for providing rural schools will be ever increasing in its efficiency." </seg>
            <seg id="p205">XOKMAL TRAINING IN HIGH SCHOOLS 187 OPINIONS OF NEBRASKA EDUCATORS. I am in favor of the high schools doing this work in normal train- Ing. It is the only practical method of reaching a large portion of the rural school teachers. I think also tha' id is the proper thing. Twenty thousand dollars distributed among the high schools of the state will benefit four times as many students as when given to a sin - gle institution. We shall plan to take up this work. — A. G. Smith- In brief my argument for normal training would be: First, growth of school spirit and interest in educational affairs; second, need of a better teaching force; third, !&gt;■ fourth, the results as will be observed in a better citizenship. — James E. Delzell. My strongest argument for the plan is that most of the graduates teach before going into any other sort of work, and particularly before going to college or university — and tli part of them remain in the work. It would perhaps be the means of arousing an in 1 in teaching and of inducing more to remain in school until they had fitted thi i for the work. Such a scarcity of teachers as In this county this year leads one to feel that in a short time no one will care to teach in our smaller schools. — Flora B. Quick. "For the sake of the little child" let the strong high schools of Nebraska undertake this work for the magnificent educational tem of our state. I'nder present conditions many a bright young grad - uate enters upon the great trust of teaching poorly equipped in the branches which she is to teach, and with the work of the country school a sealed book to her. And the little child must reap the re - ward of her ignorance. Yet the majority of Nebraska schools are filled with just such teachers. Our school system is no stronger than the weakest school or the her. (ii\ &lt;e normal schools, junior normal schools, high school normal courses, until in Nebraska "no unskilled hand shall play upon the harp, for the tunes are left for - ever in the strings." — Alta B. Jones. I heartily indorse your plan for a teachers' course in high schools. A large number of our teachers come from the high schools direct and are generally poorly prepared for teaching on account of the course of study pursued.— A. V. Teed. Most emphatically your plan has my endorsement. But let us be careful now and not go too far. I think it would be a mistake to per - mit any high school to issue certificates, and I am opposed to allowing county superintendents or the state examining board to accept high school grades. — George Crocker. </seg>
            <seg id="p206">188 -'"PERIN'TK S REPORT I believe your plan can be made a success providing the require - ments can be rigidly enforced. Two years ago Prof. Fossler of the Hartington schools had a class among which were five or six young ladies who desired to teach. He talked with me relative to their prep - aration for the examination, but more particularly concerning the training they should have to enable them to fairly well organize and manage a country school. After some debate it was decided to provide a normal class covering two semesters. Most of the time was devoted to discussions of questions of school organization and school manage - ment. Almost every phase of the work of which a young teacher would feel the need was gone over and more or less definitely worked out. These young ladies secured schools and taught successfully. The im - provement was so marked in these beginners in contrast with other high school graduates attempting to teach without having received any training for the work, that I have since earnestly advocated the normal class in high schools where any considerable number of the graduates expected to become teachers. — A. E. Ward. A good part of the high school graduates teach, and we get our best I from the high school, as a rule. Their education is much more solid than that of the graduates of some other institutions. In my opinion the normal training you contemplate would greatly aid their efficient rles O. Stewart.

            <seg id="p207">IAL TKA1NING IN HIGH 189 I am much in favor of normal training in high schools. We have about six who teach to one who enters a higher school of learning. Why not fit our high school course for the six rather than for the one? Those who really want a higher education will find some means of get - ting it. As it is, normal branches are taught to mere boys and girls, that is, boys and girls below the high school. Let us have more of it in more mature years, for after all, it is the common branches that are used in all daily life. — E. H. Koch. In many of the counties of Nebraska the country schools take all the high school graduates as teachers at once. At present in many places the demand the supply. Say what we please about what ought to be, the fact still remains that the majority do not and many cannot go to a normal school before commencing their teaching. Then the logical plan for such training is in the high school as far as the resources of that school will allow. — H. E. Bradford. We would like to have our school recognized as one that is giving normal training to graduates. For the past ten years we have had a training course for all those graduates that have sought to become teachers. This training is not included in the four year high school course given in the schools here. The training here is comprised in the following: Each graduate wishing to teach in the Nebraska City schools must, before she is eligible to a position in the schools, do the following work under the direction of the superintendent — she must take at least one post graduate subject in the high school; she must spend the forenoon of each school day during the year in the ward schools — here she is under the personal supervision of the principal; she has to observe the work in the different grades, teach classes, make out programs, and give special attention to school government and class management. The persons taking this work have in addition to take psychology three times a week under the superintendent. Persons tak - ing this course are also required to do a certain amount of reading in the teachers' library. This, too, is done under the direction of the superintendent. We have a considerable number each year that take this work. If the above meets your views as to the training that the high schools should give, we should like to be placed on the list of schools giving work of this kind. — N. Sinclair. Since 55 per cent of our graduates begin teaching at once after graduation, such a course ought to be encouraged. I have for years been in favor of normal work in the high school. If you will ask Prof. Searson, he will remember my argument with Dr. Luckey on this point. Prof. Searson said he would have helped me out if I had needed help. have held aloof from this because I have always argued that a high school with but two teachers should have but one course. But we are giving a thorough review in history and arithmetic during our last ear, and the way I teach Latin my pupils get three years' review of English grammar. Since I now have three periods per day for office and supervision, I think I could do fairly well the work on theory. So </seg>

It will help them to make more of their other work by getting a new view-point. Have seen that effect already in the case of some taking the work. Since so many enter teaching directly, we owe them better preparation. — A. A. Reed. I should like to have the Ashland high school recognized for nor - mal training. I cannot say whether the school board will try to meet the requirements, but I shall use my endeavors to get them to do so. — Magee. e would like to try normal training, and I believe we can meet the requirements. I believe the classes in high school generally would do more careful work because they would feel the importance of it more.— G. A. Gregory. I am heartily in favor of more emphasis being placed on the com - mon branches in the high school, and especially do I favor a review in the senior year, the work to be done very much as it is done in the normal school. I believe a course in the elements of psychology to be far more practical than some subjects that are now taught. The young man going into business will succeed better who has given some serious thought to the workings of the human mind. And so, too, with the professions. A physician who understands the workings of the human mind, and through this knowledge is able to get control of the mind of his patient, is by far the more successful physician. So, too, with the lawyer and minister. I speak of these things because so many of our young people go from the high school at once into these professions. The "sweet girl graduate" who doesn't get ready for anything in par - ticular, but who is soon found in the matrimonial ranks, would be a more intelligent mother if she understood the laws governing the un - folding of the precious souls given into her charge. With such a prep - aration on the part of the mother there would be less need for the kindergarten. The work in psychology could, of course, be given a pedagogical turn so as to fit the young person for the teaching profes - sion. — J. M. Mclndoo. The fact that so large a per cent of our graduates teach is one reason I favor the plan. Out of our present senior class of fifteen mem - bers, at least eight will teach without further preparation after being graduated. Also, two of our senior class dropped out and they are both teaching. If we consider the greatest good to the greatest number also the large number of children who are under the care of these inex - perienced and untrained teachers, the plan is worth more than it costs. W. T. Stoekdale. During the four years I have been in Arapahoe I have given work similar to that you mention. We had a thorough review of all </seg>
            <seg id="p209">NORMAL TRAINING IN HK.H M HOOLS 191 the common branches, keeping in mind constantly that many of the pupils were to be teachers. Then in addition to this we had a class in which we studied briefly the history of education, methods of teach - ing, school management, pertinent pedagogical problems, etc. Each prospective teacher was given opportunity to visit our own lower grades and to do some actual teaching. We have paid more attention to the training of our pupils for teaching and for actual life than to fitting them for the university. Only twelve per cent have gone to advanced schools, while almost fifty per cent teach, and the remainder take up the duties of life. The fifty per cent certainly should be looked after. The idea of three courses I think is a good one.— C. \V. McMichael. Observation work in public schools (adapted for use by visits to rural schools) is the most valuable instruction possible in any normal training work, as no other system can afford the real conditions under which teaching must be done. Instruction In the high school will near - ly always be in the hands of those familiar with Nebraska conditions and needs, and, consequently, there is little danger of an excess of theory. — C. S. Jones. 1. It prepares a far greater per cent of pupils for the work in which they actually engage. 2. The excellent "review" fits them better for business, i. e. — it prepares them for either teaching or business. 3. The "practical results" of the "review" meet the popular criticism against the school, "Pupils not skillful in spelling, writing, composi - tion, and arithmetic." 4. It is about the only way of meeting the emergency arising under the new law, and fortifies against the repeal of this law. 5. It is an inexpensive plan for bettering the teaching profession in Nebraska (not the best way, however). 6. Pupils from country schools, many of whom engage in teaching with no secondary instruction whatever, must enter the high school and take advanced studies in order to get this normal course. 7. Would cause a much greater attendance of non-resident pupils and popularize the high school over the county. — Edward M. Hussong. For five years, besides the reviews in arithmetic, grammar, geog - raphy and history, I had a class for those expecting to teach. We studied school management; they visited schools; and I gave them talks on pedagogy, etc. I tried to impress upon them the necessity of con - scientious effort and the value of sympathy in dealing with young peo - ple. The following facts tell something of their success: Of the 101 teachers in Johnson county for this year, thirty-two are from the Te - cumseh schools — thirty of them were my pupils — and twenty-eight of these thirty graduated while I was there. A number of others are teach - ing elsewhere. I had eighty-nine graduates in the six years. This large per cent of teachers I think is due to the opportunities for preparing for the work. But I found this true — I had to give the technical work in teaching myself if I got it done at all as I wanted it done. And I believe this will be the drawback in trying to do such work in the high schools. The ordinary high school teacher would not take the proper </seg>

I feel confident that the majority of them, outside of the superintendents, would do the profession more harm than good- I refer, of course, to the teaching of pedagogy and school management. But I do believe here is a great field for work and that the things you are recommending are nothing short of a revolution — and a glorious one. You can depend on me to do whatever I can to help the good work along. — C. N. Anderson. IN CONCLUSION. In our opinion there is no other avenue open for the training of teachers for the rural schools in Nebraska than through the agency of our strongest high schools. The graduates of the colleges, universities and advanced courses of our normal schools, will be required for su - perintendents, principals, and high school and grammar grade instruc - tors of our town schools. The graduates of the elementary courses in our state and private normal schools will be required for the grade work in town and city schools. It follows that we must look to our high schools to train those who are to teach in the rural schools. It is a condition and not a theory which confronts us. </seg>

Stb Nebraska District, now Auditor for the United Stales Treasury Lrepartment. WashinKion. . ■ The request to reproduce this lecture in type recalls several years of service rendered in the public schools, academies and colleges of.dowa and Nebraska. It revives pleasant memories with respect to thousands of pupils, students and teachers with whom I enjoyed a veff delightful acquaintance. The atmosphere of educational life seetas to be renewed on this autumn day as I observe the pupils, students, teachers and professors of the capital city of our nation on way to the schools, colleges and universities in search of knowledge. I recall with pleasure my associations of former years with the educators of Nebraska. In memory I can see the earnest countenances of men and women in the meetings of our state as - sociations as they diligently searched for more light and better meth - ods of instruction. Such reminiscences suggest that the continued existence of our public schools is a strong proof of an urgent public need. Their history, development and purpose should be clearly understood by all, especially teachers. Our colonial schools and colleges were only the germs from which our modern institutions have been evolved through the progress of years. Knowledge has gradually expanded, experience has added its lessons of wisdom and the true science of education has unfolded into practical results. Quite naturally those who enter the profession to-day see all these things in the mirror of the present without special reference to their historic bearings. But what is the true measure of this prob - lem? What responsibilities does it impose upon you and me? Does it mean anything more than a fixed compensation per month or per ■ ear and the last day of school? Certainly. In view of such questions i"t us glance at the investments represented by our educational sstem. Within the borders of Nebraska alone, we have 6,656 school districts with property worth $11,309,208.36. We disburse annually $3,365,836.36 for teachers' salaries and $2,038,455.62 for other cur - rent expenses, making a total annual expenditure of $5,543,550.11, inclusive of bonded indebtedness paid. Add to this an annual inter - est of four per cent on the permanent investment for school property and we have as the annual cash cost $5,995,918.44. Naturally a business man would repeat the question frequently — is this enterprise returning a satisfactory net gain? We have in this state a school population of 376,898 with an enrollment of 278,715 and an average attendance of 185,172 under the instruction rnd training of 9,680 teachers only seventy-three per cent enrolled ?nd forty-nine per cent in attendance.

But let us glance for a few moments at the wider field of the nation. The school population of the United ;iges o to 20 lnclu - ording to the census of 1900 was IC, 119, 718, males, 13,080,160 and fema]. liat there were 61,532 lonely bo&gt; :irollment for the school year 1903 and 4 according to the irnished l&gt;y tlM United States Bu - reau of Education Wl with an average daily attendance of 11 The number of tc: !or thai year was -4 2, nial 4 4 and fern.

Thus we would 1 &gt;ur per cent $27. - i annual interest charge upon the permanent investment In the public school system of the Unit. m of this vast expenditure of money, we are inclined to li he emphasis upon the question: Is this public school enterprise returning a satisfactory net gain? From a purely business standpoint our public schools owe a heavy debt to tl o have from year to year enlarged their contri - butions through public taxation for the continuance and expansion of the work. Thirty-five years ago our total annual expenditure amounted to only $ 6:: as compared with $273,000,000 for 1904. The vision of some who may read these lines may b^ limited by the walls of a building poorly furnished with the comforts and ap - pliances i il educational training. If so the mere suggestion of the figures herein quoted will be sufficient to expand their ran- ion toward the real magnitude of the financial side of this question. -hould regard the district, county and state only as parts of a great national enterprise, whose annual cost exceeds one-half of the total annual expenditures of our national government. With this vast outlay of money are the public schools of the nation re - turning a satisfactory net gain? What evidence must be required as an answer to this question? The financial investment constitutes a minor portion of the con - tributions which the people of the nation have made to this cause. Their principal investment is p d by the intellectual and moral resources of 26,000,000 boys and girls, 16,000,000 enrolled and 11, - n daily attendance. T investing placed before </seg>

Do those intellectual is all understand the real nature of the child mind and the laws of its growth? Do they clearly comprehend all of the ways by means of which the child mind can gather knowledge and grow? For after all education is a growth, natural in some respects, acquired in others. Have all these teachers scanned the pages of text books on psychol - liey learned the technical terms describing the different powers of mind? Have they acquired the fruits of the labors of those who have gone before them and left their words upon printed pages? Even after they have accomplished this, their study is still incomplete. They must turn from the lifeless page and look into the vitalized countenance of the child as it reflects the conditions, mental powers, adaptabilities, and inclinations through words and facial ex - ions. The child life as we see it is, after all, the most fascinating work on psychology. If these intellectual leaders have been trained in the use of technical terms, have surveyed the fields of knowledge and been vitalized with child life, the journey through the realm of knowledge will be only a delight and profit.

It was a sort of a "studium generale" open to all, from monastic rule. This "trivium" or elementary arts course was always presumed before the specialized courses in the university were taken up; and as it was next to impossible to secure this "trivium" elsewhere, it very soon became an integral part of the university. The cathedral and monastery schools were in a state of decay. The se - condary schools — the Grammatici schools — prepared for the ele - mentary arts course, i. e., the "trivium" at the Universities. These schools increased in power, influence, and higher work, as the Uni - versities increased the minimum age of matriculation.

The Grammaticus school may be said to correspond roughly to our high school or academy: the "trivium" to our col - lege course: and the "quadrivium" to the graduate, or strictly speak - ing, University course.

With this brief survey of the history of the college and Univi together with the necessary preparation for the same, we may on to the history of the high school in the United - HISTORY OF THE HIGH SCHOOL The first colleges in the United States had a&lt; or fitting schools, which were more or 1- iy connected with them. These academies fitted for college and supplemented the common schools. They were the only preparatory schools of the time. These did the work and served exactly the purpose of the "Grammal hools in the Middle Ages, the course being greatly extended and strength When t: 'a of free schools was first established in the United States, the high school formed no part of the system. It was decidedly a long after-thought. About the beginning of the last tury the high school (the "people's col!' lied for some stahlished. Boston has the credit of starting the first typical high school. The English high school of Boston was started in 1821. It was founded to "furnish young men. who did not intend to take a collegiate course, and who had enjoyed the usual advan of the other public schools, with tli of completing a good Eng - lish education." It had a I rs 1 course, with no Latin, but with French and Spanish. The high school movem- very slow at first.

Such statements as this tell us most emphatically that the college and high school are absolutely independent of each other in their origin. The colleges in the United States were generally speaking founded by religious denominations primarily to give the student a general arts course before he specialized in theology. The academies, preparatory departments, the feeders to those colleges, originated in the same way. The college and the academy hung by the hair, as it were, from above. The high school on the other hand, planted its feet upon the grades below. The academies and colleges looked up to the special and University work above. The high school looked down to the grades below. It could not look up at first for there was noth - ing above. During the last half century persons interested in educa - tion — especially in higher education — have succeeded, to a consider - able extent, in persuading colleges to look down as well as up, and high schools to look up as well as down. How has this been accom - plished? FIFTY YEARS OF ADJUSTMENT Fifty years ago there were practically two systems of education, with three grades in each. In the public school system there were the primary, intermediate and high school grades. In the University sys - tem the academy, college and post-graduate grades, the latter being then but little developed. The history of high school and college edu - cation during the past fifty years has been to a considerable extent an attempt to bring these two systems into harmony. There have been much billinc and cooing, with now and then a love spat, but on the whole the courtship has progressed most satisfactorily, especially in the West. The establishment of state Universities (throughout the West) has had much to do with bringing about this happy result. Un - fortunately, at the start, the state Universities took as their models the older colleges. They modeled the under-graduate college curric - ulum on that of the older denominational colleges. They based their entrance requirements on this curriculum. These entrance require - ments presumed the completion of the course in the private academy or preparatory school, not that of the public high school. Many of those who had finished the high school course wished to continue their education at the state Universities, but they found they were not pr - pared to meet the entrance requirements. There was a very wide gap between the high school and the state University notwithstanding the fact that the latter was supposed to be closely articulated with the grades below, and to form the new crown to the public school system. The attempt was made to bridge this gap by means of acad - emies, Latin schools, preparatory departments, private instructors, etc., st the Universities. The high schools on the other hand tried to bridge the gap by introducing more and more the particular subjects which the colleges laid stress upon- in their entrance requirements. This was accomplished "by the stronger high schools with a fair degree of success, but they met with many difficulties. The high schools are </seg>
            <seg id="p227">207 ATIONAL PROBLEM PAY flrst of all finishing schools for the great majority of their students. They are fitting schools for but a small number. For the most of their students they are the goal of school life, the completion of a tern rather than a preparation for something higher. When the high school curriculum was arranged to meet the needs of the minority who expected to go to college, the majority naturally demurred against taking such studies. The murmurs and objections were the loudest and longest in those communities that were more remote from col - lege centers. To meet these objections the high school course was split up. There were established a so-called University course and a high school course. Often those two courses would differ in only one subject. Yet it was generally understood that one course prepared for college while the other did not. Another difficulty that the high schools met with, when they wished to send their graduates to college, was the particular prefer - ences and peculiar points laid stress upon by the professors who con - trolled entrance examinations. There was practically no uniformity among the various colleges. The men who conducted the entrance examinations to the colleges were isolated from each other and from the high schools, and each held a somewhat different view. As specialists they laid stress upon particular points in their respective subjects. This caused no end of trouble to the high school teachers when they tried to meet the entrance standards of the different men to the differ - ent colleges. A more uniform method of admission was necessary as well as more uniform requirements. To accomplish this several meth - ods have been tried with various degrees of success. As early as 1837 the U. of M. tried to establish branch schools ( i. e. accredited schools), but after twelve years the attempt proved a failure, because it was found that the schools "were not able at the same time to perform the functions of a common school and those of a branch of the University." Twenty years later however, it was found that they could perform this double function, and the U. of M., then (1871) established her present diploma or certificate system. Only "A" students are granted certificates of admission. All others are required to take entrance examinations. This system certainly has much to commend it. The University of Minnesota solved the prob - lem by the establishment of a high school board, (consisting of the governor, superintendent of public instruction, and the president of the University), with power to grant certificates to graduates from high schools which maintain a certain standard. These certificates are accepted in lieu of entrance examinations. A state law also provides for granting pecuniary aid to schools which carry work in all branches required for admission to the University. The State of New York has still a third plan which seems to have worked well and to be quite sat - isfactory. The Board of Regents of the State of New York consists of twenty-three men who have power to grant or annul charters, to visit and inspect schools and colleges, to give examinations and issue di- </seg>

This plan seems to be growing in favor thru - out western states. State University high school inspectors are becom - ing more numerous each year. Thruout the eastern, and especially the New England states, there still exists a wide gap between the high schools and the colleges. This gap is imperfectly bridged by some high schools, by academies, by college preparatory departments, by private tutors, and even by the study of the local pastors.

Both the candidate and the community gain much by such an arrangement. But it is always a problem with the enrollment committee as to just where to draw the line.) Some more technical questions in connection with entrance work are the following: What shall we do when the usual amount of Latin (thru Vergil) is completed in three years, altho eight points are grant - ed for that amount of work? When algebra thru logarithms, plane and solid geometry, are completed in two years, can we itly allow six points? What shall we do when a student has ntary credit in a subject but after he conies to college I* is found that he cannot carry advanced work in that subject? If you out him off en - tirely from the high school credit in the elementary work, when you find he is poorly prepared, he will choose courses where that subject not appear. In this way ha will not betray his weakness. If you say when a credit is once given from the high school it cannot be taken away, even if the student does take the same work again in college and receive credit for it, this will tend to slip-shod work in the high schools. It is a peculiarly delicate question. Again, some students bring thirty-four and even thirty-six credit points from a four years' high school course. What, if anything, are such extra points worth when they have been earned by carrying twenty-five recitation periods per week? Very much like this is the case of some few who hi thru a four years' course in three years, and are given the same num - ber of credit points (32) as their classmates who take the straight four years. What general enti lit are one, two, three, or more years of successful teaching experience worth? Shall we give one point for one year's teaching, or shall the unit — the minimum — be two years? What shall or can we do for the man or woman who has had many years — say from five to twenty-five years — of experience as a teacher, principal and superintendent? When a man has had a professional course, in law or medicine before his college course, what is the former worth when applied to the latter? Such cases now occur and they will become more numerous in the future. The following case. I think, may be of interest to all present: A candidate applied for senior standing in the University. He presented his credits, documents, diplomas and even some volumes of books bearing his name on the title page. He, according to the diplomas, had i "m a "Faraway" college in 1S97: a M. </seg>

If the methods, processes and provisions were ever suffi - cient they are not sufficient now. I lal prosperity, competition, cosmopolitan population, woman's advent into tiling, change of home ideals, the coming of steam and el' have brought new ong app. tainment, and extravagant liv - ing. And with it all a new educational problem D created. Home notions have changed radically, and a part of education that formerly belonged to the home has been shifted to the school, and the school must assume the burden, at least for the pres HAS; OLUTION. The only simple, rational basis of solution is to plan the work ■with regard to the needs of the ma&gt; id of the needs of the few. In other words, in both town and country the school work is to be plant,- to prepare for life, instead of preparing for some ad- vanced school. Education for every child should be complete at any period in the course. That i- child, at any stage of its ad - vancement, should be all that it is possible for it to be at that time. Education which prepares best for life ought to prepare best for ad - vanced work. And in preparing for life education is to be life. It is to let the child live joyously in his work. We have been trying all these years to fit the child to our theories, instead of fitting our pro- I to the nature of the child.

            <seg id="p265">THE MODERN HHJII SCHOOL CURRICULUM AS PREPARA - TION' FOR A TWO-YEAR NORMAL COURSE, AND THE SORT OF TRAINING WHICH MAKES FOR THE i IRMAL SCHOOL PREPARATION. at N. E a . A- In discussing the question propounded by your committee, it has seem. to change the order of the sub-topics to consider" first the best sort of preparation for a two-year normal course, and then to comparo the requirement with the modern high school curriculum. It is now generally recognized that in the high school period there should be some differentiation of studies with reference to vocation. So, while we retain in all high school programs the studies in history, government, and economics that contribute to intelligent citizenship, the studies in literature and art that refine thr nd such stud - ies in English grammar and composition as contribute to a good En - glish hero is a growing conviction that secondary education should differentiate along five chief lines, all to I &lt;iual time and emphasis. We are providing the traditional course with its language, history, and literaturo for the speaking and writing professions; math - ematics, physics, and manual training for useful and artistic con - struction: biology and chemistry for the physicians and farmers who are to deal with life and the conditions of life; commercial geography, economics, and the theory of accounts for the world of trade; and the \ario md applied sciences that relate to household economics for tl of our homes. These five forms of the high school curriculum cover nearly all the leading lines of human activity. Prep - aration for teaching demands, however, a generalized curriculum; for the elementary teacher must deal with those fundamental knowledges and arts that are of universal value, while the special teacher in the fields of secondary and higher education needs surely as much breadth of culture as a general high school curriculum affords. It seems there - fore, at first thought, that the high school curriculum of highest gen - eral culture value is the best curriculum for the training of teachers. If the modern high school curriculum is not good for the prospective teachers, it may be questioned whether it is good for anybody. there are some of the know nd arts taught in the schools in which we feel the candidate for teaching needs to be espe - cially proficient. If this be not true there is no point to the present inquiry. In the normal school itself the student's mind must be en - • ■d with pedagogical problems. The inductive investigation of teaching, to discover its principles; studies in psychology, to afford an adequate deductive basis for the rules of general method; the his - tory and science of education; questions of school organization and man - agement and practice in teaching — these must constitute at least one- </seg>

Hence the normal school must demand of the high school such preliminary training as will j&gt;erniit the normal school to do its work. I shall venture to mate demands: The pro- her should have a living knowledge of all fundamental forms and activities of nature that condition human life. The intellectual powers of the race have been developed thru man's long struggle to discover the laws of nature, and to turn its energies toward his own ends. This knowledge li the chief component in the education of every generation of men. In the past, when tho'few moi. I in the elementary school were given to ac - quiring the arts of computation and written communication, when the higher school ■ devoted to ancient language*, this funda - mental education was incidentally thru the spontaneous activ - &lt;&gt;f boyhood, or thru the n. of industrial life. The knowl - &lt;&gt;f nature thus obtained was ill-organized, usually superficial, but with a fullness of information along practical lines usually denied to the youth of to-day. Modern life has taken the boy out of the fields and the woods, and shut him up in the schoolroom. It has greatly abrid. The technical .school is taking the vc for industrial life, and the ele - mentary school in its lengthened terms must provide in a systematic way the knowledge once afforded by the free opportunities and employ - ments of country life. Hi'ii •niand that the young woman come from the high school with a living knowledge of the natural sciences: that she shall ;i fair acquaintance with the plant and animal life of the region: that vith some cl&lt; lie relation of variety of form and function to the conditions of • : that she \n- acquainted with the various biological laws that make up the theory of evolution, and be able to account for many observed phenomena by reference to these laws. The time will soon come, I trust, when we may add to those requirement* what the needs of children demand to-day; that she love flowers and know how to care for them. She should have some acquaintance with the nature poets that reveal the spiritual significance of natural phenomena, and know some - thing of the names and works of the great writers that in the past half century have revolutionized the thought of the world thru the revel - ations of natural &gt;- She may not have read extensively in these, but she certainly should read them with interest and appreciation, and look forward with pleasurable anticipation to those hours of leisure that will make their treasures her own possession. </seg>

It is said that every problem of vice and poverty, of pauperism and crime, comes to the door of the school for its solution. No one should teach unless he knows something of the relation of these problems to his own work. </seg>

The chief obstacle 'udy of Latin. In the programs of most of the high school graduates that seek the normal school, Latin has engrossed one-fourth of tli ion periods, and from forty to ty per cent of the Unit' spent in study. The limits of this paper forbid any detailed discussion of the val- ue of Latin in the secondary school. A rigorous experimental dem - onstration of its value is impossible. The eminence attained in prac - tical affairs I n graduates of the traditional classical course may be in ap . their &lt; idies. Our school and promot- higher courses and to its diplomat the \ ambition, and wealth all mark them as the favored few of their generation. I believe that Boat of them in the general absence of higher education would attain a like ii their da Sinco arguments on this ouestion are mainly expressions of opin - ion based upon a priori on I shall venture to say that Lat - in contributes litt ! she i&gt;ro - her of Latin. The place of Latin in our schools is purely traditional. Since schools are no longer confined to lergy. and Latin has ceased to be the language of scholars and diplomats, as in the days of Bacon and Milton, schoolmasters are put to it to invent arguments for the study, chief among which is the resulting mental discipline. But modern pedagogy rejects the dogma of formal mental discipline. The discipline acquired in studying a for - eign language is helpful in the further study of foreign languages. The knowledge of Latin helps little in the study of the Romance tongues. We usually recognize new words in those tongues from their similarity to Englis&gt; .t from theii Latin derivation. Whatever aid the derivation of I words affords any one of us is due. not to his study of the sentf-nces of or Cicero, but to his independent study of I&gt;atin roots. To gain a knowledge of Roman literature and life, it is no more necessary to study Latin than to study Hebrew to understand and appreciate the Bible. lastly the constant translation of Latin into English as actually conducted does not with one pupil out of ten contribute tothe growth of a vigorous idiomatic English style. We hear almost everywhere, "Caesar said himself not to be about to be made more certain," or other absurdities scarcely less flagrant. </seg>
            <seg id="p271">251 With Latin eliminated, there will be time for further study in arithmetic, English grammar, geography, and American history — studies commonly relegated to the grammar school, but needing In many of their vital aspects the maturer comprehension of the high school period. Room may be found, too, for the studies in reading, in hand work, including art, for which now so little time is afforded. Tho other chief defects in the high school curriculum can be d to the dominant influence of the college in determining, not only the curriculum, but the methods of instruction the report of the Committee of Ten in 189:5, high school inspectors from school and college have insisted that secondan shall be college graduates. Yet the college student rarely hears any discussion of the ends and means of education, of the peculiar problems of the adolescent period, or of the method of instruction. Thrown into the high school with no resoin t his own experii Indent, he must needs imitate his own teachers. In this way the method of the University has been projected into the high school. Physics has become quanti - tative, engrossing the time of the student with endb irements. The construction of "Stewart's curve" or the verification of "Joule's equivalent " is to the normal student of much less importance than to know the modes of utilizing exhaust steam, or why the housewife must frequently add cold water to the cream she is churning. In biology the microscope has come into daily use among children who have never learned to see a tithe of the interesting and important phenomena of plant life that are visible to the unaided Instruction in English is an admitted failure in almost every secondary school. The root of the difficulty Is in the specialization of high school teaching which now treats language as a separate branch under the name of English, whereas habits of expression, good or bad, are inevitably formed in every class room. Language is not merely the vehicle ot ion. It is the form of the thought itself. To write a clear, accurate, and orderly paragraph requires clear, accurate, and orderly thinking. Instruction In the principles of any kind of doing can only set up ideals of right conduct; habits of right action can usually be gained only thru persistent individual effort supplemented by the example and demand of our entire environment. We grant that ideals should be clear, attractive, noble, determin - ing conduct by their inherent beauty and reasonableness; yet is it not as reasonable to expect to cure a bad case of round shoulders in the physiology class, as to secure good English thru the unaided efforts of that department? In conclusion, I would say that the modern high school curricu - lum is not affording proper preparation for a two-year normal course; that the fault lies in the undue influence of the college, which has been permitted to convert the people's high school into a fitting academy, to shape its curriculum with reference to the traditional ideals of the </seg>

Uniformity, so far as this illustration to throw any light on the matter, it must be apparent, is necessary and desirable. It is also imony of pri in I'niversities and colleges that their standards vary greatly in the several departments, and that the same grade in one place may have quite a different meaning in an - other. In one of the earlier years of the junior normal school work I recall a grade given in physics on a first grade county certificate work in that subject in the summer school. The least informed person knows that eight weeks' preparation is al - together insufficient for a test however slight in the study of ph&gt; science. I can see how it might be possible to arrange the courses in our regul md private normal colleges so that the amount of work done in one study in one school could be wholly out of proportion in amount and exhausti- t done in the s iy in an- other school. I have heard it alleged that six points credit are allowed in 01. college for work th.v of the same subject in another to but a single hour's credi: n is such evidence of discrepancy and lack of unifon rally lead an investigator to wonder how far the credit plan is efficient and ade - quate.

By a little further stretch of i nation such a one can be con - ceived as entered in the state normal school or the University, and by reason of the inexorable conditions of time alone, be graduated and regularly certified to touch school in Nebraska for the term of the remainder of his natural life. Notwithstanding his passage through the common and high schools and his graduation from a higher insti - tution of learning, he could be, conceivably, poor in his attainments, and perhaps unfitted for the office of teacher. The promise held out to rural school teachers and prospective rural school teachers that by attending an approved summer school six weeks, they would be credited, for satisfactory work, in three of the five essentials, or by attending eight weeks they would be credited In all five of the essentials, has been misleading in its effect, for the 17 </seg>

During the past winter we indulged in much discussion of a plan to permit such high schools as were properly equipped to give normal training, and a committee made an elaborate report whereby such a course could be followed by those who desired.

They devote a great deal of time to ob - servation in a model school under the personal supervision of skilled critic teachers. These are features which make the work of a school stand out, and yet which do not work straight toward the easy solu - tion of specific text book questions. A breadth of scholarship is gained which would not be the result if the aim were merely to acquire a body of facts with which to stand a stated test. Over and over again in the consideration of this subject I have been wondering what is, after all, the real object for which a school, in the sense that all our public and private state schools are regarded, should exist, and I cannot escape the conclusion that it is to promote growth. These schools exist to broaden and deepen intellect and to de - velop character, and essentially to fit their students for the responsi - bility of citizenship. One of the duties of the principal of a junior normal school is to make a report to the state superintendent of the progress of the work in his charge and also to submit such recommendations as he may wish. It may be a matter of interest in this connection if e of the from my last annual report written long before I had kn&lt;&gt; if this paper or my connection with it: "The object of a school is to afford opportunity to make preparation for a definite work.

I have talked with incoming students, who, by attending six weeks or eight, might hope to gain credit in three or five of the es - sentials, and listen to their complaints regarding the exacting charac - ter of this requirement. I have wondered why they did not take the examinations, a matter of only a few hours work, and be done with it.

I want to enunciate a firm belief in the worth and value of broad scholarship and liberal training for the teacher's work. Recognizing the advantages that accrue to those thus fortunately blessed it is only • suitable credit upon their II ■&gt; teach. But on the other hand I can see no reason why it should be made easy to become a teacher. Any need for a greater number of teachers in the present hour is not a reason. Better that the schools lie closed than in the control of some of these applicants who are denied permits to teach by the stringency of the new certification law. The more difficult it is to undertake teaching, the scarcer teachers will become, and so the n&gt; ';]&gt;■ will salaries advance. But how far can we push the level of teachers' wages? This question is one for the law maker. If in districts the full levy of twenty-five mills law to be levied will not raise funds with which to hire an i; at prev:: are not the patrons of the schools rather fa&lt; problem of what kind of a school they want to maintain, one within present means, or a school now beyond their means, yet attainable, that is adequate and up to the present day standards? If twenty-five mills on the dollar of assessed valuation will not provide such a school, why not amend the law to permit of a levy that will? We ought not make it easy to enter the profession of teaching, because, to make it easy to enter it, makes it likewise easy to leave it. Teaching should have that same air of permanence that the other professions have, that nearly all occupations have, while act - ually it is a transitory pursuit and its members are migratory in an </seg>

In the middle of the eigh; ntury the German government took up in earnest the matter of I ution of teachers. The movement grew, was modified and spread through - out all the schools of the empire, until "The r&gt; nuip - ied and most exclusive body of teachers in the world."

Because of the wide and liberal use of libraries and laboratories and because of the advantage of model school training and observation, the plan of examinations could be so altered, if it came after the course of in - struction, as to include tests along these separate lines or a ped - agogical thesis, and so work no injustice to those who have approached the examinations with less exact preparation. How many of us got in on the credit plan? How many of us would like now to bump up against the examining board? I used to favor the credit plan a great deal more than I do now, but as Prince Bismark said, "consistency is the clog of men who never ad - vance," and I have modified my view It is like th. rvice: Those who are already in it like it all right; it is those who are on the outside, or who want to get their friends in who don't lil&gt; We are not &gt;i to go bodily to the examination plan; few of us could be so extreme, and all are able to detect grave dangers in pushing lit plan to its ultimate conclusion.

Most officers can determine orally the fitness of a candidate to handle a certain work; we resort to the examination plan when the candidates are too numerous for personal investigation. Let me here read a letter pertaining to the point at issue, writ - ten by Prof. W. R. Hart, and dated Feb. 6, 1906. It was addressed to Supt. McBrien: "I was delighted beyond measure to read in yesterday's State Journal what you say in behalf of the five essentials crusade. It is a good thing and deserves pushing along. My stammering tongue has stood for reform in this direction for twenty years. If all other studies below the ninth grade were dropped from the school course we would have far better scholars, better thinkers, and better in - formed men and women. Furthermore, if all other studies were drop - ped from the second grade certificate and if the basis of the second grade certificate were changed from i r o a basis of ninety-five per cent average in the five essentials it would add to good scholarship, clear thinking and better teaching.

Thoroughness in learning is unattainable by those on whom we must depend for teaching under present conditions." It ig apparent that we have too many certificating powers in Ne - braska, and the chief gain to any change in present conditions will come quite largely through efforts to systematize in this direction. One standard, one plan, one board of examiners, with authority to iigate institutions and courses of study, conduct written or oral tests from .time to time, can more effectively accomplish the desired reforms than is ti &lt; ith the plan at present in vogue. I desire to acknowledge much indebtedness to Dr. G. V Luckey. for help in the preparation of this paper and to quote ver - batim the following paragraph from his scholarly book on the "Pro - ional Training of Teacher- "The certificating or licensing of teachers for any and all grades should be removed from the hands of separate institutions and local authorities, and should be placed in the hands of a non-partisan board of education. The members of this board should be chosen on account of their interest and scholarly fitness for the duties which devolve upon them. All certificating of teachers should be in the hands of this central board. There should be no blanket certificates d. On the contrary, every certificate should be made to cover only such subjects or parts of the field of education as the candidate pecially fitted to teach. This would give meaning and value to teachers' certificates, that would go a long way toward securing their universal recognition. "All institutions of the state properly fitted to prepare teachers for the elementary or secondary schools should be subject in that part of their work to the inspection and direction of the state board of education. The recommendations for teachers' certificates for the specially qualified graduates of these schools might come from the proper authorities of the institutions concerned, but the granting power as well as the certificate itself should remain in the hands of the state board." At the 1902 meeting of the National Educational Association the following statements were adopted as a part of that organiza - tion's "Declaration of Principl* "We heartily commend every step which may be taken for in - creasing the necessary qualifications of teachers, and hope soon to see as definite a standard for the training of teachers as is now fixed by the best schools in the country for the training of physicians or law - yers. We believe that the fixing of such a standard and a strict adherence to it would elevate the work of the teacher to that of a profession. We further commend any movement that may be in - augurated for securing uniformity of requirements in the training and the licensing of teachers in the various states and territories, and which would bring about a just recognition by these states and ter - ritories of the diplomas or certificates granted under this system.

One can therefore consistently urge higher remuneration for teachers, and at the same time rejoice in the Carnegie benefactions and in t!ie military pension ci'stoms of civilized count; hope that "s for teachers will ever be provided; no system, that is, by which any employe working a given length of time without particular merit can expect to much or so much in addition to his yearly stipends.

            <seg id="p287">SALARIES AM) TENURE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS IN THE UNITED STATE Addre- (cBrien bt-fore the SuperinlenileDLs arid Principals' • tier. 18U6. The most important plank in the platform of the public school teachers of America, so far as the teachers themselves are concerned deals with salaries and tenure. This plank was adopted by th&gt; tional Educational Association at its Boston meeting In 1903, and reads thus: "Teaching in the public schools will not be a suitably attractive and permanent career, nor will it command as much of the ability of the country as it should, until the teachers are properly compen ; and are assured of an undisturbed tenure during efficiency an( good behavior. A large part of the ' rd must always be the pleasure in the character and quality of the work done; but the money compensation of the teacher should be sufficient to maintain an appropriate standard of living. Legislative a to give sup port to these principles deserve the approval of the press and the people." This is the paramount issue from the standpoint of teachers. It is an extremely moderate statement which expresses clearly their just and reasonable demands 'a compensation sufficient to maintain an appropriate standard of living with an assurance of an un - disturbed tenure during efficiency and good behavior." The teachers of America demand a square deal in this matter — nothing less, noth - ing more. In order that we may reason from a correct premise and tnereb&gt; reach a logical conclusion in our study of this question as it con - cerns Nebraska, let us take a survey of the salaries paid teachers and their tenure of office in the nation at large. We shall study the • first. One of the most striking developments of recent years in the city schools is the exacting requirements in the qualifications of teach - ers. These requirements are becoming more and more severe. The idea that any high school graduate can teach school in a city has quite generally been succeeded by the conviction that no person, however well educated generally, can properly teach without special preparation for that duty. The higher standards which are being insisted upon for city teachers must lead logically to better salaries. It is an interesting study to note the actual salaries paid it cities and towns throughout the country. Time will permit us to name only a few of them on this occasion. We shall review briefly the three largest cities in the country, three in the class with Omaha, three in the class with Lincoln, and a few in the class with Beatrice, Columbus, </seg>

The salaries reported as medium ranged from $270 to $360 for a school year varying from thirty-two to thirty-six weeks, a monthly rate of $30 to $40. It will be seen from the statements we have made that Nebraska compares favorably with i in its section in the salaries paid to rural teachers. It is safe to say that for the school year 1906-7 the average raise for rural teachers in Nebraska is at least $5 a month. In many instances the increase in salary is at least $10 per month over the salary for the past school year. Thanks to the new cer - tification law for this increase. But we maintain that salaries for rural teachers in Nebraska are not yet commensurate with the quali - fications demanded and the services rendered. The salaries of rural teachers is a serious question for the en - tire country and, according to Dr. Harris, "pretty much all the inter - est in statistics of salaries in the United States relates not to the salaries of teachers in Tural schools but to those paid in village or city schools which are sufficient to support a professional teacher. Teachers of rural schools for three or four months in the year are not an important element in the discussion of salaries. Teaching as a makeshift occupation can never be of sufficient importance to cause young men and women to spend years at training schools in prepar - ation for that work. Only places with annual salaries and with eight to ten months of teaching will warrant the establishment of nor - mal schools and the requisite time and preparation necessary to se - cure the special qualifications of the professional teacher." But we cannot ignore the question of short terms in the rural districts so far as Nebraska is concerned. We have in this state at least 300 rural school districts where the annual term is less than three months or none. There are 600 school districts where the an - nual term of school is three to six months. In 3,900 school districts the term is six to nine months. In 1,800 districts the annual term I* </seg>
            <seg id="p296">274 Is nine months or more. We have 1,000 districts where the term of school is a little short of four months. In addition to this it is safe to say that we have 2,500 districts in Nebraska where the average length of term does not exceed six months. While one teacher may serve three school districts in which the length of term is three months during the year and thereby teach nine months, and while this may be done in hundreds of cases, the fact remains that w&lt; least hool districts where a teacher ( annot secure more than six months' employment. length of term as well as salary and tenure must be considered in a proper solution of the salary question. A SQIAKK DEAL.

            <seg id="p298">276 TEACHERS' CONTRACTS. When we speak of better salaries we do so only in behalf of the well qualified, progressive, wide-awake, up-to-date, successful teach - er. The incompetent, unprofessional, and unsuccessful teacher is the worst enemy we have to better salaries. The teacher who breaks her contract without first being released by a majority of the board is an enemy to better salaries. School officers, as a rule, are reasonable and if approached by the teacher in the proper spirit, will be glad to see her promoted to a better position if a good teacher can be found to take her place. A teacher who breaks her contract without first be - ing released by a majority of the board should have her certificate revoked by the authority granting it, which revocation should make her ineligible to receive a certificate from any authority whatsoever in Nebraska. A contract between a teacher and a school board is a mutual obligation, equally binding upon both parties. Neither party Can with impunity rescind such contract. A teacher who is discharged without cause by a school board can recover her salary in the courts, but the school board in most cases has absolutely no recourse against a teacher who wilfully breaks her contract. While the board might, by injunction, enforce the promise not to teach elsewhere during the time covered by the contract, they would find it almost impossible to force her to teach their school. We ask for better salaries, then, for the teacher who will keep her contract as well as teach a good school. THE TEACHER'S WORKING DAY. In the consideration of reasonable salaries for teachers, few people realize the length of the working day of the true teacher. So many persons count her work between nine and twelve and one and four. The hours of work required of a teacher vary with conditions. Supt. \. Mill* of Crawfordsville, Indiana, makes an estimate for the schools of his city of the length of the teacher's day. "They are re - quired to be in their respective class rooms in charge of pupils, in the primary grades five and one-fourth hours, the intermediate grades five and three-fourths hours, the grammar grades six hours, and high school Biz and one-fourth hours. Adding to the above the additional time required for planning lessons, reading and correcting exercises, and for professional calls, the total will bring the average teacher's working day up to ten hours." It is safe to assume that the same is true of • iiher throughout the country, whether in town or rural school. In few vocations of life are the hours longer or the work harder than in the teaching profession. I have not discussed in this paper the comparative earnings of teachers with those in other occupations for the reason that this sub - ject is to be discussed at to-morrow morning's session by President A. O. Thomas of the Kearney State Normal. </seg>
            <seg id="p299">\TUi.N.\L I'KUHUCMS OK TO-DAY 277 RELATIVE COST OF LIVING. So far in our discussion we have considered the annual salary paid teachers without due consideration of the purchasing power In different localities as well as the tenure or length of service of the teacher. The relative cost of living in country, village, city and metro - politan city must not be overlooked in the comparison of salaries. While the actual cost of living for the superintender* in Chicago may not be enough greater than in Omaha, as to warrant more than double the salary paid in Omaha, yet the demands (social, political, religious, charitable, educational), upon the Chicago superintendent come from so many more sources than upon the Omaha superintendent that it is not unreasonable to suppose the net earnings of the former will not double the net earnings of the latter. It likewise follows that if we compare the salaries of the superintendent of Omaha with that of the superintendent at York, we must take into consideration the same greater demands made on the former than on the latter. The same is true of the grade teacher in Omaha as compared with the grade teacher in York. The net earnings of the latter, at an average salary of $48 per month will, as a rule, equal the net earnings of the former at an average salary of $62 per month. The average salary of the ru - ral teacher in York county this year is at least $40 per month. It is safe to say that the net earnings of the rural teacher for a nine months' term will equal the net earnings of the teacher in the York city schools at a salary of $4 8 per month. I maintain that the net earnings on salary is an important question. However, there are ad - vantages in Chicago over Omaha. ad\ in Omaha over York, and advantages in York over the country, that would make every one of us ambitious to leave the smaller field for the larger at the higher salary, though the net earnings may not always warrant it when measured in dollars and &lt;• THE TEACHERS TENURE. The tenure of office, that is. the length of term of service of teach - ers, not only in their present locations, but also their teaching ser - vice regardless of where that servi .erformed, is an important factor in the consideration of the salaries of teachers. In the study of the total length of service regardless of where the service was per - formed of teachers in 333 cities and towns in the I'nited States with a population of 8,000 or over, w? find that nearly five per cent taught only one year, nearly six per cent only two years, a little over six per cent only three years, less than six per cent only five years, a little over 4.5 per cent had taught ten years, nearly three per cent had taught fifteen years, 2.25 per cent had taught twenty years, 1.7 per cent had taught twenty-five years, and only eighty-six hundreths per cent had taught thirty years. In order that a comparison of the total service of teachers in the various states in our section of the country may be possible, a summary is here given with the years of service grouped into five and ten year periods. </seg>

In this group of schools there are for the school \ - braska 151 principals serving their first year. We h-iv ■ in mind eral of these principals who have moved almo of their teaching vith very little increase in salary. When we con - sider the cost of moving for a man with a family, it is evident that the net earnings of such principal for each year must remain pain - fully near the zero mark. We have in mind an ambitious young prin - cipal who was receiving a salary of $900 per year. He spent at least $100 in railroad fare endeavoring to secure a $1,000 position. Con - sidering railroad fare, breakage and wear and tear on furniture, freight rates, and expenditures for new furniture, his salary for the first year in the new position would have been reduced to $800, had he secured the position. We do not wish to be understood as arguing that any principal or teacher should be content to remain for a long term of years in a small school at a low salary, but we do wish in this discussion to emphasiz? the importance of every principal or teacher doing his work so well that he is retained from year to year at a reasonable increase in salary and thus attracts the attention of boards of education in search of first class educators.

            <seg id="p302">280 1 I'KKINT! s RKPORT The principal or teacher who is more anxious to do good work than to make quick moves for a small increase in salary will ultimately surpass the "journeyman" teacher in both salary and successful record. We are pleased to state that we have proof of this in a number of in - stances in Nebraska. According to reports received at the office of the state superintendent we have twenty-one superintendents or principals who are this year serving a term in their present positions of ten to fourteen years; fifteen for a term of fifteen to nineteen years, six a term of twenty to twenty-four years, one a term of twenty-five to twenty - nine years, and two a term of thirty to thirty-four years. Of this num - ber twenty-seven are principals of ward schools or supervisors of spe - cial school work in Omaha, and seven are ward principals in Lincoln. Supt. R. .1. Harr at the head of the list of the &lt; rintendents in length of term of in his present position is now serving his twenty-fifth year as superintendent of the Grand Island schools. In order to promote a longer tenure for superintendents, prin - cipals and high school teachers and thereby promote the best interests of the schools, we urge upon school officers in high school districts, us soon as they find that they have a worthy teacher, to enter into a contract with him for three years, and to pay him a salary commen - surate with his ability to do things and to do them right. In a recent sermon Dr. Tuttle of the First Congregational Church in this city advised young men not to go into the ministry unless could not get out of it, unless they felt that they must, unless they felt that they could do that work better than anything i that if more persons would stop seeking a "job" and would direct all their • to the work or business for which they had a natural liking, there would be fewer misfits and failures. Just so would I advise young men and young women not to enter the pro - fession of teaching unless they feel a natural liking for the profession. When that falling is decided upon, then dignify the work by the best efforts possible, and they wi'l no lotigpr be compelled to hunt for "Jobs" but the "jobs" will be hunting the teacher. THE FUTURE OF TEACHERS' SALARIES In the future of teachers' salaries as discussed by Dr. Win. T. Harris, while he was yet United States Commissioner of Education, attention is called to important aspects of the question: "Do the positions commanding high salaries increase in number as fast or r than the population? Are there a sufficient number of higher ions to hold out a promise to the lower of promotion from time to time in accordance with the increased population schedule?" In answer to these questions he states that the annual increase in higher education throws open nearly 1.000 new places a year in col - leges and Universities for teachers promoted from the secondary schools who have the requisite skill and scholarship. This increase has given during the past fifteen years new positions for teachers in public and private high schools. </seg>
            <seg id="p303">281 ATIONAL PROBLEMS OF TO-DAY Dr. Harrig adds: "The teacher whose salary is low asks himself what he is going to do about it. He may submit in sorrow to his lot, or he may take a more heroic view of the matter and consider that the lot he will occupy will depend in large measure upon his own efforts. He will then try to improve his skill in teaching and to make his field of learning more extensive and accurate. He will make en - thusiastic culture studies in literature and art as well as in science. He will study to perfect himself in fine manners." It follows that as our superintendents, high school principals, high school teachers, are promoted there will be an open door for promotion for grammar grade and rural teachers commensurate with their professional skill and scholarship. In the evolution of our civilization as we increase in accumulative wealth from decade to decade and as the protective genius of the average person in the United States increases his ability to support schools, we shall have an increasingly number of positions at higher salaries open and ready for ev. htr who has made due prepara - tion therefor. In 1850 the total per capita wealth per individual on its true valuation was $308. Decade by decade it raised to the following sums: In 1860, $514; in 1870, $780; in 1880, $870; in 1890, $1,036; in 1900, $1,235. "It appears that each individual in the United States has an average of four times as much realized wealth as in 1850, and therefore can bear a burden of taxation equal to four times that of 1850 with greater ease, because the greater income from vested property the greater tax possible without stinting the individual in his necessities." The average person having gainful occupation in 18. r &gt;0 produced less than $494; in 1860, $651; in 1870, $849; in 1S80. $921; in 1890, S990; in 1900, $1,065. The increase in per capita wealth plus the in - 'rease per capita earnings of the average citizen in the Unl B are "full of hope for the future of the teacher as regards his salary and Ills social position." The bright and promising future for teachers' salaries as viewed in the light of the general industrial progress and the other more hopeful view from the economical light of increased values for vo - cations that have for their object protection and culture cannot be better emphasized than to quote Dr. Harris: "In the earlier stages of civilization, ninety-nine laborers out of each hundred are needed to supply raw material and rude manu - factures for the community. With the growth of civilization a 1 and larger number are detailed from the one hundred to provide creature comforts, protection, and culture, and the teacher's voca - tion at present by far leads in the number of those who have to do with providing culture for the community. These vocations are lim - ited in numbers only by the ability of the community to furnish a surplus of money beyond what is needed for the raw materials and the rude manufactures for food, clothing and shelter. In the far distant time a goal will arrive when one person in each hundred, </seg>

The writer hopes to answer such questions in this paper. liing is used more as an avocation than as a vocation. It is tpplag stone to ;i Uy is it the highway to the bar. Thi lawyer in t lie country who l;a:;' not had experiem ready employment, and is in line with intellectual pursuits. It af - fords opportunity for study, and keeps the blade of the mind bright and keen. When a young person deliberately out to b a calling, he is usually attracted by the inducements of prosperity attending the calling, and one does not have to search far to de - termine that the pecuniary advantages of a sehou are not great. A few days ago the writer made inquiry of tei iug high plac«a in education, relative to whether or not they intended to teach school more than a term or two when they began. Of these ten persons, one always had intended to teach, dreamed of it, and played school when a child; six were determined to enter law, and one of these is already admitted to the bar, but does not now expect to leave the schoolroom; the other three had pare for medicine, but were sidetracked in their ambitions. There are pleasures and attractions in teaching which fascinate and keep many engaged from year to year. Of the work of the world, the teacher comes in closest touch with the future citizen and has the moulding of habit, the forming of character, and the inspiring of noble life, which "Money cannot repay or Fame reward." Superintendent of Public Instruction Schaeffer of Pennsylvania, in his annual report, says. "It is found that in this state there are teachers who receive less per year than the average cost of main - taining paupers. No one will claim that the indigent &lt;irtu - rate are too well cared for." In no line of intelligent work does there seem to be so little fi - nancial encouragement to spend the whole of life at hard skilled labor as in the rank and file of the teachers of the country. Many of the natior"s strorpest srd best men and women began their work in the schoolroom, but it was too strenuous, and the remuneration </seg>

From the Report of the Committee on Salaries, Tenure, and Pensions of Public School Teachers in the United States, prepared by the National Educational Association for 1905, we find the following: Three hundred teachers of Nebraska — and from the larger schools at that — reported their time service as follows: Five taught less than one year: forty-seven taught one year; forty-one two years; forty-three three; forty-five four; twenty-nine five; seventeen six; eleven seven; thirteen eight; eleven nine; twelve ten: eight eleven; four twelve; six thirteen; four fourteen; five fifteen; two sixteen; one seventeen; one twenty-one; two twenty-three; one twenty-four; making the average tenure for three hundred teachers of 4.1 years, and these from among the la city schools of the state. have not time on this program to go fully into the condition of wages and salaries in the United States, but will confine our in - vestigation largely to the conditions within the state of Nebraska. From the records in the office of the State Superintendent of Pub - lic Instruction in Nebraska, we find that in 1905, 9,24 7 teachers wore required in the schools of Nebraska. These teachers received $3,049, - 345.79 for their year's work, making an average salary paid to each teacher, including country schools, rity schools, superintendents and principals, $333 The following figures are computed from reports and estimates ved from seventy-three teachers of Buffalo county — for the pres - ent year. Four are teaching at $30: two at $33.33 1-3; twenty-seven at $35; two at $37.50; twenty-nine at $40; seven at $45; one at $4 7.50: and one at $50; making the average salary of the seventy - three teachers $38.70. Average length of term is 7.8 months. This shows a substantial increase in salaries, and also an increase of three - tenths of a month over last year. For better comparison, let us change this to a yearly salary, and we find the teacher of Buffalo county compelled to live on $301.86. The average cost of board, estimated by the teachers, is $2.94 per week, making $91.73 for the school year. 95 per cent of the teachers reporting are doing Reading Circle work, pay $2.12 for books, and $3.50 for educational periodicals. The average cost of attending County Institute one week and paying Institute fee is $7.40. Also county, district, and state associations, $6.25. We assume that the teacher makes her board during the portion of the year she is not teaching. The State Superintendent of Iowa collected an estimate of the teachers' expenses, somewhat in ex - cess of this. For the purpose of completing our computations we use his figures relative to the cost of dress, making the account of average teachers of Buffalo county read as follows: </seg>

October. 1S**&gt; In this day and age it seems quite impossible that any criterion should bo set up for the fixing of t. -ave that of merit. When it comes to the training of children none but the best should be employed, for the money at hand. The children of each grade are equally valuable to the nation. All deserve the best training that can b« given them. In some places, however, the idea is still held that the eighth grade teacher should be paid better wages than some other grade teacher because that grade requires greater ability in the form of ex - ind professional preparation. This idea has grown out of the old idea that most any one would do to teach the little ones but that ighth grade teacher by necessity must be able to organize and con - trol his school in every detail. Organization and control are nee* - in all schools, but by the very nature of things, this organization and control takes on different aspects in every grade, and the fault lay in the fact that this has been evident, to many, only in the eighth grade. In New York City there are three grades of salaries: the lowest from the kin&lt; to the sixth grade, the second in the seventh and first half of the eighth. The highest in the upper half of the eighth. Clarence F. Carroll, superintendent of schools, Rochester, N*. Y.. remarking on this plan, as adopted in New York, says, "That the higher salaries paid in the upper grades would naturally draw the primary I toward the higher grades. In consequence the pri - mary teacher would always be inclined to look forward to the day when by examination and by promotion she might leave the services of the little children and aspire to teach children of grammar grades. T must assume that the primary teacher in the New York schools re - gards herself from the first as performing only a temporary service, and that the best talent cannot therefore be retained in the primary grades, for the ambitious and artistic teacher would eventually, attain her aim and secure her promotion." This proposition will appear, I am sure, to the average superin - tendent as a menace to the work of the early grades. It has been my experience, and I am quite sure it has been the experience of others, that the first grade teacher ought to be a good teacher. That is stat - ing it mildly. I may put it in stronger terms and affirm that no ser - rendered to any human being is higher than that of the suc - cessful primary teacher in the public schools and kindergarten. </seg>
            <seg id="p311">289 ATIONAL PROBLEMS OF TO-DAY "Under such a system as this, it would not be just to blame teach - ers for seeking this so-called advancement. The theory itself appears to me as vicious, first, in that it places this service to little children relatively below that rendered to the older children and, second, in that it would tend to destroy in the lives of a host of noble women the highest impulse ever given to woman, and to blight the sentiment that has so long dignified the kindergarten and the primary school. It would, I believe, tend to put back the progress of the public-school system and the progress of civilization indefinitely if the principles were to be generally applied and acted upon." Miss Ellor E. Carlisle, supervisor, public schools, Boston, Says: "Primary teachers should be made to feel that they have the highest, noblest, and best paid work that their qualifications are open to. All teachers should continue their habits of academic study, for inspiration in their work, and for the renewal of their youth. I should like to see primary teachers receive an increase of salary after some years of work, on giving evidence of efficiency and scholastic advancement." Aaron Gove, ex-superintendent of schools, Denver, Colo. ; said before the National Association, "Our agreement upon the desirability of the appointment of tear-hers upon merit is pronounced. It is difficult to understand how the superintendents' can approve any other method." It is sincerely hoped that the time will soon come in Nebraska when teachers may be elected to places for which they are best fitted and adapted without being lured from these places by false standards set up by school boards in the way of variation in salaries for the different grades.

The fact that the last two increases depend wholly upon the teachers keeping alive and progressive is a strong feature.

For the smaller cities which we are necessarily considering to-day it would be absolutely ;endent to keep peace and harmony prevail - ing and retain upon his force teachers doing the same grade of work and receiving different salaries because he had recommended one more efficient than another. Such a course would keep a constant fer - ment not only among the teachers but between the board and the teach - friends. Summing it all up then, I believe time of service is the correct basis for salary schedules First, it permits the teacher to enter and remain on the force with a definite understanding of what she may expect as to compensation. Second, It keeps a teacher longer in one position because she knows that her services are being appreciated to the extent of an in - crease in salary. Third, it gives you a strong force for two reasons, viz: 1st, it keeps the superintendent constantly dropping the weakest teachers for no man will recommend for an increase in salary a teacher about whose worth there is question; 2nd, it makes the teachers put forth greater effort that they may be retained until they reach the maximum. Fourth, it saves the school board from the annual importunities for Individual advances in salary. Fifth, it is done in all other callings. Sixth, it is the practice of nearly every large city and of most smaller cities. I am not sure that this is good reason, but everybody knows more than any body. Seventh, the opportunities to advance to high school positions and principalshlps will prevent the settling down to humdrum mediocrity when the maximum has been reached. </seg>
            <seg id="p315">SITERVISIOX WITHOUT VISITATION. By County Supt. W. A. Yoder, Omaha, before Nebraska Superintendents' and Principals' IT. 18H6. I presume there is not a well-supervised school in Nebraska which is not visited by its supervisor. We must distinguish clearly between visitation and supervision. Visitation is a means of inspection and although necessary to is not strictly speaking, a part of supervision. The subject forces us to keep in mind the schools whose princii all or nearly all the time and, consequently, are allowed no definite portion of school time for visitation. In reference to other schools, however large, it makes clear the point, that we are to Interest our - selves at this time strictly with the subject of supervision, and that any references to inspection are to be made because inspection Is a preparation for supervision. One of the most common and Important means of supervision is the teachers' meeting. It is in the teachers' meeting that many ques - tions of discipline may well be considered; especially is this tn general questions bearing upon the discipline of the whole school and, therefore, of interest and importance to all teachers. Conduct of pupils in the halls, the manner of entering and leaving the building, questions that bear upon the conduct of pupils during intermissions, and other similar matters may be profitably treated at the teachers' meeting. In towns where one building is occupied by all grades from the kinder - garten to and including the high school, such questions appear to demand special consideration. In such schools different grades often their intermissions and are finally dismissed at different hours of the day. In each of these classes pupils must be given due freedom ■hey must not interfere with the rights of others. Everything should be so planned and ordered by the principal and teachers that both the child of five and the young man or woman of eighteen shall be given to understand clearly, but rightly, just what should and what should not be done. The principal who takes into consideration the large portion of the average life that is spent in school recognizes that much is due from the school along the line of proper incentives to right and hon - orable living. This leads us somewhat beyond what we ordinarily mean when we speak of discipline. It brings us to a consideration of points bearing upon the lasting habits and conduct of pupils. In this con - nection should be considered such points as accuracy, system, prompt - ness of action, self-respect, risrht nttHn^o towirri work, independence. ?&gt;nd a f«V1«» &lt;~&gt; r firtivid'ini rosnonsibilitv: honestv. politeness, con* •t for the rights of others and a proper attitude toward property both nubile and private Everyone who has had experience with </seg>

It is next to hold an inspirational meeting without carefully plan - iiout the teacher who attempts to instruct without preparing for the recitation. I once heard a superintendent tell of the work of such a teacher when conducting a recitation in remember it was something like this: The teacher called Um forward to recite. Having bwn told by a member of the class where to find the lesson, he turned to the proper place. t« top of the page were to be found in large letters the words, and Gulfs." The teacher looked but a moment, his blowing with the knowledge at his command a- ilt of the sligh- m, when he called out, Dd Gulfs! ■\Vhere arc they?" The principal who holds his teachers' meeting ne has come to do so, who has no definite pur - pose in mind, who must rely upon the hope that his teachers may be able to start something worth while, or who acts on the theory of the uneducated minister who spurned all preparation on the ground that he had an invisible funnel in his head through which the Lord poured knowledge — such a principal is employing methods as far be - low par as the teacher who said, "S&gt; ilfs! Where are they?" Another important aid to supervision consists Af written direc - tions to the teachers. For this purpose the hectograph and mimeo - graph are coming into very common use.

T have em - ployed this method in order to keep in touch with the various grades and classes of the school. In many of tin we find that the 1 portion, perhaps seventy-five to ninety per cent, comprehend the work at least fairly well and do ory work. Thesi n the teacher m h work i- </seg>
            <seg id="p318">296 ri'KRINTt - REPORT few weak ones are likely to be found in the class. These can be discovered by the principal by visiting the room and in other ways. The plan of inspecting the written work not only assists in discovering such pupils, but, having once discovered them, it makes it possible for the principal to inform himself thoroughly in reference to the ability of said children. Since some of the most difficult problems of classification arise from the fact that these abnormal cases must be dealt with, it follows that the principal who studies them is the one who does most for his teachers. He is able to say and do something worth while as soon as the teacher refers the cases to him, and often before. The examination of written work by both principal and teacher and the discussion in reference to the same enables the principal to help the teacher solve her difficult problems, strengthens both teacher and principal, does the pupil justice and establishes right standards of grading, thus producing approximate uniformity along this line throughout the school. I have just referred to conversations between principal and teach - ers. This is a very important point of supervision; in fact, no one would think of supervising a school without relying to a large ex - tent upon coi with his He who relies to the fullest extent upon all other means of supervision still finds it neces - to discuss many questions with the individual teacher. He will not find it difficult to discover what questions of discipline, method, ■ be considered by him and the teacher directly interested. Some • incipals of schools in which are who have grown old in the service. I have heard that such principals sometimes feel reluctant about performing which it is necessary for them to perform. The prin - cipal is likely to fear that the teacher will consider him an in - truder, a mere nretender who can annoy, but not assist her. I think, however, that this is seldom the case. The broad, worthy teacher does l.ot look at it in this light, especially if the principal acts his part well. Although the teacher may be an expert at her work, it is still Important that the principal know his school of which her room is a part. Indeed, so many questions arise for the principal to solve, the correct solution of which requires that he know his school and know it well. I believe any cultured, well-educated young principal who honestly and conscientiously takes up the work of supervision in a common sense manner will soon find not only thnt he is becoming fairly well acquainted with the conditions and needs of his school, but also that he can a with his best and most exper - ienced teacher. If the principal cannot get a proper hearing in her room, he might heed her conversation as thev walk together along the street to and from school. She will b? sure to talk of what interests her, and good teachers are always interested in their school work. The plan book appears to be very commonly used. By this I mean a book in which the teacher writes her plans. There may be several kinds of these, hut the one about which I happen to know is the one by C H.

Heading the columns at the top are to be found the words Reading, Arithmetic, English, General Lessons, and two blank spaces to be filled if necessary. Lines drawn from left to right separating the days of the week, with other lines perpendicular to the first and separating the branches form rectangular spaces. In these spaces the teacher writes the assign - ment of lessons several days in advance. The principal examines the book at the close of the day or at any other time. He discovers what the teacher has done and is doing. He notes the length of lessons assigned and the amount of work the teacher expects the pupils to do. The record helps the principal to determine when, in the judgment of the teacher, a certain subject is completed. Aside from being of assistance to the principal, it is a record of value to the teacher, especially as the end of the school year approacnes. I have never carried out this idea sufficiently to be able to say that I have really used a plan book. However, I see at least some of its strong points. Reports of progress are often used in the supervision of schools; also statistical reports relating to enrollment, attendance, tardiness, etc.. are necessary. When I find it 1 to require a certain kind of report I do so, keeping in mind that, while complete, it should be concise and brief as it can conveniently be made. If I find the purpose for which the report was devised no longer exists, I quiring it. I think it unwise to require too many reports, and by too many I mean more than necessary to effective supervision. Too many reports involve a waste of time and mean unnecessary burdens upon the t&lt; &gt;n the other hand teachers usually know about what use is made of reports, and therefore comply cheerfully with reasonable demands along this line. I shall suggest, but not discuss, the following devices, th&lt; three of which I should not have thought of mentioning had they not been suggested to me by other superintendents: 1. Arrange for one or two visiting d;&lt; 1'. Hold conversations with pupils. ihange written work. 4. Have a superintendent or principal from some neighboring school, perhaps somewhat larger in size than your own, come and talk to teachers, giving them an opportunity to ask questions. Probably most superintendents do not employ all the devices here suggested. Indeed, I do not consider it necessary for them to do so. I do believe, however, that, whatever else a successful principal may do, he will use at least a few of the plans here given. When I was asked to write on this subject. I decided at once to send out letters to many superintendents and principals of the state asking them what they consider most helpful in supervision.

            <seg id="p322">EDUCATIONAL AGRICULTURE. By W. B. H»rt, Professor of Education and Psychology. Nebraska Suite Normal School This title Is chosen for the reason that if Agriculture becomes a fixture In our country schools it must be educational. The study of Agriculture must do something for the mind of the growing child at. well as for the pocket or bank account of the grown man. Ag - riculture as a part of the course of study must justify its holding a place by claims as valid as those -which justify arithmetic, reading, geography, history, or any other common branch. Some of these bram • been in the course of study so long that many teachers have ceased to inquire why they are there, and when some pupil raises the question as to why such and such a study must be pursued, the her is often at a loss to give any valid reason for such study. The common school course of study is loaded down with a long list of names. These nani' &gt;een added to the list from time to time under the impression that a new subject was beiriK added to the course. As a matter of fact, the additional word is little or nothing more than a name for an additional chapter, or a new view point for some subject already in the course. This is well illustrated in all that has been attempted in the line of the narcotics-and-stimulants phase of hygiene. It 1b further shown in magnifying civil government, or civics, into an independent subject. The plan of a government is a of its history and is vital to the mind only when taught as such. The same is true of composition as related to grammar, and of book - :ng as related to arithmetic. There is in Nebraska, however, a heroic effort being made by the state superintendent to get back to fun - damentals in the somewhat arbitrary dictum of "Five Essentials." These should stand as an unchallenged membership in a new hier - archy of studies which will mark, for Nebraska at least, a new point of departure in educational development. Is it too much to hope that progress in the future may be along more rational lines than it has been in the past? A more rational course will be worked out if, in the future, each new subject as presented be compelled to give a valid reason why it should claim a place in the course of study. Agriculture has been placed in the elementary schools of Ne - braska. Whether this has been done wisely or not will depend upon the justification that can be made for teaching it. In general, two reasons are assigned for studying the subjects found in any given course. One reason is that the knowledge gained will be of use to the individual in later life. The other reason is that by the study of in subjects the activities of the mind are cultivated and disci - j.lined for the use it may be put to in after life. </seg>
            <seg id="p323">301 EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS OF TO-DAY Before Agriculture becomes entitled to a permanent place in the common school course it must withstand three tests: first, the test of usefulness; second, the test of mental discipline; third, the test of humanizing culture. Taking these points in order, what an - swer can Agriculture make to the first question — -"What is the use of it?" For the purpose of this discussion it may be assumed that the usefulness of any body of knowledge is measured by the bearing of that knowledge upon the life and conduct of the person possessing it. The person possessing such knowledge must be thought of both in hig individual capacity and as a member of society. Since the life g; an individual is so largely absorbed in his social relations, the basis of the social organism must become the controlling factor in determin - ing what is or is not useful for the individual. The body of knowledge Qtial to existence in a self-sustaining way in a mining camp in the mountains is not of the same sort as is required in a village of fishermen on the seashore. The problems that confront successful living in a city of sky scrapers and a three-layered system of rapid tiansit require a different body of knowledge from that required by the one and two storied dwellers on the farm. Nebraska as a social unit has an agricultural basis. Other com - munities may thrive on the minerals, ores, or plastic clays found in their soils, but Nebraska has become what she is both in wealth and intelligence by means of the fertility, or plant-food, in her soil. So far as present indications give a forecast of the future, this fer - tility and soil culture must remain the basis of her progress as a state. But to say Nebraska's resource is agricultural is almost equiv - alent to saying that the key which will make that resource avail - able is industrial. These two ideas, therefore, give us the standard by which we can measure the relative usefulness of a given body of knowledge for Nebraska pupils. It is true that reading, writing and arithmetic are taught with a tolerably well-defined notion of their usefulness. But when this is said almost all is said, because nine-tenths or more of all else that is taught has no bearing whatever on the industrial activities in which Ne - braska people are so largely engaged. For, leaving out of the count some very small groups of persons, what are Nebraskans engaged in? They are employed in the production, preparation and exchange of commodities dependent upon the fertility of the soil. Some of these commodities are related immediately and primarily to the soil, such as food stuffs and domestic animals. Others are related somewhat in - directly, or remotely, such as farm machinery, lumber and house fur - nishings. Steamboats and mining machinery are inconsiderable fac - tors in Nebraska life, but self binders and high-bred grains and blood - ed animals are vitally essential to our existence. Now, efficiency in coaxing from the soil two ears of corn where formerly one was wont to grow, and in urging a cow to yield two ruarts of cream whose ancestors yielded but one, and the preparing </seg>

For what knowli lay a gr claim to usefulness than that which enables easily into the industrial life of his community? Yet this great body of knowledge connected so directly with the soil and its prod - ucts has hitherto, for the most part, been ignored in our school course*. It is to be admitted that quite a body of biological knowledge is more or less the common property of every farming community. i in truths about plant and animal life are current everywhere, such as. th;&lt; ilar manures are suited to particular plants; that nfit the soil for other crops; that horses cannot do good work on poor food; that poorly housed feeders take on fat slow: vs yield more milk; and that certain ses of both plants and animals are caused by certain conditions, either of weather, food or management. These facts, vague, scanty, and i though they may be, will enable one to adjust himself and make a tolerable showing.

This fact mak&lt; ort of material for the exercise of the mem - ory. This much abused mental activity thri on wh within th&lt; of the individual's activities. The memorizing of things and the words that stand for them and their relation other is easy, pleasurable and profitable when the mind is acting within the range of its interests. The entire pre-school life of the country child is full of home and farm interests. What knowledge he has is certain and vivid. It is knowledge of a real vital sort IM it was not memorized to be recited. His memory is clear of with bols and i much fdr the cultivation of the memory, only in mind that the facts suggested for the cultivation of the o &gt;n furnish matter on which the memory ilutely without limit.

Now, the question arises, does Agriculture supply material for the exercise of the mind involving the use of the imagination as outlined in the above paragraph? When a person is planning a garden plat he Is exercising the imagination. When a child is ar - ranging the make-believe furnishings of a playhouse it is using the imagination. In all the plays of children which imitate the occu - pations of a community, the imagination is used in nearly every form of its activity. Farm life furnishes the material for more plays than all other occupations combined. This makes it educative for children in the very highest degree. In the training of a vine upon a trellis, or shaping the foliage of a tree, or a plant, or a group of plants, the imagination has the free play of the artist in the produc - tion of ideal forms of grace and beauty. The one who is moulding the lifeless clay is no more an artist than the one who is giving artificial beauty to living things from the images of beauty created by his own mind. As a means of inspiring those higher forms of creative imagery, it is only needful to mention the farm ballads and pastoral poems that have afforded a perpetual fountain of joy to many a nature-loving soul. Finally, Agriculture, in the broad and human - izing sense in which it is here used, gives play to the imagination in seeing the great spiritual truths of life in its higher and moral relationships. When the Psalmist would characterize righteousness he said, "The righteous man shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of Water." When the Prophet would present a picture of peace he takes us to the country to see the leopard lie down with the kid, the wolf dwell with the lamb, the calf and the young lion feed together, and a little child lead them. When Christ would impress upon his hearers the truths of human life and human destiny, out of thirty-eight parables found in his teachings more than a third of them are drawn directly from some phase of agricultural life. These thoughts make it easy to pass to the discussion of the next forms of mental activity, namely, judgment and reason. These are go interwoven with each other that they will be con - sidered together. Judging must both precede and follow reason. Stated in simple terms, the relation between judging and reasoning is this: the mind lays hold of two judgments and after comparison it reaches another judgment usually spoken of as a conclusion. Judg - ment and reason are more or less confused in our common thinking. We often say a man used poor judgment when we might have said with equal propriety that he reasoned poorly, or didn't reason at all, as where one cultivates or plows his ground when it is too wet, or pastures a fall grain crop too late in the spring, or wears out a soil by continued cropping without rest or renewal. It is not the pur- </seg>
            <seg id="p327">305 pose here, however, to correct or even to criticise this confusion of terms. Our question is. Does Agriculture give any material or op - portunity for the exercise of these two most important mental ac - tivities? In order to see the full meaning of the conclusion reached In answer to this question it will be useful to distinguish two sorts of mental activities that may properly fall under these heads. If the mind is presented with ;i ral truth like a prin - ciple, or " definition, and is required to apply it to particular cases, this is one form of reasoning, as when wi Noun is a name. Here is a word which is a name, therefore it is a noun; or when we say, Oaks produce acorns. This tree produces acorns, therefore it is an oak. T: body of mathematical reasoning is of this sort, but in addition to definitions and general truths certain other self - evident truths, called axioms, are freely B There is another form of reasoning which proceeds by slow and easy stages from the seeing of a particular thing, or event, by itself to the discovery of some general truth illustrated by, or em - bodied in the individual thing, or in a group of things of the same kind. This sort of reasoning is based more largely upon experience than upon principles, definitions or axioms. It is sometimes spoken of as reasoning from particulars, lieii, upon experience it re - quires careful observation. In fact it cannot be carried on without observation. Now, since we saw how vast a field Agriculture opened for the exercise of the observation, it may 1 with propriety, Does Ag - riculture give any opportunity for the exercise of the reasoning which depends upon observation? The question as thus stated needs but little argument to secure an affirmative answer. But at the risk of becoming tedious, a few typical cases may be cited. A child may ob - serve the difference between a cultivated and an uncultivated bed of flowers and may be taught to apply his reason in accounting for the difference. The same is true In observing the effect of applying or withholding fertilizers. The reason of more than five hundred boys was in active operation during the past year when the great ex - periment was going on preparatory to the mid-winter corn contest. Every change of method in cultivation of the soil, in selecting and manner of planting seed, in the care of animals, either for breeding or feeding, in the rotation of crops, in the rearrangement or relo - cation of farm buildings, in the selection of places for fruit tree* and shade trees, in the location and handling of the water supply, in the fight made against the enemies of both animals and plants from which a profit is obtainable, in the manner of plowing with reference to conserving or discharging the rainfall from the surface, the time of marketing the surplus, the method of securing the crops as to whether intended for use at home or for market — in all these matters which might be multiplied in their details indefinitely, the reason is active, i. e., the mind settles upon what is best to do in a given 10 </seg>

Such service requires, on the part of those in one calling, a knowl - edge of the wants and interests of every other considerable calling, a knowledge of the relations^ ing between one's own calling and all others, and of the relationships among all other callings, and also the relation of the civilization of which he is a part to the other ci\ h past and present.

This seems to teach that though the city is the magnetic center towards which greatness goes, he country is the perpetual source from which comes. It all li us that the mind fed on a constant diet of excellencies is not inspired to equal, still less to surpass, the pro - ducts of art and other human achi. i which minister to it; and also that the mind nurtured among nature's rugged laws, where life is a daily struggle with the unseen of which the plant, or the animal or the storm, or the changing season is but the symbol, is ripened into a toughened fiber that gives it that most desired quality, efficiency. From this it seems fair to conclude that Agriculture has a valid claim for culture value. </seg>
            <seg id="p330">308 STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT discussion relative to the exercise of the imagination. The simpler forms of imagination in which the child sees his own feelings shared in by the plants and animals of his acquaintance give the starting point for many if not all the noblest sentiments of the soul. The child's innate love of beauty in flowers enables the teacher to make garden-culture one of the most refining influences that can be brought into the life. By calling attention occasionally to the unselfishness of the plant in giving of its brightness and sweetness for our enjoyment and pleasure, the child can readily pass to the great moral lessons of kindness and self-sacrifice on the part of human beings for each other. This can be even more perfectly done in the study of domestic animals from the standpoint of the service they render us. The story of "Black Beauty" may well be called the 'Tncle Tom's Cabin" in the crusade for Horses' Rights. This study of plant and animal life on the plane that raises the subject above that of practical usefulness gives one an insight into man's true place in nature. It also shows him his relation to a kind Creator. When it became necessary to show men bow insignificant were their highest works of art, the great Teacher called attention to the lilies of the field, and when man would boast his own superiority he had to be told that no sparrow fell to the ground uncared for. The chances for cultured refinement of feeling and thinking are better among the flowers and herds of the farm than among the crowds of thickly herded men. In all things of the mind the source of greatness, at least of inventive greatness, con - tinues to be the country. So fully impressed with this thought is editor Howells that he goes on to say: "It appears that a child born where he could first wittingly open his eyes upon a noble square, framed in by palaces whose frescoed and sculptured fronts should face in gardened spaces a lovely fountain with groups of statuary glimpsed through the leaves and waters, ought to feel the impulse of creative art far more than a child that first looks out on a barn and a hen-house, with a pump in the foreground, and a wood-shed straggling in the middle distance, and some cattle emerging from the background. Yet the chances are immensely that the farm-born boy will feel the divine influence, which will not visit the soul of the city-born child." From the foregoing discussion it seems reasonable to conclude that, in reply to the first question — Is the study of Agriculture use - ful the answer is. Yes; in reply to the second question — Does Agricul - ture afford material for mental discipline? the answer is, Yes; in reply to the third question — Can Agriculture contribute to humanizing cul - ture? the answer Is, Yes. Thus do we see that from whatever point ct view the subject is approached, Agriculture gives an affirmative answer to every test that can be applied to any subject, not excepting the richest, in any course of study. </seg>

Beatrice Nebraska, before the Department of Music Education, N. E. A.. Asbury Park, 1906. Music is reputed by its advocates to possess an educational value, but beyond the vague notion that it refines, people have, In the main, no views as to how it educates or why. No proposition is more uni - versally established than that young people profit by hearing music and by taking part In it; and on no proposition i analysis less often brought to bear. The singing of songs in the public schools of America is thought by all classes of people to promote the pleasure and happiness of the pupils; incidental instruction in the rudiments of vocal music by the regular teacher is, in most schools, rather reluctantly tolerated as one of the demands of the complex civilization of t' .vhile the systematic course of study in vocal music directed by a super - visor who is a specialist is maintained as yet against considerable opposition, in fact, the faint murmers of heard amid the cries of "fad," "us.

It may be said here, that those who desire to see the gospel of good music and its appreciation propagated, hail with delight the mul - tiplying numbers of summer schools of methods and normal schools v.here teachers learn to teach public school music. All this does not imply that the supervisor should not be an expert in his line, should not be a master of the theory of music, but that in addition to these really essential qualifications, he should be ;i trained educator, an organizer, a harmonizer, a leader who can in - spire teachers to their best efforts. Yes, the supervisor must teach the how to teach music. ment of music instruction in public schools will result from ment in the music training which grade teachers re - ing their profession and afterwards under the tutor - age of a skillful supervisor. If music instruction possesses a high educational value, and we ve it does, is there any valid reason why teachers should not .re themselves to teach it? Speed the day when a knowledge of at least the rudiments of music shall be a legal requirement for tification. Already certain states have legislated on the subject as the following ■ taken from chapter X of the report of the Com - missioner of Education for 1903 show. Examination in music is re - quired for State Certificates in California, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, New Hampshire and North Dakota; for Probationary Elementary Grade Certificates in Massachusetts: for First Grade Primary Certifi - cates in Washington; for Special County Certificates in New .T&gt; i ■while such an examination is optional for State Certificates in Mis - souri, and may be required for County Primary Certificates in Nevada. When teachers i&gt; ruination in music for certifica - tion, the subject will cease to be considered an accomplishment and will be placed upon the same basis as arithmetic and geography. Just as long as teachers are not expected to make themselves competent to impart instruction in this branch of study, and the supervisor at - tempts to do all or nearly all of the teaching, just that long, will mu - sic be considered uncommon, the gift of the few and an unessential part of the curriculum. But some will say that when such conditions are realized super - visors will be needed no more than supervisors of reading and ge - ography. On the contrary, when that time comes, supervision will be in the highest type professional. So far nothing has been said of the large majority of schools too small or financially too weak to employ a specialist in vocal music. This number includes small towns, villages, and rural schools, in which are found approximately 66 2-3 per cent of the entire school enroll- </seg>
            <seg id="p335">313 EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS OF TO-DAY ment of the nation. In all of these schools music supervision Is out of the question and the responsibility lies upon the regular teacher. In reality, only a few of the larger schools in each state have such advantages for all or part time. Eastern and central states, on ac- count of denser population, consolidated districts, and greater revenue for school purposes, fare better in this respect than other states as a rule. In Nebraska, for example, whose educational system takes high rank, only twenty-six cities and towns have music supervision. Reflection upon these statements may serve to remind us that as jet music instruction has scarcely touched the schools of America and that if the nation ever becomes musical we must enlist the active co - operation of the common school teacher. Not only this, but we are forced to acknowledge that the grade teacher must be depended upon to teach the children vocal music and in mi without direction. It is just as patent that supervisors must pin their faith to the same grade teacher. It is she who conies in touch with the real life of the pupils, who understands local conditions. It is she who day by cay thinks and plans with the children and through them shapes pub - lic sentiment and moulds public opinion in tht* district. The \&lt; who does not recognize tl tl and direct his influence through her to the people has his lesson to learn. It is the grade teacher who arouses a lasting interest in music and gets boys and girls to want to sing, and not the supervisor who reaches them so remotely. It is she who will convince the people that music has an educational value and that it is not an expensive fad. The influence of the supervisor must flow as an electric current through the teacher to pupils and people, with a mutual confidence whic!: - a faultless conductor. If the grade teacher Is omitted in the calculation, the spark will never leap the gap which always exists between a supervising officer and the people themselves. It is the grade teacher who must be depended upon to create a musical spirit in America. When we concede her overshadowing influence in the schoolroom and community, when ors learn to recognize her competency in handling children, when the efforts of the supervisor are directed towards the teaching of teachers how to teach, then music in our schools will be taught much more efficiently than it is now. The supervisor is much, but the grade teacher is more. "She is the backbone of the teaching force." not excepting superintendent or any other supervising officer. </seg>

            <seg id="p338">316 STATE SUPERINT1 - REPORT The composition of a school library is perhaps discussed too frequently to need much comment here. There should first of all be reference books. There should be books for the lower grades as well as for the high school. The English department should i.ot be stocked up with uninteresting classics to the exclusion of ma - terial for other departments or of general interest. There should be some fiction even in a small school library, because the child mind even more than the adult mind craves a certain amount of the romantic, and libraries, like courses of study, should be based upon the needs and capabilities of the readers. The majority of teachers, however, have to deal with the school librarj- as it already exists, rather than to have the pleasure of purchasing a new one from some ideal book list. The problem is how to make the best use of the books at hand. A library is a sort of tool in the hands of the teacher. Its efficiency varies according to the skill of the one using it. In the hands of a clever manipula - tor it is capable of producing marvelous results, but managed by an unskilled workman it will yield only what is homely and shape - la*. One of the most valuable kinds of supplementary work in school is that in connection with the library reference books. The student should be taught how to use reference Ixxik*. We frequent - ly have students come into our library who do not know how to use an encyclopedia. A dictionary is to them simply a book in which to find the meaning of words. All the markings which show whether a word is foreign, obsolete, or not in good use, and all the wealth of information in the back of an ordinary unabridged dictionary are as unexplored and useless territory. The Century Dictionary is unheard of, as are likewise the classical dictionaries. Poole's Index, books of quotations and facts, year-books, almanacs, and all publications of a similar nature. Many of them are un - aware that the bound volumes of magazines are mines of wealth. itly a girl who is a graduate of an accredited high school in this - looking for some material for a paper fissioned her by of sociology. The librarian helped her to find several magazine references in Poole's Index and directed her to the shelves infnj* the bound volumes. Presently she came hack and asked in a bewildered way: "Do I have to look in different things for each one of these?" Accustomed only to studying a definite number of ned pages in he: had no idea whatever of In - ndent investigation. Not long ago I heard a librarian say she did wish schools would teach the studenta to know the difference between a table of con - and an index. Perhaps it may seem that all students would understand this simple distinction. Yet only a few .days after I had heard this remark, a student who had been directed to find cer- </seg>

A student may be excused for his ignorance of a library cata - logue, tx srd-catalogues are not likely to be used in small libraries. But the catalogue would not. be the source of so much per - plexity and trouble if the student had been given his due share of training in the use of books and the investigation of sub student ought to be so quickened in his intellectual conscience that he will be constrained to go to the dictionary, encyclopedia, or other reference book about every subject in which he is int. &gt;tan - i ia.ll, quoting from Emerson, says: "If you have the most fleet - ing interest in anything whatever, you are grieving the Holy Spirit if you do not run to the library with all 1 I to feed that interest before it cools." Of course in this respect, as in all others, the teacher must sincerely practice what he preaches. Another important use of the school library is to furnish ma - terial for actual recitation room work. For example pcrhapl Mographi' li of Whittier, following a study of "Snowbound," may be accompanied by a request for each pupil to read and report upon some short poem of Whittier's not previously read, to be found iii the library volume. Sometimes the teacher may read in class from the library books. If judiciously and beautifully done, this n fails to arouse it' 1 on it is a good plan, ly in the lower grades to have the pupils give oral reports of wl have read. This is usually better than having written reproductions. The latter is often a rather deadening process, but telling the story to a company of interested listeners has a stimulating, vivifying effect, quickening the mental activities and ministering to a laudable de - sire to please and entertain. Last week I heard an interesting lesson In what the children who were of the sixth grade in the training school, called their "supplementary reading class." They had spent the previous period in reading whatever story they chose from the book that had been given them. Then, as they were called upon, they stood in front of the class and told their stories in a surprisingly clear way, using a vocabulary that would have been a credit to a high school student. First, a bright-eyed little Miss gave a long Greek legend, including the riddle of the sphinx. Next, a boy, always called dull and stu - pid, was called upon. I expected a few disjointed sentences, but to my surprise he gave a clear pleasing story of a family of lions, warm - ing to his subject as he proceeded, and taking a real delight in tell - ing his story. The third speaker was a timid lad, bright enough, but afraid to talk. He took his place before the class with evident embarrassment at my presence. In a few minutes he seemed to forget all about everything except his story of the discovery of Lake Champlain, the search for the Northwest passage and the trouble ■with the Iroquois Indians. These three stories occupied the half- </seg>

Of course independ - ent judgment as to the value of books can be developed only by a course in English. But a student has a right to know something of how books rank in the judgment of those who are supposed to know.

If a boy has a mania for collecting, let him collect stamps or something else that will arouse his interest in historical or scientific reading. If he cares only for making things, give him something like the "American Boy's Handy Book." In our library, who care nothing for the general periodicals, read the ■itific American" nearly into holes every week. When a boy is all excited over pirates and wild Indians, he will read vigorous ex - citing books or nothing. Then is the time to give him Stevenson and Kipling, Stanley's Explorations, or the travels of Daniel Boone and John C. Fremont. When a girl is at the sentimental age, her emo- </seg>

Wholesome, sweet stories flfce the Alcott stories or Mrs. Wiggins' books will minister to her tastes and at the same time furnish new, fresh, pleasant thoughts. In every high school, and every other school there are some students who do not read at all, owing to lack of time and pressure of school work. They study, or think they study from morning un - til a late bedtime, not even looking at a daily paper. They do not discover what magazines are in the library nor find out the names of a single new book. They are conscientious in their course, feel - ing that they would be robbing their studies of their lawful time if they do U &gt;K- Such students are in danger of most effectually breaking up the reading habit, instead of establish - ing and strengthening it. In such t is the teacher's business to sin sign, and otherwise inveigle the pupil into useful read - ing without causing him to do violence to his conscience — a thing always to be avoided. On the other hand, there are nearly always some students who read too much. They read when they ought to be studying; read when they ought to be helping their parents; read when they ought to be sleeping. They live constantly in a glamor of unreality, and are peevish and unwilling to attend to their ordinary tasks. A girl told me recently that she loved above all things to read, and that she read every minute 'iuld get. Her recitations showed that she probably read a good many more minutes than she could legally get for the purpo&gt; when asked to name some of the boo^ &lt;uld think of only i very few, and those were inane A young man in our school is failing in his work. The re - monstrances of his teachers and the advice of his friends seem to be of no avail. He has excellent ability and a good opportunity of study, but he 1b so addicted to novel-reading that his very will-power seems to be gone. He reads ordinarily good fiction if it happens to fall in his way, but most of his time is occupied with worthless sto - ries that leave him restless, listless, and inattentive to the serious things of life. The school library has its mission to students who read too much as well as to those who read too little. It can substitute good books for poor. It can supply material for the teacher to use in assigning detailed work that will necessitate careful study. The best antidote for poor reading is the substitution of a kind that will continue to interest but will also cause the student to exert his own powers. Not long ago I had a class report all the books they could re - member of ever reading. The students were of about the ninth grade, but with much more discrepancy in age than in a high school ninth grade. Thirty students reported a total of 1,711 books, making an average of 56. The largest number reported was 200, the smallest 14. However there were some students in the class who made no written report. Among these was a young man of perhaps twenty- </seg>

The ethical influence of a lili ..It in more ways than one. First, such i n high school studen make in a library lead to independence of opinion. The student who ex - amines both sides of a question for d&gt; in the way to become I man who does his own thinking, and a man who thinks for himself is not of the kind that compose mobs and en - gage in riots. Calm and patriotic, he examines and consid - ers instead of being swayed by the opinions of wild politicians. Sec - ond, a library of well used reference books ought to do a good deal toward breaking up habits of mental laziness. A student who can - not make himself look up words in the dictionary may not miss very much knowledge, but every time he silences his dictionary conscience he is binding himself by a habit that will weaken him intellectually. A student who holds himself to looking up words, allusions, and his - torical references, is mentally enlivened so that he can think more clearly. His mind becomes trained to habits of activity instead of passivity. Bad mental habits are as weakening as bad physical habits. The world recognizes that when the physical laws of nature are violated, retribution follows, swift and proportioned to the of - fense. Yet the same persons will not recognize that lazy, slipshod, 31 </seg>
            <seg id="p344">322 S RKPORT wandering habits of thought are followed by equally sure retribution in the loss of mental power. I once heard a teacher say that most of us were mentally so lazy that i ]&gt;• did five minutes of real thinking in a week. It sounds like an astonishing exaggeration, but a little honest self-examination shows that there is only too much unpleasantly astonishing truth. Third, a student who has become accustonu'd to in\ the questions of the day by the use of the school librar&gt; kely to leave school with the opinion that edu - cation is an hing. His text-books alone may give him the idea that school work deals only with things of the past, but his supplementary work in hi will show that it is highly a thing of the present. A student who leaves school con - sidering the whole system of education as unpractical will be a dan - gerous citizen.

It is idle t. t a book, which he is enough Interested in to read, has no infl \ girl who weeps over the woes of an imaginary heroine, or the boy who grows ex - over the wild adventures of an explorer, loses or gains, ac - cording to the general tenor of the story.

Hut the teacher cannot give what ho him - self does not mini inspire his students to an investiga - tive and scholarly attitude unless he himself is a reader and an in - vestigator. It is often said that a love of books, music, pictures or nature is contagious. Generally students will catch something of a teacher's enthusiasm for anything whatever. He influences more by what he is than by what he says. If he is enthusiastic and earnest ir his use of the library, his students will likely fall into a habit of reading much. The supplementary reading required by teachers and furnished by the school library is perhaps more far-reaching in its moral re - sults than anything else in the school course can be alone, because li Is likely to have a greater effect in forming the ideals of the stu - dent. And the true teacher recognizes that nothing In this world is of so much Importance as that the student have true ideals. </seg>

The following resolutions were adopted by the committee: 1. To report on the work of the first eight grades only. 2. To report upon the principles upon which a high school course should be based, leaving the working out of the plan to a fu - ture commit!. 3. To make no attempt to outline all phases of English but to emphasize certain important ones, leaving others to be taken up later. The purpose of the work in English should be (1) to secure freedom of expression, (2) to secure correctness of expression, (3) to enlarge the vocabulary, (4) to teach pupils to connect both oral tind written expression with thought, and (5) to correlate literature with technical English as a medium for culture- These five purposes involve many things, each of which is, In itself, of the utmost importance. With the first, however, the primary teacher is most concerned. It is easy to say, " encourage the child to express himself," but to do this in the best sense is an altogether different matter. To obtain freedom of expression there must first be created a desire for expression, and herein lies the teacher's para - mount responsibility. To select those topics of conversation which come within the understanding and environment of the pupils re - quires much i Every lesson in the curriculum is, in a certain sense, a language lesson, and as such should be borne in mind by the teacher. Care must be taken not to interfere with the thought or make thought im - possible by untimely correction or criticism. Those points which noed correction should be made note of and later should be drilled upon until the use of the correct form becomes a fixed habit. The exercises in the elements of literature should be both con - structive and Interpretative, and as far as possible constructive, or synthetic, work upon each should precede the analytic, or interpre - tative. Your committee beg leave to submit the following outline FIRST GRADE I. Technical English.

Examples of the mode of association may be found in "The Tales of a Traveler." This book will furnish also some material for the study of the story. The mode of mystery may receive attention here.

The note-books in the study of literature should be re - garded as part of the composition work, and time should be allowed for their careful preparation. III. Interpretative English The following selections contain material suitable for the Eleventh Grade: Browning. .1 Poems; Maclaren, -ide the Bonnie Brier Bush;" Chaplin, "Eli." "The Vil - lage Convict." If time permits, one of Tennyson's Idylls or its equivalent, may be read. It is suggested that the se - lections be studied in the order mentioned above. The stories of "Eli" and "The Village Convict" will fur - nish excellent material for a study of visualization, charac - ter and mood. They may also form a basis for the study of story construction. ' It is assumed that topics suggested before will be here kept in mind, and adapted to the particular selection of prose or verse In hand.

Consolidate. or centralize, the weak districts into a common central school, conveying the pu pils from every part of the greater district or the con - gressional township to and from the central schools by means of cov ered vans or wagons, in charge of clean, capable, careful drivers.

With a library room, music, debating club, etc., our boys and girls will hesitate to leave home and such a school for the un - certainties of city life. Centralization will not only keep the boys on the farm but it will help to keep the big boys in school. Arguments against consolidation are generally based on some of the following reasons: 1. Natural proneness of some people to object to the removal of any ancient land mark or to any innovation, how - ever worthy the measure or however well received elsewhere. 2. Lo - cal jealousy on the part of some who fear that some other section of the proposed centralized district will have greater advantages than that of their own, even though the conditions for themselves and </seg>

Over thirt igo, after having experienced for years the common results in communities as they grow older and become more thickly populated — the moving of the rural population to the cities, towns and villages,— the state leg - islature of Massachusetts framed a law by which they began central - izing and transporting pupils in public vans or wagons. About ten years later the plan had reached Ohio. In a few years it had spread into Indiana and Illinois, later into Iowa, and now Nebraska is at the point where serious consideration must be given to a plan of this kind. </seg>

Yet because of the fact that so </seg>
            <seg id="p382">360 3 RKPORT touch bad material is committed to them, and because of the further fact that many who are beyond the juvenile court age (sixteen years) are sent as punishment for crime, instead of being committed to the penitentiary, and also because of the stigma that attaches to the child in after life, our court is averse to sending these children under six - teen years, except as a last resort, when no other place can hold the child and develop in him a right character, or when the criminal in - stinct has developed to such an extent as to render him unfit for any other place. In my judgment the greatest benefit to be derived from the juve - r.He court law will come as a result of the change from the old system of treating delinquent children as criminals. I nave seen timid children shrink in terror from the open iron barred door of the jail, after having been arrested for some misde - meanor, and after being incarcerated over night with older criminals, I have known the same children to come out hardened, ready to boast of the fact that they had been in jail, and to start right out on a life of crime. This system has produced more criminals than all of our and reformatories combined have reformed. The one great primary cause of delinquency of children, and the I,rimary cause of the increase of crime, is the mismanagement of the homes, through ignorance, incompetency, indifference, or viciousness on the part of part One of the most important offices of the juvenile court and pro - bation officers is to furnish advice, instruction, and to assist parents in the control of wayward children, and to endeavor to improve con - ditions in the home. As a rule I have found parents who have failed to prevent their children from going wrong, realize the fact, and are discouraged be - • of it. to be ready and willing to act upon any suggestion, or adopt any method proposed by the Court or probation officer, and co - operate with them in an endeavor to save their children. To illus - trate I will give a case in point, one of many similar cases. It was h ible family with two boys ten and twelve years of age, bright, intelligent little fellows, but wayward and beyond the control of parents. The father was a traveling man, absent from home most of the time, proud and stern in demeanor. When at home, if he noticed his children at all, it was with a frown, or a sharp rebuke. The children feared him but did not respect him. The mother, a good woman but frail and indulgent, blamed the school, the teachers, the neighbors and everybody except herself and the children for their waywardness, believed all that the children re - ported to her, upheld them in their complaints, criticised and con - demned the school authorities, the teachers and neighbors in the children's presence. As a result the children hated their teacher, re - fused to attend school, were ■: tful and insolent to neighbors, </seg>

They loafed on the I night, fell into bad «•, learned to smoke cig - arettes, and were finally ling. The father was fu - rious as he expressed it, "the boys had disgraced his name, which had never before been tarnished with crime." He insisted that they should be severely punished. "Send them to the reform school, or to the penitentiary," he said. The mother was heart broken and discouraged. She tearfully and very reluctantly assented to the suggestion of her husband that the boys be sent to the Industrial School. The Court and probation officer had ■ pi Ik with the boys, they appeared penitent and begged hard for "one more chance," and then after a plain heart to heart talk with the parents, in which it was shown them that they were in fact the real parties who were to blani' decided to give the boys another chance under the care and supervision of the probation officer. The father was doubtful, but consented. The mother was glad and readily promised to do her part and to follow faithfully every instruction of the Court, and to carry out to the letter every suggestion of the officer. The boys were taken to school. A private talk with the teacher brought about a better understanding between her and the boys. The home was visited frequently. The boys were kept there at night. They nuired to report frequently to the Court and probation officer. The conditions at home improved. This happened more than a year ago, and the father and mother are profuse in their expressions of gratitude to the juvenile court, for saving their boys, and the boys, too, are friends of the Court, and I am certain on the road to good citizenship.

The Juvenile Court of Douglas County was organized Marc! 1905, in compliance with the provisions of the lav. March 8, which by reason of its emergency cla me operative at once. The board of judges of the district court met for the purpose of inaugurating t tit- work of the new division ai d from their number Judgt A.

The judges then cast about for a committiee on juvenile court work, to be composed of well-informed. hose civic loyalty would had them to make personal sacrifices, if need be, for the welfare of the new venture in behalf of the child' Mrs. Draper Smith. Miss Margaret McCarthy, Attorney Henry W.

Number of visits in the homes in the county by the officers, 3,000. These i: tig calls have touched all classes and have dis - closed many kinds of evil and suffering, among which was a wretched mother who was so lost to common decency as to allow the profana - tion of the person of her 14-year-old daughter, with no other defense than that she was too young to be hurt. Patience, labor and sym - pathy have often brought help. Many schools have been visited to secure their records of our wards. Many saloonkeepers have been warned against selling liquor to minors; a vigilant eye is kept on the owners of slot machines and all gambling devices. The war against pool rooms and dance halls will be fearlessly waged until they are brought under the rules and regulations provided by the law. Effective work is being accomplished through the adult delinquent section of the law. One father, for ruining his own daughter, was sent to the peni - tentiary for six years. Another gray-haired man, convicted of a statutory crime against 14-year-old girl, sentenced to five years in the penitentiary. An- other gray-haired man awaiting trial to answer to a statutory offense. One man now in jail for teaching immorality to little boys. One man fined $50 for insulting a young girl. Two fathers for cruelly neglecting their families, out on bonds. Two grain^*ealers out on bonds. Two junk dealers out on bonds. One grain dealer, for buying stolen grain, fined $100.

The juvenile court is a carefully planned civic fffort to destroy the criminal class by cutting off its recruiting forces. Its machinery provides for the handling of children's misdemeanors in a manner commensurate with the needs of the c;&lt; The law recognizes no child as a criminal. As a delinquent child be may receive correction, admonition and advice. If honor and in - dustiy cannot be aroused within him in his i.atura: home he be removed to better conditions. If his condition is so serious as to need still more restraint, discipline and training he may be sent to a state school. A noted Xebraskan, who has made a study of these matters, "I know of no law that has been enacted that can measure in impor - tance with the juvenile law. Its corrective and pre'. influences are far-reaching and cannot be m* The great number of chil - dren who have come directly \inder its workings are only a handful when compared to those who have been restrained from wrong and influenced for right from its indirect influences. Since it has been in operation there are better homes, better parents, better attendance at school, better conducted businesses, better municipal government, and a general awakening of the people in the manner and method of dealing with erring children." I will also say with respect to the property stolen by children 95 per cent of it hns i vered, and we have not lost over ■ cent of our wards during the entire year. (Applause.) Judge Sutton — We are having Chicago weather here today and we also have here two distinguished gentlemen from Chicago. We have with us Prof. Henry W. Thurston, who of the juvenile court work and who is the chief juvenile officer of Chicago. We have also with us Judge Julian W. Mack, who over the juvenile court at Chicago. I will call upon Professor Thurston, who will talk (o us about the juvenile work in Chicago and what it has accomplished there. Henry W. Thurston: — Mr. Chairman and friends: I want to con - gratulate you first of all upon the magnificent work which has been done in this city during this first year of the juvenile court work, and to acknowledge my personal indebtedness to those connected with the court for the generous hospitality that has been extended to Judge Mack and myself since early this morning. I have learned very much which will be helpful to me in my work as I go back to Chicago in connection with the newsboys' work here, in connection with the detention school, especially in conversation with your probation officer, Mogy, and with Judge Sutton, judge of your juvenile court. </seg>
            <seg id="p388">366 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT It is a wonderful work we are engaged in. I don't know any way to account for the wonderful growth of this juvenile court move - .pon the basis of the fact that society has at last become consi Its duty and its opportunity with reference to the little child- In America, for man; prided ourselves upon our ability to dis* I to develop every natural resource of this mag - nt land. Everything in the soil and mine, and quarry, and for - est, and stream is sought out and developed, and made to contribute some of its riches to this land, and we look down upon countries like China, which have been blind for centuries of time to their magnifi - cent natural r» and hitherto we have done something toward the discovery and of the resources of our little children. We have prid^ :or many years upon the development of our edu - cational system, our great common schools, and yet, within thes&gt; we have been finding out that many a boy and many a girl has somehow failed to be discovered, failed to have the magnificent bilities of manhood and womanhood in them discovered and de - veloped, that somehow of the break-down of the family in cer - tain cases, the failure of the public school to rise to the full height of Its opportunity in other cases, the faults of the city government, the political organization of society, and still other cases, and the indus - trial injustice that has thrust upon us so many great problems in this country: or because of the failure of all those institutions to so co - operate with each other that the child might not fall between, : that during the last few years we have been finding that for some one or more of these reasons we h: numbers of children that must be looked after. ' &lt; iously or unconsciously developing an institution which stands for the principle that every child shall be ! and given a chance in America. The most important question before the American people is not raction question of a city or the rate railway regulation by the national government, or the tariff question, or the Philippine question. or Imperialism, but what kind of children are we bringing up? I say w&gt; ir juvenile courts, which gtand for the care of child who fails to sret the proper care in some other way, and I think of ■ •■ in the Bible, when- 'When my father and my mother forsake me. then the Ix&gt;rd shall take me up." And we are coming, in th- that God's work in this world is to be done through human agency. We can. with all due reverence say, her and my mother forsake me. then the state shall take me up," and there is no more sacred duty than that undertaken by • of us who are working in the juvenile court. Now, when we began to look after these children, and bring them into one court, as we do in Chicago, and as I understand you do here in Omaha, and just began to look after those who are neglected and delinquent, the number of them and the need of them becomes ap - palling. In Chicago during the last year we have had 4,088 new </seg>
            <seg id="p389">367 cases filed in the juvenile court, a great number more, whose number is not recorded, who have been looked after by our officers outside of the court. I wonder if you can think of some great mass of children to compare that number with. Many of our public school buildings have twenty teachers, with fifty children in a room. That makes 1 OM children, and as you go by a schoolhouse at the close of the session and see the boys and girls tumbling pellmell out of doors, sometimes almost out of the windows, you think that a schoolhouse full of children is a large number, and yet four of these great school buildings emptied of their children, to file in a mournful and sad procession before the judge of the juvenile court, to whisper out and to explain their needs and their faults, their hopes and their possibil - ities, and as they come before the judge, what is it possible for this new agency and all the juvenile court to do for the child? It never has been done equally well before, as the same mysterious resources were never before discovered in society, or shall it be a new applica - tion of the forces that have long existed? The only question which ean be asked in the juvenile court with reference to this chiM he comes so near the judge that he can put his hand upon its shoul - der, or listen to the whispered confidences of the little girl, is what st for this child. No question of politics, no question of influ - of any kind, no question of moral relationship shall be allowed to interfere with the correct answer to that question. What, in view of all the circumstance t for this child? When the judge tries to answer that question he has the possibility of taking the child from its I nd putting it in an institution, temporarily or perma - nently. If necessary. The judge himself. Judge Mack, will speak, per - haps, more particularly on how vital in the life of the child, institu - tional life is. but even if it were not futile, from the point of view of the child's life, how soon our institutions get filled Ours are crowded to the doors. Standing room only in almost all of them all the time. And so we turn to the other possibility of dealing with the child, and the other institutions . and will tlwaj necessary. Send the child back to his home, to a relative, or friend, or neighbor, and add these words. "I will put you under parole to such and such a probation officer." And I wonder if you people who have heard of the juvenile court and the probation system realize for one moment of time what the burden of responsibility is that is laid upon the probation officer when those words are spoken? For this human life that conn- 'he judge is in some sort of a tangle, e\en at the early years of a child, and if that tangle is to be straight - ened out, and this boy's possibilities are to be discovered and developed, this probation officer, through his or her personality, through her heart and understanding and sympathy, is to bring into this child's life that personality and helpfulness which it never had before, or is to di- iinewhere in the neighborhood, somewhere within the surroundings of that boy or that girl, some friend who can bring to that child the divine touch through which alone redemption can come. </seg>
            <seg id="p390">368 The juvenile court is expected to bring its personality into touch with the personality of the child, but it cannot be expected to do this. It is not an institution that will take care of these dependents and delinquents by itself; this can only be done through some other part of its machinery. It is only through these officers or persons, in i&gt;r, can the child be redeemed, and when we add to the task that is thrown on the probation officer in one case — and if there were time I would like to give some of the illustrations of the difficulty in dealing with the child — when we add to the task in one case the number that we are compelled to give to one officer in Chi - cago, and in man the task becomes overwhelming, unless we all upon &gt;nd those who are interested, to help to a very mm! ban they realize now to be necessary. now have 3,^00 children on parole in Chicago, and we have twenty-two officers in the pay of the county, and we have about ei^ht officers who are paid by private subscription. But for these officers ■who nre in the pay of the county the average number of children un - der their care 1 in some of the congested district number r a high as 175, and in one case 200 children — each life a tangled Iff- hers are overloaded with children in olroom, and yet our machinery is so crowded that when we take up this new work to look after the welfare of the child we are unable to get the public support to pay for officers enough to do the work properly. Of course we expect to ask the public, as you o be asked here to appropriate sufficient money to hir -t men and the best women in your community to do this work. If you need higher qualities in :i in a Sun - day school teacher, i- her of the public school, what kind of qualities, do you think, are needed in the man and the woman who are to bring redemption to the child of the juvenile court? And then, re also goinp n Chicago, as I hopf you are here, for vol - ho will come to the aid of these probation officers, who will stand in -five or fifty, or one hundred, perhaps, in seme of our districts, behind the probation officer ready to be sent, a man ;in who needs the help of a young man, and the woman to this girl, and so on, so that there may be brought into those lives the personal touch which an officer in charge of fifty or seventy, or one hundred, or two hundred children, cannot by any possibility bring in her own person. But there is another kind of work which the probation officer has to do, of which I will speak just one word. There are a large number of cases which our probation officers have that have never been before the court that have to be looked after; and in our city even if those volunteer workers, persons who do not go to the juven - ile court at all, volunteer to care for one of these wards of the court, I believe that it is possible for us to open our eyes to the needs of the boys and the girls who come in contact with our own boys and girls in the schools and in the homes. How many of us, when our </seg>

Papa, I believe Sammy is not a very good boy," and upon inquiry it was found out that he was doing some things the child of my friend n told not to do. T'pon further in - quiry, It v as found out that the father of the boy f a great deal of the time, that the mother w;&gt;s a hard working woman and did not have a chance to take care of her child as well as she ought to, and this boy v a^ inclined to go to the bad, but he had a fine voice and singer in the school, the public school to which he went. The father says, "Suppose you invite this boy to your house and let him sire with mother and us; we have a piano. I suppose he would like to come over?" The boy said, "Yes, I think he would like to come." So they invited him to come, and he sang with them, and ted with their children for several months, and seemed to be a different boy. Under this influence his musical genius was awakening within him. and he seemed to be on the way to a high - er kind of life. He to you mean that sort of thing? That instead of sending that boy away I Invited him in?" I said, "Yes, of course." "Well." he said, "I think I can do that, I think my neighbors can do that." So you might go on giving illustrations — let me give one more. I was speaking at another place, along this line, and a woman camo up to me afterwards, a woman who had a very decided brogue, foreign born woman, but whose soul shone in her eyes, who had com - mon sense, and who had achieved some success in this life, and she said, "I want to give you an illustration of what I think you mean," and then she told me a story about a boy who was the son of a hard working woman, who had been a truant from school and could not be dragged to go to school; his mother could not look after him be - cause she had to work. She said, "I told my boy to take him along to school. He was two years younger than this boy; one was 9 years old, where the other was 11. I said 'Paul, do you think you and I could get James to go to school?" And after I had talked with him a while, he said: 'Yes, I will try and help, 1 " and so she went over to the mother of the other boy and talked with the boy himself, and they agreed that Paul was to go every morning to the school with him. u </seg>

A little thing to do. The ver came into the juvenile court. But 1 do not believe you could help Mogy Bernstein and Judge Sutton any bet - ter than by doing that kind of thing to strengthen them in their work. -ing I would like to say this: That some of us feel that because our children are looked after, that there is no particular reason why we should look after the children of anybody else, or that we should take very much interest in the juvenile court. Now, I won - der if we : : re awake to the fact of the contagion of typhoid fever and smallpox and yellow fever, and the measles and all that sort of thing In the physical world. I know we are, but I do not believe one-half of the people in this audience are awake to the possibilities of moral contagion that may come from this neglect of the boy, or this neglect of the girl. There is no such thing as shutting ourselves up in our home, or our neighborhood, or our part of the town — even our town as against another town. Moral contagion is just as real and definite and blasting a thing, and it involves the life just as much as physical contagion, and as we must come to the consideration of the question asked by Mrs. Sherlock Perkins Stetson Gillman in the matter of her child, in which sht ,- v ed this question: "How beet can I serve thee. my child?" She n the whole round of possibilities for the child in her beautiful "Shall I give you wealth, honor, position, power, or all of these?"

We must save all the chilaren on earth; so let it be. God helping us, we will do it. Judge Sutton — During the last few years, Douglas county ha&gt; been expending approximately $250,000 a ye:ir to catch and punish criminals and not one cent has Douglas county spent to keep little boys and girls from becoming criminals. This vast amount of a quar - ter of a million dollars includes the cost of the police department in Omaha, the cost of the operation of the criminal court, and the cost of the sheriff's office pertaining to criminal cases, and our share of the expense of maintaining the state penitentiary, and yet, after expending this enormous amount of money annually, crime is now in - creasing in Omaha, and 1b increasing in all the large cities of the United States, or nearly all of them. Students of criminology have been Investigating the problem of the treatment of crime and criminals. </seg>
            <seg id="p393">371 EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS OF TO-DAY and have come to the conclusion that we have been pursuing the wrong system; that instead of punishing the criminal at maturity, we ought to keep these little boys and girls from becoming criminals. This is the work of the juvenile court, and the juvenile court of Omaha, and all of the departments of the court, need the help and the co-operation of every sincere, God-fearing and liberty-loving citizen in Omaha and Douglas county. I trespass upon the time of Judge Mack just to say these few words because I have the opportunity again. Omaha ought to feel very proud this afternoon to have with us such a distinguished citizen as Judge Julian W. Mack of Chicago. Chicago could afford to pay Judge Mack ?10,f&gt;00 a year for presiding over its juvenile court, and could still congratulate itself upon having made a good invest - ment. The judges in Omaha receive $2,500 a year for doing the work of the juvenile court, together with their other judicial work. But the Juvenile work is a great work; it is a work that is going to grow. I am very glad this afternoon to have the pleasure and the honor of introducing to you Judge Mack of Chicago. Judge Julian W. M;ick — Friends; Mr. Thurston and I did not take this little trip in the expectation that we might be able to teach the people of the west anything new in regard to the juvenile court. We went to Denver to learn at the fountain; we came to Omaha in the firm expectation that we would take away with us some lessons that we could apply in Chicago, and I want to congratulate the citi - zens of Omaha on the work that is being done here for the children. I believe that I am acquainted, either personally or through their work, with most of the juvenile workers of the country, both judges and pro - bation officers, and in no spirit of flattery or exaggeration do I say that you are to be congratulated in having now, and in having had for so many years among you, that living human dynamo, Mogy. (Applause). Long before the juvenile court was established here, long before the juvenile courts were established anywhere, he was doing the work that we are trying to have done all over the country, rnd in talking with him today, and asking various questions, to see what his views were. I found that he had the most progressive views on every phase of this work; that there was not a single thought that was not uplifting and that did not mean that the children of Omaha have found a man that is going to help them and save them. (Ap - plause.) I only wish that we had one such In Chicago to supple - ment the work Mr. Thurston and the court is trying to do. And what is all this juvenile court work, what does it mean? Is there anything so new about it? Hasn't the state, haven't the people always cared for the children? Haven't we always tried to do our duty by them? In a measure, yes. And in one branch of the juvenile court work there is no new fundamental principle. The neglected orphan and the dependent child is the ward of the state and when it has lost by death, misfortune, depravity or otherwise the care of Its natural parents the state will step in and do the work that these parents should have done: and in caring for our dependent </seg>

But even here the juvenile court is ■opting to carry out the most prov ideas. \ o we thought that all orphan children should be be put in orphan asylums and rested there n thinkers along child-saving lii.es don't \e in that way any more; they know that every child individual love, individual now that in no institution, no &gt;r the matron may be, ran the that individual love that we want I i our children, and we want our children, if we should be taken away, to haw. When you get home and your little one comes to you and pours out its petty troubles and its heart-burns, you listen patiently; you know that they amount to nothing at all, but you do not say that to the child. You know that for him thes t roubles are real bur - dens, and the mother's : to receive those burdens; to permit the child to open up its heart. You give it that in - dividual opportunity t) human being craves. No superintendent cu an orphan asyhini can devote his time or his thoughts amongst the three, four, M ndred children in such measure that the child will come to him freelj with all Us jxtty troubles. And what is the t? The poor little soul is opi' d it pours out its troubles in hot tears in the solitude of its bed. Now, what modern workers in child-saving want i liese little ones may find a foster par - ent and not an institution, and all juvenile courts, in dealing with ildren, aim, so ft le, to find homes for the children. And I hare been delighted to know that in the work here you have ul in finding homes; so ful that your ra tell me there "re more places for children than there are children for a home. And yet, the time may come when it will be difficult to find those homes, and therefore, I say to you, you who may have no children to brightsn your lives, take to yourself some or - phan, some dependent, some poor litt: mother's heart, those who have not been blessed with children of their own, take some little stranger and give to him that love that is only wait - ing for an opportunity to pour itself out; make that little life happy, and assuredly you will make your own life happier. In this way the le can do so much and can be of the greatest assistance to the juvenile courts. But, as I said, the care of the dependent child does iot mark anything distinctly new in the world. It is, in the case of the delinquent child that the new feature comes into our jurispru - dence. It has always been basic in our criminal law that when a ■n has reached the age of criminal responsibiliy, the age of 7, or 10, or 12, and there Is a difference in different states; whenever the child has reached that age he is dealt with exactly like the adult. Our common law made no distinction whatever. The child who had broken the law must, like the adult, be punished. The author - ity of the state must be vindicated. Our offenders must be deterred from committing like crime. That is the underlying theory of our </seg>
            <seg id="p395">373 .VTIOXAL, PROBLE1 DAY criminal jurisprudence, and the result was the child was arrested, put In the police station, bound over to the grand Jury, where they have grand juries, indicted, brought before the criminal court, con - victed and sentenced to jail, to the penitentiary, the house of cor - rection, ;ind during all the period from the first day of the arrest mingling with the vagabonds and the harlots and the criminals of adult years. Saved? No thought of saving. Damned, and damned forever; contaminated, criminalized. All of the good that there is latent in the child crushed by the treatment that the state gave to It. All that was bad brought out through contact and association. True, during the last century, ameliorating influences were at play. We established reform schools Instead of penitentiaries for juvenile offenders. Incidentally to the basic principles of punishment, with its deterring infli incidental, I say, to this — came the idea that the child might be helped, so that when It left the prison It mipht at least know a trade. That was a grand thought, but it was not sufficient ■ it. was only incidental. The juvenile court legislation represents this theory, that with the delinquent, just as the dependent child, the state is the greater parent; that every child within its borders is its ward: that when the natural parent fails in its d'lty or Is unable, no matter how good he may be, to perform his duty to the child, the state must step in. the state must take charge ct its ward, not to punish, to damn, to condemn the child — no, as the kind but stern parent, to train the child, to educate, to raise him up to decent citizenship, to eradicate those evil tendencies that have produced the pnrticular wrongdoing, to bring out the jrood that Is latent in every human being, so that in the end the child may be a good, decent man or woman. That is the basic idea of the juve - nile court, and, therefore, in dealing with the child, the delinquent child that comes before the judge, the problem presented is not a lf-p.il one, but purely a human one. There is no type, there are no ■ is all Individual work; and individual work is the only true work. The educational idea is uppermost: the one thought is, how i? this child to be dealt with in order that he may turn out good? The problem, of course, is not an easy one. We have not yet solved the difficulty; we have not yet solved the methods by which the desired results can be procured. We have the same difficulties that the teacher has, for the teacher's work Is exactly the same. The true teacher does not regard her class as a unit. The true teacher knows that her class is so many individ - uals. The true teacher knows that her work will be successful only in the measure that she learns the individuality of each child, and that she gives to each child that human sympathy, that human Interest, that human care and thought that the individual needs of each individual child demands. That teacher's work is our work and. therefore, I say the work is all human. It is not merely a le - £al one. Now, how do we go about it? There are two things to be done: Either the child has to be sent away, or it has to be </seg>
            <seg id="p396">374 n't s report be left at home. No child ought to be taken from its home if the home is anyway fit — a place fit for the child. There is nothing so strong as the human blood tie; there is nothing more pitiful, noth - ing more saddening, than the sight of a mother clinging to her youngster, or the youngster clinging to the mother, whom it is the duty of the court to separate. No matter how low or degraded the parent may be, the spark of mother love is but seldom deadened; and yet the character of the home, the life of the parent, the mis - erable surroundings, may be such that the good of the child, the one thought of the court, can be attained only by taking it away. And then, as I said before, in taking it away, what we ought to attempt to do is to find some other home for it. Of course, there are children who have lived in wretchedness amidst scenes of drunkenness and debauchery who need a stronger, stricter training preparatory to finding a. home for them. There are children who have gone such lengths in wrongdoing that they need sternness, that they need good elements in the institutional life, and those children we must take away and send to institutions. When a child, however, is placed in a family; when a child is left at home in its own family, what that child needs is that which it has failed in full measure theretofore to receive, and that is the personal care, attention, uplifting influ - ence, of some individual. We attempt, as Mr. Thurston said, to give these to our probation officers. They are there for that purpose; their duty is to go into the homes, to understand the child, to get right into the soul life of the child, in order that they may make their influence for good felt; to get acquainted with the parents, to talk with the parents, and, if needs be, and only as a last resort, to threaten the parents with the loss of the child. Now, one officer having complete charge of a geographical district, having not only this to do with one hundred to two hundred children, but having to be the general guardian of all the children in the district, the one to whom complaints can be made about the wrongdoing of the chil - dren in that region, the one who must look out for the places of evil in the district, that they be not permitted to contaminate the children of the district, cannot properly do all this work. And it is here that the public at large can again be of the greatest ;. to the juvenile court. What we need in this work is for each child that comes into the court, some one man or woman who knows what life ig, who realizes the duty and the obligation implied in that word that comes so lightly to our lips, but that means so much to the real earnest thinker, — human brotherhood. What each one of these children needs, as I say, is some one man or woman who has made a real success of life— not merely a money success — who knows life and who loves the child, and who is willing to give not merely that which you and I and everyone within the hearing of my voice can so easily give because it will come out of some surplus — money, but who 1b willing to give that which is dearest of all — himself, his thought, his heart, his time (applause) — this personal service of the </seg>
            <seg id="p397">AT1ONAI. I'KOBLK' -DAY 375 individual. And I cannot help emphasizing all through this work that it is the individual that counts; the individual that we are look - ing after, the individual man and woman who can help that indi - vidual child. I say, if the juvenile court has for every child just one man and woman who has made a real success of life, who will be to that child a real friend, particularly the young man, the young professional man, the young business man, who can give some of his evenings, some of his thought during the evenings, to the young growing boy, either at school or at work, who can show him things in life; that the good is better than the bad; who can take him to the theater, take him to the ball game, take him into his own home, as Mr. Thurston said those other people have done; take him into his own home and show him how a decent man lives, don't you know that that boy is saved? And let a good, decent, honest woman in - terest herself in the young girl that is just going astray, or in the young girl that has pone astray: don't let society lift up its hands to crush her; no. let society lift up its strong arms to sustain her rnd to show her that there is always hope and always room for the repentant sinner. (Applau You have not any idea, ladies and gentlemen, how far-reaching and deep-seated is the trouble with the young girls and the young boys. I am not surprised any more when I get cases of that kind every juvenile court day in Chicago; I am no longer surprised when I am told that in smaller communi h as yours, the same state of affairs exist. Depravity of the worst type in little girls and little boys, 10, 11 and 12 years of age, and those children are in our schools; those children are the Mi of our children. Aye, per - haps the wrong strikes home without our knowing it. I say to you that there is nothing more important in the world than for the father and mother to be the real companion of their child. (Applause.) if you can make your child feel that you are not merely the parent, with the parental authority, but that you are the companion, the chum, the friend, eager to share in the child's thoughts, willing to enjoy and to encourage the child in its pleasure, the boy in his sports, you have conquered your child I applause), you have saved him from go - ing wrong. If you fail in this. I warn you of the dangers ahead. And this problem that Mr. Thurston pointed out — of the moral contagion — what does it mean? That we cannot raise our boys and pirls alone? Nay. put it from the standpoint of our duty, morally, as members of the human family, to assist our neighbor. Put it on the more selfish standpoint of protecting ourselves, and we will be (tuick to realize the duty to assist others. We must see to It, we fnthers and mothers, and teachers; and I speak as one who hs&gt;s been and is still a teacher; we must see to It that we know the child and gain his confidence. We must see to it that other parents know their children and gain their confidence. I believe that in connection with school in the country there ought to be a parents' association and that the fathers and mothers should come together, and that </seg>
            <seg id="p398">376 those who are best at others should show them how to gain the confidence of their children, how to bring home to the :ildren. in a pure, beautiful way, through the life of the plants and the animals, the mysteries of human life; for surely, if &gt;ou do not bring it home to them at a comparatively early age, in the beautiful manner, they will get the knowledge, and they will ' in the nasty way. and the t&lt; must be ever wakeful for the first signs of wrongdoing in the schools: when they manifest themselves by the language written on the walls and by the notes that pass between the children. The teacher's eye must ever be awake and watchful for these symptoms, and the moment the symp - tom in any schoolroom, it ni&gt; k«eked, lest it lead to ilts. But while all of this work of the juvenile court is in a measure '.n that we now attempt to save the child and make him a good man or woman, and th» re the state from dealing here - alter with the criminal, yet from another point of view, it is merely palliative. \W ;ire not striking at the root of the problem: we are only taking hold after something has gone wrong. We cannot get at the real root of the trouble until we reach the millennium, when ■ &gt;m of this human problem are the h • human injustice, the fight o: gainst us of the spirit of hwnan &lt;&gt;d, and in so far as • prevail, in so far will ive the children from coming into the juvenile court. And we can do much townrd this end. The st;ite has ;\ gre;it duty. The peo - ple as a whole hai oward the individual. I am not a I of the word, but I realize that there are many duties that the state owes, and that the eonimunit- that have not fully done. Take the i the truant child. Why is the child a truant? trial to go to school? Man} a child cannot sit all me other outlet for its energy. The school* are recognizing this. They are recognizing the duty of train - ing, not merely the mind, but the eye and Ihe heart. We are get - ting manual training, and I have been told and I am glad to know that you 'iur fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth erad&lt; &gt;ou had it from the very first day. You have not any idea whai :t is on children who cannot stay at their books. We have in Chicago a private training school that was established some ago for the poor Russian refugees' Jewish children. It v as '.n, as none of the Jewish institutions are. Some time ago a boy came in there who had been a truant from his regular school, and it was thought that possibly that school might be able to do him good. The wise superintendent sent him up to the work •hops; they did not put him at books at all. but let him work. A few - later the little boy comes to him and says: "The teacher has • n out a lot of things; I wish I could read them, then I would </seg>
            <seg id="p399">377 iNAL l'W know what to do; won't you put me in the reading class?" He was lut in the reading class. Do you suppose that boy became a truant from that reading No, he had an incentive to work, and a little while later the boy, who had never studied mathematics, learned that in using his tools he had to be exact; that there were Instruc - tions containing figures, and that unless he learned to count and work out these figures he could not make the things that he was trying to make, and he came to the superintendent again and he asked to be put into the class of arithmetic. He never played truant from this school. That is only one of many illustrations of what manual train - ing does for the child. There are many other things that the community can do. Think of the poor mother who goes out to work. What a great relief it is to her, when she is at work, to know that her boys and girls are un - der the teach' tour or five or six hours a day; and what a great relief it would be to her if we had, all over the country, what they have in some places; not only the teacher during the school hours, but the play instructor during the free hours. If instead of closing the gates of our school-yiirds when school is over and turning the children into the street, where they are bound to come in contact with ? policeman sooner or later, we regard our schoolhonses as social centers, to be utilized day and night; at night time for the working boy and the working man and the working woman — the foreigners are &lt; ve instruction — and after school hours as the play - ground of the community, where the children can play, and play under supervision. (Applaiu I think of the troubles and the anxieties of the mother, durin&lt; '.he long summer vacation, when she knows that her boys arid girls must be left to themselves. While we are ■oiling the problem : n t way in some of our cities, we have done a little something in Chicago; iKht t" make it universal; we ought to make it in all the schools; we ought to have the vacation school and not merely the regular school: we ought to have the vacation school where the child would be brought close to nature, with its excursions into the fields and into the country, where play and work will be mingled, where the child will be taken care of. where each will be occupied in useful things. Of course all this costs money. Of course the boards of education In our various cities have not what they need, and they won't get It until you and I learn to do our duty and pay our taxes. (Appla We have all got to do the right thing if we want the right to prevail. If we don't do our duty how can we expect the children to do theirs? When the children m the wrongdo*-: what conception do they get of justice, of duty? The little child who commits a wrong and is brought into court and put on probation or sent to Kearney, and that child sees the greater criminals, the rascals, the grafters of the community, escaping through all sorts of technicalities, what conception does that child get of justice? (Applause.) </seg>
            <seg id="p400">378 STATK SUPEHIN1 - KKPORT No, if we want to bring about right results in the children, if we want to make men and women worthy of the name, we ourselves must be worthy of the name; we ourselves must do our duty. And then other measures: I don't know of whether you have a day nursery here. We have a number of them in Chicago. Un - fortunately sixteen or seventeen are not enough. We are getting more. There is no sadder problem in the juvenile court than that of the young mother, widowed or deserted, who comes in and says to the judge, "I want to give up my child, I cannot support It, I've got to work, there is nobody to care for it." If I know that there are va - cancies in the day nursery, I tell them of it, who have never heard of them; I tell her that we will see that she gets a room near one of the day nu: that she can leave her child there all day long. I will see that she gets work, so that she can go home at night and take care of that child. But it does make the heart burn when you got to keep her in ignorance of the day nursery because you know they are all full and you cannot help her and you have got to let her give away her child. The day nursery does not only mean that that child is saved to its own mother's love and care; that that child is well cared for in - stead of being put out to a large asylum, perhaps; it means more — i* means that that young woman is saved, because when the young woman, widowed or deserted, is ready to give up her babe, there is only a few months before she is ready to give up herself. Save the babe to the mother; make the mother keep that babe at home at night, and she will stay there herself. (Applause.) And one more life is saved. And then we have got another thing in Chicago that we feel proud and happy about and that ig our small parks. We have estab - 1 them in one section of the city; we are going to establish them in all sections. We have now a string of eleven or twelve parks, small parks on the south side, in the thickly populated region. Every one of these parks has a large assembly hall, and in each one of these parks we have a large swimming pool, and the boys and girls in the neighborhood that behave themselves come there. Do you imagine for a moment that those boys and girls are going to get into the juvenile court? Xo, they are saved. They have got the natural outlet for their desire for play and for sport. Each one of those place* has got an instructor to look after the children. In the large assembly hall there is an opportunity for dancing — and what girl does not want to dance? If you don't give her the opportunity to dance in a decent way, in a decent place, under decent auspices, she is going to a dance hall connected with a saloon, and she is going to be lost, because there are few of them that go there that are I Isn't it worth while for the community to give those public playgrounds and those small parks and save three or four or five hundred children from going wrong? That is what we are trying </seg>

There are many more phases to the juvenile court work that we should want to touch upon, but the hour is growing late. If in return for what we are taking away from this city — and I assure you we are taking away much- — if in return for that I may have brought home to you a kinder realization of the duty of the individual toward his fellow men and may have impressed upon you the need of your juvenile court (as all of our juvenile courts) for the help from the true-earnest.

Redick, one of our juvenile judges who is always ready and anxious and willing to do his part and share in looking after the little folks. I introduce Judge Redick. Judpe William A. Redick — Ladies and Gentlemen: About the only excuse I have for detaining you at this late hour perhaps is that I happen, through the ignorance and foolishness, perhaps, of the vo - ters of this county, to be one of Mogy's judges. I certainly will not attempt to add to what has been said by Mr. Thurston and Judge Mack here upon the subject of the work of the juvenile court. I have listened with great pleasure and great instruction to what has been said. All I might hope to add would be to enforce some of the thoughts that they have brought before you upon your minds in a little different way than they have done, and to do so I am going to tell you a couple of stories. The first one is that of the faker on the street corner, who had attracted quite a large number of men and boys by his loud howl - ings, and when quiet had been attained they found that he had upon his hand a flea, an educated flea, and he would say, "Sit up," and the flea would sit up; he would say, "Lie down on your back," and it would He down on its back; "Roll over," and it would roll over. After repeating that two or three times, all of a sudden the flea dis - appeared. A March was begun among the crowd to recover the flea. Finally the faker said; This flea had a predilection for colors, especially blue; has anyone here anything of the color of blue upon his person? If they have, in all probability the flea will be found there. " Sure enough a gentleman was found that had on a blue necktie, and, after searching down a little below the opening of the vest, sure enough there was the flea, and he handed it back to the faker, and the faker put it on his hand and said, "Sit up," but it would not sit up; he says, "Well, lie down, then," and it would not lie down; "Well," he says, "turn over," and it would not turn over; and he handed it back to the gentleman, and he says: "This is not my flea, it is yours." (Laughter.) Now the point is here, ladies and gentlemen: This juvenile court is not our flea any more than it is your flea. These juveniles </seg>

There was hardly a re on his face that one would recognize and call his own or fh, and this old lady was calling one day upon a young woman whose (11 was about three or four months (id. nnd the younger woman said to her caller: "I see other babies • retty. nnd my little one is so Iv 1 don't know what to make of it." The old lad Nev - er mini' ,iind that; why, my boy.

But the court shoi. the power to keep him in its charge and not be compelled to release him at the end of his 16th year. We provide for possible cases when we increase the age limit, in what seems to me to be a wise way, by empowering the juvenile court judge to turn over any child to the processes of the criminal law if he deemed that the child had become a confirmed criminal. Now. when you are dealing with boys of 17 and girls only 18 that may have gone through such a stage of wrongdoing that they ought to be sent to a penal institution. That sometimes happens. Rarely, I believe, but still sometimes. And that enables the court dealing with children of an older age than you now provide for to avoid the dangers that go with it. This is all that I want to say about the criminal law. But since I am on my feet, I suppose I ought to tell a story. (Laughter.) The </seg>

When we landed in Denver yesterday — and it illustrates the power of personal work. Judge Lindsay told me of a boy whose father was a drunkard, and the mother worse.

H- &gt;out to send him to a state institution when a woman of wealth and position in the community interfered and said, "Judge, give me a chance at that boy." And Judge Lindsay, who thinks that every boy, no matter how bad he is, can — nearly every boy run be saved from going to a state institution — said that this boy absolutely must go there; "You cannot do anything with him in your home, and you would not tolerate him there a day." "Well, now," she said, "I think I can if you will give him a chance." He gave her a chance. The young rascal, of course, would not go to school. He played truant. She stopped sending him to school, but she spent three to four hours every day teaching him herself; the looked after him. He lived in a beautiful home. He got his daily bath. He was a regular ragamuffin, and he looked like that woman's child looked to the rest of us. Eleven months had passed. Jrdge Lindsay and Mrs. Reynolds told me that there is not a finer, cleaner, more honest, polite, manly boy in Denver, and that is the rtsult of personal influence and nothing else. There was heredity and environment both working together to kill the boy. There was human love that saved it. (Applaus&lt; me give you another case nearer home. When we started our state institution, something like yours in Kearney, a body of KO millionaires went around the country to the different insti - tutions. In going through one in Indiana, one of the gentlemen who, though he has no children of his own. is president of one of our larg - stitutions for dependent children, said to the warden: "I wish you would point out the worst chap in the place.' The warden said, "There he is, Joe Smith, 19 years old; been in here most of the time since he was 1 2. He has got more black marks now than any boy in th- :md it will be years before he gets out." The man stepped back and began to talk to Joe. He told him he was not trying to preach to him; just wanted to help him. But Joe was mum. He went on talking to him; told him that when he was a boy some friend of his came along and told him it was just ar much fun and just as easy to be near the top of the class as at the • m. and encouraged him to work to the top. and when he left 6Chool he was near the top and felt all the better for It. But Joe vas still mum. Finally he gave him his name and address, and told him that all he wanted to do was to help him if he could, and that if he wanted he could write to him. The boys are permitted to wtite on the first of each month. The first of the next month Joe wrote to the gentleman. He said: </seg>

The reason I am writing this to you is that you are the first man that ever said a kind word to me." Joe got a letter in reply. The first of every month he wrote again, and more black marks went off. Joe was out in less than a year, with a clean record. He came to Chicago. This gentleman is one of our very lnrgest merchants, and he is the head of a business of many niillions a year. He gave him a job in his place. The boy was interested in electricity. He paid for a course in the Scranton correspondence school.

He was a thief and a ras - cal, a bad boy. ard did everything a fellow ought not to do. The human touch from this grand, kind man saved that boy to himself, his family and the state. Wasn't it worth the interest of this man with all of his tremen - dous busine. r cares. And there is not a busier man in the city, and yet he is a man who finds time to be at the head, as I said, not only of one of our largest institutions for dependent children, but he is interested in every uplifting work in the city. (Applause.) And if you will indulge me, I will relate just one more story to close — one of Judge Lindsay's. He talked to a body of business men, as I hope I am talking to a body' of business men, and he asked them to do what I am asking you to do — to take a personal inter - est in the work of the juvenile court; and some of them said they would; and one of them, the superintendent of one of the largest plants there, the Pullman works, took a boy fiom the judge, a boy who had been pretty tough. The sec - ond day that the boy wai in the place he threw an iron rod at his foreman, nearly killed him and almost broke a machine worth a thousand dollars. (Laughter.) The superintendent came to the judge about it. Something radically wrong. But the judge was not satisfied with the mere statement of the case. He wanted to find out the underlying causes; the thing that we must always search for when we see the mere result. And he found that this foreman had called this boy a jail-bird in the presence of a lot of the other chaps. Of course the fellow had been in jail a number of times, but that was no reason for him to call him a jail-bird. The superintendent had tried to help him and gave him a Job. and the boy did what ninety-nine out of a hundred would have done — lost his temper and let it fly. And the judge persuaded the superintendent to give him a chance, and he put him under another foreman in a different de- </seg>

REPORT OF THE DETENTION SCHOOL, OMAHA i Mrs. I perintendent— By courtesy of Mouy's Magazine One hundred and se children have for greater or less time been placed in the detention school, which opened June 20, 1905.

The commodious house a -outh Tenth street, with its de - hghtful grounds, has offered many of the material aspects of genuine home comfort. Mrs. Heller, with Misses Grey and Stevens, who were uaociatod with her in the kindergarten of the Froebel school, have found a wide field for the exemplification of Froebelian princi - ples. Mr. W. C. Fraser, who teaches and supervises the boys at work and play, has found an extensive area for sowitu if fair dealing and integrity. The children are taught to take part in all the varieties of the work that is done to maintain a good, comfortable place in which to live. Both boys and girls take turns at cooking, washing, iron - ing, bed-making, dish-washing, dusting and cleaning floors. It is a great revelation to most of the children, for they have no knowledge of work and, of course, but little power of application. They are always willing to help and almost always willing to do things over until they reach the required standard. The girls are taught to mend and darn. Some even acquire some skill in making garments. Several have been interested to learn to crochet. The girls who come here know none of these things. By 10:30 a. m. the housework is usually done, and such of the children as are not sent to the public school are assembled in the schoolroom for study till 12. The afternoon school session is from 1:30 to 3:30. An effort Is made to help each child to a little ad - vancement in fundamentals each day. Six or seven boys between the ages of 10 and 14 have been lifted from uncertain stammerings over the first pages of the first reader to creditable ease and speed in the third. Under ordinary conditions the children are allowed to play out of doors several times each day. When a boy has not had his hearing in court or has lost cast by ill behavior this privilege is withdrawn. It is the wise ruling of the judges in making it a moral obliga - tion to remain here that enabled the restraining influence of the de - tention school to be invisible walls instead of a real barricade. Yes, a few boys have "ducked." Only one has been helped to stay away. One interesting case occurred in the first weeks of the school's life. In spite of all explanations and remonstrances a young Syrian lad suddenly departed, leaving just a vanishing streak of brown legs In the air. Inside of half an hour he came back, leading a lit - tle brown brother. He "could not sleep," he said, "without Char - lie." They were motherless and had never yet been separated at night. A cleansing bath, clean clothes, wholesome, adequate food, a rea - sonable allotment of work and study, play and diversion seems to transform these dreaded delinquent, incorrigible, dependent and neg - lected children Into a very normal condition. They are usually kind - ly, courteous, amenable, affectionate and happy. They are always under supervision. This seems altogether the » </seg>
            <seg id="p408">386 PKK1NT S REI-ORT simplest plan for rendering harmless any evil tendencies and ing active all the possible elements of good. The children play games indoors- — not always quiet games, eith - er, though checkers, dominos and snap are favorites. They are fond of singing hymns and much enjoy the religious services arranged for them on Sunday afternoon at 4. Of books to be read allowed, "The Wild Animals I Have Known," Jungle books, giant stories and "Chatter Box," and Youth's Companion are favorites. But most of all the children love folks, and most of all their hope is to be at least wholly removed from the danger of setting themselves against so - ciety lies in coming to know and love really earnest humanity-loving men and women. The youngest child held for the court was 2 years old, and two girls have been released on becoming 16 years old. The family has varied from fifteen to twenty-five in number while Denver's detention family runs from eleven to fifteen. They maintain no dependent children at this institution. We have never harbored so ill a boy that he would not lend hand in the care of the babies — never had but one child attempt to be impudent. This is all the brighter side. Children are some times homesick and weep. The other night a newcomer said piteously that he was "so sick," "right here," placing his hand on his chest. One of the other children was directed to get him to bed, and a cup of clear hot water was administered. The next morning he smilingly announced that that stuff in the cup helped him greatly. Children are not al - perfectly good. There are times when they must "meditate;" times when "meditation" needs the stimulation of other corrections. Twice in the history of the school there has been need of a piace where a child in a wild fit of temper might spend it without disturbing an . The school is still without that much need - ed equipment. The superintendent and two assistants sat for two hours one night holding the arms of a temper-crazed girl to render her power - the other alternative being to send her to the city jail in the : wagon. She was in her night dress, when she refused to obey a simple request and flew into a towering rage when urged. She was fourteen. The family that most tries the mettle of the Denver school at - tendants is that one composed of big boys, little dependents and older girls, especially if some of the older girls have been guilty of immoral conduct and others of different sinful deeds. This combi - ration has had to be met more than once. It demands better equip - ment and more teachers. It seems entirely probable to the detention school workers that 96 per cent of the children passing through their hands may be per - manently righted and become Intelligent aids to the community. Mrs. Heller's classification of delinquents is as follows: First — Bright boys whose energy is misdirected </seg>
            <seg id="p409">'-DAY 387 Second — Boys with slightly defective mental powers, who are hence misfits in school and therefore open to bad influei Third — Boys coming from absolutely bad environment with which they are apparently in harmony. Reasonably intelligent care ought to remove from delinquency all this first and second class and a large portion of the third, the residue of which may still be regenerated in the state school. The fourth class of delinquents are the girls, and the girl ques - tion demands especial and distinct consideration. It is in the main a more con:plexed question than that of the boys. This is mainly true because it is less a child's problem. The way to save a fallen girl is to get hold of her before she falls. Important as is prevention work, in ways it is more important with girls. Unquestionably the children who have come into the detention if allowed to go on uninterrupted would be the recruiting force to the worst element in the community. Placed here by the working of the juvenile court, they have grown plump, rosy, happy and good at a cost to the county of 68 cents per day, the food of meal costing lian 7 cents. Altogether since last July the detention school has cost about $3,000. The estimated cost of Pat Crowe's trial, $3,000. The most conservative investigator may be convinced that the detention school has by setting children right and saving them from becoming state rharjv I to the community in its good work more than enough to defray the whole expense of juvenile courts (he first year. THE NEW EDUCATION. - Magazine By I hanan.) To develop men worthy to be regarded as made in the Divine image, the youth should begin by being and doing every day, as far as possible, what he should be and do in the full maturity of his powers, for every faculty of soul and body requires the active growth of the whole twenty-one years of minority uninterrupted. His destiny at full maturity is emphatically to be a producer; for if not, he must be a sponge, a vampire or a robber. Yet the old style education led him to dislike or to scorn his only honorable destiny, and in fact was the predisposing cause of Immeasurable profligacy. He must assume his duty at once, and making himself as useful as possible, grow up in the cheerful performance of the essential duty, the basis of all virtue. Blessed is the farmer's boy who learns from infancy to help in every possible way his mother, s.sters, brothers and father and find pleasure in the service. This is the essential moral education, by the practice of the most substan - tial of all virtues, consisting of energy, industry and manly firm - ness controlled and guided by love.

The • r rearing of children. Don't feed the children on maudlin senti - tnentalism or dogmatic religion: give them nature. Let their souls diink in all that is pure and sweet. Rear them, if possible, amid pleasant surroundings. If they come into the world with souls groping iu darkness, let them see and feel the light. Don't terrify them in early life with the fear of an after world. There never was a child that was made more noble and good by the fear of a hell. Let nature teach them the lessons of good and proper living. Those children will grow to be the best of men and women. Put the best of them in contact with the best outside. They will absorb it as a plant does sunshine and the dew. — Luther Burbank. REPORT OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCE DEPARTMENT OF THE OMAHA WOMEN'S CLUB. (By courtesy of Moby's Magazine.) October 23, subject "Truancy." Miss McCarthy designated tru - ancy as a school crime of many types, from an occasional absence due to the allurement of spring, to chronic truancy that makes a boy fall bo far behind in his classes that he loses the education that is his birthright. Ninety-five per cent of school children attend school reg - ularly. Parents are largely to blame for the truancy existing. Some are too indulgent, some too harsh, some indifferent. Teachers do what they can to reclaim these truants, but cannot give each case the individual attention it needs. Superintendent McLean, of South Omaha, began at the root of the matter. Why is a child as he is? First, he inherits his nature, physical, mental, moral; then it is mod - ified by his environment at home and on the street. While he is in school a few hours each day the influences of the home and the street are constant. He who comes from a cultivated home has the best chance in school ; he who comes from an average home has . a good chance, but he that comes from a poor home has practically no chance, because he lacks proper food, clothing, sympathy; to keep step with the rank in the public schools he must attain a certain standing in ability, clothing, manners, else he inevitably falls be - hind. Some boys are truants merely from a spirit of adventure, but chronic truancy opens the door to delinquency. Miss Magee thought truancy in the congested part of the city, where the city mission does its work, largely due to intemperance. Mr. Parker, the truant of - ficer, said that last year he made 2.583 visits, walked 2.380 miles and caught 247 truants. Of this number 200 were taken from stores and shops, and were, most of them, eager to go to school if allowed to </seg>
            <seg id="p411">389 EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS OF TO-DAY do so. He thought school children ought to be allowed to see the circus parade, so one great temptation to truancy would be removed. It was then moved and carried that the Social Science Department respectfully petition the Board of Education to seriously consider the establishment of a special school for habitual truants or incorrigl - bles, as provided for by our compulsory attendance law. November 6, the Detention School. Mrs. Harriet H. Heller gare the address. She said: "The children in the detention school are the waifs and strays of humanity. They need more care than the normal child. We quarantine disease and stamp it out; we must do so with crime. One bad man in a community Is a serious menace. We cann. very child, but we can save some and help all. A child with one vice is better than a child with five; society has a right to protect itself. It cannot afford to have boys and girls grow into bad men and women. The child has a right to have Its needs attended to. He to be made right by the community that has made him wrong. These waifs are God's children, the same as your The divine is in the child of the sot and the abandoned woman.

            <seg id="p412">390 STA1 I some special attention, some special opportunity? Do the people know how much of their money is invested in high schools? We do not object to high schools. We do say that the inequality pro - duced by the expenditure of school funds in accordance with the real practical needs of our boys (and girls, too), 1b worthy the careful attention of the people and the school boards. It is already receiving the attention of our most eminent educators, and my best excuse for making this plea for justice to the boys (and girls, too,) is the encouragement I have received from some of the best school teachers. To a large extent I only voice their sentiments. In some of the schools they have cow'ained of the awful waste of opportunity. I do not speak in a spirit of unfriendly criticism. I may be mistaken. What I shall say is rather in the spirit of kindly suggestion out of ai. earnest desire to help solve as faithfully as we can xing growing problem. It is not a question of passing judgment on the schools. If it were that then they must be judged by what they h nplished, rather than by what they have not accomplished. By this test no man can accord them too much praise, or too much credit their faithful administrations. What I suggest is not revolutionary. It is rather evolutionary. We should adjust th&lt; as reasonably as we can and as far as we can, so 8f to better fit the boy and his practical needs. As it is now, we ex - •y kind and type of boy to fit himself to exactly the same m. It is a case of one rule to control every kind of boy, no mat - ter what his environment or natural inclination may be, and so the boy who would be glad to work with his hands and improve his soul and intellect by this means is denied the opportunity, and to this ool is unjust to the boy. It may be taken as sustained by the best iuithorlty that the age most favorable for manual train - ing is between 4 and 14 years, yet this golden opportunity is neg- I by our schools in the very places where it is most needed. The schools troubled with the most delinquent boys — the real candidates for criminality — are mostly in bad neighborhoods and have not even that little smattering of hand-work known as "sloyd." Every thought - ful student of the child problem in this country must wake up to the will make progress just so far as we improve environ - ment and opportunity, for just so far will we improve the child. Good citizenship depends upon good children. Good children depend al - most entirely upon opportunity and environment. The Elmira reformatory for youth is probably the largest single ntion of the kind in this country. Out of 1,500 boys there the superintendent declares that not 2 per cent ever had an opportunity before they came to learn to do things with their hands — that is, useful, artistic or mechanical things, the love, the delight and joy of every boy — especially the wayward boy. of the boys I have been compelled to send to Golden in the last year came from two or three schools where envi - ronment was bad, and opportunity in school for the useful, practical things those boys would have delighted to do, absolutely did not </seg>
            <seg id="p413">391 ATIONAL PROBLEMS OF TO-DAY exist. I do not hesitate to say that out of probably 1,000 Denver boys who ha\e been to tin Industrial school not one ever had an opportunity In his school in Denver to learn manual or trades' work until he committed a crime. Generally it is not the boy's fault that lie is in Golden. It is his misfortune. The public too often stit;niati/&gt; &lt;v with "reform school order," but it is brutally and blindly ignorant just the same. A 13-year-old boy, between his sobs and tears, once asked me f he could learn to be ■ plumber. "Why," said little Earl, "can't 1 get an education while I am learning to be a plumber's helper?" The boy had been pursued by the school attendance officer, of course. He was past the sixth grade. He went back to school, but only after rebellion had yielded to force from without. He would have gladly ielded to the force from within himself could he have gone where y monotony was relieved by any kind of joyous work with the hands and heart. It does not follow that it must be just plumbing; M while east. I went into one school and found a large number of around tables doing plumber's work. They were between 13 and 15 years of age. Of com others of the same age doing ■rinting, carpentering, iron molding, modeling, drawing, ornamental roa work, etc. In one ungraded school down on tlv in New York •ity, where most of the work w;is manual training for boys from 9 - old up. the teichcr called up to me a little fellow of 12, who was so interested in his work he apparently did not observe my en - ranee or even court interruption. He could put a cane bottom in a h;iir be'ter thai some men. He did other beautiful work. In it he had put his very heart and soul. That boy had been a little truant, and. of e&gt; Mttle thief — technically as the brutal, ignorant crim - nal law used to view it — but he was getting justice — not in the re - nrra school, but in his own home in that his opportunities were equal o the natural outpourings of his little soul. His teacher said to me hat instead of trying to get him into school they had difficulty in getting him out. How cruelly unjust the state might have been to hat boy. It was just such a boy I was asked to "send up." so "he ould learn a trade." If his home was bad and the increased oppor - unity afforded by the public school did not help to correct evil ten - encies. then that advice may have been good; otherwise it was bad. have had some boys at the State Industrial school intensely inter - ested in their work, "getting an education," as little Earl suggested, ■ne why they could not do such work in the schools at home. I ow recall six boys in my experience, who asked me to send them to he State Industrial school "so," as they expressed it, "we can learn a trade." I recall two who deliberately committed a petty crime in rder to get there for this purpose. One of them became a criminal fter release, because of association with a boy who came under bad nfluences when he came out, and so led him astray. He should have had his opportunity before he was 14. The superintendent of Elmira eclares that the great trouble js that during the period when boys </seg>

This is a commercial age, and we must to a large extent recognize it in educating the boy. It is a legiti - mate encouragement to him to know how much he can make if he becomes proficient in a certain trade or occupation. Say what you please about a boy not knowing what he wants to do at 14 or 15. the fact remains that at that age 90 per cent must do something, and if he has no chance to learn some practical usefulness in school, he must learn something to do as soon as he leaves school, and this is generally something he ought not to have to learn, and would not, in most cases, if his education were more intelligently directed, the last two years especially, in the grammar schools, as far as possible with the view of fitting him to some trade or occupation. The highest grades in the public schools of Cuba correspond to our third and fourth grades, yet the main feature of their school there (and it was pointed out with pride in all the schools I visited) was the manual training work. It was everywhere in all the lower grades among the younger children. No one thing in all Cuba did our government pride itself upon more than the school system it established with the aid of the most practical educators in the world. Every reform - atory in this country devotes the greater part of its educational work to training of the hands as the best means to reach the head and heart. This is their remedy for delinquency. Should we not have it in the first grades? Should we not devote two-thirds of the time spent in the seventh and eighth grades for boys and girls to all the practical work that can be reasonably crowded in? We must have the trade work and the ungraded school, and we no doubt shall have them. I'nless we do. the school is unjust to the boy.

That one act, in time, would do more than all the courts to reduce illness and crime among the young. The present condition should be rather reversed. If we have money enough and the people will stand the tax, let us have the high schools as now conducted, but until we do, let us be Just and do not si&gt;e™d the money for a favored class, 90 per cent of whom could and would pay for the same education anyway, but spend it for the ninety and nine.

It is rather the duty of the school boards, as far as they can. to meet the real requirements and necessities of our children. WHAT STARTS BOYS AND OIRL8 oN DOWNWARD CAREER8? n. Ben. T. Lindsay— By courtesy of Mew's Magazine i What starts girls on downward careers and boys on criminal careers? There are so many (auses which make for crime that to a: this question is not free from difficulty. There is no doubt in my mind that drink is responsible, more than any one cause, for the criminal careers of boys and girls. I use this term as applied to men and women who become addicted to in - toxication and bad habits. The father, through drink, becomes a useless vagabond and deserts his family, leaving the poor mother to shoulder the double burden of home-maker and bread-winner. I say that one of the most alarming things we face In this coun - try is the increasing indifference to the marriage and home tie on the of the man, which indifference is caused in most cases by the bad habits of men who weaken their manhood and unfit themselves for the serious duties of home-making, child-rearing and good citizen - ship. Of course, in the children's court we have a great many boys who are brought up for offenses that are not of themselves serious, but they may be the beginning of more serious offenses; and there - fore the greater importance of taking them in time and furnishing the ounce of prevention which is better than the pound of cure; and not only the majority of cases of this character against boys, but I should say that the great majority of serious causes of crime in child - hood, are the result of bad parents and bad homes, or no parents end no homes, and some parents are even worse than no parents. How frequent it is to see the embarrassment of the boy or girl when asked about the home a — and the pity of it is that </seg>
            <seg id="p417">395 some of them are not even embarrassed — to hear the statement glibly made that "the old man was a drunkard and skipped out and left ma to take care of us." Every boy and girl has a right to be born right and reared right. This is the God-intended legacy that is infinitely dearer than the legacy of millions; but it is denied to thousands and thousands of children all over this country. While I am not an alarmist, and grant you that a rash state - ment is dangerous to any cause, I tell you that unless something is done through moral training, through the schools, courts and power of the state — and, above all through that greater power of human brotherhood and interest for our fellow man — to stop the alarming spread of disregard for home ties and for wife and child by men in this nation, I shudder to contemplate the amount of suffering we must all endure in the end for our neglect. We are prating entirely too much about the unreal and the un - substantial. The real questions, after all, are the ones that affect the home and the children in the home; and because we have neg - lected these questions, or sneered at those who are trying to do some - thing to change the conditions that are making for evil, we are suf - fering for evil, we are suffering from an increase in crime in this country. It is better I te and try to do even if it should tht&lt; full measure i pected, than to sit idle and do nothing or waste all of our time in discussing political qu- bat, after all, as President Roosevelt has: indicated, as compared to this tion of the home and the child, ars ephemeral and unsubstantial. The sixty-five boys arrested for stealing brass and other prop - from the railroads of one town I recently visited are of infinitely more importance to me than the question of regulating freight rates on that railroad. These boys became thieves largely because of lack of oppor - tunity for good and much opportunity for evil, and because of no effort on the part of the state to relieve the conditions that were making for crime in their lives. Again, social and economic conditions have much to do with the misfortunes of boys and girls- I have seen boys and girls by the thousands crowded together in the great cities, and I have been filled with pity and sorrow, but not amazement, to hear of the amount of po-called crime among these children, and to hear the stories of im - morality and dishonesty in their lives. You know it has always been the scheme of the state to grab the little child, tako him to the police station, or throw him in jail. This is only making a matter worse, with no effort whatever to re - lieve the cause. It is not always an easy matter to relieve the causes, but much can be done and much is being done. It is all a mistake, however, to expect too much of so-called juvenile courts. They are more than </seg>

And in spite of the best home training you find boys and girls going wrong; but do not forget th;it this is always the ex - ceptional case: and where one boy or girl from a good home goes vrong, there are more than a hundred who do not go wrong.

Children become calloused more or less to vice, and get really false notions, because what they read in the papers is after all the exceptional case, and too many of us are prone to judge the general condition by what is, after all, only an exceptional or special condition. I believe that the messenger service is one of the greatest cor - ruptors of bOJ There are many pure, honest girls in the department stores, and we dislike to speak of the dangers encountered here, because we have such a high respect for the many good, pure girls who courageously lead a noble life under all kinds of trials and temptations; but no one knows better than these very girls the temptations they endure, nnd how many of their sisters fall. There are certain young scoundrels in every community who go about seeking whom they may devour, and who lead many girls astray ; and young rascals of this kind should be hunted down and shown no mercy. They have no respect for virtue or womankind. Another prolific cause of the downfall of young girls is their going to theatres and public dances without chaperones or. in fact, going at all at a tender age to some of these places; visiting girl friends of questionable character, especially in rooming houses or out - side of the family circle. Above all, the lack of companionship between mother and daugh - ter and the lack of training a girl in that maidenly modesty which is her chief protection from scoundrels, are also causes for the down - fall of thousands upon thousands of girls of the cities of this coun - try. If the number were really known I am sure it would be start - ling. . The truth is that the public, like many parents and many teach - ers, do not really know the facts, and from one standpoint it may be just as well that they do not know, but from another standpoint it is very important that the facts should be known, for there is nothing to be gained in permitting sores to fester under cover. However dis - agreeable it is to deal with filth and garbage, the whole city would suffer in the end if it were neglected. But it can only be removed and cared for in the proper way. No girl's troubles or any troubles affecting the morals of the youth of the city should be aired and written about in the newspapers any more than the garbage wagon, which is absolutely necessary to the health of the community, should perform its functions In the open streets at times when they are most crowded. Perhaps an occasional jolt to the community is necessary to let them know that evil is getting in its work, and that they must be up and doing, to overcome evil with good.

            <seg id="p425">BIENNIAL REPORT OP THE STATE BOARD OP EDUCA - TION TO GOVERNOR JOHN H. MICKEY. The four years of your administration as Governor, now closing, are marked with many interesting events in the history of our great commonwealth, to which you can look back with pride In the years that are to come. Few, if any, are more epoch-making than those of the Normal School work. DIFFICULT PROBLEMS In the beginning of your administration you were confronted with difficult problems touching the Normal School work. The legis - lature having passed bills granting to the Normal School at Peru new and needed buildings, at the same time passed a bill creating a new Normal School. After a very careful consideration you placed your official approval upon both acts. While there were some to criticise at the time, the wisdom of your action is now abundantly apparent. The rounding out of your four years as Governor the teachers and school people of the state are ready to acknowledge their very great obligations to you in these particular matters, and to admit the splendid impetus your action gave educational work. No better help or more encouraging feature has entered into the school work of Nebraska than the uplift given by your Excellency in the several acts you have approved pouching Normal and other school matters during your two bienniums. Appended to this report you will find the details of the advance at Peru and Kearney. We call special attention to the tables that show the advancement made in Normal School work in the state. OUR ADVANCEMENT. One of the strongest reasons for the public or state Normal edu - cation is that It affords an equal opportunity to all in the state. Equally enjoyed by those of the remote rural district as well as those of the more densely populated centers. The remarkable growth of our Normal School attendance during the past four years is un - paralleled in the history of any state in the Union. The critics of four years ago said the establishing of a new Normal would mean the crippling, if not the death, of the Normal at Peru. The most sanguine advocates of additional Normals were only able to express to your Excellency the hope that when the buildings were com - pleted and the school in operation we might see, as other states had 5«5 </seg>
            <seg id="p426">402 'PKRINTENDENT'S REPORT Men in their new Normals, from 150 to 2r.ii students in the first two or even four years of their history. What are the facts? With the passage of the bill creating another Normal School and its subsequent location at Kearney, Peru began a new life. That year Peru had a total enrollment of 730; last year the total enroll - ment at Peru wa&gt; the same percentage of gain would give us this year as an enrollment, 1,537. The indications are at this writing, Nov. 30, 1906, that the estimate attendance will be fully realized. The attendance at the opening period 1904 was 4 20: last year it reached 655, while this year H To-day the students are sim - ply up to the limit of the capacity of the buildings with many, many applications still coming in. The new Normal at Kearney has had a most phenomenal growth — 863 students matriculated in the first full year of her history, thus breaking the records of all new Normals in the United States. She Ft arts out in the second year of her history to even surpass the splendid record made the first year. Some one asks, "Why all this advancement; why all this great increase in enrollment?" Simply be - cause Nebraska has been callii. 0 her Normal School work and because the state has been raising the requirements and creating a demand for better teachers. More and better teachers are needed. We are just in the beginning of these good things. We cannot as state afford to take a backward step in any of these directions. The educational progress of our state will depend largely upon the efficiency of our teachers. Our Normal Schools thus become ed - ucational centers. They furnish trained teachers, better educated and at the same time become a source of inspiration to other teachers all over the state, encouraging them to pursue studies in the higher in - stitutions of learning and to aspire to nobler aims in life for teachers and students with whom they come in contact. The real value of the Normal Schools of the state cannot be measured by the number of graduates, because from the under-grad - uate classes there go out every year a large number, not as well equipped as they should be, but better equipped than when they en - tered the institution, for the actual work of teaching, so that the good accomplished can be measured only by considering the entire number receiving instruction for the entire course or part of the course. All of this advancement in Normal School work means also a direct call for larger and better equipment, for sufficient money to pay good salaries. These things should receive careful consideration that we may be able to pay in proportion to the service rendered. Good salaries for the services rendered In the educational institutions of our state is truly an educational item that demands persistent at - tention. A good illustration of this fact was made by Superintendent Carr of Dayton, Ohio, at the National Superintendents' Meeting of 1904. </seg>
            <seg id="p427">STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS 403 He recounted his experience as a member of a committee to purchase an organ for a newly erected church. The committee selected and put in a pipe organ that cost $5,000. When the congregation began to worship in the new church it found that Sister Jones, the old organist, could not touch the new organ. There was too much machinery about it for her. She would have nothing to do with it. Then the services of a daughter of one of the deacons waa secured, and she failed to produce satisfactory results. Then a widow's daughter, who was a good musician and w^ho needed the place, was persuaded to try and play, but she could not get any real music out of the pipe organ. There was great dissatisfaction in the congregation and the commit, •ee were charged with mismanagement — the buying of complicated machinery; the congregation seemed to be breaking up. Just then the committee secured from the city at a good salary a splendid or - ganist. When the master musician began playing, stirring their souls with such music as they had never heard before, it was impossible to go back to the old reed organ or the old organist. So the Normal School work, with all of Its enrichment in the teaching profession, is recognized as a new instrument In our school work. The swinging away from Normal School work, a few years ago, has had its reaction and the pendulum is now swinging another way, and the school boards and directors are recognizing that, like the organ in Superintendent Carr's church, it takes a master teacher to operate the modern school and bring about the desired results. In fact, Nebraska schools are all depending to-day on those who oper - »&gt;te the machines, and it is an important problem to know how and where to secure a sufficient number of well-made, well-taught, well - directed teachers. Public sentiment has been a little slow in its edu - cation along this line, but it now has reached the time where it is demanding good results from our schools. It is also ready to recog - nize the proper means of securing these good teachers. Teachers are also compelled to show that they can do good teaching. School boards are recognizing this fact also and are employing none but the best, regardless of where they live so long as they are properly educated. The criticism offered freely a few years ago — the lack of prepa - ration on the part of the teachers — will soon pass away if the state will continue to give the proper support to her State Normal Schools. There will be many to rise up and call you blessed in the years to come because, while you were Governor, you took such a great step forward in these educational matters, thus recognizing the fact that the very best preparation possible is needed for teachers who devote their lives to this great work. Nebraska has no standard, but we are growing one. The min - imum requirements of a few years ago have been raised each year. We are making progress. We recognize that education is not train - ing and that training is not education, but a careful combination of the two, and then an insight into the teaching practices, is doing wonders with the teaching forces of our state. </seg>
            <seg id="p428">404 STAT&gt; S REPORT THK ADVANCE SHOULD CONTINUE Our state should continue the advance step taken during your ad - ministration and commit herself more fully to a better Normal School policy. In the matter of buildings and equipment we have made great strides forward, but are not now able in either school to handle all the students possible for us to secure. Nor have we the room or equipment to do the very best by the students now in the school. Our teaching 'orce in the two institutions are among the best scholars in the land. They have high ideals and splendid teaching power. Thorough work is done in each school and the grad - uate department, and the pedagogical and training departments are the equal of any school. At the same time we are keeping the Nor - mal Schools abreast of the times touching the demand for the teach - ing of industrial subjects in our public schools. OUR SUMMER SCHOOLS Our Summer Normal School work shows a very marked increase in the attendance; so much so that the board now make the Summer Normal School a permanent policy of the State Normal work. We expect to continue the very high grade of work in the Summer Nor - mal, making it the equal of any institution in this country along the line of graduate, professional, academic or truly pedagogical work. The policy of the board is to bring to our Summer Normal Schools the very best instructors possible for us to obtain, in addi - tion to the regular faculty. Thus our Summer Normal School work is growing In attendance year by year and increasing in popularity. The attendance last summer was simply limited to the capacity of the buildings. Scores of teachers who wanted to take the work could not be accommodated. THH STUDENTS Another advance noted during this biennium is that more of our students enroll for the full year's work and thus remain in touch with the high grade of instruction throughout the ten months of the school year. The average tension of student life in our State Normal Schools is very high. Left to themselves these students are orderly and devoted to their studies. This indicates that they realize that *hey are getting ready to deal with a problem that is worth studying. An analysis of the student body in another direction would show a large percentage during the ordinary school year have never taught; &amp; considerable number of them have raised money by their own per - sonal effort to pay their expenses at the Normal. That will account In part for their devotion in preparing for their professional life work. Of course they have all signified their Intention to teach in the public schools of our state. I doubt if any other company of stu - dents realize the seriousness of the situation and feel their responsi - bilities to the extent these Normal School students do. </seg>
            <seg id="p429">405 .STATK NORMAL DO WB NEED NORMALS? The question is often asked "Do We Need State Normal Schools?" If all the graduates from the State University, State Normals, Junior Normals and private Normals entered the teaching ranks on gradu - ation each year they would constitute only a part of the teaching force required annually in our great state; they would hardly fill the vacancies caused by resignations, withdrawals, and deaths year Dy year. Quite a large percentage of the entire body of teachers in Nebraska are untrained as teachers. We need more trained teachers and we need them badly, and the want of Nebraska in this direction is the want of every state in the Union. The only way we can meet it in this state is to maintain our present system of Normal Schools that we help supply the ever increasing demand of all our public schools for better teachers. The Normal Schools are the only schools in which the history, the philosophy, the theory and the practice of education can be taught to any considerable number of young men and women, and they are. the only schools in which the subjects are studied and expounded in the manner in which they ought to be pre - sented by the teacher in the schoolroom. At the same time they are the only schools in which the teacher while being trained actually practices teaching while being trained. There are other institutions devoting part of their courses of study to this specific work; they are doing spjendid work, but they still lack the particular application of the practice work under the eye of a master teacher. The Normal School devotes its entire course to this especial work of furnishing thoroughly educated and technically trained teachers — teachers who can give value received in instruction for the money expended. INDUSTRIAL SUBJECTS. The demand for teaching certain industrial subjects in the great common schools of our state is upon us. Our Normal Schools have recognized the demand thus made as just and right. Just as fast as possible we are putting them on a safe, sane, sound, pedagogical basis and are now providing thorough instruction in all these great lines. Yes, we are teaching the teachers how to teach the children in their schools these great matters. AGRICULTURE. We are teaching it. Not just nature study dubbed agriculture, but really the elements of agriculture with a definite object and spe - cific aim in view. Thus we are meeting the imperative demand from the rural communities for teachers trained along these lines. We will send forth teachers that will be able to bring this great subject very close to the people who need it most. It was a little sentimental at first, but it has grown marvelously, until we are beginning to realize in our state the practical value of this kind of teaching. We </seg>
            <seg id="p430">406 S REPORT • re not for one moment apeing the great Agricultural colleges con - nected with our splendid State University, but our course of instruc - tion in the Normal School is practical and will prepare the teacher in the work of agriculture as it will be taught in the public schools of our state. The rank and file of the farmers for many generations past have learned much of their work from the customs handed down from generation to generation. Much of the school work in the past lias been rather educating the boys and girls away from the heart of nature and the soil. Many, many times they only grasped what an unguided observation would give them or again learned from the unpleasant experience of working with the soil under adverse cir - cumstances. To many of them soil was nothing but dirt and farm la - bor a drudgery and agricultural work generally considered suitable only for those who knew but little and cared to know less. This is all changed; it is the oldest vocation, the newest science. Teachers must teach the science of agriculture and that it is possible to put a more attractive side of life into the farm and the rural cen - ters. Thus training the boys and the girls to love nature, to keep close to the soil, admire rural scenes and rural life, to build up a sentiment strongly in favor of the country life and of agricultural pur - suits. The coming in this direction has been slow, but the agricul - tural education in the schools will surely help solve the problem and the Normal Schools of our state are ready to do their part in train - ing teachers along these lines. DOMESTIC SCIENCE closely connected with the foregoing subject is the work of Again the Normal Schools of Nebraska are keep - ing ;i rmal Schools of the country in taking very ad - ps in this particular line of teaching. We are increasing our equipment and are now teaching teachers how to teach domestic ldren In their schools. Thus we lead them to an Intelligent appreciation of the affairs of the household and the rela - tion existing between housekeeping and sound living. MANUAL TRAINING. Another of the industrial problems is manual training, and the Normal Schools of Nebraska are hard at work along this line, know - ing that a course in manual training will connect the children with. In a real way, the labor products of the world. It puts them in touch In a peculiar way with the great industrial activities of life. Possi - bly it will lead them to see the possibilities or the opportunities that are just before them in life. The ultimate object of all the industrial work in our Normal Schools is to teach teachers how to teach boys and girls of our public schools how to get the most out of life. We pass now to the direct work of the biennium for each school </seg>
            <seg id="p431">407 PERU. THE NEW CHAPEL AND GYMNASIUM. During this biennium the new chapel and gymnasium building, one of the finest buildings on the campus, has been completed. The gymnasium is 84x110 feet, with a 20-foot ceiling. It is provided with bath rooms, sanitary closets, locker rooms and quite thoroughly equipped for the physical training and indoor athletics. The first or main floor is the new chapel, by far the largest and best assembly hall owned by the state, comfortably seating 1,600 people. In this building are also located the offices of the president of the school and the registrar. The building was completed and equipped, except decorating, within the appropriation of $43,500. THE NEW LIBRARY BUILDING. During this biennium the new library building, for which the legislature of 1905 made an appropriation of $32,000, has been completed and is now housing the 20,oOO volumes comprising our Normal School library. It is a plain, substantial, fire.proof building, 85x70 feet, two stories high, giving ample room for 35,000 books, and reading and reference rooms to accommodate 1,000 students. The equipment is modern, up-to-date, steel shelving for 20,000 volumes, and so arranged that as the library grows shelving for the additional 15,000 volumes can readily be added. THE NEW SCIENCE HALL. The old frame library building has been doubled in size and brick veneered and converted into a modern science hall. The build - ing is 104 feet long, 32 feet wide, in the central part, with wings on either end 42 feet wide, and two stories high. All of this chang - ing, enlarging, brick veneering, etc., has been made without a special sppropriation. Instead of spending the $2,500 that the legislature gave for repairing and refitting the old science rooms to meet the increased demand of the science departments, the board made the changes above indicated, taking the old science rooms for additional and much needed class rooms. The biological science department oc - cupy the first floor and the physical science department the second f.oor. This places these important departments in a position to do thorough and more efficient work. PRESIDENT'S RESIDENCE For a great many years the president of the school has li\ a part of the main building. The great increase in attendance has compelled the president to vacate this part of the building. He was compelled to go outside of the campus to get rooms. Thes^ rooms and </seg>

At the beginning of the school year the student deposits three dollars. At the end of the school year the deposit is returned less the rental fees. By renting books they cost the student from $1 to $1.50 ]&gt;er year; to purchase the books would cost from $12 to $18 per FEES The board have practically eliminated all fees save the unusual kage in the laboratory. SELF BOARDING. During this biennium plans for self boarding have been very carefully considered and perfected. In connection with the domestic science department and under the direction of the special domestic science teacher, many of the students are boarding themselves. It affords an opportunity for actual exemplification of domestic science. Tt provides a recreation, adds to the pleasure of school life. The expense in self boarding is very nominal — about one-half of that of regular boarding. REQUIREMENTS'. The board have joined with the faculty in gradually raising the entrance requirements. I quote from tli«' Peru catalogue (1914 and 1905, page 18). "Students are advised to finish their high school before coming to Peru. The high schools of Nebraska are doing most thorough and efficient work, work that is hardly excelled or even equaled in the preparatory departments of colleges and normal schools. It seldom pays one to go away to school until he has mastered thoroughly the work offered at home." The entrance requirements have been made just as rigid as the law of the state will permit.

The total enrollment for 1903-1904 was 812. The total enroll- ment for 1905-1906 was 1,215 or an increase in enrollment of The increase in enrollment is the equal of another school — 403 more students at the close of school last July than at the beginning of the biennium. To properly provide for this increased attendance in the way of text-books, equipment, teachers, correspondence, etc., ha. quired painstaking and careful planning and the most rigid economy possible to live within the appropriations. It meant very long hours for the teachers and large classes. The increase in floor space since 1903 has been 50 per cent. The increase in enrollment since 1903 is nearly 100 per cent, while the increase in the faculty (1903 with 27 teachers, 1906 with 30 teachers) has been only three. In order to meet the increased enrollment and not come to Jhe legislature with a deficit in the teachers' salaries fund, we have had to increase the size of the classes, increase the school hours, and the work of all the teachers.

During this biennium the building has been completed and the new normal opened. The building erected and completed during this biennium is the center wing of what when fully completed will be ihe main school building. It was completed and formally tendered to the board for acceptance Dec. 20, 1905. The architect refused to :ecommend the at of the building and filed with the board a lengthy report pointing out eleven defects or failures on the part of the contractors to complete the building according to contract and rications- — claiming however that it was possible for the contrac - tors to remedy these defects or to complete the building properh on the recommendation of the architect the board refused the building and notified the contractors to proceed and complete the building in accordance with the contra' April 9, 1906, the architect reported in writing that all defects and incompleted portions mention in his report of Dec. !•, 19n. r i had now been completed or rectified except the defects in marble floor and the removal of the alkali stains on the front of the build - ing. The defects in the marble floor were found to have been caused by students stepping on the floor before the oement was thoroughly set and was no fault of the contractors and all but a few of the minor pieces had been reset. The contractors reported on the alkali stains that they had tried everything known in science to remove such stains and had failed. The architect reported to the board that the failure to remove the stains damaged the building $600. Upon the payment by the contractors to the state treasurer of $500 as liquidating damages, tka building on April 9, 1906, was formally accepted by the board. The vote on acceptance being unanimous. LOCATION. The normal school properties at Kearney are located in the west - ern part of the city about a mile from the Union Pacific and Bur - iington passenger stations, and consists of 23 acres of ground and the dormitory (formerly known as Green Terrace) the land and this building reconstructed for dormitory purposes were the donation of Kearney to the State; the main building built with the $50,000 ap - propriated by the legislature of 1903 and the boiler house and heating plant built with the $15,000 appropriated by the legislature of 1905 During this biennium the boiler house and heating plant has been completed within the appropriation made therefor.

The building was tar from being complete but the school took possession of the com - tleted portions and moved around from room to room keeping out *»f the way of the contractors. All the school work is carried on in this one building, except the one department of manual training which uses rooms properly fitted up on the principal floor of the boiler house. The school shows a remarkable growth in its first year. The matriculations reaching s63. The enrollment of the present year Nov. 30, 1906 is 548 an increase of 148 over the enrollment of the tame date one year ago. The same percentage of gain will carry the enrollment this year beyond the 1,000 mark. In making the appropriations for the buildings and the maintenance of the school the legislature frequently said we plan for a school of not to ex - ceed 250 the first biennlum. The expectation has been realized and we enrolled the first year of the biennium 113 more than three times the number anticipated. RENTING TEXT BOOKS Realizing the great saving made at Peru to the students by renting to them their text books, the board in the very beginning of the new normal at Kearney inaugurated the same plan. Buying the text books at wholesale and renting them to the students. The same fees are charged, ten cents per book each semester. This makes a taring of thousands of dollars each year to the students. REQUIREMENTS The board places Kearney and Peru on the same basis in re - gards to entrance requirements. The board lives up to the limits of the law in this respect. To raise the entrance requirements any high - er would seriously affect a goodly number of students that come to - day from the western portion of our great state. These students have gone as far as their home schools can carry them. A very care - ful analysis of the students shows but very few that have not attained, to at least, the tenth grade of work or its equivalent. The percentage of students that have not mastered all the school work offered them at their home school is very small. SELF-BOA RDINO Self-boarding is one of the new problems in normal work. It is rapidly assuming shape at Kearney. Remember this is a new school with all new problems to solve. This one question is now receiving proper attention from those concerned and will soon be properly equipped. Thus affording the student of small means and plenty of energy the one way of greatly reducing the expense of securing good education </seg>

            <seg id="p442">AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION AND INDUSTRIAL TRAIN - ING. (Edited by Deputy E. C. Bishop, Department of Public Instruction.) With an appreciation of the value of industrial training as a general supplement to the curricula of the various divisions of our public school system, and feeling especially the need, in an agricul - tural state, of training the youth to a knowledge of, familiarity with, respect for and an interest in agriculture, we have encouraged indus - trial training, especially in agriculture and in domestic science. However worthy it may be, a new issue cannot be successfully established by legislation alone. The value of a new issue must be felt before it can become a permanent factor In any enterprise sub - ject to the support and approval of the public. Domestic science, man - ual training and agriculture cannot be successfully legislated into our schools, until our teachers, school officers and our people recognize the need of such training. An important step was made when our state university fixed the stamp of approval by offering courses of study In these industrial lines. The increased registration each year in these courses has justified increased faculties for instruction, yet the public is com - paratively slow in sending her charges to this work. Public sentiment must receive a better insight than that afforded by a few young peo - ple who search out and go to this work; the work must come to the public, must enter the home; must command the attention of her people. Operating under the influence of a strong, healthful sentiment from the leading educational factor in the state, we have endeavored to reach, through the public schools of the state, the homes of our people, with some suggestions, some Insight that will cause them to desire to know, to see and to possess that which will bring to the members of the home, a desired measure of knowledge, usefulness ind happiness. With a desire in the home for training of the youth in domestic art, in manual training or in agriculture, provision for such training will come from the district school meeting, through boards of educa - tion, to the child enrolled in tbve public school. The attempt to reach the child through the home has too often resulted in failure because of the lack of interest from the indifference or even the opposition of the parent, who fails to recognize the value of such training to the child. Whether it be from lack of knowledge or from the conserva - tism which says, "What was good enough for me is good enough for my child," experience has shown that we are too often unable to 27 </seg>
            <seg id="p443">418 reach the home through the parent, We arc more often successful in reaching the home thr- child. The child, with mind un - prejudiced by bygone exjM and associations, more often gives a ready car to the new thought and more willingly lends a hand in the untried work. From this point of view, we have sought to interest the youth, i.nd thus bring the attention of the parent to the value of industrial training. What, so far, has been accomplished can be told in few words, that has been awakened is healthful; the interest that has been aroused is gen - uine; the results are satisfactory; the future seems full of oppor - tunity, full of promise and full of work. Contrary to the opinion held by many, there is no law requiring the teaching of agriculture in the public schools of Xebraska. The ■ ska lepi amended the existing law for the oer - nserting the requirement for 1st and 2nd Ki ertificates, that- "The first and second grade 1 to any person who shall pass a satisfactory examination in the elements of agriculture including a fair know - ledge of U ! ure and composition of the common plants, in '.irJs. and quadrui»eds." The only subject required to be taught by law in the state of Nebraska is physiology and hygiene. The law on this point reads: "Provision shall I roper local school authorities for instructing the pupils in all m upported by public money, or under state control, in physiology and hygiene with spe - cial reference to the effect of alcoholic drinks and other stimulants and narcotics upon the human system." To require by law the teaching of agriculture in the public pchools, before public school teachers are prepared to give instruc - tion in agriculture, would defeat th- f introducing the study of agriculture. Our legislators acted wisely when they first provided that teachers must prepare themselves to teach agriculture. The teachers' examinations in agriculture, to this time, have been conducted more on the principle of leading teachers to properly pre - pare th&lt; in the subject than as a test of such knowl - edge of the subject as should ' icher who teaches it. With four years of examinations and such other encouragement as could be given. Nebraska teachers are beginning to feel some - thing of the breadth of the subject and are preparing themselves to teach it. With teachers who have for four years been preparing themselves on this subject or who, having more recently entered the profession, have anticipated this requirement; with the examina - tions gradually requiring increased comprehension of the subject on the part of the teacher; we are in a measure becoming prepared to handle the subject. Without the law requiring the teaching of agriculture, it has been Introduced very largely into rural schools, Into the grades in town and city schools, into high schools and Into </seg>

The sentiment of the people has been cultivated to an appreciation of the subject, and co-operation is now coming from sources where four years ago there existed only opposition or indifference. The interest and activity in agriculture has been brought about largely by the following means: COURSE OF STUDY All courses of study, recommended for use in rural schools, provide for the teaching of agriculture, — not for teaching agricul - ture as it should be taught in a school devoted to agriculture, nor for teaching as agriculture a subject to be taught as one of the five essentials, but rather a continuation of the primary work in nature study; recognizing that agriculture is more than nature study. Agriculture means more than observation. It means that some - thing must be DONE as well rved. It means an active in - terest on the part of the student that will in rural districts assist in forming the almost missing "connecting link" between the school and the home. Our teachers as a whole know but little of agri - culture. We cannot insist at this time that they shall know a great deal about agriculture, but we do urge that they become interested in the subject and that they add to this interest, such knowledge as they may secure, such means of gaining knowledge and such means cf creating interest among pupils as will cause pupils to become in - -ators. and into touch with real life. In high schools, the subject is taken up and studied more as a special subject with the recommendation that laboratory work In - clude objective work "out-of-doors"; that theories in agriculture be taught in relation to the facts as existing in the objective surround - ings of the locality. Our best high schools must yet continue to contribute largely to the supply of teachers for rural schools. Under the new law provid - ing for recognition by this department of normal training in high schools, in the normal course of study recommended for such high schools, the study of agriculture is given a proper place. The outline for the one year's course provides for instruction in laboratory work in Farm Animals, Milk and Its Products, Soils, Field Crops and Garden and Orchard Crops. ( See Normal training in high schools of this re - port for one and two semester courses in high schools.) It will be noted that in the one year's course, one hundred and twelve periods are given to study and ninety-six periods to laboratory work. The laboratory work is designed to bring the student into a clos - er, broader, and intimate knowledge of the subject; for instance, in "Farm Animals," eight double practice periods are given to visits at nearby stock farms where the typical specimens of the different breeds of horses, cattle, sheep and swine are studied in the home </seg>
            <seg id="p445">420 STATK SLPERINTI S REPORT environment. The laboratory work in Milk and its Products. Soils Field Crops, and Garden and Orchard Crops, is designed to bring the student into contact with problems which are commonly met in the home, or community. In the study of Field Crops, Garden and Orchard Crops, the stu - dent is expected to deal directly with the object studied so far as possible, by cultivating with his own hands, the plants studied. L\ NORMAL SCHOOLS In our state normal schools, special instructors are provided in agriculture. School Gardening provides out-door laboratory work as a supplement to carefully arranged indoor laboratory exercises. In the state junior normal schools, school gardening has furnished an interesting and favorite laboratory study for the summer school junior normal teachers. Teachers in these classes are required to plant and care for their own "little farms" and thus gain by actual experience the lessons they would teach in their schools. UNIVERSITY AID. — For the 1906 season of the Junior Normals, the University of Nebraska provided special instructors from the Uni - versity School of Agriculture who each spent two weeks at each of the various junior normals, instructing in his specialty. Field Crops, Soils, Farm Animals, and Horticulture were the subjects treated by these specialists. The regular instructor in agriculture conducted the school garden and supplemented the work of the special instructors. The university also sent special lecturers who made the rounds of the junior normals and lectured on various agricultural subjects. AGRICULTURAL AND DOMESTIC SCIENCE CLUBS With teachers prepared to teach the subject there is yet the need of awakening the proper interest on the part of pupils and their parents. The movement that has done most toward creating an interest among young people in agriculture and domestic science is the organization of agricultural and domestic science clubs. With a view toward reaching a number of individuals throughout the state, the first Nebraska corn contest was inaugurated in the spring of 1905. The five hundred boys who first forwarded names and addressee to this department were furnished five hundred kernels of pure bred seed corn. The University of Nebraska School of Agri - culture furnished the seed corn. The boys were notified that a re - port would be expected of them. During the summer it was de - cided that it would be well to ask each of the five hundred boys to send or bring to Lincoln with his written report, the best ten ears of corn raised from the seed furnished him. A prize list was ar - ranged and a program prepared; the girls who had demanded that they be given an equal chance with the boys were admitted as corn cookers and the first Nebraska corn contest was announced. </seg>

An abridged stenographic report of the contest follows: REPORT OF NEBRASKA CORN COX'l Held at Lincoln. December 14-15, 1905. Excursion tickets on all railroads in Nebraska leading to Lin - coln were put on sale Wednesday, December 13. Headquarters were established at the Lincoln hotel and preparations made to receive the corn growers and corn cookers from all incoming trains Thurs - day. The managers of the corn contest were agreeably surprised to find delegations arriving on Wednesday afternoon, the 13th. Valley county, the first large delegation to reach Lincoln, arrived Wednesday afternoon. Thirty-eight boys and girls in charge of the county sup - erintendent, Miss Alta Jones, registered and left their baggage at the Lincoln hotel and spent the afternoon seeing the sights of the city. Other smaller delegations arrived in the afternoon and evening. Thursday morning delegations began to arrive from all direc - tions. Guides wearing •'Corn is King" badges, with an additional "Guide" badge, met all trains and found no trouble in getting into communication with the delegates who arrived, most of them wear - ing corn badges and special county or district badges. The program provided for: first, registration at headquarter*, second a trip to the state farm, where the entries were made in both contests, and third, visiting at the state farm. University of Nebraska, and the manual training and domestic science departments of the Lincoln city schools. The afternoon program was a continuation of the forenoon program, the incoming afternoon trains being even more loaded than forenoon trains. The judging of the corn exhibits was begun in the afternoon. At five o'clock p. m., the "Q" street Lincoln city fire department made an exhibit run from the corner of Q and Tenth street east to Sixteenth street, much to the enjoyment of the visitors. Evening Session — December 14. The first general session was held at Grant Memorial Hall, Uni - versity of Nebraska. A complete stenographic report was made of this session and of all the subsequent sessions, an abridgement of which follows: The convention was called to order at 7 o'clock. Prof. C. H. Miller, director of music in the Lincoln city schools, led the boys and girls in learning the new state song, "Nebraska." "Nebraska Scenes on Canvas," the next number on the program, was conducted by Dr. G. E. Condra, of the university. This was made up of scenes from different parts of the state.

These scenes were for the purpose of showing the natural n of the state, and consisted of farm life, irri - gation farms, chalk formations, lakes in the sand hills, artesian wells, quarries of stone and sand ready to be manufactured into stone, the denizens of Nebraska of many years ago, and fossils in rocks. Dr. Condra's remarks, in connection with the pictures, were very instruc - tive and entertaining. In conclusion he said: "Now, as I have shown you all these things about our great state, I want you all to join in singing once more the chorus of the song 'Nebraska,' " which was done. Dr. E. Benj. Andrews, chancellor of the University of Nebraska, was then introduced as "the friend of the girls and boys of Ne - ■ a.." The chancellor's address on "The Reformed Country School" was much appreciated by the young people and teachers •Mem bled. The audience was then entertained by two excellent music num - bers furnished by the University School of Music.

We have not limited him to any subject. I am pleased to introduce Prof. John Hamilton of the Department of Agriculture." ADDRESS OF PROF. JOHN HAMILTON United States Department of Agriculture. •Young People of the State of Nebraska, Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: Your speaker, in introducing me, said that I had come all the way across the continent for the purpose of talking be - fore this audience to-night. I would like to correct that by stating that I was sent across the continent by the Department of Agriculture — the Secretary of Agriculture- — to learn from you what this meeting that you are holding means in the elevation of tl and girls of your state. To-day I have been engaged in inquiring among the friends who have had to do with the bringing of this great assembly together and what it stands for. Why is it that a meeting of this character has been brought about? How do you propose to utilize it in aid of agriculture in your state? "My official duties take me through the United States in con - nection with the farmers' institute work of the country. During the last year there were two scenes that impressed me more than any other. One was located at the St. Louis exposition in the great agricultural building which covered about forty acres of land, filled with exhibits from all over the United States and from every foreign country — the largest and most valuable collection of agricultural 1m- </seg>
            <seg id="p448">423 ri.TI'KAL EDUCATION AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING plementa and agricultural products that our country or auy try has ever seen in a single exhibit. "The scene In that great exposition most suggestive of pro - gress in agriculture, according to my view of progress, was that pre - sented by the state of Illinois which consisted in an exhibit of corn contributed 1 farmer boys, each boy contributing ten ears of corn grown by himself, and in front of each exhibit there was a photograph of the little fellow who grew it. Associated with this corn exhibit there was a small cabinet placed at the desk of the gen - tleman who was in charge of the Illinois display. Before it was placed this notice: "Please write upon a card the name of some hoy who belongs to th. Illinois.' By this means they were gath - ering together thousands upon thousands of names of the young people of the state of Illinois. TheM names were to be sent down to the uni - versity at Champaign, and there classified letters were to be subse - quently written by the authorities of that great university to every boy and girl whose name was put in this cabinet. You can understand what it would mean to a little fellow way up in one of the counties of Illinois to receive a letter from the chancellor of the university or the head of the school of agriculture, calling his attention to the fact that the university is organized for aiding the agricultural peo - ple of Ufc and it is interested particularly in our boys and girls, and especially in the little correspondent that was addressed. "The other scene to which I refer is this meeting to-night in which the boys and girls of your great state have been brought up to your university. Boys and girls coming from farm homes, from the country districts of Nebraska up to your university to see what that university has for them. Does it not impress you and all who are fortunate enough to witness it with this fact, that there is a great thirst out in the country districts for knowledge, and that this thirst has extended until the boys and girls even the smallest of them are anxious to learn what they can do to equip thmselves for their fight for life. "My duties bring me in contact with men and women who are interested in agriculture all over this country, and it is not an unusual thing for me to see several hundred, yes as many as two thousand men and women, agricultural people who have come up to spend from three to four days, and in some instances as much as a week at their state university, attending lectures, and inspecting the work which the experiment stations and agricultural colleges are doing in nid of farming people. I say that this is no unusual thing. It is oc - curring in many of the states of the Union each year, but I do not know of an instance in any other state in which our farmer boys and girls have come up to their university in such numbers, and from so widely separated districts as we witness here to-night. It is a demon - stration of rural interest in agricultural education that has not, so far as I know, been duplicated anywhere else in the Union. </seg>
            <seg id="p449">424 1 -PERINTi "I wish to say to you right here and now that the Department of Agriculture a' Washington is very much iir in the educa - tion of the peopl 1 of this country along agricultural lines. When I asked those who commissioned me to r&gt; the department before you to-niuhi what ! should say, i it will be ex - • 11 will lend your influent iblishing the principle essential to inter - cation if we are to have any permanent improvement in our agri - culture. It will be well for you to assure those present that we are •sted in meeting the needs of the young people for instruction &gt;e lines, and therefore glad to receive inquiries from them, and to send them such of our publications as may meet their needs." This is the message that comes from I . lture ou to-night. "That there is need for the national government to inter - self in this matter of th- of rural comnmi rticu - larly of the children in these communities, is evident from the fact that in many of the states the trend of population has been from the country into the city. In one state with which I am particularly familiar in the decade that preceded l»00 the population that came into that state during that decade numbered 143.000. Of that num - ber only Aent into the country, and 120,000 settled in the What is still more significant is that this 23.00U of which 1 speak settled, not in the agricultural counties, but in the mining manufacturing, and lumbering counties of the state, whereas the lltural communities lost altogether about 10, #90 of their popu - lation in that decade. "It is becoming a matter of great concern to the authorities of that state, and it is a matter of vital interest to the national govern - ment to discover some means by which this flow of population from the country into the city may be arrested. These people did not leave because agriculture is not a profitable business. There were other reason*. We all know that city life has not given to the mass of its people the living that it is possible for men to get in the country. It can be demonstrated on a blackboard to the satisfaction of any - one that the people who live on the farms are a class the best off of all of our population. You must take clerks and people engaged in all other occupations, mass them together and their daily wage does not average nearly as much as the daily wage of the people engaged in agriculture. "A proof of its profitableness is shown by the fact that out of $1,435,000,000 of exports from this country in 1904 over $853,000, - 000 or 59% per cent went from the country districts, showing that after the agricultural people have fed and clothed themselves and their families, and have fed all of those who are engaged In other occupations — after having fed eighty millions of people, over $800, - 000,000 was left as surplus to send to other lands. "This shows that agriculture is a profitable calling. It may not </seg>
            <seg id="p450">425 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION AND INDUSTRIAL TRA be profitable for you, or for me, but it is profitable to the great mass of people who are engaged in it, and the fact that so many have been leaving agriculture and going to the city is not due to the un - profitable nature of agriculture as a business. It is due to other causes, and I hold that it is due largely to the fact that the education that is given out in the country schools has been of such a character as practically to compel people to move from the country into the cities if they want to educate their children. "The truth is that in the country districts in most of our states the education that is there given has not advanced beyond that which was given thirty or forty years ago. It is a question whether in many of oil 'he country school hu&gt; lucational efficiency below that of forty years ago. "It has come to this that every man now knows that in order that his child ma;. I in life he must have education. The edu - cation, however, that is given out in the country districts, consists merely of the rudiments of an education, arithmetic, writing, reading and spelling, with a few other things that have been in the schools for all time past. \\ not changed our education in its char - acter and methods in the country to accommodate it to the new con - ditions. •\Ve wre in ral years ago in my nati\ u dis - covering the true conditions of our rural schools. Accordingly, an investigation was begun to see what was actually being done. • We wrote to the teachers in the 1,500 school districts in that state, ask - ing three queatloi First — How many class' ill hold each day? Second — What are the ages of your pupils? Third — What is the average number you teach? We found that in the rural districts of that state the teachers were required on the average to hear twen - il that some of the teachers held as many as forty classes. It is manifestly impossible, a physical im - possibility, for any man or woman to make scholars out of attendance upon a public school whei • minutes to a class, which was the average amount which the country school teacher gave to the children of that state. If you deduct from this the minutes that are required lor the pupils to go to and from their desks, the time necessary for the assigning of lessons, the keeping of order, and the recitation. That was the average time for hearing classes recite throughout the reported districts of an entire state with a population of more than a million agricultural people. "The question then came up as to what should be done to make the education of the country equal to the education that is given in the towns and cities. The teacher in the city had anywhere from six to seven classes a day, and Instead of having from eight to ten minutes to give to a class he had from thirty to forty minutes. The result was that in the city schools they had all of the studies that the pupils needed for modern education, whereas, in the country schools it was impossible to introduce new subjects beyond those that were </seg>

If he is to live in, and enjoy the country, he must devote some part of his time to the study of the things with which he is surrounded and with which he is to deal. Unless he can pet that education in the rural schools in the neighbor - hood in which he lives, it will be impossible for many of those who are living in the country to ever get that kind of knowledge that country life requires. The consequence is that people who desire the best for their children in many of our states have been leaving ■ luntry and going to the city where graded schools exist so that their children can be taught the things they must know in order ' in this century of industrial strife. lira i' was undertaken to correct this condition of things und to be impossible to add new studies that are needed now for the proper education of country children to the existing cur - riculum. It was clearly impossible to introduce into the rural schools any additional teaching under the then existing. The only possible solution of the problem was to establish graded schools. To do this it was necessary to consolidate several small district schools into one. The Hi road srhoolhouse, it was felt, would have to be abandoned, and the children be brought from areas from three to five miles in diameter to this school. That meant the transpor - tation of children and the bringing of them together into the cen - tralized schools. "The condition of things was brought to the attention of the legislature and an act was passed, authorizing the township to aban - don the old-fashioned country schoolhouse and bring the children to a centralized school, having this school officered with several teachiers, and the pupils classified according to their ages and ac - quirements. "Thus these country schools were enabled to graduate classes of students who were fitted for the high schools, and some of them for entrance to the freshman class in college. This was the solution of the country school problem in the state to which I have referred. "I believe that we are coming to this view all over the nation. uust centralize our rural schools and place in these schools sev - eral teachers and introduce the kind of studies that are necessary !n order that country children may be equipped for rural life. Much of the education that we are now giving tends to fit people for city life. If a school had been devised to drive people out of the coun - try, and make young people unsatisfied with country conditions, I do not suppose that a method could have been devised to accom - plish this better than the old fashioned course of study to which the rural school was confined. It fitted people for the professions, whereas the rural education we need to-day is of a kind that ought </seg>

Much of the compensation that comes to men and women in this world comes from this sentimental side of our life, that can only be fully gratified in the country. The city is full of men and women who are simply existing whereas in our country homes we have the inspiration of life all about us, and of the feel - ings that come to the man and woman who possess a home of their own, are self-supporting, are their own masters, and have all the ad - vantages of the city in addition to none of the disadvantages that most city people must endure. "I am sure that Nebraska has gone beyond most of the states in providing tor our rural students. From conversations that I have had with your superintendent of public instruction, I find that you have a system of classification of studies in all of your country district schools, and that you are solving this problem of rural edu - cation by making it possible for your country youth to get the edu - cation that they need for country life in the district schools at home. In this respect, Nebraska, I think, is among The foremost states of the Union, and the complete solving of this most difficult problem Is sure to come to us in th&lt;e near future, through such experiments as have been taking place in your magnificent state. "I am greatly interested in the farmers' institute work. Coun - try children should be brought to take some part In that important educational industry. We have been talking all of these years to adults, to people who have their living to make in the country, and we have been trying to get them to see the possibilities of their call - ing. The real work of improving the agriculture in the United States however, must begin in the public schools, and the education that we are giving to older people through the farmers' institute is in or - der that they may see that it is possible to take the truths of science that the agricultural experiment stations and colleges are revealing and teaching them in an understandable way to the smallest child in the public schools. "The great rural problem to-day is the question of the educa - tion of our country children, and I believe that question can only te solved by first securing the consolidation of our rural schools, which Involves the transportation of the children to and from their homes so that everywhere throughout the United States children in the remotest rural districts will have the same advantages of education as are given to those who are more advantageously sit - uated in the towns and cities. Nebraska, I am rejoiced to find, is taking the lead along this line. </seg>
            <seg id="p453">428 tTPEBINl - REPORT "I have taken your time this evening because I have felt that the points that I have tried to make are most important. If we will take up the question of the consolidation of our rural schools and convey our children to and from these schools in comfortable vans, we will, I firmly believe, have solved the country problem. We will have made it possible to pay teachers in the country schools salaries ranging from forty to ninety dollars per month, and to put into these centralized schools equipment and apparatus that will be the equal of that which is now found in the best town and city schools, and to have school gardens, and large and well-kept grounds surrounding these schools so that the teachers may have opportunity to demonstrate In a practical way the things that are being taught in their schoolroom work. If we had this introduced into rural life, the only great force that is to save the country from depletion and make it the abode of wealth and culture through all of the years to come." At this point in the program Dr. L. P. Ludden took charge of the ceremonies attending the introduction of the king and queen. King Corn entered the room and took his place on the stage attended by two sunflower attendants. He was garbed in a golden yellow - robe and crown adorned with trimmings of corn husks and carried a wand as Indicative of regal power. As he took his place Mr. Lud - den read a poem written for the occasion. Mr. Ludden: "A great many years ago when our forefathers landed in America they found growing a certain kind of grain called maize Subsequently they called it Indian corn, and when we came out to Nebraska we raised such an abundance of it that in a little while it crowded out the wheat so we simply called it corn and crown - ed it king. I will now read you a poem, written by Prof. C. A- Murch of the State Normal School at Kearney, entitled: The Song of King Corn. "The dews of heaven, The rains that fall, The fatness of earth, I claim them all. O'er mountain and plain My praises ring, O'er ocean and land, I am king! I am king! O'er the green hills, Flash my shining blades Paat dancing rills, Through sun-kissed glades, </seg>

Cities and states Arise at my call. Bright gold bursts out Where my footsteps fall. Where my russet plumes In the breezes swing, The glad earth laughs, For I am king! I'm king! I girdle the earth With shining bands. The groaning trains That sweep the sands, And ships that brave Old ocean's swing. Are mine, all mine — I am king! I am king! Would you dethrone me? Not so, not so. Still the golden tide Shall swel] and flow; The earth yields riches, The toilers sing, In the gold land, Where corn is king. King Corn was then presented and stood with scepter uplifted while his subjects gave him the honors. After the introduction. Pro - fessor Miller of the Lincoln schools sang a song, "Old King Corn," composed by Mr. Bishop, which was heartily applauded. Mr. Ludden: "Many years ago South America said, 'We will dispute the right of corn to be king in Nebraska.' So South America sent a bride up to this great country of ours to supplant, if possible, old King Corn, but they failed, and Nebraska simply joins to-night the bride and the king." Then while Queen Alfalfa, also attended by the sunflower boys, majestically entered the room and took her place on the platform be - side her lord, Mr. Ludden read the following poem, also composed by Professor Murch: </seg>

To this realm so rich and wide." Came the king, so proud and tall, Clad in suit of Lincoln green; Met the princess as she went, Dressed In robes of royal shieen.

Far across the utmost hills, Russet-plumed, he scatters gold Purple crowned, his royal bride, Blesses earth with wealth untold (Applause.) Queen Alfalfa was dressed in a gown of golden yellow covered with alfalfa. She wore a wreath of the same material. Then Mr. Ludden announced the entrance of the midget heir to the throne. The Heir to the Throne, Said King Corn one summer day, To his queen, Alfalfa Hay, "Though we rule this fair domain Rolling hill and sweeping plain, Though our subjects leal and true, </seg>

While Mr. Ludden was reading the poem little Sugar Beet In white with green beet leaves around her neck entered and was received with an ovation. Taking up a pinch of sugar Mr. Ludden announced, "With Nebraska beet sugar I christen thee' Sugar Beet.' " Sugar Beet responded as follows: "I guess you'll havu tf&gt; squeeze me, A sugar beet so very small, I was afraid to come at all, For fear some one would seize me. If you really would like to see How sweet a sugar beet can be, I euess you'll have to squeeze me." (Applause.) The various parts were taken by the following King, Russel Gentzler. Queen, Ruth Gould.

            <seg id="p457">432 HKKIXl S KWORT GIRLS' SECTION. 9:00 o'clock a. m. Miss Rosa Bouton, Director School Domestic Science of the State University, addressed the girls' section on The General Principles of Cooking." She said, in part, that the fact that the girls were there showed an ambition to do something worth their while and attention; that the most Important thing in the world is character building. She spoke of the home, the most important Institution in our nation and its being the very heart of the nation because there the individ - uals are trained. All this work of domestic science and domestic art is important because of its relation to the home. The physical life, the moral and intellectual life are there closely united; and because they are so closely interwoven the importance of the physical side is evident. We must have good food, comfortable clothing and be well housed in order to be most efficient in our life. People who are sick and who have the backache and headache cannot do the best intellectual work, nor can they develop the moral backbone in such condition. It is very easy to be cross. Miss Bouton enlarged and illustrated along this line and further spoke of the foundation principles of the work of domestic science and compared them to the corner stones of a building. She named one of them, cleanliness; another one, neatness; an - other, order; and a fourth, system. She discoursed at some length upon the Importance of each one. She also spoke of economy as uniting them. She also spoke of money and material; the importance of economy of time and strength. She said that those were the things that women especially were apt to forget — economy of time and strength, and spoke of the different ways of economizing; how people should have their kitchen; they do not have them conveniently ar - ranged: they have to take many more steps than would be necessary in order to perform their work. Instead of having it arranged con - veniently and for the purpose of accomplishing their work with the least degree of labor they get tired and weary, whereas if It were planned and arranged for convenience of time, labor and strength the same work could be accomplished in one-third of the time and effort. Miss Bouton then spoke of the inside work which was being done in the way of cooking and household economy and such matters in the kitchen laboratory of the domestic science department of the fctate university, extending a cordial invitation for all to visit that department at tho university. Great interest was shown in Miss Bouton's address, which was well received. The next address was by Miss Lyda j. McMahon, Superintendent Girls' Industrial School, Geneva, and entitled "What Girls Can Make From Corn." </seg>
            <seg id="p458">AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING 433 Miss McMahon devoted considerable time to speaking of what the girls were doing at the Geneva school. She said there were over fixty girls there and that more than half of them had raised the corn which they had used in preparing the articles that were brought down for the corn contest. When Miss McMahon asked the girls to do this work they asked the privilege of going into the kitchen and experimenting. The girls devised all of the exhibits that were brought. She said that the girls were very enthusiastic in their work and seemed to perform the work with great facility and with much interest. Miss McMahon took occasion to remark that while it was an in - dustrial school and that most of the children there had been sent there on account of some misbehavior, she found them much different than what people might judge, and said that the girls were doing excellent work, that there was no disposition on the part of the girls to show disobedience or anything of that kind. The exhibits from that school were very excellent and attractive. POSSIBILITIES OF FLORICULTURE. "Young Ladies: I am not going to talk about something above and beyond you, but of something within your reach. I wish to open before you the gates of a new and beautiful world where you can enter into the holy of holies of good old Mother Nature and help her work miracles. Do you want to be an artist? "Let me show you how, without pencil or brush. Take a piece of brown earth for your canvas, plant it with bulbs, plants and seeds, be generous with it, and you will soon have a picture no artist can copy. Your flowers will be alive; their fragrance will fill all the air. Like brides preparing for their nuptials they will make their toilet before you. It will be a scene of beauty to see those radiant hosts dissolving the rainbow to weave its tints into their garments. Your picture will be such that no artist can copy it. He will give you only flowers in effigy. They will be but the corpses of your creation. Those delicate tints of shadings will fill him with despair. "If he could reproduce your picture with blossoms that live and l-reath, he would be immortal. He cannot, and so you stand far ahead of him as an artist. "Think of the possibilities before you. Take my own case. My hands know how to toil. My fingers are knotted with rheumatism, and yet these hands are brothers of the brain. We work together, and as the result hundreds of thousands of flowers come up at our beck. The hoe is a wand in the hand of a king and beauty follows in U path. "Again. You can adorn a piece of land with known varieties of flowers, but right in the edge of the unknown there are those that mortal eyes have never seen waiting for your skill to call them to ■ (C. S.

I have planted fifty pounds of peony seed, and the thousands which will spring from them will be different one from the other and among them there will be tome of rare merit. "A few years ago a lady in Indiana planted some peony seed and produced many new and choice ones. I helped her to sell one for lion, she sold another for $150, after she had produced several clumps from each. I have had marvelous success with phloxes. These are natives of America. They were taken to France and the florists have wrought wonders with them. At first the flowers were the size of a dime, then they were made as large aa a quarter, then as big as a half dollar, and. then for a wonder as large as a silver dollar. I sent for the finest, planted them in the center of the group so the bees could cross them. I planted the seed and the flrsi year secured over twenty much finer than most of our Imported ones, some larger than a dollar. The Ne - braska Experiment Station at York has sent out a manual on the peony, the only one in any language, that can be had for thirty cents. And there is now in press a manual on the phlox, showing how you can work miracles with these glorious flowers. The price !b only fifteen cents in stamps; and then you can go into wonder - land and call out new and beautiful things all your own." BOYS' SECTION. Prof. A. E Davisson, principal of the University of Nebraska School of Agriculture, addressed the convention as follows: AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. (A. E. Davisson.) "Gentlemen: I say 'gentlemen' because the term means a gen - tleman, and has no reference to age; and I know you are all gentle - men. It affords me great pleasure to see in the Assembly Hall of the School of Agriculture such a large gathering of boys who are still In the public school, and yet who are sufficiently Interested in agri - cultural matters to come to Lincoln to show what may be accom - plished by giving particular attention to raising corn in a scientific way. When I speak of raiBing corn in a scientific way, I mean that yon have selected the seed with great care; you have given it the proper kind of cultivation; you have put it into and kept it in the right kind of relation with old Mother Nature, and as a result of your effort Mother Nature has accomplished the miraculous work of producing corn as beautiful as anything in ancient stories, and as marvelous, if not more bo, than the Seven Wonders of the World. It is a great thing to co-operate with nature. The reason it Is a great thing is because of the fact that nature comes from the hand of God, from the hand of Him who 'plants His footsteps in the sea and who rides upon the storm.' When you boys are helping nature </seg>
            <seg id="p460">AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING 435 to perform her work, you are really helping to accomplish the pur - pose of the Most High. So I say you have done a great work. "Do you know, when I was a boy, on a farm, I did not think as I followed the plow — and I followed it many a long weary day — I never thought I was in partnership with the Great Architect of the Universe. I never thought I was doing a great work in helping the earth to produce. I did not think when I was husking corn and throwing it into the wagon; when I helped put the wheat into the granary; when I took the hay and fed it to the cattle; when I took the foodstuff to the swine — I did not think that upon my efforts and those of others engaged in like work depended the provision of food in all forms for hungry millions of people. Did you boys ever think as you sat at your table eating the sugar-cured ham, or at least ham just as well cured as Armour's; when you were eating the beautiful white bread that comes from your mother's hand and ber great knowledge and experience; did you ever think while eating these things how much you depend on Mother Nature? Did you erer think, young gentlemen, that if you and the other boys like you all over the country, should fail to do your duty in co-operating with Mother Nature, that a catastrophe worse than any that can be imag - ined would follow almost immediately? And yet such is the fact. I ate breakfast this morning in my bouse; I expect to return there for lunch at noon; I expect to eat supper to-night on the train mov - ing between here and Chicago, and to-morrow morning I expect the restaurant keeper in Chicago to have things ready for me when I call for them. Why? We have never thought why, but it is be - cause the farmer, his son, his wife, his daughter, are all doing their duty faithfully. Is not it a beautiful thought when considered in that way? If you did not raise the beautiful corn, the corn with ears of beautiful gold; if you did not produce the beautiful golden grain of the wheat plant; if you did not take care of the domestic animals on the farm and make them fit for meat that will make you strong and enduring; if you failed to do all these things, I think the worst cat - astrophe in the history of all the earth would follow, and it would follow quickly. "So, let me say to you, young gentlemen, and say it with full knowledge that it is true, that the farmer, the farmer's son, the farm - er's daughter and the farmer's wife are the foundation stones not only for our present greatness but for all our future achievements. If any of you imagine that we in the university of Nebraska think that you are common people and that you ought to be embarrassed when you come up to speak to us, just get over that feeling. Call me Davisson if you want to. You have more right to call me Davisson than I to call you Jones or any other name. Why? Because you are engaged in the work of feeding the world. So much for farmers in general, but let me say a word about the farmers of Ne - braska. Eleven years ago if a person had come to Nebraska with the money, it could have been purchased for $300,000,000. To-day we </seg>
            <seg id="p461">436 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT have come to such a point in prosperity that our farmers' lands alone are worth three times that amount and more. We have a larger sum of money on deposit in our banks for every man, woman, and child throughout the state than in those of any other state in the Union. Do you know why this prosperity has come? It is because the farmers of Nebraska who went through the hard years of 1893-4 stood by their guns; stood at their posts and did all they could to assist Mother Nature. "We often speak with admiration of the Roman soldier who ttood at his post of duty even though the ashes, the lava and the fire of Mount Vesuvius poured down upon his head. Let me say to you, young gentlemen, and to older men who are here, that that heroism is not to be compared with the heroism of the Nebraska farmers who Htood at their posts of duty for three lor.g years with starvation staring them in the face, declaring 'We will hold on.' Our magni - flcent state to-day is the result of that. Search the pages of his - tory, if you will, and nothing can be found more astonishing, noth - ing greater, nothing more sublime, than the heroism of our peo - ple who stood by Nebraska; and the fact that they did stand by Ne - braska has made it possible for us to be one of the richest states in the Union. In speaking of them we frequently s;iy 'the common 1-eople.' Of course there is nothing derogatory in the term 'com - mon people,' but it is not the right adjective to use. When we ■peak of the farmers of Nebraska, we should call them the extra - ordinary people. (Applause.) • • • w, young gentlemen, I should like to go on and spend some time talking to you along this line, for it is a great subject. It Is a wonderful subject. There is one other thing I will say — there Is a disposition among some boys — I had it at one time toward my father and the trip that he gave me to the orchard was effective In the instruction I received — a disposition to think 'I know more than my father." The moment you begin to think father is an old fogy and that he does not deserve not only your full honor but your ab - rolute reverence, the sooner you dismiss it the better it will be for you. It will not do, young men!| These old farmer fathers of Ne - braska are the salt of the earth. They are the men we must honor. They are the men whose friendship I desire. They are the men who have always paid their debts. They are the men who have brought up families and kept them from contamination. They are the men who have made Nebraska what it is. When we refer to our great men, let us not speak of the United States senators and representa - tives in congress, our governors and other state officers as being the typical great men. Let us speak of the men who have made Nebras - ka what it is, as being the great men and honorable in all their rela - tions to life. (Applause.) "I must tell you a little about the School of Agriculture. It began ten years ago this month. We had fifteen students. We bad no building at the state farm where we could give instruction. </seg>
            <seg id="p462">437 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING The next year we had thirty-three and had only one room. I heard my first classes In the half story attached to the upper part of Professor Lyon's house, and bumped my head whenever I went In to hear my class. (Laughter). The next year we had fifty-one students and a little more room. We Just put on an addition to the building we had, in order to make it look like something. The next year we had fifty-seven students, a gain of only six. Then we got the experiment station building. The next year we had 114 students; the next 132, and then the next year we fell back to 119; the next year 206; last year we had 332. and this year we expect to have 400. We had two courses in the school — the winter course which begins the 2d day of January coming — and I hope there will ie some of the boys from this crowd present — and the three years' course. The three years' course began in September in 1898, with two students, I came out and began school with that number. I never felt so lonesome in my life. The second day another student registered. I vent down to the university in the afternoon and when they asked me how the School of Agriculture was getting along i said, 'Fine, the registration has increased 50 per cent.' We got another student on Wednesday, and then I said, 'We are doing well; our registration has increased 100 per cent.' I had to count it in per cents in order to make a respectable showing. We have to-day n the three years' course in the School of Agriculture 177 students. Our first graduating class was in 1903, and consisted of ten men only. Our second graduating class consisted of seventeen men, In 1904; in 1905 it contained twenty-four graduates. Providence per - mitting, next spring we shall have forty-four graduates, almost twice as many as Kansas graduated from her college last year, even though she claims to graduate more students than Illinois, Wisconsin, Min - nesota, and Nebraska. (Applause.) I am not a son of a seventh son, so have not the right to prophesy, but I do prophesy that in 1907 we shall have sixty-seven in our graduating class. And the beauty of it all is that these boys will go back to the farm and try to develop Nebraska. They do not go away feeling that they are above work. Let me say on general educational subjects that the moment the boy goes back to his father and mother without the disposition to turn in and help them even though he has to do hard work, he is doing a dreadfully wicked thing. The educated man must not be afraid to take off his coat if necessary, he must not be afraid to soil his hands. The one thing which should con - cern the educated man, is, Is it honorable? Is it respectable? Does it do something for humanity? (Applause.) "Now, what do we do in the School of Agriculture? We sim - ply teach our boys so ..hat the/ will go back and co-operate with nature; that is all. Professor Lyon will tell you, as soon as I am through, about how we teach our boys to work in harmony with nature in the raising ot crops; he should tell you how we teach them to work in harmony with nature in preserving and adding to the </seg>
            <seg id="p463">438 TE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT fertility of the soil. We also teach the boys to work in harmony with nature by teaching them what methods they must use if they would produce the best in the animal kingdom. "We have a student in the School of Agriculture who has been here now two years. Last summer one of his father's cows became sick with milk fever. We do not try to make veterinary surgeons, but do teach some few things about the science. This young man went to his home town and got the necessary appliances and gave the cow treatment; about the only treatment to be given was to work in harmony with nature. The next morning the cow got up and came down as usual, ready for business. In two week's time a neighbor's cow became affected with the same disease. The vet - erinarian was sent for. He came, examined the cow and said, She's got the milk fever; she will die in a short time, and I can't do any - thing for her.' They asked him to try to do something. 'No,' he said, 'there is no use of trying; she will die.' The farmer had heard about our boy and sent for him to come. He took along his caao and treated the cow. The next morning that cow was down at the house for breakfast. ( Applause. ) What a beautiful thing it is to work in harmony with nature as far as live stock is con - cerned. It is the testimony from all over Nebraska that our boys go back to the farm and are uniformly gentle, kind, and consider - ate of live stock. "Our boys not only learn the principles according to which they must deal with live stock — and concerning which Professor Burnett will speak to you — but they learn to be considerate and gentle with animals. "We not only do this, but we take our boys into the dairy and teach them to make butter as beautiful as gold; and as delicious to the taste as the fabled food of the Greek gods; they learn to deal with milk in such a way that when the little babe takes it into his stomach it is not a breeder of pestilence, but something that fur - nishes bone, sinew, blood, muscle, and insures a healthy growth. What a wonderful thing it is. Yet you will find people who will say that agricultural education does not pay. "I have a friend at Fort Calhoun, Douglas county. He has a dairy. He learned his business here in this school. He has a barn with cement floors. He has a water plant so that he can flush his barn and keep it as clean as a lady's parlor. When his men go to milk, they must wear white suits, wash their hands, clean their fin - ger nails, comb their hair, and appear in the presence of the lady cows as gentlemen. (Laughter and applause.)

He is a gentleman of the highest type; and whenever I meet him, as I frequently do, in the city of Omaha I feel that I am standing in the presence of one of nature's noblemen. "I think I have told you all my time permits of about the Agri - cultural School. Let me say in conclusion that it has been a great privilege to have you boys before me and to talk to you. I hope when you get large enough you will come to the Agricultural School. You will find boys here to give you a hearty welcome. We shall be glad to have you take all our work and when you go home to do so with a disposition to be more valuable to your father and mother than you were before; with a disposition to regard your fathers and mothers with more reverence and more honor than ever before. The results of agricultural education will be felt in all lines. In twenty years from now we shall see all over Nebraska fruit trees by the hundreds of thousands bringing forth every favor - able season, fruit that shall please the eye and delight the taste. We shall see the beautiful green of the alfalfa plant and the royal purpk bloom in every county. We shall see forest and shade trees dotting the plains that are now without a tree. We are going to make Nebraska as beautiful as any state in the Union. We shall see the dairymen producing $40.' worth of dairy products every year. Our corn crop is going to increase until we shall be the first state in the Union in its production. "We shall not only see all these things done, but also, men and women on th&lt;e farm who will be demanding for their sons and daughters training of the highest type. So, the result of it all will be that we shall obtain untold riches from old earth in corn, wheat and other crops, and best of all we shall have the highest type of citizenship in all the earth." (Applause). Professor T. L. Lyon, associate director of the experiment sta - tion followed with an address on "Improvement of the Corn Crop." He gave interesting information concerning the production and cul - tivation of corn in Nebraska and used specimens of corn instruct - ing the boys how to select and judge seed corn. Professor E. A. Burnett, director of the Nebraska Experiment Station followed with an excellent address on Variation in Domestic Animals. GENERAL SESSION Friday Afternoon, 1:30 — Agricultural Hall. Address by Prof. John Hamilton, Washington, D. C. "Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I feel quite embarrass - ed in undertaking to speak to you this afternoon for the reason that my official duties lie along somewhat different lines from those which this meeting represents.. The gentleman in our department who is in special charge of our sch»ol work is Mr. D. J. Crosby. He is </seg>
            <seg id="p465">440 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT thoroughly informed as to the condition and progress of this work throughout the country, and I regret exceedingly that his other duties have prevented his being with you in this meeting of the farmer boys and girls of Nebraska. "I shall talk to you for a little while about a phase of agri - cultural work that the department of agriculture has taken up for the purpose of assisting the several states. I refer to the Farmers' Institutes. "When the land grant colleges were established in 1862 it was believed that these institutions would supply the needs of the public In the matter of agricultural education. To the great disappoint - ment of the friends of agricultural education it was found that com - paratively few of the young people of the Beveral states attended the agricultural colleges or seemed to care for the education which they were created to furnish. For a good many years the colleges went begging for students. "This has been changed. Public sentiment has come to be In favor of this kind of education, and the institutions are being filled with the youth who wish to pursue studies along these new lines. "Whilst this is true, and we are rejoiced that it has come to be an actual realization, we nevertheless cannot fall to see how en - tirely Inadequate these institutions are for the great work of educa - tion that is needed to fit the entire body of country people for rural life. Suppose, for instance, that your institution here had 1,000 students in agriculture. What is that compared with the great body of youth distributed over your state who need instruction in agriculture. It is manifest that no one institution In a state can hope to educate all of the farming people who need instruction in their art. "As a consequence, some means had to be devised by which information such as is given in the class rooms can be taken out to the homes of agricultural people who can never go to college, teaching them how to farm better, and to appreciate more the oc - cupation that they have chosen as a life pursuit. "To meet this need, the Farmers' Institute was organized. The movement had its origin in the individual states. It was not a nat - ional affair in the sense of originating in the National Department of Agriculture. Ea&lt; h state organized institutes for itself independent of what others were doing in this direction. The institute had as lt» primary object the reaching of adult farming people who were actually engaged in carrying on the active operations of the farm. "This work has been in progress now about twenty years until institutes last year were held in all of the states of the Union ex - cepting two, reaching about a million agricultural people. "One of the valuable results of this work has been the arous - ing of the farmers to an interest in, and appreciation of the value of science as applied to agriculture. There was a time, not so very long ago, when to speak of a man as a scientific farmer was to </seg>
            <seg id="p466">441 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING cause a laugh. A remarkable change has come over us in this re - spect. We are now looking to our scientific Institutions for infor - mation that we need to help us out of our troubles as agricultural people, by solving our problems and prescribing remedies for our agricultural ills. This feeling has extended until now the interest 1b widespread, extending to the remotest and most isolated of our agricultural communities. The colleges and stations are now send - ing out their best experts to lecture to agricultural people in the institutes, and the state directors of farmers' Institutes are employing the best practical and most successful farmers to explain to oth - ers the methods which they have found most advantageous in the growing of crops, in the rearing of animals and in the treatment of their soil. Last year 993 lecturers of this character gave in - struction in the farmers' institutes of the United States. No bet - ter teachers can be found anywhere than those who have been giv - ing instruction in the institutes of this country. "The Institutes have accomplished two important results: They have brought the practical farmer to appreciate the value of scien - tific truth as applied to his profession. They have brought him to respect science. They have also taught the scientific man, on the other hand, to respect the practical man, and have shown that it is possible for a capable teacher to take scientific truth and make it understandable and useable to the ordinary farmer who has had no scientific training. So that now science and practice have come together, and the representatives of both are in a teachable and receptive frame of mind. "Until now the farmers' institutes have followed the same gen - eral method of work in all of the states. A meeting of farmers is called, several lecturers give addresses on various farm subjects, some discussions are had, and the meeting adjourns for a year, to re - peat substantially the same program year after year varying the speakers and to some extent the subjects. In some of the states in which the institutes have been longest fn operation there is a growing feeling that we ought to advance beyond this old method and devote more time to particular topics so as to make an exhaustive study of some single subject that is of importance to the agriculture of the community. To meet this new demand the National Department of Agriculture has suggested the organizing of a series of movable schools that will each remain in a community from ten to fifteen or twenty days, giving instruc - tion in some specific thing, and selecting out of that community and forming into a class those who are interested in that particular specialty, organizing small classes for study under the supervision of an expert teacher who comes equipped with all the apparatus for teaching the specialty that Is required. The department is hav - ing these courses of study for movable schools prepared by the best experts that the country has. Just now four such courses are in </seg>
            <seg id="p467">442 STATE SOPERINTh - REPORT preparation; One on cheese making; one on butter making; one on poultry rearing and one on fruit growing. "The plan is to have these schools equipped by the state di - rectors of farmers' institutes and sent out under a capable teacher to localities in which there have previously been organized classes of not less than eight nor more than fifteen persons, who agree to i all the lectures and engage in all of the practice work that the course requires, and the teacher is to be provided with all the ap - paratus and appliances necessary to teach this subject in an up-to - date and effective manner. For instance, if he is to teach butter making he shall have a modern butter making outfit with ther - mometers, churns, Babcock testing machines, butter workers, ap - paratus for making BJUUya After the delivering of a lecture, th« students are &gt; to put on their aprons, and go to work and do the things that the lecturer has outlined, and thus become familiar with the practice as well as with the theory of butter mak - ing. Each course of study is prepared so as to begin at the elemen - tary end of the subject, and continue in successive step to its com - pletion. the teacher is expected each day to visit the homes of one or more of his scholars and give advice respecting the improvement of methods for carrying on the particular branch of agriculture that he is engaged in teaching. "It is expected that upon the completion of the course there will be left in each community visited from eight to fifteen persons who will be well equipped for doing the things that they have been taught, and thus add to the efficiency and productiveness of agri - cultural methods in minunii: "If the school is on the rearing of poultry, instruction in this Industry will be given. In like manner if it is upon the making of cheese, fruit growing, or other agricultural specialties. "Tlv r having finished his instruction in one locality I his apparatus to another in which a similar class has been organized, and repeats the instruction, and so continues throughout the year. "It is believed that these schools will furnish facilities by which many of our young men and women who are unable to go to college will have a section of the college brought to them. In other words we are trying to extend the college beyond its interior work in the class room out into the rural districts to meet with and aid the youth and older men and women who need Its help. "This is the first item which I have had in mind to present this afternoon. It is a great advance upon th« old methods that the institute has been pursuing in previous years. These schools can go into the remote communities where men have had no educational advantages; where boys and girls scarcely know there is an agri - cultural college in their state, or that there is any information that would aid them In their life as farming people. All through the </seg>
            <seg id="p468">AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING 443 states there are plenty of young people and older ones as well who need simply to be awakened to the possibilities of agriculture, to cause them to thirst for knowledge of how Its possibilities may be realized by them. To all such, the teacher in the movable schools will say: 'If you desire further knowledge of this subject than I have been able to impart in the limited course that has been given, go up to your agricultural college and enter its classes and take advantage of its superior equipment and corps of expert teachers. and perfect yourself in the specialty that you have chosen, and be - come an expert in your line of work. "If we would succeed in agriculture we must cater to the public taste, and the public taste has become educated until it is now fastidious, no longer to be satisfied with the lame, the halt, the blind, the gnarled, and the defective animals and articles that once we thought good enough for human use. "It is the uncommon article in the market that brings the top price. The common is and always will be cheap. It is the pound of butter that is worth a dollar that brings a dollar. - have a fine example down stairs in the room below of how attractive and appetizing corn bread can be made. I saw an item the other day in. I think the} Youth's Companion, giving an account of the experience of two ladies who went visiting to Mt. Washington for a summer outing. They hadn't very much money, and when the matter of where their vacation should be spent Mt. Washington was proposed. The older girl said to her sister, 'Jennie, we haven't got much money and we are going up where there are plenty of people who have money to burn. We will not be in it at all.' The other replied, We will simply have to take a lower place and go to the foot of Mt. Washington and get the best out of it we can.' The older sister then put the question, 'Have we got th&lt; nerve for that?' The 'hat they had the nerve and went. The boarding house where they located was not very good, indeed thin^ • &lt;lly bad. After a couple of weeks' of this experience one day at dinner a dish of food that had been baked and was muss - ed up beyond recognition was brought in. The woman of the house evidently impressed with the fact that it was not in very prt able shape, in half a, marked: 'It looks like it had been e't but it aint.' The consuming public want articles in presentable condition. Just like the corn bread in the room below. Any one of the ar - ticles in that exhibit is fit to go upon the best table in New York City or anywhere else in the world. I am glad that I am not on the committee to judge them for I would insist on giving a premium to every exhibitor. It is a wonderful exhibit, and has been made by children. We used to think that a child could do nothing but make a noise and get itself into mischief. Here we have young girls from all over Nebraska coming to the capital city of their here for </seg>
            <seg id="p469">444 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT exhibition the products of their skill in that most difficult and im - portant household art, the preparation of food. "We used to believe that skill in the performance of the var - ious operations embraced by what we called the mechanic arts could only be acquired by adults, and then only after years of practice in the particular industry whose mysteries the apprentice desired to follow. Now we know that operations of this character can be taught in school to children, and in the odd hours that can be spared from the regular course of study. Children can be taught to perform work along mechanic lines that will compare as favor - ably with that of expert workmen of years of experience as the corn bread displayed in the room below compares with that prepared by the expert chefs of the most fashionable hotels, being just a trifle better than anything these high-priced cooks can produce. "Children can be taught anything and taught it in but little time if they have the right kind of Instructors. The movable school proposes to have the most skilled instructors that can be procured. No school can rise higher than the qualifications of its teachers. If it has poor teachers it is a poor school. If its teachers are cap - able, enthusiastic, and in love with their work you have a good school. All depends upon the character and qualifications of the instructors that you select. "The movable school of agriculture, well-equipped with appara - tus for instruction and expert teachers, sent out all over this coun - try will revolutionize agriculture in the United States, and slake to some degree, at least, the thirst for knowledge that now universally exists. "I wish to call your attention to another matter that the Nat - ional Department of Agriculture has asked congress to do for the improvement of the farmers' institutes: "Farming people, Mr. Chairman, are trained observers. Their occupation is such as to require that they shall form their judg - ment as to the dualities and needs of animals, crops and soils largely from their appearance. Much of their education is through what they see, and as a consequence, if you wish to continue their edu - cation the best possible channel has been found to be not through their cart, but through their eyes. The living object or its repre - sentation in a photograph projected upon a screen, or the object il - lustrated by a chart often conveys more information in a minute than could be imparted in a half hour's talk. "The department has had lectures on various farm subjects prepared, illustrated by lantern slides. These have been found to be very useful wherever it is possible to present them. They, how - ever, can only be shown at night or in a darkened hall and require apparatus that is somewhat inconvenient to transport. In order to supplement these object teaching appliances the department has asked congress to make an appropriation to the office of experi - ment stations to be used in the preparation of a series of agricul- </seg>
            <seg id="p470">ILTIRAL El&gt;' INDUSTRIAL TRAINING tural charts for use in institute work. The plan la to have chart in series, as for instance, one series upon Indian corn, the illus - trations starting with the seed and its germination and showln iu succession its development up to the matured plant. The pre aration of these charts is to be placed in the hands of a corn exper and when he has outlined the points to be presented, provide hi with a skilled artist to make drawings of the parts to be illustrated and then have them lithographed and printed in colors for the use of the institute lecturers. I "In presenting the several subjects it is proposed to have but item on any one chart so that the attention of the audience will be distracted from the point under consideration, but be con - rated upon that one thing until the lecturer is ready to display next. In this way, it is believed, much valuable truth can be trted, and audiences be interested to an extent that would not y other nieth I "To have charts of this character prepared will require a con - able sum of money, especially if they are to cover the subject griculture, in its several branches and departments, but when engravings are once made the subsequent cost of the several is will be merely that of press work and paper, so that it will &gt;ossible to supply sets of charts to lecturers, schools and col - ; iit merely nominal cost. I "These are the two lines of work by the Department of Agri - ire relating to farmers' institute improvement that I desired ave you consider with me this afternoon, and I hope that when proper time arrives you will use your influence in having these &amp;ble schools started in your state and that you will see that your ational institutions engaged in teaching agriculture avail them - ;s in their instruction work of the charts that are proposed to jrepared by the National Department of Agriculture at Wash- N'EBRASKA'S GREATEST PRODUCTS. B Professor G. E. Condra, of the University of Nebraska, was in - aced and addressed the convention as follows: I "Young People, Ladies and Gentlemen: I am pleased to have privilege of speaking to you this afternoon. My reasons for ng on this occasion are three: First, I was born and raised lie farm, and most of my relatives are farmers. Second, I have in young people of your age, and third, the subject to be dis - }d has considerable importance. Let me speak very directly as one who has had experience with young people. "Now to the subject. 'Nebraska's Greatest Products.' Have you decided or named them in your own minds? How are we to </seg>
            <seg id="p471">446 STATE SUPERINTEKDENTS REPORT the United States where coal and iron are said to be of greatest importam • :ie a fuel and the other used in the manufacture of many useful articles. They are not valuable products in our state. We cannot give them first place. Most of you would select a farm crop. Just last night you crowned alfalfa 'Queen' and corn "King". There are other queen and king crops. In the south, cotton is king. There the lives of many people are devoted to the raising of that great plant. Even the sessions of school are regulated by it, the boys and girls attending in July and August, between the cultivation and picking seasons. When we remember how Impor - tant the cotton plant really is, and that many useful articles are manufactured from its fibre and seed, we are willing to vote It king crop for the southern states, though second in importance in the United States "Another queen is wheat. Our state raises much of this grain. You know how it is grown and marketed and something of its var - ious uses, but, is it Nebraska's greatest product? If not, what do you wish to name? I see that you are agreed and that the verdict is unanimous — in favor of corn (applause). Now, are you quite sure that your decision Is right, and that it will stand? When we recall how much of this king of crops is raised in the United States and that Nebraska is one of the seven principal corn-growing states, we justly become proud of our production. Do you know how much corn was raised in Nebraska this year? Well, if we could place It all together it would make a very great pile. Then, if it were loaded into wagons, forty bushels each, and if it were possible to place the wagons and teams in a line extending eastward from the state farm, how long a line do you suppose it would make? Would it reach to the Mississippi, Cleveland, or to New York City? Then if it could be continued across the oceans and continents, how far do you sup - pose it would extend? Well, we could load enough wagons to thus span the world and have corn to spare. No wonder you vote corn king of grains (applause). "Have you thought much of Nebraska's lands and crops? Some of us go about the state considerably. We see broad fields almost everywhere. The country is rich and big. It is at its best in the summer time when the small grains are being harvested. People living in eastern states do not know how fine our landscapes really are. Some of you live as far out as Holdrege, Ord, Broken Bow and Valentine. What sights greet your eyes as you make the trip to and from Lincoln? I would like to be able to describe the agri - cultural scenes of such a trip in the country where you live. Beyond description are those fields of corn, oats and wheat, and the farm homes' The land is unusually smooth, and only the curve of the earth hides the thousands of additional farms from view (applause). It is the country where corn is raised In abundance. You boys and your fathers prepare the seed beds, plant, cultivate, gather, and finally feed or ship the corn which we have christened 'King.' Your </seg>
            <seg id="p472">AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING 447 principal purpose is to raise more and better corn. You increase the yield and quality by seed selection and by careful cultivation. You are learning how to select and grow corn which produces the largest possible amount of shelled corn per acre. The product of your earnest toil is used finally as food for the world. "Just now you are all sure that we have correctly named Ne - raska's greatest product, yet it may be in order for us to con - lnue our observations and inquire a little further. Let us visit typical farm, there to see the crops, barns, fences, farm animals, rchards and other things of interest. When there we soon realize hat the farm is a many-sided or complex institution, and that all f its interests demand intelligent labor. Out in the barn is the ather, and in the fields are his sons — busy at work. But, all of arm life is not out-of-doors. About the house may be found the mother, little children and perhaps one or more grown up daugh - ers. There we find the real farm home — the place where mother resides! Do you realize how important a place the farm and arm home have in our state? No one has yet adequately described hem as a type. They are not all alike in kind and organization. "Have you heard the story of the rich farmer? Let me tell It &gt;riefly. This farmer belonged to a type which is only poorly repre - sented in our state. He is said to have possessed fine barns, fields, lorses, cattle and swine of which he was very proud. His place was widely known, for his cattle and swine had won premiums, nd his horses, races at the fairs. So the farmer was much plow d ith his lot, especially when visited by a reporter from a leading ewspaper. The reporter met the rich farmer in a lane leading o the barn, and was immediately invited to luncheon. Upon enter - ng the house, the guest saw a small boy shrink from the presence f the farmer, leaving the house. The mother and daughters ap - peared to be so many evidences of ceaseless toil. After lunch, the men made their way back to the stock barns, the farmer and owner irecting the route. They visited a well-kept barn containing a ne herd of thorough-bred cattle, and then the fast horses. There, te rich man explained the horses' food, which consisted of the best lay and grain, and then, more in detail, the care and training ecessary to produce really good horses, such as his. "The stalls re cleansed often, even washed,' said he. 'Also each horse has a pecial trainer.' Everything about the barn showed the truth of he owner's statements, yet the guest did not fail to note that the armer had said, many times, these are 'my barns,' 'my cattle' and my horses.' "The next and last place to which they went was to the swine sheds. After passing and observing a number of fine animals, they came finally to the king of the lot. The rich farmer said, 'See that animal! Money could not buy him! He is the best of his kind, and my hog.' Just then the reporter, by changing his position a little, caught sight of a poorly clad and illy-treated boy, who, by </seg>

Turning to the farmer the guest said: 'A-n-d, w-h-o-s-e boy is that?" The reply came hesitatingly, He's mine but he'll never amount to much.' And then the reporter said rather quickly "No wonder, why don't you give him an equal chance with the hog?" What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul'.' 1 May we not say also what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own son or daughter (ap - plause i .

Broadly stated, your worth depends upon three things. Body, mind and character, these three, but as one. "Young people must have good food and plenty of exercise in order to develop strength of body. As a whole you appear to be healthy looking young animals (laughter), yet there are sev - eral youngsters here who should straighten up just a little if they wish good lungs and active bodies (they straighten). Then how about the hump-backs, rounded shoulders and curved spine (all erect)? They will not add to your value, boys, when you become men. Good form, health and proper carriage are desired in horses. Are they not even more important in men and women which you are to be? "On the farm and everywhere, it is knowledge that saves and ignorance that wastes.

And you know that a higher education is within the reach of most every one, but it is left to his or her own choice and effort. If you are to become proficient in any line, such training will be very necessary. Some people score high in body and mind, but too low in char - acter to be classed as manly men and womanly women. This means that you should stand for right things and thus as you grow be - come manly and womanly. You cannot afford to be tardy, lazy, dishonest, careless and mean; for such traits soon show in one's life. A man's body is usually an expression of his character, and the character shows best in one's face. A few here may have been a little too cross and melancholy at times; others, giddy. Most ot you are cheerful, energetic, and not afraid of work, and that is a good way to be. Ton young people should run, jump and have a good time. You are not all fully grown yet. You will have to eat much, play a great deal and work also to become men and women of full stature. One thing is sure, no one can afford to be mean and you know why. As sunshine and warmth are necessary for the growth of field crops, so are cheerful moods and right action 1 for the full de - velopment of boys and girls. "During this convention you have heard talks by Chancellor Andrews, Professor Hamilton and others. Those grown up farmer boys have given of their experience, of their lives. They have caused you to think more of the farm than ever before. The lessons which you have learned on seed selection and cultivation may have value also in your own lives. In other words, the fathers and mothers to be, of our state, should be fit for selection. It is quite appar - ent that some boys present to-day have been looking often in the direction of certain healthy and good girls (applause and laughter). Also a few of the older girls may be wondering who those large and nice looking fellows are (applause by boys). We cannot blame you for this, at least, if the girls can cook as well as they say they can, and if the boys are manly fellows (applause). "Young people, fathers and mothers, we have briefly reviewed some of the main products, that you might thereby see their rela - tion to the state's greatest products. Corn is king crop.

"Things are changing; this is a day of education and adaptation. The boys of our state must work and think also if they hold and further improve the fine lands which their fathers leave them. If there is anyone in the world who has a just title to anything, it is the farmer who has braved the storm and improved his land. You fathers and mothers covet the best for your children, too, and you know that you cannot alone give them strength of body, mind and character.

(Continued BUSINESS MEETING The chairman announced the business before the convention to be the adoption of a constitution, election of officers and such other business as might come before the meeting. On account of the crowded condition of the hall, and from the fact that many visitors were present and that the different school districts and counties were represented by unequal numbers of delegates, the chairman suggested that for the further organization of the meeting, an ad - journed meeting be held in which each school district in the state represented at the meeting be entitled to one delegate and that such delegates be empowered to adopt a constitution, carry out its immediate provisions, and transact such other business as might come before it. A motion was made to this effect and unanimously adopted. The chairman announced the meeting of delegates to be held in the north audience room immediately following the adjourn - ment of the general session. Before adjournment, Superintendent McBrien announced the presence of Dr. Ludden and request was made that Mr. Ludden relate the story of "You're It." Mr. Ludden respond - ed not only with "You're It," but with a general talk which greatly Interested and pleased the audieii' "YOU'RE IT \M&gt; " GET THERE." Mr. Ludden: "I am not going to do like Professor Condra, go down there on the floor, because there is no space between you and me. I want you to see me. I am a little fellow, Dr. Condra said I was a big man. Now, I was down at Sedalia, Mo., recently at- </seg>

You can tell how much I weigh. He had a little bit of a boy beside him, twelve years old; like that boy that Dr. - Condra told you of out yonder, where the hog was so big and the boy so small. While there seated beside his father in the car and the car filled nearly as full as this room, as we went along toward the station presently three ladies entered fhe car, and the father said. Willie, get up and Rive the lady a seat.' Willie got up and gave the lady a seat, then he looked down and said, "Papa, if you would get up, then all three could sit down.' (Applause.) That is not McBrien's story of 'You're It. 1 "I have several stories about 'It.' I stood on the street corner as these boys and girls were walking along O' street yesterday; an express driver came along and he said to Jack, 'Look at them! Corn raisers! Don't they think they are it?' (Laughter). I don't know whether that is the story McBrien wants or not. I want to say to you, as that man said to the driver on the other wagon as they passed each other and pointed to the boys and girls that have come into this corn contest, You're It.' And you are a mighty part of the 'It' of Nebraska just now. (Applause.) "At one of the. asylums not long ago one man had been severe - ly beaten by a mildly insane patient in another ward of the same institution. When picked up he suddenly became insane and was cairied by inmates into the toilet room, and before the guards reached there the hot water had been turned on him until that person had been cooked to death. This made people afraid to go by there, fearing that some of those mildly insane might become sud - denly insane and take them and do likewise. A business man saw some patients out on the ward and he said, 'What if they should ne suddenly insane?' Looking back, as he walked near the corner of the grounds, he saw one of them really running towards him with all speed, and he started to run, that he might reach the street car ahead of the man. Down the road they went just as fast as they could go, and the crazy man gaining on the business man in front of him until the business man from sheer exhaustion fell to the ground and was unable to arise; and he looked back and saw that crazy man coming. And ha crowded on toward the prostrate man, who said, 'Well, I guess my time has come; I might as well say my prayers and be ready to die because he is going to beat my brains out.' And the crazy man rushed In upon the prostrate form and as he tripped over him he reached down and touched him and said, 'Tag, you're it.' i Applau^ "So I say unto you boys and girls of Nebraska, just as you say on the school grounds, as you said yesterday and day before, and next week as you chase each other around the play grounds and say, 'Tag, you're it,' you are it in more ways than one in this wonderful great of ours of Nebraska, great in its opportunities, wonderful in its priv- </seg>

"Then it is a splendid time to go down in the city and move along in the great work that stands before you. I love to be ai those who come from the farm, the great every-day people. You know one of our great men said, 'God must love them, the mon people, because He has made so many of them in this wonderful world of ours.' And those who come in from the farm and do work on the farm can hold their heads Just a little bit higher because they have the approval of God. Agriculture is the oldest of all the vocations and the newest of all the sciences in this twentieth century. They are the great every-day people. "I was out in Pueblo, Colo., two years ago spending some months there and one day towards spring in that great state of Colorado there came Ringling Bros.' circus. It was the first time in all the years the mountaineers had had the opportunity to come down from the camps, and I will never forget th&lt; Hundreds and hundreds of those mountaineers left their mining homes. The winter snow had gone and it was the first time they were able to come down into Pueblo and see the city. The throng that went up and down those streets, those mountain people, great plain, every - day people — men there with their wives, boys with their sisters — with others' sisters — fellows who had their girls out for the first time in their lives — you could tell them every time — he had her by the hand for fear that Dr. Condra or some other fellow like him might take her away from him. (Applause.) And I saw one cou - ple, especially the boy dressed in the cowboy's boots and pants tucked in them and the girl with a red dress and green hat — the two colors didn't harmonise — they went up and down that street over and over again, he holding her hand all the time. The soda fountains were doing splendid in that city that day, and on Fourth and Main street they had a great crowd of these people there. And the crowd watched. Finally I saw this couple going back and forth, and as they came up to the fountain, the fellow said, 'Feller, give us some of that water.' The soda man said, 'What flavor will you have? What flavor do you like?' The fellow said, 'What have you cot?' 'Anything; just name the flavor you want, sir.' The good fellow looked at his girl and said, 'There ain't any flavor we like better than onion; give us some onion.' The soda water dealer said, I haven't any.' The fellow said, 'What have you got?' And then he went over a long list, and when he got through, the fellow said, 'Give us some strawberry.' He gave it to them, and when they had about half emptied their glasses the fellow said to his girl, 'That fellow is giving us only common Colorado water sweetened.'

That you will always find that on the farm there is an opportunity for the exercise of the greatest brain power that you possess in developing and bringing yourselves into a higher state of possibility. "Going east in April this year, a gentleman across the seat from me in a Pullman car in the early morning handed me a little pamphlet paper published in Indiana and he said, 'I have read this and it is very peculiar, and I would like to have you just read that if you will." And I read two or three pages — which had so greatly pleased him. This was the report of a man that England sent over lo America to discover why America moved forward with such great strides. That man came to observe and to study, as Professor Ham - ilton told us last night. He came to observe customs and ways. He says in this report: 'I left my home and took my passage on a vessel and as it sailed out of the harbor of my city, and I looked back to see how beautiful was our city, till it seemed that I never saw the city so beautiful in my life. And very prominent among all of the others I could see the tower of our great St. George, touched by the sunlight. I watched it, and I could see, so bright was the light, the pendulum as it swung back and forth. And every time that pendu - lum swung back and forth it seemed to say to me, 'take it easy t-a-k-e i-t e-a-s-y; you must take it easy, old man,' and I said, 'that's me.' England is paying my expense in going to America, and 'take it easy, take it easy' I would, while they paid my bills. "And no sooner was our vessel landed at New York and the gang plank put up, than I heard some one saying, 'Step lively, step lively, sir,' and we were rushed down that gang way and a fellow collared me and said, 'Hotel sir, hotel sir,' and I was soon hustled into a cab and whirled up through narrow streets between tal buildings to a mammoth hotel, ushered into the office where I regis - tered and was assigned a room. Another fellow put me in an ele - vator and in a few seconds I was shot up to the seventeenth story before I knew what had happened and I was shown into a room lighted with electricity, and he had turned on the light and gone be - fore I knew it, and could not think what kind of a 'tip' I should give him. Soon I heard a strange noise on the mantel; it was a little clock, and its pendulum swung back and forth rapidly, tic-tic-tic-tic, and it seemed it was simply saying to me 'Get there! get there! get there!' ' And so young men and women from the farms of Nebraska,, you are into the work here where we give you the possibility of act - ing like that little pendulum, 'Get there! get there!' " (Applause.)

BEFORE KING CORN CAME TO NEBRASKA (By Gov. J. H. Mickey.) "Mr. Toastmaster, Boys and Girls, Ladies and Gentlemen, Fel - low Citizens of Nebraska: I am very glad to greet you here to- Light. It has been an inspiration to my soul. I am glad to live to see the day to witness this sight here to-night. Any of us and all of us are proud of this opportunity. I heard President Roosevelt say when he visited the state, in his speech at Grand Island two years ego in April, he was talking about the hogs, cattle, corn and alfalfa and the great things we were having in Nebraska, and around in front of him was a bank of about an acre of school children, and as he looked down on the school children, he said, "I want to congrat - ulate you also on your great crop of children both in quality and quantity.' I say that is all right, it is the boys and girls and the way we raise them that is the great hope of our future. • • » "But I am here to talk about 'Before King Corn came to Ne - braska.' I was here before he came here and that was thirty-seven years ago. I remember when I was a bit of a boy of reading what Hor - ace Greeley Bald. I was born and lived down east from here, over along the Mississippi river. I remember he said, 'Young man, go west and grow up with the country,' so I followed his advice and came from the state of Iowa to Nebraska in a prairie schooner. I used to break prairie in Nebraska with oxen, thirty-five, thirty-six and thirty-seven years ago. I used to plant trees when they would not grow on the prairie because it was too dry. I used to plow the soil and help prepare it to raise the great things we enjoy here to-night. Do you know that King Corn is wedging his way into the civilization of the world? is helping to feed the world? Don't you know that the land that produces the corn is going to be the most valuable land in our country, and that we are in the corn belt? and that the corn belt always raises good boys? and if you have good boys you are always sure to have good girls in this country? Now sir, it is absolutely true that we are raising the best boys and girls in Ne - braska of any state in the Union (great applause). I know what I am talking about because I have five boys myself and four girls. (Ap - plause.) "I said to the president: "How many children have you?" He said. 'I have six and I wish I had a dozen.' I replied, 'Mr. President, you will have to take a back seat, for I have got nine,' and I am proud of it.' I tell you the thing to do is to put the right kind of faith </seg>

I am so glad to see them getting ready. Don't be afraid of work. The boy and girl who toils will be the man and woman fifty years from now to help run the world. How we need to cultivate the dis - position to toil! This is a remarkable time, and an age when great things are being done, and the world is looking to the corn belt country for food. Agriculture is bound to be a great business, still greater in the future than it is now. It is a great thing to change the great American desert into a great corn field, and these boys who are growing up in front of me here will help to do it. I have five boys, and 1 know how old the youngest and the oldest is, but I get mixed up about the ages of the middle ones. (Laughter.) "It is a great thing to be able to select intelligently the seed that you plant in the ground. I want you to bear in mind that the time has come when it takes as much brain power to care for the stock, to feed and protect and look after it and be the producers of this great country of ours as it does in any profession in life. (Ap - plause.) We are just waking up to the fact that Nebraska is equal to any of the other states in the Union. The time was when they used to think the boy didn't need to know much about farming. That time has .gone by. Some of my boys know more about farming in one hour than I do in twenty-four hours, because they have studied it. And it is very important to know how to raise the corn and how to raise the steer that he will pull down the scales at from 1,800 to 2,200 pounds Instead of 800 pounds or 1,000 at a given age. ThU great corn country of ours is going to be one of the greatest states in the years to come. I am sure that these boys are on the right track. God bless you and lead you into a life of usefulness."

Toastmaster: "We have a man here to-night, whose legs are long enough to reach from his body to the floor, and not an inch longer, no matter what he thinks when he gets up to address you.

When I look around over this audience, it seems to me that it is a most remark - able audience. Whenever I see a company of boys and girls like this, I am always reminded of my own boyhood days, because as one of our own thoughtful writers once said, ] was a little boy and girl myself. 1 It is said of Bryant, our first great American poet, that he never bad a boyhood, or if he had, he had no recollection of it. I wish to say to these boys and girls here to-night that I had a boyhood, and the reco: of that boyhood were indelibly stamped upon my memory by mothers slipper. &lt; Laughter, i &lt;- I am to speak to you to-night for three minutes on the subject of The Things That Were and the Things That Are.' In doing bo I will necessarily hav&gt; iething of the generation that is now upon the stag*- a, managing and conducting the affairs with the on immediai' 'ding.

The boys and girls of the present time enjoy some of the things we did 1* particular. They have their football, baseball and basketball their socia and all of those things which add so much to zest in their studies and which were for the •edification and uplifting of the boys and girls in school life. re Mr. Thomas reviewed the changes brought il and home life by modern conditions.) • • • "Those i .ghtful days, but modern invention has changed things and d&lt; much of what we considered good. Modern in - vention has separated iwople. Instead of making them sympathetic, it has made them cold and distant. People used to die a natural death ad not ermi of bacteria and ap - pendicitis at that time. We had to die a natural death. Things changed wonderfully, and the generation th;t ling upon the scene to-day, nd girls represented here to-night, will have to fight out the battles that we have begun. You are richer by far than any other generation that ever lived upon the face of arth. All that man has ever known and written in books for ten generations preceding ours, is not sufficient to measure up with the advancement made in this generation that has preceded you. You have inherited it all. You are the richest ]&gt;eople the world has ever seen. While we have begun the fight, you will finish it. " (Applause.) Toastmaster : 'I was out in Denver a little while ago. There was a convention there at that time of the artists of the world. One of these gentlemen said: "Will, do you remember that great painting of mine of Abraham Lincoln?

The other fellow said. That's nothing. I painted a picture so true to nature of an iceberg floating on the ocean that my wife put it in the refrigerator and used it all summer for ice.' At this a farmer standing by, became interested in the subject, and was asked if he painted? 'So.' he said, 'I don't paint, but I got a gal at home that draws pictures. She drew a picture of our old speckled h - life-like that I could almost see her feathers flutter; and one day I happened to drap it into the waste basket and there she laid.' (Ap - plause.)

And the first thing that the storm-tossed mariners saw on their homeward return when they rounded the prom - ontory was the same statue seeming to bid them welcome home again. This statue was the wonderful creation of a master mind, executed by a trained hand. Standing before the picture of the Sis - tine Madonna you admire the symmetry of the central figure. Ton marvel that such a figure should stand there among the clouds. If these lines had been drawn by the hand of a draughtsman this would seem to be unreasonable, but being drawn by the trained hand there is poise and balance. "This picture leads you to look upwards, to higher thoughts and nobler deeds. The central figures seem to stand in space surrouni - ed by a boundless universe; and the eyes of the Madonna look not at you but through you to your manifest destiny — a master produc - tion of a master mind, executed by the trained hand. "Together the master mind and the trained hand have been working out the destiny of the race and will still continue to do so. We need the trained hand as much, if not more so than at any time in the past. "How are we endeavoring to preserve the trained hand? By in - troducing into our schools manual training and domestic science. A r e you represented in this contest? It is necessarv that the hand be trained, because mental acts are of value whci they are worked o'it through the trained hand into deeds and actions.

I know just how you did it. That is putting a premium on dishonesty; but when you make a thing with your hands, you cannot be dishon - est. It stands as the representation of your work to be judged by all who see it. There is no chance for dishonesty. I hope in this work you will get a deeper respect for labor. It is a sad lamentation that so many boys go out from our schools apparently unmindful of the place the laboring man holds in the social fabric. They seem to forget that the man who digs post holes well and in a cheerful spirit, is as well worthy of honor and respect as the lawyer, doctor, preach- er or the teacher. (Applause.)

Take two girls of intellectual training — one goes into the store and measures out calico prints, and the other goes into the kitchen to work. We find the former maintains her position in society and the latter falls to the lower stratum. This is all wrong. It takes more brains to run a kitchen than it does to measure calico and dress goods over the dry goods counter. In domestic science, girls, do you realize that it takes brains to cook? We are going, in a measure, to leave the question of the servant girl to the manual training and domestic science department. I trust you will become in harmony with your environments. What is all this life to be unless it is full of sym - pathy for our fellow man. I hope this feeling will spread, until, in a measure, we are able to realize what the poet has summed up in the little couplet representing the time of universal peace and har - mony when the drum-beat shall be heard no longer, and when the battle flag shall be unfurled in the parliament of man in the federa - tion of the world."

"There are many reasons why this peculiar subject was given to me, but the chief reason is that the gentleman responsible for this glorious occasion wanted to make sure that all the speeches would be brief. They knew that if they asked me to tell what I do not know about farming I would talk all night. I am honest In admit - ting that I know absolutely nothing about farming. I will also admit that I know as much about it as some gentlemen whom I have heard talking learnedly about what they knew of agricultural pur - suits. (Laughter.) To hear some men talk you would think that anybody could run a farm profitably. "I know, however, that it requires a lot of hard work to be a ssful farmer. I know that farming contains a great deal of poetry — in the minds of men who never farmed. I know that It is no longer a makeshift for a precarious livelihood, but it is to-day a profession — a science, if you please. And I know a lot of men who never tried it who are quite sure they could make a howling suc - cess of it. Men who are too lazy to cultivate a two-by-four garden in their back yards declare it to be their ambition to become farm - ers, and they talk about it being the ideal life.

I haven't made good at anything else, and they say that every man is good for something. (Laughter.) Once a farmer was undecided what he would make of his eon. So he locked the boy up in a room with a Bible, a silver dollar and an apple. He said to himself, 'If I find him reading the Bible, I'll make a preacher of him. If I find him eating the apple, I'll make a farmer of him. And If I find him playing with the dollar, I'll make a banker of him.' In a little while the fond father opened the door and found the boy sitting on the Bible eating the apple, with the dollar in his pocket. So the father said he would make a politician of the boy. (Laughter and applause.) "Farmers are growing liberal. Here in town our employers only give us eight hours in which to do a day's work. The farmer is not bo driving in his demands.

And the farmer girl — God bless her — she comes to town and her healthy complexion and her graceful carriage are the envy of her sallow and sickly sisters of the city.

Crabtree. ) "I am just as anxious now to have it known that I was reared on the farm as I was anxious several years ago to leave the farm and go to town. •When I husked corn, fifty bushels was a good day's work. About the time that farmers began to expect 55 or 60 bushels as a day's work, is when I began teaching school. It 4s perfectly natural that I should continue in school work since it is a common practice now, as I understand, to husk 75 or 80 bushels a day. "I am sure I would appreciate the boys of the farm even if I had never been on the farm myself, having had them in my school. "Permit me to tell you about one farmer boy who came to my school. The first day be came into the high school room his feet got into his way and tripped him in front of the school. Owing to the amusement occasioned by this incident I considered it neces - sary to detain him awhile after school. But when he finally started home I saw I had not detained him long enough for some of the boys had waited for him a block or so away. Just as soon as he came to where they were, one, a loud-mouthed fellow rushed toward him showing fight. He walked backwards a little ways, then turned and ran distancing the town boy in the race An instance showing that the farmer boy gets there. (Appt&amp;a "But after running about a block he stopped, evidently thinking he had run far enough. Here is where the town boy made a mis - take. He rushed up as if to strike, meeting with a blow that sent him to his knees. On rising he thought he really would strike a blow this time, but this time he got a blow between the eyes that left its color for several weeks. This time on rising he took his turn leading the chase. Sometimes a town boy can get there at a lively rate. (Applause.) "The country boy was a hero after that. He was not the best in school, but he was above the average, and graduated from the school with credit. The town boy did not finish his course, not even the first year. "I saw the town boy the other day working on the streets here in Lincoln. He was leaning on his spade handle, working exceed - ingly hard on a cigarette. The farmer boy is now a leading educa - tor of the state, a successful county superintendent in eastern Ne - braska. "A few years ago the university sent me out to deliver a few addresses at farmers' institutes. Having been reared on the farm and being an educator I ought to be able to give farmers many advanced ideas as to methods of farming. At least that was the view I took of it. I had hardly begun my engagements until I made the discovery that advancement In farming had actually been going on and going so rapidly that I was not keeping in sight of it. </seg>
            <seg id="p494">467 AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING "It is surprising to learn the number of business and profes - sional men who have been reared on the farm. Practically all of them. "At a recent meeting of the School Master's Club the chairman requested each member who had been reared on the farm to raise his hand. Of the thirty-five present only one failed to raise his hand. The membership of this club is composed of college presidents, pro - fessors and leading principals and superintendents of the state. "This is only one of many instances showing that when the farm - er boy equips himself with an education he is likely to become a leader in a profession or in business. "I am glad to see improved conditions on the farm and glad to see a greater number of the boys remain on the farm. I am glad that the town-going craze — as a craze — is dying out. "Even if the town boy were made of better moral fibre I should say it is for the public good and many times to the advantage of the individual himself for the farmer boy to come to town. "Is it not true that every one advises you to remain on the farm? I am not going to do that. I used to wonder when a boy, and as a matter of fact. I still wonder whether there is any more reason for fastening a boy to the farm for life than there is in forc - ing any other boy to follow the same line of work that his father happens to be doing. The farm is a mighty good place. It is one of the best places in the world. But some boys may find their talent and their desires centering in some other line, and country boys are just as much entitled to a choice of occupations or professions as are the boys reared in the city. "We need and doubtless shall continue to need for all time, farmer boys for leaders in the professions, honest farmer boys to serve as presidents and cashiers of our banks and as managers in all important lines of business, farmer boys to preside over our universities and colleges and we need them to supervise our systems of public schools. In short the country boy, because of his honesty, his high sense of honor and his wonderful strength of character Is in demand for the chief places in every important line, and both for your own good and for the best interests of society, I urge you to equip yourself with an education and to respond worthily to the call that comes to you whether it be to remain on the farm or to take a responsible place in a profession or in business. "Here's health and good will to the farmer boys who are pres - ent and who are sure to get there." (Applause.) The Toastmaster: "The next speaker does know something about farming.

"Whether your life be that of a farmer, mechanic, writer, school teacher or preacher, it does not matter — the main thing in life Is to beep your mind right at all times. "I ran across a fellow the other day, a gambler who thought • he world was all wrong, who made me think of a true story.

The other boys in the saloon rubbed somo limburger ill over his mous - tache. Finally the fellow kind of roused up out of his stupor and says 'Bar-keeper, is not this terrible?' He didn't know what it was. Then he fell into another slumber and then roused up again and says 'Bar-keeper, is not this terrible?' Bar-keeper paid no atten - tion. Finally the man saw the door and made a bee-line for it out of the room. He rushed out into the night and came back again with tears streaming down his faoe. He said, 'Bar-keeper, is not this terrible? Bar-keeper said. 'What is terrible?' and he replied 'The wholo world smells bad.' (Laughter.) "My first day in Nebraska was the first conception I ever had of what it meant to be in a corn belt state. I came from Minnesota, where they don't raise corn. The first night I stopped in Nebras - ka was out in a lonesome part of the country with a couple of homesteaders. I asked them if they were not lonesome way out there away from anybody. And one said 'Lonesome?' No. In the daytime we have plenty of work, and in the night-time we sit and listen to the corn grow.' I will close my remarks this evening by reading you the poem, 'Hearing the Corn Grow.' "You may talk of the balm laden breezes of Spain, Of the Mediterranean's foam, Of the verdure that grows on the banks of the Seine, Of the grandeur and glory of Rome; Of the beauty adorning the Alps beyond Where Napoleon's army once bled, Of the happiness felt after crossing the "pond" In the land of Illustrious dead.

            <seg id="p497">470 ;t's report lived on earth and mingled with human beings. This boy studied in the Tecumseh high school, then entered the University of Ne - braska, giving special attention to the humanities. At the end of two years' study in the university, he took up electrical engineering. His genius, integrity, and industry won for him the approval of his professors and he was made an assistant in the electrical engin - eering school. Soon after graduation he was called to Pittsburg by the Westinghouse Company. A little later he was called to Boston by the same company and in 1893 had charge of the electri - cal exhibit for the Westinghouse Company at the World's Fair, Chi - cago; a little later he was called to South America to superintend the establishment of the Westinghouse interests there, on a salary of t~,500 per year. Ho returned to Nebraska to wed as his life companion a Nebraska girl — a Lincoln girl. Soon he was called to London by the English-American Syndicate to battle with the intel - lectual giants of Europe, at a salary of $10,(100 per year. He was Nebraska born, reared in our Nebraska public schools and a grad - uate of the University of Nebraska. I think we ought to join in the university yell in honor of that Nebraska boy — James McCrosky — who has climbed to the top round of the ladder of success. (Here the yell was given, led by Mr. Irving S. Cutter. Dr. Condra led in the university yell a second time). "Now, just a word about a Nebraska girl. I remember when ited the country school where she attended, three miles south of Tecumseh,' out there on the little old hill among the scrub oaks, where stood the schoolhouse. One evening we went out there for the eighth grade graduating exercises. She was one of the three girls who finished the eighth grade course in that school. She hesi - tated about taking part in the exercises because her parents were poor and could not afford to buy a costly graduation dress, but she took part on tho program and earned the common school diploma; then she studied a while in the Tecumseh schools, took the exami - nation, receiving a third grade certificate, taught a country school or two, attended the Normal school, was hired in the grades at Te - cumseh, attended Normal school again, then was hired in the grades at Hastings; attended school again during her summer vacations. Later she was engaged in the Lincoln public schools, teaching in one of the outer districts here where the Russian children attend. During the past three summers she has conducted the model school In the Alliance, Holdrege, and McCook Junior Normal schools. About two years ago she was promoted to the McKlnley school, Lin - coln, as one of the primary teachers and during the past year her schoolroom has probably been visited by a greater number of teach - er* seeking observation of model school work than any other school - room in Nebraska. She is one of the ablest primary instructors in county institutes in the central west. President Crabtree, of the State Normal School at Peru, visited her school early this fall and tendered her a position in the faculty of the model school at Peru. </seg>

"Therefore, boys and girls of Nebraska, I appeal to you to make a careful study of your talents in order that you may make the most and best of yourselves, in whatever field of human endeavor you may decide to work. Probably the chiefest of the causes of failure among men and women is a mistaken calling. Dean Swift emphasized this so well when he said: "Brutes find out where their talents lie; A bear will not attempt to fly; A foundered horse will oft debate Before he tries a five-barred gate. A dog by instinct turns aside; Who sees the ditch too deep and wide; But man we find the only creature Who led by folly combats nature; Who when sha loudly cries forbear With obstinacy fixes there; And where his genius least inclines, Absurdly bends his whole designs." "I may address some who have poverty's pinches to cope with. You may be poor. What of that? The greatest men and women of all time were once the children of poverty. So join me in the In - spiring song of old Robert Burns, himself a son of toil: "Though losses and crosses Be lessons right severe, There's wit there, you'll get there; You'll find no itherwhere." "And again, when he shouts: Never you mind the crowd, lad Nor fancy life won't tell, The work's a work for a' that To him that doth it well.

"From all that I can learn of the magnificent resources of your state, its progressive people, and of its great Institutions and indus - tries, I am of the opinion that Nebraska people could very appro - priately have inscribed upon their state coat of arms, 'We are here to stay.' I am convinced that Nebraska is a good state in which tc live and work and gratify that other inborn desire of every true American, political renown. "To an Eastern man you seem to be in the far West, and yet i in pared with years ago you are no longer remote. Governor Curtis, the war governor of Pennsylvania, once in a speech before mpany that met to celebrate the completion of a small rail - load in his native county related an incident that occurred in his boyhood days, illustrating the progress of the country since that time. The story was that of a citizen of that county, living in the Bald Eagle valley who had sold his home, and had concluded to go When the time came that the family wwn to start a large number of his neighbors and friends came from th« sur - rounding region to bid them good bye. They were all very much affected. Women were wiping their eyes, and the men were more than usually sober and subdued. They felt that they would never ■heir friends again. Just as they were to start one of the neighbors inquired where they were going. One of the women of the family in the midst of her sobs and tears managed to say, 'Why, way out to Steubenville.' In those days the Ohio river was west. "The geography that I studied as a boy had over the history of e;M a vignette containing a picture illustrative of the char - of that particular state. For instance, if the state was Geor - gia there would be a picture of some negroes picking cotton. If Maine, a picture of a lumbering camp and a yoke of oxen hauling logs, and so with other states. My recollection of Nebraska is that it was designated by a picture of a naked Indian on horseback with a bow and arrow chasing a buffalo. "That was the condition out here not many years ago, and now to come out and see all of this wonderful region settled by a most intelligent and progressive people, equipped with all of the appliances that go to make up a great civilization, is certainly most surprising. There has not been in any other age that history records anything that equals the development of this land that less than a century ago was inhabited by savage tribes, and stocked with herds of buffalo, that roamed over this great expanse at will.

"Every speech made by Nebraska men since this meeting be - gan has been of high order, advising your young people to aim high in life, to live for noble ends. There has not been a single thing done or said that has not tended toward the elevation of men and women and children, that has not directed them to higher plane* of life. "It has been a great satisfaction to me to be in an atmosphere so pervaded by righteous sentiment and civic spirit as that which has surrounded us during this most wonderful meeting. "But Mr. Toastmaster, I am expected to speak on the subject, "As Nebraska Seems to Me.' Three things about Nebraska have impressed me more than any other that I have seen. One occurred two years ago when I came out here upon the invitation of the di - r of your experiment station, Professor Burnett, to meet with, and address the Agricultural Students' association of your state. I supposed that I was to meet a dozen or at most twenty of your young people connected with the agricultural department of your university in the college parlor, or in some small recitation room for a brief conference upon agricultural study, and the life which tt represents. It was dark when I was taken out to the state farm, as you call it here, and ushered into the stock judging pavilion that had just been erected, and which was opened for use that night for the first. Imagine my surprise when I entered to see the build - ing filled with 4 00 of Nebraska's college men, — 200 connected with the agricultural department of your university and 200 coming down from the farms of your state, graduates who had gone from this institution home to their farms and were back now to attend that meeting. I was never more astonished in my life. I had never seen such a gathering of young men interested in agriculture in any other state, and I have visited most of the agricultural colleges and experimental stations of this country. The little speech that I had prepared for the club I had expected to meet was simply nowhere. "The feature that impressed me was this: That Nebraska is giving higher education to her young men that they may not go off into some of the so-called learned professions outside of agri - culture, but that they may go back to the land and go to work to develop that great fundamental industry upon which all others rest —Agriculture. "That meeting was a demonstration of the fact that such an education can be given, and is given in Nebraska. That is the kind </seg>
            <seg id="p502">AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION AND INDUSTRIAL TRA 475 of higher education needed in every state of this union. Most of tho education called higher leada men away from agriculture. Nebraska has shown that the young men that they educate can and do go back to the farms and not only gain a livelihood in this call - ing, but have as comfortable and hospitable homes as exist anywhere in the world. "Another of the things to which I have referred that impressed me was a scene that I witnessed at the St. Louis Exposition. While there 1 was invited by the gentleman in charge of the Nebraska exhibit to go over and see what Nebraska could produce. He took me into a beautiful and commodious room fitted up after the fashion of p. theater, and after seeing me in &lt;», comfortable chair star machine called a kinetoscope, and then rolled off Nebraska with all of her great plains covered with her wonderful crops of corn and alfalfa and all of the other agricultural products that grow so lux - uriantly upon your soil. Thero I saw Nebraska in all of her glory. the agriculture of one of the greatest states in the union, and I was impressed with this fact that for fertility of soil and magni - ficence of production thene was no state in the union that surpassed her. That was number two. •The other thing that has impressed me has been this great meeting just closing. By the way, Mr. Toastmaster, it is now near midnight and these young people ought to be in bed. We have been extending this banquet until some here have come to think, no doubt, with the soldier who went with Sherman in his march to the sea. During that march they had to go through a great many streams, and when they got down toward the Atlai they frequently had flat stretches of cypress woods covered with water from one's shoetop to waist deep. One day when they had been marching a good while, each with his accoutrements held above his head to keep the ammunition from getting wet, and there was no sight of either shore one soldier called to a comrade, 'I say. Bill, 'pears to me that old Pop Sherman has struck this here river endways.' Some of you, no doubt, have been thinking that we have struck this banquet endways, but I assure you that the shore Is now in sight. "You ask me what I think of Nebraska. If my impressions of your state had been limited to the observations of the last two days, I would say that Nebraska is made up principally of the most magnificent children, such as cannot be surpassed anywhere in America, and that is saying a good deal, for America has the finest body of youth In the world. "This meeting signifies much to me in the development of your agriculture, partly from what we see here as an accomplished fact, and partly from what we do not see as yet, but which nevertheless will be realized in the years to come. "That your future is assured I confidently believe. I believe it because you have begun your agricultural improvement where </seg>
            <seg id="p503">476 state must finally begin it, if what we desire to be real - ised. You are beginning it in your public schools. This meet - ing is prophetic of future progress because it has been brought to - jrether by your superintendent, of public Instruction. You have come to this, that your department of public Instruction is about to take the children who are scattered all over your great plains In hand and educate them in agriculture at their homes. This great de - partment is taking hold of the farm life which you represent, and is going to lift it out of the drudgery and loneliness that has attend - ed it in the past into the most delightful occupation that exists. From what I have been able to gather, you have all of the machinery in this department necessary to unlock the wealth of your lands to use by all future generations, and all that is needed is simply to put it in motion. All that is needed is to set it at work and keep It at work, doinp that for which it has been so carefully and ad - mirably designed. If this is done, you will very soon have agri - cultural education in public school in Nebraska, and your college and university will be overflowing with young men and women who are anxious to secure an education which will fit them for the pursuit of this great industry. "In many states they are talking about corn, about cattle, about alfalfa, about wheat. Most of our time, and much of our money has been expended in improving these products. Nebraska has departed from the beaten track. She has taken hold of her and girls and has undertaken to so educate them that they shall not only produce corn and wheat and alfalfa in perfection, but at the same time insure to the commonwealth the perpetuity of country life, and the best citizenship of any state in the union." (Ap - piaii^ PURPOSE OF AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL 0R - \IZATIO\S In all this work, whether it be agriculture, domestic science or manual training, the aim is to induce the boy or girl to try to do something, to by individual effort acquire the skill, gain the knowledge and feel the inspiration that comes from earnestly directed effort toward some definite end. The result is already being felt in the increased number of boys and girls who are looking forward toward better preparation in lines of industrial activity which ap - peal to them and in the impetus given to a general desire for a bet - ter and fuller knowledge and skill In connection with the envlron - &lt;&gt;f the home. The object of the state organizations: — "The Nebraska Boys' Agricultural association," and "The Nebraska Girls' Domestic re association." is set forth in the constitution adopted at the first meeting Dec. 15, 19 </seg>
            <seg id="p504">AURICULTURA1 1NH INDUSTRIAL TRAINING 477 To organize the school boys and school girls of the state for definite work along lines which will bring the home and the ■ 1 into closer relation; to i &gt;ple for the fuller joyment of their environment; to dignify, bj of its conditions and possibilities, the farm life of the twentieth century; to educate the youth of country, town and city to a knowledge of their de - pendence upon nature's resources, and to the value of the f [ development of hand, head and heart; to stimulate activity that will industrial training its due emphasis in our educational system; to give to the state the services of her ambitious boys and girls In :,tudy and experiment in fields that will bring a better and a greater lopment of the t mon wealth." The plan of the work of th&lt; iations as outlined in the ning. contemplated a state organization that would exist prin - cipally for the purpose of encouraging the work in county and school district organizations. The following quotations from the state con - stitution of both agricultural and domestic associations. farther express the plan in mind. "The state organization, while anticipating good results from the work of the individual state membership and the state meetings, expects the greater good from its office as an encourage &lt;1 as - sistance to county organizations." "The county organization, reaching directly into every school district, from its local position can organize more factors and can secure a greater personal interest in its work; it occupies a field more potent, and with more possible results than does the distant and more, restricted stata organization." The state constitution also expresses the relation of the school district organization to th&gt; id county organization, as follows: "In such measure as the state organization exists largely for the encouragement and assistance it may be t" mty organiza - tion, so is the relation of the county organizat; he school dis - trict organization. Thie county organization re rhool district in the county, the school district organization reaches to every home in the district. Local conditions should regulate the scope and nature of work in each district." The plan for the work of the state associations contemplated an annual yearly meeting and program, but on account of the great amount of work and the expense of conducting a state contest, It was expected that only the one state contest would be held. The one state contest being considered sufficient to give necessary impetus to the county work. However, In the business meeting at the state meeting, 1905, when it was announced that plans the next year In - cluded holding a state meeting with a program but omitting the contest feature, the members unanimously demanded a second state contest. Arrangements were accordingly perfected for holding the 1906 Corn Contest and Convention. The continued activity of the organization of the county and the school district clubs has justified the existence of </seg>
            <seg id="p505">478 the state organization as a factor in unifying and encouraging the work in the county and school district. 1006 &lt; urn Contest and Convention The plans of the state organizations are expressed by the intro - ductory letter of the state manager in the official publication of the two state organizations, which was this year sent out to the state and county members: Our organizations had their beginning in the spring of 1905, with an ip of five hundred Nebraska boys who entered the corn growing At the first state meeting, December 14-16, 1905, we added "corn cooking" and initiated an equal number of girls. This year our work includes corn, wheat, potato and sugar - beet growing; corn cooking, and other branches of cooking; hand sewing, and manual training, with work in county clubs in other lines of Agriculture. Domestic Science, and Manual Training. e our organizations had their beginning in the production and use of corn, and since corn is Nebraska's greatest and favorite crop, at the meeting of the executive committees held at York, July 27 and 28, when the question of the title of our 1906 "guide book" was presented, it was unanimously agreed that It should be named "The Nebraska Corn Book." In this booklet we have given liberal space to the discussion of corn, and have treated briefly other subjects of interest to our mem - bers. We hope that brief mention here will lead to Investigation and study, and to profitable experimental work on the part of our membership. The object of our organization is to provide suggestion and direction rather than Instruction. The boy who carefully cultivates and studies the growth of a patch of corn, sugar beets, potatoes, wheat, or other plants, will gain a new interest and a better appre - ciation of the value of careful thought applied in the study and the adaptation of seed selection, soil fertility, and the intelligent culture of plants. Further, he will become interested in the best methods of marketing, and of the use of these plants as food for man and animal. This will direct him to study, to discussion, and to inves - tigation, leading to a knowledge of systematic feeding and caring for live stock, to a study of animal adaptation and needs, and to a care - ful consideration of the financial problems involved. This is edu - cation. The girl who learns by actual experience to successfully culti - vate one flower, one vegetable, or any plant in which she becomes Interested; who learns to bake a loaf of bread, to prepare an edible dish for the table, to can a jar of fruit, to make an apron for the use of herself or a member of the family, to neatly darn or patch a garment; — if she seeks to know and to perform these simple yet important duties the best wl ines with her work, </seg>

"Earth's noblest thing, — A woman perfected." — Lowell. "To reason firm, The temperate will, Endurance, foresight, strength and skill A perfect woman, nobly planned. To warn, to comfort, and command." — Wordsworth. "A woman should be good for everything at home." — Euripides. We expect each of our members to learn to do something worth doing, — "something the world wants done," to learn to do It well; to acquire skill with the hands, to combine brain and muscle; to answer so far as possible his own questions, by experiment and by study; each thus to become his own teacher, and to lead himself into an education that will bring the fullest development of the triunity. — the hand, the head, the heart. 1'nder the head of "Domestic Science" direction as follows is given to the members of the Domestic Science association : "The purpose of the organization of the Nebraska Girls' Do - mestic Science association is to help the individual to become health - ier, happier, and to do her part toward contributing to the making of a happy home; to help every girl to become a greater power for good in the intellectual and moral life of the community in which she lives. House keeping is one of the essentials of home making. To be good home maker should be the ambition of every girl. Nor ii- tidour. Wide hall or lordly dome; The good, the true, the tender, These form the wealth of home. — Hale. The girl who learns the value of wholesome food, and how to prepare it; who appreciates the results of the application of the skilled hand in the making and care of wearing apparel; whose taste has been cultivated to the love of beauty in home adornment; whose heart has been touched and whose mind has been broadened by observation of the laws of nature in the culture of flowers and other plant life; whose mind has been cultivated, whose tastes and talents have been developed; she who has had this training, is pre - pared to undertake the responsibilities of home making. </seg>
            <seg id="p507">480 Our aim is toward Individual development: Each girl is to ne her own teacher in acquiring the skill and in appropriating the genuine enjoyment of successful effort. While we offer a few suggestions, we urge our members to original thought and action in experiment in cooking, needle-work, and the various branches of do - mestic science and art. To those who have almost reached womanhood's sphere and find themselves unskilled in domestic art and science, yet who ap - preciate the value of this attainment, also what it means to con - tinue through life thus unskilled and unfamiliar with the many little it contribute toward making the home of happiness and contentment, we quote Shakespeare: "An unlessoned girl Unskilled, unpracticed. Happy in this, she is not yet so old she may learn." And as a kindly warning to those who ar- nig then, with the supposition that personal beauty or ethical culture alone will always satisfy, we repeat the words of Cobbert: men, so amiable in themselves, are never so amiable as when they are useful ;and as for beauty, though men may fall in love with girlB at play, there is nothing to make them stand to their love like seeing them work." Many a girl who has been educated through the hig through tl returns to her home, wel it is true, an&lt;: for her accomplishments, yet. hwim must fail, from lack of earlier training, to contribute her share In some of the simplest duties of the home, she is nevertheless a dis - appointment to the loved ones there. Not always, — but seldom, — is this disappointment expressed, or even its source fully realized, yet it is there. Certain it is that the possession of the skilled hand in domestic science and art, in addition to scholastic training, is a very much desired and much appreciated talent." "The object of our state contest is to stimulate girls to try. Our schools of Domestic Science have demonstrated the fallacy of the expression "cooks are born not made." Almost without excep - tion girls in domestic science classes in our schools and girls at home, if they follow carefully and explicitly the directions given, are successful in their work. Many times the fault is in the recipe. Recipes are too often written for practiced cooks who know how to "fill in" the omission of detail. When in doubt as to procedure ask some one who knows, or carefully decide on what seems a rea - sonable method of procedure, then experiment until you know. The recipes given herein have been thoroughly tested. Yon may have better or may secure better recipes. After trying these </seg>

You cannot fail if you proceed ini.llii;. in l&gt; . — and persevere. Suc - cess Is worth mure than it costs." The 19H6 state meeting is to be four days in length. It in - udes, in addition to the regular contest features, evening and entertainments, in general day sessions, and section meetings for instruction in special line of agriculture and omestic science. Mr. Alfred Montgomery, of Illinois, "The Farm - r Painter," is to be present during the entire meeting. The Na - onal Department of Agriculture will send Mr. Dick J. Crosby, the overnment specialist in agricultural education. The Peru State Normal Male Quartet, the University of Nebraska Military Band and the niversity of Nebraska Mandolin and Glee Club are engaged for the meeting. Members of the faculty of the I'niversity of Nebraska School of Agriculture and other prominent educators will address te general sessions and instruct in the section meetings. </seg>

A landlady rooming women students is expected to provide for their use till half after ten on Friday, Saturday and Sunday evenings, or on two of these evenings, a reception room prop - erly warmed and lighted. Women students in these houses are ex - pected to receive gentlemen callers only on the evenings named and only In the reception room. For several years frequent and severe criticisms have been made upon the doings of certain fraternities and sororities connected with the university. The better and probably blameless chapters are often censured with the rest. Some carry these strictures so far as to de - nounce the entire system of Greek letter organizations, which may be said to be at present, so far as public opinion in our state is con - cerned, on the defensive. The most prominent complaints are early "rushing'' and initiation, needless expenses, idling, dissipation, at - taching disproportionate importance to the social element in educa - tion as compared with faithful study, and worst of all an undemo - cratic spirit of clique and exclusiveness. The regents have considered this situation, and brought it to the attention of the organizations concerned. The fraternities have al - ready responded in a proper spirit by creating an Inter-Fraternity Council for the rectification of abuses and the promotion of healthy fraternity life. The council is empowered not only to discuss fraternity affairs, but to correct, to discipline and, in extreme cases, to impose penalties. The fraternities through the above described council have unani - mously adopted the following rules governing pledging and initiating: "No fraternity shall pledge or initiate any new or prospective student until after the mid-semester reports are received in the regis - trar's office (on the Saturday preceding Thanksgiving day), and not even then shall any new student be pledged or initiated whose name appears on the delinquency list." Rules governing "rushing" have also been enacted Rule 1. — No new student shall be invited to or entertained at any social function whatsoever, except as mentioned below, given within or without the fraternity house, by any fraternity. Nor shall a new student be invited to or entertained at any social function given in behalf of any fraternity by an individual or other organization. The single exception to this rule shall be that new Btudents may be in - vited to "smokers' given at fraternity houses on Friday or Saturday evenings. It being understood that the refreshments on these occa - sions shall be of a simple and inexpensive kind. Rule 2. — No new student shall be furnished or given a meal by any member of a fraternity, either within or without the chapter house. Rule 3. — No new student shall remain in any chapter house later than 6 p. m. on Mondays, Tuesdays. Wednesdays, and Thursdays, nor later than 12 p. m. on the other three days of the week. </seg>
            <seg id="p514">487 THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA Rule 4. — It shall be agreed and understood that each fraternity wishes to stand on its own merits with the new students, and will request all sororities and other friends outside the fraternities not to discuss in any way with the new students the subject of fraternities and their respective merits. Rule 5. — No new student shall be met at the train by any fra - ternity man (with the single exception of one brother meeting an - other brother) nor shall the baggage of a new student be sent to or kept at any fraternity house until after he shall have been pledged. Rule 6. — These rules shall be binding upon all fraternity men, alumni as well as active. The Inter-Sorority Council was organized May 12, 1906. It has at various meetings thoroughly considered the subjects of rushing, en - tertaining and studentship, and adopted a few rules for the better - ment of conditions among sororities. The council feels that a good beginning has been made and the way opened for fuller Improvements. The regents deem it fitting to inform patrons of the university that membership in fraternities or sororities is in no sense necessary tor any students, the entire benefit and advantage of a university course being obtainable without it. The open literary societies, the Palladian and the Union, are still, as heretofore, invaluable organizations, offering wholesome so - cial and mental opportunities to all students. Though no organic part of the university, they have always been cherished by it and given valuable quarters in its halls rent-free. This policy will continue. Their influence is not in the direction of dissipation, extravagant liv - ing or frivolous conduct. They foster the virtues of attention to busi - i.ess, loyalty to the university, high character, respect for parents and teachers, living within one's means, paying one's debts, and the i.voidance of conduct that would discredit students themselves or pain their friends. Members of these societies strongly cherish the ties binding them io their alma mater. Several thousand people have belonged to them, among these some of the most influential and deserving men and women ever connected with the university. They have stood for the best interests of the institution, responded loyally to her call, and helped in maintaining elevated standards of conduct and scolar - phip among her students. The university esteems this sort of influ - ence as beyond price. Students may master the entire curriculum, but if they graduate with wrong social ideas or with habits such as some student organizations are calculated to form, they have missed the high calling which the university holds before them. The evils connected with athletic sports, more especially with the playing of football, have occasioned no little solicitude. It would seem undesirable to inhibit this game so long as students delight in it and it has the approval of a large number of considerate university men, unless its harmful tendencies increase or at any rate fail to sub- </seg>

            <seg id="p517">490 Nearly all the Instruction given in the university has been zealous, learned, vivacious and in accordance with modern and approved meth - ods. A commendable amount of original Investigation has been car - ried on. The faculty contains men whose standing in their specialties war - rants the university in relieving them as much as possible of drudgery and routine. To one of our professors specimens are sent for de - termination from all parts of the world. He is at this moment read - ing the proofs of a report covering his studies to be printed in the "Biologia Central! Americana" now publishing In London. Another professor is repeatedly called by the United States Fish Commission to investigate problems touching the food and propagation of fishes. Another, successfully investigating the fossils characteristic of this region, has added greatly to the sum of knowledge in regard to an - cient life. Still another's investigations into recondite historical mat - ters have brought honor to him and to the university. These are scholars whom the oldest universities would be proud to place In their faculties, where they would be given amplest facilities for study, in - vestigation and publication. It should be possible for us to make similar provision. No man who has attainted such distinction in his field should be allowed to give his time, which is of inestimable value - to the world, to anything but his proper work. The growth of the university, the increase in its teaching staff, and the shifting of departments between buildings and quarters, tho inevitable and in the main not harmful, have produced one unfortunate result, the almost complete disuse of the faculty meeting save for recommending degrees. Opportunities for the exchange of views on matters of importance to the university are infrequent. While the administrative advance is straightforward and positive, the educational development is intermittent and unsymmetrlcal. The faculty lacks coherence. To many a professor, his own department looms larger than the university itself. The best corrective for this would be contact of each man with men in other departments. A faculty man must be encouraged to give thought to university problems and in - terests. A revival of the faculty meeting as a regular occurrence might help conduce to this. Replacing of the senate by a "university faculty 1 ' has also been suggested, meetings to occur fortnightly or monthly, of r length permitting a fair exchange of views yet not encouraging triv - ial discussion. Such a university faculty should include all people of professorial rank. Junior professors need the experience to be gained by such meetings, while every faculty needs the aid of Its younger members to save it from conservatism and help bear the bur - dens too often carried solely by deans and heads of departments. Many new courses of instruction have recently been added, also a good deal of apparatus. Considerable of this was manufactured by students under the direction of instructors, a great saving, as sup - plies of such a nature are very costly. </seg>
            <seg id="p518">THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA 491 We are of the opinion that our teaching force is at this moment more efficient than ever before, in spite of the unfortunate fact that we are still losing good men to other institutions able and willing to pay larger salaries. The permission of this drainage is not credi - table to our State, and we anxiously appeal for the resources that shall enable us to stop it. Lincoln is a healthy and beautiful city, rich in social culture, churches, and schools, all which make it an inviting home for pro - fessorial families. Nebraska boasts a population, a history and a cli - mate which disincline people once acquainted with the state ever to leave it. The university itself has a proud record, a goodly and glow - ing esprit du corps and a fame secure and rising not only in this coun - try but abroad. We insist upon the utmost liberty of thought and utterance for every professor. Nothing but insufficient money prevents our retaining permanently our teachers against bids from without. Such a source of power along with our other advantages would render the university of Nebraska one of the very foremost teaching bodies in the United States. In view of these considerations, and of the continuing rise in the cost of living we earnestly call upon the State for such a salary fund as shall enable us to establish a somewhat higher maximum limit of salaries in all important professorial posi - tions. The college of medicine, notwithstanding its cramped laborato - ries and lecture halls, and the competition of schools with shorter courses and less thoro examinations, makes steady progress. Some of its graduates already enjoy large practice. Its methods thruout are up-to-date and punctiliously severe. Other centers of medical educa - tion insist upon higher beginning requirements but we cannot learn that, allowing for this admittedly considerable advantage, any insti - tutions excel ours in the work we attempt. Larger faculties are to be found but none abler, better trained, more consecrated or more efficient. As intending physicians need no longer leave our state to secure ample and rich preparation for their life calling, so intending law - yers need not. Our college of law has soundly established its three year course, all parts of which are taught with vigor and success. Its methods are the best and are skilfully applied, with the happy result that able and diligent students not only soon after graduation become good practicing lawyers but competent judicial thinkers, suitable for legislators and for political leadership. An accomplished professor of public law has been added to the faculty, whose courses of instruc - tion, resuming the subjects formerly discussed by Professor Cook, will not only enrich this college but reach many students in the other col - leges. Similar good and broad effects must attend the work of the new department of political science and sociology and that of the new professorship of commerce.

Extending our view from the individual to the nation our uni - versities must offer the fullest and best bu- location possible if our country is to maintain her present industrial and commercial position and extend her influence in the world's markets in fai the kieen international competition prevalent to-day. Other leading countries are training their business men in - f the A great many American colleges and universities now offer com - mercial instruction, among them the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Chicago, Dartmouth College, New York University, the State Universities of Wisconsin, Michigan. Illinois, California. Iowa and Kansas. Economic geography, American industries extractive, man - ufacturing and distributive, American commerce, European conm history of commerce, modern business methods, technique of foi trade, commerce of the Pacific, commerce of Latin America, consular service, accounting, insurance, banking, and business ethics are among the subjects taught. Our university cannot afford to refrain longer from offering this kind of business instruction. In most bran I in - structors are inferior to none. In economics ;&lt; our staff has ably covered the theoretical, historical and critical fields; now, as we have practical courses in agriculture, we must have one or more up ' industry, commerce, business methods and related subjects. The objection might be raised that Nebraska is essentially an Agricultural state. The university is doing and will continue to do all that in it lies to promote the farming interests of the state and country, to elevate the farmer's calling in honor and in profitableness and to make all students respect and love it. If we fail to provide fit educational chances for our ingenuous youth part of them will remain ignorant but most will go to school elsewhere and be largely lost to the state; whereas if we school them nobly such and so many as we need will stay, adding to the state's wealth and culture, while the residue will be advancing the state's fame and the nation's welfare in other parts of our land and the world. </seg>
            <seg id="p521">494 There is not a single prospective farmer in our university who would not be benefited by many of the courses we are installing, while we have many other industries besides farming, all of which need carefully trained business men and leaders. Our future bank - ers, journalists, underwriters, wholesale and retail merchants and industrial managers will to a great extent come from the ranks of the students we are educating to-day, not a few from farmer families, moreover, many of our ambitious and capable youth, in what - soever families they are reared, will properly look forward to busi - ness careers outside our own state; responsible positions in our ex - panding foreign trade, our great national industries, our railroad ofllces, our consular and our diplomatic service. The demand for such courses is strong and undoubtedly growing. The students from our secondary schools, who in increasing numbers are looking for - ward to business careers, are bound to be attracted by the univer - sities ottering the most beneficial courses. Our university must fur - nish this kind of instruction or let neighboring institutions do it. Clearly, therefore, one of our duties and opportunities lies in supplying this demand, and we earnestly hope that the legislature will co-operate with us in the efforts we are making to the desired end. During the present biennium we have completed and occupied agricultural hall at the farm. This beautiful edifice cost $60,000. Not far from $10,000 was expended for heating, plumbing and furniture in it. All the money items here and in the paragraphs immediately fol - lowing are approximate, the exact figures being given in the fiscal part of this report. A sanitary sewer about 11,000 feet long has been built from Salt creek, connecting with all the permanent buildings of the farm plant. Connection with the city water system has also been made by laying about 4,500 feet of six-inch water pipe. Five fire hydrants have been placed at different points on the grounds. The cost of the sewer and water system and of introducing city gas was $16 Some ll.ooo square feet of cement sidewalk was constructed last year, at a cost of $1,300. A new chemical laboratory was equipped in the experiment station building. We are now equipping a new soil laboratory. Additional equipment has been placed in the chemical laboratory. The total cost of these improvements will be $2,800. The chemical laboratory added $1,000, the soils laboratory $1,600, and the agricultural botany laboratory $1,200, to their respective equipments from the Adams-Hatch fund for the year ending last June 30, 1906. Changes have been made in the dairy building, extending the milk-testing laboratory and laying a cement floor in the churning </seg>

Additions were made to the beef cattle barn, attaching two sheds and a silo, doubling the capacity of the barn, all at a cost of $2,400. Some $600 have been expended in farm fencing. The burning of the boiler house last February necessitated re - building. This was done in a temporary way, at a cost of $^ making it serviceable till a permanent plant can be erected. The woman's building, for which an appropriation of $32,000 was made, is in process of construction. The farm library was moved and new bookstacks and tables supplied, costing $800. A new swine barn is now going up, which will cost $2,500. To the equipment of the farm mechanics department ten new forges and the entire outfit of the carpenter shop have been added, which, with floors in the forge and the carpenter shop, cost $2,400. The department of agricultural botany has been established, in charge of Professor F. D. Heald. Upon the promotion of Samuel Avery to the head professorship of chemistry, Mr. R. H. Shaw was made associate chemist of the experiment station. Since Mr. Shaw's resignation Mr. F. J. Alway has been elected professor of agricultural chemistry and chemist of the experiment station. Professor H. R. Smith has been placed in full charge of the animal husbandry de - partment. Superintendent W. P. Snyder has severed his connection with the farmers' institute work and is giving his entire time to the experiment sub-station work at North Platte. Mr. Val Keyser has been appointed assistant superintendent of farmers institutes. Following Professor Lyon's resignation, the department of agron - omy was divided, as has long been regarded desirable, into a depart - ment of soils and a department of field crops. Mr. Alvin Keyser was made adjunct professor of soils and Mr. E. G. Montgomery adjunct professor of field crops. Mr. F. G. Miller, professor of forestry, has been taken on to the experiment station staff. Mr. Frank Wolf, foreman in Held crops, has been appointed special agent of the United States Department of Agriculture in wheat breeding experiments, his salary being paid by that department. Mr. W. W. Burr has been appointed special agent of the United States Department of Agriculture, his salary being paid by that department, and is assisting superintendent W. P. Snyder at the North Platte station. The department of farm mechanics, par - tially established the previous biennium, has been developed during this. The enrollment of students in the school of agriculture has greatly increased. During no year of the last five has the number failed to exceed that of the previous year by at least 25 per cent.

We should be pleased to use more labor thereupon. The attractiveness of the estate could thus l&gt;e much enhanced.

The live stiK-k is in good condition. No t consequence have occurred. The creatures have been continually healthy for a short time in the fall of 1905, when an attack of hog cholera caused us some loss. New specimens should be added to the beef and dairy herds to place them in the best shape for instructional purposes, and we intend to make such additions either this winter or early next biennium.

Portions of the farm had been very badly used before coming under our control, and much labor was necessary to bring the land Into a condition where experimental work was possible. One hundred and fifteen acres has been laid off in five and ten- acre fields and subdivided into plats. Eighteen acres is used in co - operation with the United States Department of Agriculture, ten acres of this being devoted to systematic work in crop rotation and methods of tillage to conserve moisture. One hundred acres is under alfalfa, 25 acres of this being on the high divide where conditions are extreme and where the su of alfalfa may indicate that it can be grown upon thousands of acres of Nebraska land now of low value and considered useful only for grazing. Forty acres have been seeded to g; various sorts, mainly brome, meadow fescue, and orchard grass, to determine the adapt - ability of these grasses to the region. Contrary to the traditions of the country little difficulty h;&gt; ienced in getting a stand of grass, summer tillage having been used to prepare the land. Sorghum and Kafir corn have given abundant yields as forage crops. About 280 a&lt; under regular crops. The balance, about 1,640 acres, is in native pasture or devoted tn buildings and yap The personalty inventory at present is approximately as follows: Considerable farm machinery is not included here.

Since the beginning of the biennium, about $2,500 worth of pork has been sold from the farm. The school of domestic science in our university was organized in 1898.

Two classes of women will be benefited by these courses, those who are studying for the sake of general information and culture and desire to make their lives helpful and efficient in the home, and those who, likewise desiring information and culture, expect to use their training as a means of maintenance for themselves or for others. The thought is to raise the standard of home life among our people, to help individuals become healthier and happier and a great - er power for intellectual and moral good in the community.

By requiring double laboratory time first year men get in full work, but second year men can complete but two-thirds of their required laboratory exercises. The double time plan with us causes just complaint from other departments. To relieve this condition a considerable sum is necessary, but not more than other institutions with smaller classes have spent. Figuring the net cost of the cheapest serviceable apparatus to be had as planned and priced under the direction of the late Professor Brace, and adding an estimate, by the superintendent of construc - tion, of the cost of completing unfinished details of the building and putting in necessary furniture, we reach the sum of $19,7(11 as really and vitally needed to enable the department of physics to meet the demands upon it. It is desirable that the engineering departments be erected into a sub-college of engineering. The precedents for such an organiza - tion exist in practically every American university. Following are the figures of the freshmen registration in the several colleges and the engineering departments for the current rear, as of date October 8: </seg>

We hu\- nodations in shops and draughting rooms for only about 8(1 per cent of this year's freshmen. By making substi - tutions, difficult and more or less harmful, the surplus ha: - commodated in a way, but their fixed order of work, practically all prescribed, is interfered with, and it becomes difficult to complete the courses without serious interference in the program of classes of later years. The conditii outlined for the freshmen apply equally to the advanced classes. The shops, laboratories and draughting rooms are all inadequate. Something must be done, and we sincerely hope that the State will make it possible for us to adopt the improver we propose, providing room both for immediate needs and for the ratural growth of the departments for several years. A building costing not less than $100,000 is asked for by the department to house the shops, the steam and gas engine laboratory, the laboratories of fuels and friction, of materials and of hydraulics. Preliminary plans for such a building have been prepared. The present engineering laboratory should be renovated and remcdeled into larger electrical laboratories, at a cost of $2,000.

At the same time, the present wing of the mechanic arts hall should be completely celled with a suitable metal ceiling, arranged to deaden the sound, which now seriously interferes with lecture work in the building; and the whole building should be plastered. The cost of these changes and improvements would not e\ $40,000. The instructional equipment in the several departments must be increased and such new force added as modern engineering educa - tion demands. FINANCIAL. The regents ur^e that the policy already established of provid - ing support for the North Platte sub-station and the farmers' insti - tutes from the state general fund be continued. Neither the neo nor the propriety of that cor I longer be argued. The sub - station and the Institutes are of growing importance to the people of the state: their management is wisely left to the regents who freely lend the forces of the univi all such interests as are allied to education. Decided progress has been made at the North Platte sub-station against adverse conditions. Everywhere increasing interest is manifest in the work of the farmers' institutes. Liberal appropriations are recommended for both. The sub-station should have not less than $ IQ and the institutes $15,000.00. The latter will surely be n to maintain efficiency of the institutes if it be found impracticable hereafter to secure free transportation for institute workers. Two years ago it was proposed to erect one wing of a woman's Miilding on the university farm and an Item of $32,000.00 was ac - cordingly inserted in the university appropriations. The regents found that in a building which must contain laboratories, work rooms lecture rooms, offices, laundries, kitchens, dining rooms and living rooms no one section could be built and finished for occupancy with - out such cramping and reduction of proportions as to render the whole inadequate, unsanitary and ill suited to its purposes. Neither was the board able to devise a plan for such a building, of creditable appearance and capable of future additions except at a very consid - erable extra cost. The $32,000.00 was granted not because it was thought by any one to be a sufficient sum but because it exhausted the estimated resources of the university at that time. Instead of constructing a building by parts or wings there seemed no alterna - tive save to proceed with a plan for the whole building, upon a reasonably ample scale, constructing only so much of it as the avail - able appropriation permits. The regents deem that course most economical in the end and it has the great advantage of supplying a suitable building from the first. The building is in process of </seg>
            <seg id="p529">502 construction which is expected only to be endowed and temporarily roofed with the funds now available. The regents' estimates for the ensuing biennium contain an item for completing and finishing the structure and equipping it for occupation in the fall of 19' In January, 1906, the university suffered its first Mriotil by fire which partially d« the boiler house and its contents situated on the farm near Lincoln. Repairs of the building and ration of apparatus and machinery cost $2,". Phis was I draft upon the current expense appropriations of the present biennium but by careful economy a deficiency has been avoid - ed. The weakened condition of the heating and power plant at the farm and the rapidly increasing demands render it wholly inade - quate. A larger new plant must be installed located at a point of nd safety. An item is included in the tiniw estimates for this pun Two years ago an appropriation of $7,500.00 was made from the temporal- -ity fund ned. however, upon the grand imMPitnt fi reaching |31 Its purpose wi ase library facilities, supply apparatus for the department of physics, promote ]K&gt;ultry and swine husbandry and secure additional land. The condition upon which that appropriation « come available failed. That failure, together with the fire loss mentioned in tl.- ng paragraph, and the growing needs of the university in all directions has made it impossible for the regents to much financial aid to -Tal nieasun d by that appro - priation. The estimates for the next biennium for current e.\| ■ and mail of farm departments have been slightly Incn whereby the regents hope to strengthen the small beginnings and maintain efficiency until an adequate special appropriation can lie supplied. Since the passage of the free book law for the common schools there has been a recurring agitation of the question of supplying text - books to students of the university and section 0144 chapter 87 Conip. Stat. Nebr. 1 :• inclusively establishing the legal duty of the negents to furnish text-books to students "at, regardless of the initial and current expense of such an en - terprise.

As nearly a - be Mi 1 the university student book trade approximates $15. - 00 annually. If the legislature determines that the regents must go Into the book business, $.". at least must be appropriated to supply the initial stock. That sum n;ight be sufficient to main - tain the supply for a time provided the regents are authorized to continually reinvest the proceeds of the business in new books. But if, instead, the board is required to turn the proceeds of the bu&gt; </seg>
            <seg id="p530">503 THK UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA into th.e state treasury to await reappropriation by the legislature, a much larger sum than $6,000.00 must be provided now and again and thus the book trade easily absorbs considerable sums of money badly needed for salaries and necessary expenses. That is not all. If the !• I books to students at a k than a tradesman can it must be because th vfll furnish rooms, heat, light and service, or some of these things, free of charge against the They are all of them factors which in greater or less dev mine the "cost" of books on the retailer's shelves. The regents have more than once carefully investigated the subject and are prepared to present it in detail to legislative committt ■■ In March. 1906, Con &gt;ted an additional appropriation to the several states to aid and enlarge the work of the experiment sta - tions. The purpose of the act of Congress was to donan station $5,000. 00 for the year ended June 10, I90C, increased by $2,000.00 each year thereafter until a maximum of $16,000.00 an - nually is reached, thereby doubling annually the original Hatch ex - periment station fund. When the first payment under rhi - reached the state treasury tli. auditor declined to draw war - inst it upon the official orders of the board of regents, cit - ing section l'2 of article ;! of the state constitution ol vhich provides, among other things relating to state revenues, that. "No money shall be drawn from the treasury except in pursuance of a specific appropriation made by law." The act of Congress pro - vides that any part of an annual appropriation thereby made which is not expended within the fiscal year for which it is made shall be deducted from the next year's installment. Therefore if the re - irents could make no use of the gift until after an appropriation of it by the legislature convening .January, l!«07. $S would be i st to the university, its experiment station and 0 have always granted that state "revenues," taxes of all forms, collected from the people of the state by the machinery of state gov - ernment, are subject to the constitutional provision above quoted: but, they have also long contended that gifts of money tho handled by the state treasurer as ex-orticio treasurer of the university do not fall within the constitutional provisions relating to the disbursement of ordinary revenue. To test the legal question involved proceedings were instituted in the Supreme Court by mandamus, entitled, The State of Nebraska ex rel Spencer Lens Company vs. E. M. Searle. Jr., Auditor of Public Accounts. At the last September term that case was decided in favor of the relator and a final order was made di - recting the respondent to issue warrants against the money in the treasurer's hands upon the orders of the board of regents. The logi - cal effect of that decision is to place all money for the support of the university not raised by taxation at the disposal of the board without legislative appropriation; the custody of the monies and the method of disbursement remaining as now provided by statute. </seg>

Distributing the increment over the three years in which the new revenue law has been in operation there is indicated a probable future advance of a little more than nine millions annually under normal financial conditions. In the ts' estimates for the next two years the annual increase of the grand assessment is plaf rvatively at $8,' if this rate of increase could be depended upon for a series of &gt; it adds to the university resources only $8,000.00 per year.

Of this amount not more than ii be paid from other sources than the temporary uni - y fund leaving $197 as an annual charge against the latter fund. That means $394,000.00 for two years. But $394,000.00 will barely maintain salaries as they are; it allows nothing for growth, for additions to the teaching force nor any margin with which to meet bids from other institutions for our strongest men. $ 000.00 will no more than enable the regents to make a salaries sched - ule for the next two years comparable with other universities of Nebraska's rank. If to a salaries roll of $4 5' be added not more than fl7C.000.00 for general current expenses, repairs, apparatus, books, etc., there remains of the estimated resources for the next biennium but $100. or new buildings and all other permanent improve - ments. But more than that sum ought to be expended on the farm alone for buildings and other essential impro To-day the work of the university occupies twenty-three moderate sized build - ings exclusive of m at North Platte. One new building is in process of construction. The average cost of the 24 buildings is less than $3 D.oort.oo — too cheap certainly — all will agree, the fact most forcibly illustrates the extremes to which the re. have been put to meet all needs without exceeding resources. Much equipment, particularly of the more costly kind, is lacking. On the material side the most urgent need still is for floor space and equip - ment. To one who views the university from the standpoint of its highest development it is apparent that expenditures for salaries and maintenance must continue to absorb more and more of the total resources. The time is not far distant when the entire resn must be used for these two items only. No doubt the issue will be intelligently and earnestly by the people of this state who failed to foster its educational foundations.

            <seg id="p539">512 5 Kr.POKT An examination of the registration of these students shows that along with the rapid increase in the number of men there has been &amp; notable decrease in the number of women. There is not only a de - crease in the proportion of women, but an actual decrease in num - bers. This is in spite of the fact that the college has one group of studies (domestic science) which is desigi . ially for women. In fact, if it were not for the enrollment in this subject the number of women in the college would be less than two per cent of the whole In seeking to account for these peculiarities In the growth of the industrial co! '-ral explanations ha* offered. Thus it Las been suggested that lower conditions of admission may have brought this notable increase in the number of students in th&gt; lege as a whole. Yet this cannot be tr iderably more than half of the stud' nditions are fully as high as they •re anywhere in the \nd further, while there has a great increase in the enrollment in 1 1 of agriculture, there has been a falling off in the school of mechanic arts and the school cf domestic science. If easier admission brought an increase in one case it is hard to see why it should not do so in the other cases also. Another suggestion that is sometimes made is that the rigid curricu - lum has had an ■ again wi met by the fact that there is fully as great rigidity in the curricula in which the increase of students is found as in those in which there has been a falling off. It may be that the young men come to this college becau prefer engineering and agriculture, and that the young women who come to the univer;- neral literary studies. Possibly this simple explanation is after all the true c I There are now :- :oups of studies, each four years long, the college. During the biennium three were dropped out, viz: jmical engineering, mining engineering, and chemistry-domestic :he faculty feeling that there was not sufficient call for them warrant their continuance. I am quite of the opinion that it uld be wise to drop out several more groups, for which the demand very limited. I am sure that the work of the college couid be bet - done with one-half the number of groups than with the present mber. With a revision of the general scientific group so as to e it greater flexibility we might dispense with all of our so-called &gt;ecial'' groups, and perhaps one or two others. A new group (home economics) has been added during the bi - ennium. It includes four years of work, and replaces the two-year group in domestic science. Admission to it is the same as to the other four-year groups in the college. tThe establishment of the department of forestry, and the organ- Ion of the technical group in forestry have been fully justified by registrations during the biennium.

BESSEY, Dean of the Industrial Co! REPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN. To the Chancellor and Board of I I have the honor to submit the following report on the condi - tion of the library during the biennium: The number of bound volumes added during the two years end - ing November 11, 1906, is 6650, of which 5 2 3 2 were acquired by purchase and 1418 by gift. The total number of volumes now in the library is 69,960. Thirty-five departments share in the library book fund at present. Owing to the increase in the prices of American books published under the net price system, it is impossible for us to purchase as many books as formerly. Yet the university is growing and the need for books is increasing so thai something in the way of special ap - propriation for the purchase of books is absolutely necessary to pre - vent the library from falling behind. Prof. James I. Wyer. Jr., who had been in charge of the library since 1898, resigned his position here to accept a call to the New York State library and terminated his successful administration De - cember 31, 1905. The present incumbent began his duties May 1. The work of the library was carried on in the meantime under the efficient direction of Miss Nellie J. Compton, assistant librarian. The most pressing need of the library is additional shelving ca - pacity in the main stack room. During the summer of 1906 two large floor cases accommodating about 4,000 books were placed in the alcoves of the stack room necessitating the removal of study tables from the alcoves and thus lessening our accommodations for leaders. The shelves are now so solidly packed as to admit of prac - tically no further expansion and if a second story is not added to the stacks, the only resource will be to remove some of the least used books and box them up till such time as the proper accommoda - tion can be furnished. The reading room is overcrowded much of the time and its seating capacity has become insufficient to meet the demands made upon it. I strongly urge the advisability of providing a reading room in the new university temple where newspapers and popular maga - zines may be made accessible and where students may have oppor- 33 </seg>

The increased demand for bulletins has forced us to publish reg- ular bulletins in litions. Recently the mailing list was thoroly revised, but still we require not less than 2! s for all regular editions. The cost of printing and distributing bulletins has become so large that it would be well to consider whether appropriations should not be asked for this purpose.

In addition to his duties as teacher and experi - menter, the head of a department is often obliged to spend several hours each day answering correspondence, which amounts in a partments of the station and school of agriculture to 1 S . 0 0 1 1 li per year.

Fifteen men connected with the uni - versity did institute work, and 2G other lectu: employed. That the instruction given at this institution has been of prac - tical value is by abundant testimony from nearly every point where institui D held. The beneficial results of institutes are seen in a more general interest of the people in the study of ag - ricultural problems and in the adoption of those methods which have given the best results in practical operations. At the present time a very large source of assistance to the farmers' institutes is liable to be cut off by the withdrawal of the ance of the railroads in transporting farmers' institute speak - ers. This assistance has amounted in the about $: Iditional luperinti has also become nee ■ ac - count of the growth of the institute movement.

While a survey of the agricultural work in the university shows a continually increasing capacity in the class rooms, laboratories, to handle students, this growth in equipment has scarcely kept pace with the growth in attendance of the school of agriculture. At the present time there is more pressing need than ever before for new buildings and for additional equipment. </seg>

What wonder that many a student, in - fctead of securing a real education, is merely getting dizzy. Quite important is it that this state of affairs should be correct - ed; for the world is daily requiring more and more carefully trained men, while the difficulty of giving the proper training is as steadily increasing.

I should call attention at the start to the fact that the affiliation consummated in 19":! has developed more strength than the most optimistic could have hoped. The advantages of laboratory work on the campus of the university and under the influence of a university atmosphere have been so marked that the clinical teach - ers speak of the training of the students as exceeding their most sanguine expectation. On the other hand the growth of clinical facilities in Omaha has been such as to give the students opportuni - ties for practical work that are proportionally equalled by very few institutions in the United States. Indeed, the entire situation Is so attractive that It has appealed to medical men of the highest type; and in seeking for heads of the departments of gynecology and der - matology, we were able to secure men of broad training and thoro scholarship who found the advantages in our institution adequate to draw them away from one of the largest and most prominent medi - cal schools of the west.

            <seg id="p564">537 THE UNIVERSITY OK NKHK In theoretical work, complete courses are offered In musical his - tory, harmony and composition, elementary theory and ear training. In applied music, piano-forte, voice, violin, brass and wood wind in - struments of the modern orchestra. Classes in ensemble training in different departments meet regularly and public concerts by the students and faculty occur monthly. During the year past some of the great instrumentalists and singers of the world have been heard In Lincoln under the auspices of the school, and the climax of these efforts was the establishment of the May Music Festival, on which occasion the famous Theo. Thomas orchestra, noted soloists and the university chorus of two hundred voices presented standard choral pnd instrumental works of the great masters. The school is entirely self-supporting, being at no • the State, and being without endowment is dependent for its suc - upon proper management and the fees received for instruction. Its faculty, however, is subject to the approval of the board of re - nimenced under the present organization in 1894. Since the first it has increased and for the lance las been as follows: 1900-01 1901-02 1902-03 1903-04 1904-06 19 340 516 I It has therefore grown nearly one hundred per cent during the period, with the present attendance larger than at any pre - ious time. tTh« object of the school is to educate teachers, to develop the rtistic spirit in the fullest sense, and to give the greatest attention ) the intellectual side of music study. Theoretical instruction is given almost exclusively in cli while applied music is by private lessons. A special course has been &gt;lanned for the education of supervisors of music in the public schools. This is proving to be an important and popular course. The chool has outgrown its present quarters so far as a dormitory is oncerned, as all rooms in the building are needed for instruction and practice. So that the problem now to be solved is a place of esidence for those who come to us for the special purpose of music tudy.
