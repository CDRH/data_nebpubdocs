         <seg id="p004">2 Lincoln, Nebraska, July 1, 1940. To His Excellency, Roy L. Cochran, Governor: Sir: In compliance with the constitutional requirement, I have the honor, to submit the following report of the Board of Educational Lands and Funds for the biennium beginning July 1, 1938 and ending June 30,1940. Fo'lowing my appointment as State Treasurer in August, 1939, I assumed the numerous duties in connection with the office of Secretary of Board of Educational Lands and Funds. The ensuing change in personnel placed a Chief Clerk in direct supervision of all detail activities of the office and I believe this report will substantiate the effectiveness of the change. In a great number of counties the productive value of lands has been very low during the past two years due to crop failures. However, dur - ing the period July 1, 1939 to July 1, 1940, it has been possible to collect on school land rentals $125,000 in excess of the amount collected during the preceding year. The records of the office show that prior to the time the Board had authority over the personnel of the department, apparently very little effort was made to collect unpaid accounts. It is impossible to make a definite statement as to the amount, but the uncollected rental on forfeited accounts would in all probability run far in excess of a million dollars. There are many cases on record illustrating the manner in which a lessee found it possible to retain a lease for a long period without remuneration to the State. For example, a lessee would hold a lease as long as possible without making rental payments, a brother perhaps would then take over the lease and in turn it would be transferred to a brother-in-law. An application is pending in Washington for a project to improve the accounting system of the office, which when completed would show the past and present status of each lease and sale account. This would be a valuable aid in eliminating the possibility of ineligible parties hold - ing leases, as well as speeding up collections. A number of small isolated tracts, consisting of a few acres here and there, and on which the State has received no rentals for years, have been favorably disposed of. Of the 1, 696,316 acres of school land owned by the State of Nebraska all is now under lease with the exception of about 680 acres. The de - linquent list for 1940 is less than half of the usual number. There are approximately 500 sale contracts, of which about 80% </seg>
         <seg id="p005">3 had expired several years" ago. At present they are practically all m good standing, the back interest having been collected and in many in - stances, 10% payments were made on principal. _ On December 16, 1939, a Resolution was adopted by the Board of EducationaV.Land? and Funds cancelling all Mineral Leases heretofore issued by the Board for the reason said leases were not issued in the manner and form provided by the Constitution and Laws of the State of Nebraska and lessees had failed and refused to progress with due diligence to develop the minerals on lands under lease and to file re - ports of progress as required by law. Under new Regulations adopted by the Board, there are now ap - proximately 21,244 acres under Mineral Lease with an annual rental income of $2,64252, There has been considerable increase in oil activity ' m the State of Nebraska the past few months which should be effective in increasing mineral leasing on State lands. &gt; - In order to conduct an efficient administration of the duties per-' taming to school lands and funds of the State of Nebraska, it fa beta* recommended that a full time field man be:added to the personnel rf the Xtepartment, whose duty it wiU be to supervise the investment of the Permanent School Funds and make necessary investigations of school lands. ••¦"-¦'¦ ¦¦.¦;- .¦¦¦•-, . Respectfully submitted, . JOHN HAVEKOST, Secretary Boardof Educational Lands and Funds- </seg>
         <seg id="p006">THE ORIGIN OF SCHOOL LANDS OWNED BY THE STATE At the close of the Revolutionary War, the United States came into possession of a vast area of land reaching from the Alleghenies to the Mississippi River, known as the Northwest Territory. When Virginia was admitted to the Union, she requested that the land in the Northwest Territory be set aside to be used to help support schools. The land was surveyed and platted into townships six miles square and containing thirty-six sections. Section sixteen in every township was reserved for the maintenance of public schools. Other states, as admitted to the Union, were given the same consideration. The same grant was made to the original thirteen states. When California was admitted to the Union in 1850, sections sixteen and thirty-six of each township were allotted for school purposes and extended to all States. The Enabling Act which admitted Nebraska to the Union, was passed by Congress on April 19, 1864. Sections sixteen and thirty-six in every township were granted to the State for the sup - port of common schools. The first statute relative to the control of a school land provided that the State Auditor shall be made commissioner and have general charge of the administration of these lands. This statute was passed in 1867. In each county the lands were to be ap - praised by three persons and offered for sale to the public. No lands were to be sold for less than $5.00 per acre. Following this statute, the new constitution of the State of Nebraska adopted by the vote of the people in 1875 created the office of the Com - missioner of Public Lands and Buildings. In 1936, by a direct vote of the people, the Constitution of Nebraska was amended abolishing the office of the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings, but did not take effect until the year 1939. Since that time the Board of Educational Lands and Funds has been composed of the Governor, Secretary of State, State Treasurer and At - torney General. This Board now has full management and control of all school land rentals, sales contracts, mineral leases, and the investment of funds derived from school lands, now amounting to approximately fourteen million dollars. JOHN HAVEKOST, Secretary 4 </seg>
         <seg id="p007">Rates and Regulations Pertaining to the Leasing and Sale of Educational Lands . . LEASE CONTRACTS The Board of Educational Lands and Funds may at least'once each year designate a day and an hour for offering in a public manner, at the office of the county treasurer in the respective counties, lease con - tracts on all of the educational lands which may be subject to lease in that county at the time of such offering. The same shall be subject to lease at an annual rental of six (6) per cent upon the appraised value thereof. Provided, if two or more parties desire to lease the same land, the officer having control of the auction shall lease to the person who will pay the greater amount of cash bonus in addition to six (6) per cent upon the appraised value as annual rental. If after due diligence to lease the land at an annual rental of six per cent upon the appraised valuation, the land may be offered for lease at less than the appraised valuation and the board may lease it to the person or persons who will pay six per cent upon the highest offered valuation as annual rental if, in their judgment, it is to the best interest to the State to accept such bid, but they may reject the same and pass said land without leasing at said auction. Lease rentals are due in two installments, January Ist and July Ist of each year. If rentals are not paid within six months after due, the lease holders are declared delinquent and notice is sent them if their post office addresses are known. If unknown, notice is given by publi - cation in a local newspaper. Ninety days after date of such notice lease contracts are declared forfeited and are subject to auction thereafter. Delinquent lease holders are not permitted to bid at the sale of the leases they have forfeited, but at any time before the hour advertised for the commencement of such sale they may reinstate their leases by paying all back rentals, fees and cost of advertising. All school lands under lease are subject to reappraisement at any time the Board of Educational Lands and Funds so elects. AH leases expire twenty-five years from the first day of January next ensuing after the date of the lease. A lessee has the right at the expiration of his lease to apply to the county treasurer for a new lease and receive the same without compe - tition, at the same time surrendering the old lease, paying rentals six months in advance, and a lease fee of one dollar. This will do away with the public auction only in cases where the former lessee does not apply for new lease. In such cases the lands will be advertised and leased at public auction to the highest bidder, and all 5 </seg>
         <seg id="p008">6 improvements on the land appraised by the county board. Improvements to be included in such appraisements shall be all buildings, fencing, wells, windmills, pumps, tanks, irrigation improvements, and also costs for labor expended in breaking sod on said tract of land and reducing same to cultivation, and for alfalfa or other crops growing upon said land. The appraisement shall be made within thirty (30) days after the acceptance ol the bid. (See Sec. 72-218, Session Laws Nebraska, 1935.) Where lands are forfeited on account of non-payment of rentals, the movable improvements are sold under the direction of the Board of Educational Lands and Funds as provided by Sec. 72-219, Nebraska Sersion Laws, 1935. The amount of school land authorized to be leased, direct or by renewal, to one person is limited to 640 acres. EDUCATIONAL LANDS MAY BE PURCHASED FROM THE STATE AS FOLLOWS: Lands known as isolated tracts, lands situated in the irrigation districts, and lands for the use of churches, cemeteries, schoolhouse sites, county agricultural fairs, public roads, and for sewage disposal purposes. Any lessee of land situated within the areas irrigated, or to be irrigated, from irrigation works constructed or controlled,' or to be constructed or controlled by the United States, or its duly authorized agencies, or any lessee of any forty-acre tract or government sub - division, any part of which is under irrigation, may purchase the same. (See Sec. 72-211, Nebraska Session Laws, 1935.) The law also provides that if any forty (40) acre tract is adjacent to other school land which is wholly or partly under irrigation, and therefore subject to sale, such tract may be sold even though not under irrigation if, in the opinion of the Board of Educational Lands and Funds it is expedient to sell the same. Any irrigation district in which there are or may be any educational lands belonging to the state which are or may hereafter become sites for reservoir purposes may purchase from the state for reservoir sites such educational land, or portions thereof. (See Sec. 72-211, Nebraska Session Laws, 1935.) The law provides that the Board of Educational Lands and Funds shall make a list of all isolated tracts of school lands containing less than forty (40) acres, all undivided interests in realty, and all city lots held by the state of Nebraska in trust for the permanent school fund, appraise same, and upon the expiration of the leases or upon forfeiture of lease titles, offer the same for sale at public auction, to be sold by the county treasurer of the county in which the lands are located to the highest bidder for not less than ninety (90) per cent of the ap- </seg>
         <seg id="p009">7 praised value. The purchaser shall pay not less than twenty-five (25) per cent in cash on day of sale and the balance to be secured by sale contract running ten years at six (6) per cent annual interest, the purchaser having the right to pay all of the unpaid money, or any part of it, in multiples of five (5) per cent of the total purchase price at any interest payment date. '¦¦ . : : ' : In the event the purchaser, or the assignee, does not pay the annual interest upon the unpaid purchase price within six (6) months after interest becomes due, the land shall revert to the state. SALE CONTRACTS The owner of a sale contract may at any time pay any portion of the purchase price thereof to the treasurer of the county in which the land is situated; provided, all interest at that time earned and due has first been paid. And when the principal is paid in full other than the first of the year, interest upon the obligation having been paid for the entire year, the county treasurer receiving such principal payment may refund to the payor out of any interest money then in his hands the interest so paid in advance in excess of the amount earned and due at the time said final payment is made. All unpaid principal on sale contracts, excepting those covering isolated tracts and lots as heretofore described, draws interest at five (5) per cent per annum, payable annually on January first of each year in advance. A sale contract holder making his final payment to the county treasurer should also surrender his contract that it may be forwarded to the Secretary of the Board of Educational Lands and Funds with receipt showing full payment.

No assignment of a school land lease or sale contract is valid until recorded in the office of the Board of Educational Lands and Funds, and an assignment will not be recorded if any interest or rental is due at the time it is offered for record. The original sale or lease contract must be sent in with the assignment or the latter will riot be recorded. Contracts will be returned with recorded assignments. When a subdivision of not less than forty acres in any contract is assigned, a new number is given the assigned portion of the ledger account and a certified copy of the original is given to the assignee. When assignment is made as above, the original contract must be re - duced and the interest or rentals, as the case may be, is adjusted to the new conditions. When interest on a sale. contract, or rental on a lease contract, is not paid when due, the county treasurers will collect "penalty" interest </seg>

Improvements on leased land and the owner's equity in land under sale contract are subject to taxation. County treasurers are requested to send in school land receipts at least once each week. Sometimes tardiness in this particular leads to considerable unnecessary correspondence and occasionally to delinquen - cies being charged against contract holders who are not in arrears, but whose receipts have not been sent to the Board of Educational Lands and Funds. Lands escheating to the state under the alien act are appraised and leased in the same manner as educational lands.

         <seg id="p012">REAPPRAISEMENT OF SCHOOL LANDS School Lands are reappraised by a standard classification. Where classifications are made, the State Surveyor views each forty-acre tract of School Land for the purpose of obtaining all the necessary information relative to the type and rating- of the soil, its adaptability, and the topographical characteristics of the land. A map is drawn showing the actual condition of each forty-acre tract. Normally school lands are divided into four types, namely: cultivated, hay, grazing and waste lands. Each type of land is divided into more than one different grade according to its degree of productiveness. In arriving at the productive value of the cultivated land, the soil type and region in which it is located, are ths two most important factors. Hay and grazing lands are usually divided into three classes each. This classification map referred to contains, in addition to the above data, all information relative to movable and immovable improvements, together with the value of same. Under the law, the State has a prior lien on all movable improvements on State School Lands in the event of unpaid rental or interest on contracts. After the land in a particular county has been mapped and classi - fied, a public hearing is held at the county seat. The County Com - missioners meet jointly with a representative of the Board of Educational Lands and Funds, not to determine the individual lease value, but to arrive at a fair value per acre for the various types of land in the county, thus eliminating the possibility of appearing to show individual favoritism. Due to a lack of sufficient help in the Department of Surveying, it has been impossible to take care of the authorized work and it has become at least two years in arrears. In addition to this, there are numerous counties greatly in need of classification which have not been authorized. This Department should be in a position to take care of classification and reappraisal promptly upon the authorization of same rather than force the lease holder, whose rental happens to be excessive, to con - tinue paying rental on the old basis for as many as two years after the Board has authorized the reappraisal. In many cases, the lease holders have been forced to surrender their leases and in such cases, the State loses no less than a year's rental. Those losses might have been avoided by a resultant rental reduction had the reappraisal been made sooner. It does not seem fair that a lessee who has kept his lease in good stand - ing for many years, put improvements on the land and made it his home, must lose his lease on account df drought conditions because of delay on the part of the State in correcting excessive rental, and sub - sequently be forced to stand by and see some other party obtain a new lease at a lower rate of rental; a rental which would have enabled him to carry on. 10 </seg>
