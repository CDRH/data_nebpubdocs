            <seg id="p002"/>
            <seg id="p003">FOREWORD To His Excellency, the Governor : The Board of Control herewith transmits the Fifth Biennial Report of the State Institutions of Nebraska for the period ending June 30, 1923. The biennium formerly ended on November 30 of each even-numbered year, but this date was changed by an act of the legislature, so that this report really covers a period of thirty-one months from December 1, 1920, to June 30, 1923. During the period, no change has occurred in the personnel of the Board, but several changes have been made in the chief officers of institutions. Dr. Beverly A. Finkle, superintendent of the Orthopedic Hospital, Lincoln, Nebraska, resigned to enter private practice, and was succeeded on August 23, 1921, by Dr. J. H. Matthai. Miss Amy V. Stevens, who had been superintendent of the Home for Dependent Children, Lincoln, Nebraska, for a number of years, resigned on July 5, 1922, being succeeded by her sister, Miss Nellie Stevens. The latter served until February 19, 1923, when her resignation was received, and Miss Lena Driever was appointed to the position. We call attention with pride and pleasure to the fact that the report shows the institutions to have gone through the bien - nium without incurring any deficiencies ; although the cost of living, and consequently the cost of supporting the state's depen - dents, has certainly not decreased since the appropriations were made for the biennium. Some improvements of a permament character have been made at the various institutions during the period covered by this report. A hospital building, bakery and scullery have been erected at the Nebraska Institution for Feeble Minded, Beatrice, Nebraska ; a cottage for girls at the Girls' Training School, Geneva, Nebraska ; a hospital building at the Soldiers and Sailors' Home, Burkett, </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 Nebraska; a gymnasium building at the State Industrial School, Kearney, Nebraska ; a hospital building at the Hospital for Tuberculous, Kearney, Nebraska ; a farm house and a barn at the Lincoln State Hospital, Lincoln, Nebraska ; a warehouse at the State Penitentiary, Lincoln, Nebraska ; a hospital building at the Soldiers and Sailors' Home, Milford, Nebraska ; a kitchen building at the Norfolk State Hospital, Norfolk, Nebraska ; a main building at the State Reformatory for Women, York, Nebraska. These buildings were badly needed, and they will have to be followed by others in the very near future if our wards are to be properly, efficiently and economically cared for. The legislature just past made provision for two or three buildings, but failed to see the necessity for several others that were urgently requested. Brief mention was made in the last report of the establishment of the Reformatory for Men at Lincoln, but the importance of the institution calls, we believe, for rather more extended notice. This institution was established as a result, primarily, of a wide recognition of the need of segregating young first-term offenders from more mature criminals. The legislature of 1921 authorized the establishment, therefore, of such an institution, making an initial approproation of $300,000. Of this sum the Board ex - pended $37,500 for 10 acres and a brick building .known as the Hayward Military Academy, later buying about 152 acres of contiguous land for the sum of $49,531.25. This land is used for farming, stock raising, dairying, and intensive gardening. Various trades are taught such as tailoring, shoe repairing, carpentry and joinery, brick laying, electricity, automobile repairing, launder - ing, engineering, firing, and barbering. The manual labor about the institution is, of course, performed by the inmates, of which there are at this date 189. Mr. A. W. Miller, the superintendent, is doing much constructive work with the young men committed to his charge, and we believe the institution is amply justifying itself. The difficulty of employing the penitentiary inmates at suitable labor that does not conflict too much with the prerogatives of the free workers of our state, has been pretty well overcome. The state still operates the fibre furniture factory which has been at the prison for some years, and has also established relations with the Oberman Company by which shirts are made and disposed of with a minimum of competition with free labor. r </seg>
            <seg id="p005">5 INMATE POPULATION There are seventeen institutions under the control of the Board, and at this time (July 1, 1923) the inmate population is 5917, as compared with an average of 4980 for the biennium ending in 1921, and 4907 for the biennium just prior to that. The following table will be found of interest as showing the population of the different institutions during the past two biennia : Av. pop. Av. pop.

In conclusion we wish to express our appreciation of the efforts of the officers and employees of the various institutions in striving to bring about a betterment of the living conditions of the wards under their care. We wish also to thank the Governor for his manifestations of interest and for his assistance in the work of this department, and we trust that he will continue his efforts to help us provide better means of caring for the wards of the state.

            <seg id="p019">19 To the Governor and the Board of Control of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. I am pleased indeed at this time to give to your honorable body a report of the progress of this institution for the biennium ending June 30, 1923. I may say that for the orderly and reason - able accounting of our work the change in the ending of the fiscal year and biennium is most fortunate. Now, in such a biennial report as this we are able to include two full years of school-work each beginning on the second Wednesday of September and concluding on the second Tuesday of June. These school-years are the true units of our endeavor and render a report much more satisfactory than was possible under the former division of period. This period has, altogether, been the happiest and most successful, with the best results obtained by the pupils, that I have ever known. And since it has been my privilege to be associated as instructor and superintendent with the school during no less than fifteen years, this is a joy and satisfaction. Our student body, more largely than ever before, has consisted of little people; and these are most contented always and acquire information most readily. Some of the little tots come to us, sightless, well-nigh helpless, their parents leaving them disconsolate in a deluge of tears, and almost before we know it little fingers are skipping nimbly over Braille dots, under the most devoted direction of Miss Jennie E. Johnson, our tactile teacher. Among all of our pupils, however, and among our help and faculty, there has been a spirit of helpful cooperation surpassing what I have at any time previously known. This happy consummation has been effected, I am pleased to say, with a smaller corps of assistants than for many years in the past. In the interest of economy during the first year of the biennium we managed to get along without a girls' industrial teacher. This was found to be so serious a detriment to our success that, upon my report, a teacher has been employed during </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 the past year and one will he employed for the approaching year. Tlii* handwork i* most valuable. Since its founding our school lia.s been in a constant state of evolution and thin biennium one of the point* of change has been in connection with our Sunday Chapel observance. Our previous - methods of Young Peoples' Society and Society of the Golden Rule had appeared to lose their vitality; so that, after careful consideration, we decided to try something else and are now following the International Sunday course. The school work has not varied much in recent years; the nature of the instruction is such as to prevent abrupt and whimsical Change. Our eight typewriters have been in almost constant use and the dictaphone is taught to several of our high school pupils. Our reading and writing is fast going over wholly to Braille; and this has been accomplished without shock or disturbance by starting from the primary and building up ;is thy pupiU have progressed. Almost all of the older students have acquired the newly adopted system thru their own efforts. This year a class of four finished the prescribed course in the literary department. They were Heulah Anderson, Elsie Carrutli, Vinnie Harden, and William Jantzen. From three to twelve pupils attend volunteer readings, which occupy from fifteen or twenty minutes on school days to one hour on Saturdays and Sundays. The selections are made by the pupils and include daily papers and books by the best authors. The supervisors and others read aloud many books suitable to the needs of the little people. The older pupils are fortunate in having for their regular reader Mrs. Kate Freeman, who has read to them numerous high grade books. In addition there have been at chapel exercises and at odd periods many articles read from magazines and newspapers. We have been especially fortunate during the past biennium. in the avoidance of serious sickness. During the whole period our own hospital has not been opened for the nursing of sick folk, all minor ailments being successfully treated in the respective sick - rooms adjoining the supervisors' apartments, under the careful supervision of the matron and supervisors. For special treatments I have used the permission kindly granted me by the Board of Control to take a number of our pupils away to experts in different lines. </seg>
            <seg id="p021">21 1 here expren* the thanks of thin school t(i Dean Irving Cutter of the University of Nebraska College of Medicine; to Dr. Harold (&lt;ifford; Dr. James Pattern; and to Superintendent J. H. Matthai, of the Orthopedic Hospital; and to their assistants. No charge for service performed was made in any case. In lieu of other gymnastic exercises we have adopted a complete system of calisthenic drills. The pupils have taken the Kreatest interest in these exercises ; and we observed lalmost immediately upon starting these drills an improvement in carriage and in other lines. A crushing blow was struck to the school in the death, during the second year of the biennium, of Kdwin C. Cook, a teacher for more than a quarter-of-a-century in the institution. Aid for the Blind In a general way the use of the fund provided for the Relief of the Blind has followed the plan previously marked out: (a) Loans to blind persons for business, or school; (,b) Scholarships to students pursuing higher courses; (c) Employment of Field Agent; (d) Direct help in some instances where needed; and (e) The purchase of some apparatus and supplies. There have been eight loans made in the past biennium, amounting to $625.00 to assist blind and partially blind persons in business and in securing education. While one can never say definitely I have reason to believe that three-fourths of this money will be repaid in time, for the borrowers are in earnest about their meeting of obligations. The conditions under which blind folk must struggle for a living have been especially bad during the last few years and it is not to be wondered at that these handicapt people fail occasionally to make ends meet. One of the most satisfactory uses to which some of this Aid for Blind fund has been put is toward supplying some help for those seeking higher education. I recommend that the Board of Control employ a general field agent to explain the plans and purposes of the school. One of the cases that has enlisted our warmest sympathy is that of Clarence Goddard, both deaf and blind, who came to us at the beginning of the last school-year. It has been a source of joy </seg>
            <seg id="p022">22 to his teachers to open up the avenues to his understanding. In spite of his immense physical handicap, extremely bad health in addition to the loss of two senses, he has made marvelous progresss The Board felt that our school equipment was more meager than it should be for the best results ; and this resulted in the build - ing up of the various departments. Playground apparatus, scientific apparatus, music and musical supplies, and books have been purchased and will be of vast benefit to our pupils next year and for many years to come. I am deeply grateful to the Board of Control for courteous co-operation; and to the officers, teachers, and employees of the school for their assistance. Most respectfully submitted, N. C. ABBOTT, Superintendent. </seg>
