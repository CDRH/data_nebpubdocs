            <seg id="p005">Governor Cochran's Message DELIVERED TO THE FIFTY-SEOOND SESSION OF THE LEGISLATURE OF NEBRASKA January 7, 1937 MR. CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE NEBRASKA LEGISLATURE: In again accepting the office of Governor of the state of Nebraska, I do so with a feeling of deep responsibility; a responsibility which has increased because of the adoption of a new method of legislative procedure; a responsibility which has increased because of the neces - sity of determining and making provision for the minimum needs of government at a time when drouth has again laid its devastating hand on our state which, directly or indirectly, is wholly dependent upon agriculture. Two years ago, we were confronted with more major problems than were ever attendant at a single legislative session. These problems were solved, as were the many administrative prob - lems which followed and continued throughout the past two years. At this particular session we do not have a necessity for a great deal of legislation, such as has been needed in previous sessions. In entering upon your duties, I know the spirit that animates you to make a successful demonstration of the first Unicameral Legis - lature. You are honored in being members of this body. This may well be an historic session, not because of the legislation passed or rejected, but because of the new method by which it 1b accomplished. If successful, we may see the methods of procedure adopted by you used as a guide throughout the nation. Let us hope that Nebraska may lead the way in an improved method of legislative procedure just as we have led the way in providing efficient, economical government without bonded indebtedness, without new and more burdensome methods of taxation. It is my constitutional duty to call your attention to the conditions of the state and to the state's needs. lam pleased to perform this duty. Some legislation is needed at each session of the legislature. Much legislation is seldom needed. Let us remember that a successful session can be based on what 1b not done as well as by what is done. I do not join with those who think the best measure of a legislature is the dispatch with which it is conducted. Legislation is a serious business and any law passed may affect, directly or indirectly, over 1 </seg>
            <seg id="p006">i ! one and one-third million people. Proper deliberation is essential for satisfactory results. Further than this caution against hasty legislation, I do not have or shall not have any suggestions as to rules and procedure. STATE OAFITOIi Two years ago, I recommended to the Fiftieth Session of the Nebraska legislature that a bill be Introduced and passed submitting a constitutional amendment to a vote of the people to provide for the abolishment of the office of Commissioner of Public Lands and Build - ings. This was done and the electorate of this state on November 3rd, 1936, by their vote abolished this office. The Attorney General 'has held that the office became vacant and non-existent on November 3rd, 1936. The Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings is now serving as custodian of the State Capitol under appointment and direc - tion of the Governor. His term of office, for which he was elected, ends today. I recommend that immediate legislative provision be made for the custodianship of the Capitol. Because of the large investment In the building, equipment and machinery and the fact that the whole task of taking care of our State Capitol is, to a considerable extent, an engineering problem, I recommend that legislation be passed placing the custodianship under the Department of Roads and Irrigation which, in turn will be responsible to the Governor. BOARD OF EDUCATIONAL LANDS AND FUNDS I recommend that legislation be passed at an early date giving authority to the Board of Educational Lands and Funds to appoint a secretary or chief clerk other than a board member and also giving authority and responsibility to the board to perform all duties with which the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings was formerly charged under the statutes, - with the exception of the custodianship of the -Capitol Building as provided for above. CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS PROPOSED Because of the vote abolishing the office of the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings, there remain but four members on the Board of Educational Lands and Funds. I recommend the submission of a constitutional amendment to make the State Superintendent of Public Instruction a member of this board. It seems to me that the reasons for this are quite obvious. The board should be constituted of five members, as formerly. The Superintendent of Public Instruc - tion is the logical addition because of the fact that the duties of this 2 </seg>
            <seg id="p007">board have to do with the administration and supervision of lands and funds belonging to the state, the income from which is used to help support our public schools. I recommend that a constitutional amendment be submitted to provide for appointment of the Attorney General by the Governor. The reasons are obvious. The Governor is held responsible not onlyJ, for his own official acts but also the acts of state departments under him and he is likewise held responsible m large measure for those performed by boards on which he serves.' He is entitled to a legal advisor of his own choice. I join with the Chairman of the State Railway Commission in recommending a constitutional amendment by which the Railway Commissioners will be appointed by the Governor with the consent and approval of two-thirds of the legislature. For these positions special knowledge and qualifications are required which, it is believed, can best be secured by appointment. Confirmation by the legislature gives the whole people of the state a part through their representa - tives in the selection of the members of the Commission. Under such provision, two-thirds of such members which, in effect, represent two-thirds of the population of the state, must give their concurrence. SOCIAL SECURITY UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE At the special session of 1935, the legislature did not deem it advisable to pass the unemployment insurance law which I recom - mended to make available the advantage of the provisions of this phase of the National Security Program. Legal opinions indicate that there may be an advantage in the immediate passage of such a law if it could be approved by the federal social security board and become effective prior to collection date, January 31st, 1937. Early action on this bill is highly desirable so that the necessary organization can be made effective to collect the contributions covering the year 1936. Anticipating the desirability of early action, the Attorney General has already secured a form of bill which will probably meet with the approval of the federal social security board. While this form of bill may not be perfect and may require some amendment to meet condi - tions in Nebraska, it will form a basis for your early consideration. If this is not . accomplished, it is recommended that your Honor - able Body memorialize Congress to extend the deadline fixed by the social security board so that Nebraska and other states in a similar position may not lose any of their benefits under the Federal Act. 3 </seg>
            <seg id="p008">SOCIAL SECURITY LAWS NOW IN FORCE! Nebraska was one of the first states to adopt a social security law to provide for old age assistance, aid to dependent children, to crippled children and to the blind. It 1s the first time in our history that such legislation was ever attempted. As a state we are glad to be able to grant assistance to the aged, to dependent children, and to others in distress under the provisions of the Social Security law. We must keep in mind, however, that this law provides assistance only and not necessarily adequate maintenance. In making such ex - penditures, as a state we must always keep in mind the interests of both those who receive and those who provide. We must keep in mind the taxpayer as well as the beneficiary of such a program. The cost of social security at the present time in state and federal funds amounts to a little more than six and one-half million dollars per year or almost twice as much as the $3,627,069.00 raised this year from property taxes for state government. Another year of drouth has been responsible for an increased number of beneficiaries under this program, an increased and unex - pected burden with decreased ability to pay because of drouth. It is hoped that we may again have adequate moisture for our fine crop - producing soil so that we may again come into our place as a great food producing state of the nation. When this happens, the number of people who need help under this program will be reduced, while at the same time the ability of the rest of the people to pay for this program will be increased. I recommend that the present laws be continued with substantial - ly the same average rate of payments as have existed during the past year. Some minor amendments to these laws are needed. I recom - mend that our social security laws be financed, using all of the beer and liquor taxes with a continuation of the head tax. It is recom - mended that the one cent additional gas tax enacted two years ago, which ends under its own provisions on March Ist, 1937, be re-enacted and that a portion of the revenue coming from this tax be used for the financing of social security and the remaining portion be used for the construction and maintenance of highways. !,. TAXATION The cost of government as a whole m Nebraska has been reduced twenty-three million dollars per year. A net reduction of thirty - four million dollars m bonded indebtedness of the local subdivisions has been made. These gains should and must be maintained with fur - ther economies . effected wherever possible. Local, as well as state administrations, must recognize the needs of those who pay as well 4 </seg>
            <seg id="p009">as the needs and desires of those who spend. Successive drouths following a period of depression haye reduced the capacity to pay. At a time like this it is natural that some might think of light - ening the tax burden by adopting new forms in lieu of existing forms of taxation. Experience of other states has amply demonstrated that such attempts to shift the tax burden have resulted in only increased taxation. I refer particularly to a general sales tax and a state in - come tax. Of the total tax dollar levied on property, approximately 11 cents goes for state purposes. Despite this small percentage, the state in its expenditures should at this time seek to hold down ap - propriations to a point commensurate with its most urgent needs. The state should be an example for low cost government. The local subdivisions should follow this example. Nebraska asva state is in an enviable position. We have no indebtedness, we have adopted no new forms of taxation. Some of the local subdivisions are in distress because they incurred an excessive indebtedness. I do not believe it is possible to administer the political subdivisions of the state and avoid bonded indebtedness entirely. I do believe, however, it is possible for the political subdivisions to take an example from the state and for the most part to follow the PAY-AS-YOU-GO plan. A bill passed two years ago provides a method for constructing school buildings without creating bonded indebtedness. This is a start in the right direction. BUILDING PROGRAM The financing and construction of this magnificent building over a long period of years is an example of what can be accomplished without burdensome taxation. I believe it is self evident that a further building program for Nebraska is needed. Requests have been made by the governing bodies of charitable and penal institutions and of the higher educational institutions for additional buildings. The need exists for new buildings and for repair of old buildings, just as the need exists for new buildings, for repairing and repainting of old buildings in the towns and cities, as well as on thousands of farms throughout Nebraska. The construction of new state buildings, whether for hospitals or for educational institutions, must be paid for directly or indirectly from the products of our soil. These products have not been forth - coming. We are waiting for adequate moisture to produce crops, the only source of wealth which we possess. We must likewise wait for public buildings until the source of payment is assured. We know that new public buildings are needed. We do not know accurately how much building is needed nor do we know the esti - 5 </seg>
            <seg id="p010">mated cost. I recommend that provisions be made for determination of these facts by a State Planning Board Committee. The purpose in granting this authority by the legislature would be to secure facts relative to present, as well as prospective needs, and estimated costs of those needs. This program may well extend over a period of at least ten years. The extent of the authority to be granted should be limited to the gathering of facts and the making of a report to the Governor. The Governor, in turn, should present this report to the next regular session of the legislature with the committee's recommendations. Two years ago, the legislature recognized an emergency at the Hastings State Hospital where the condition of an old hospital building is such that repair is not practical. The condition is such as to create grave concern for the safety of the inmates. The legislature, on rec - ommendation of the Governor, made an appropriation of $200,000.00 remaining in the capitol building fund for a new hospital building at Hastings, as a start in the way of providing a new building to replace the old one. An additional $161,000.00 in federal funds has been allocated for this purpose and bids will be received this month for the construction of the first unit of a new building. Additional construction work is imperative and an appropriation should be made or a levy provided by this legislature to take care of this emergency. I am making a study of the most pressing building needs and will make recommendation In my budget message. HIGHWAYS Nebraska has followed a wise course in its highway development using current revenue and federal aid for highway construction and avoiding indebtedness of any kind. I recommend a continuation of this program. Our highways are of three general kinds — those on the federal aid system, those state highways not on the federal aid system and feeder roads on neither of the above mentioned systems. We have added approximately 5,000 miles to the state high - way system. We have nearly doubled the original mileage. At the same time, we have reduced the revenue going to the state by one and oneJialf million dollars per year represented by the one-half cent additional in gas tax appropriated to the counties and by a reduc - tion in auto registration fees. This policy is obviously inconsistent, on the one hand to increase the responsibilities for construction and maintenance of state highways and at the same time to reduce the amount of revenue made available for such construction and main - tenance. 6 </seg>
            <seg id="p011">For several years federal aid funds have been made available to a considerable extent with no requirement for matching. Under the present federal laws, we must match all federal road funds re - ceived (with the exception of those for railroad grade crossing elim - inations). I call your attention here, as elsewhere, to the necessity for continuing the additional one cent gas tax law with a substantial part of it (probably over one-half) to be used for highway purposes. Under this plan, the Department of Roads and Irrigation will re - ceive approximately the same amount per year in state funds as it received prior to 1933. Nebraska is forty-seventh among the states of the Union and the District of Columbia in the amount of auto registration fees charged for each vehicle. Nebraska is twenty-eighth among the states in the rate of gas tax collected. Combining these two, Nebraska is forty - second in the amount of taxes charged for each motor vehicle. A higher gas tax and a lower registration fee is the more equitable plan. It charges the user of highways, whether he is a resident of the state or of some other state, in proportion to his use. It Is interesting to note that a higher gas tax has apparently not reduced the sale of gasoline. Kansas, for example, with a three cent gas tax and a higher registration fee used an average of 534 gallons per motor vehicle per year while in the same period, an average of 540 gallons per motor vehicle was used in Nebraska. HIGHWAY SAFETY During the past year, as a result of efforts on the part of state and local officials combined with that of public-spirited citizens, the press and the radio, a reduction in highway fatalities has been made. However, we recognize that there continues to be far too many seri - ous highway accidents resulting in death and serious injury and that something additional should be done to alleviate this condition. The 1929 session of the legislature passed a driver's license law which, experience has shown, is of little or no value. It is recommended that this law be amended so as to make it truly effective and that the granting of a driver's license to an individual shall be considered a privilege to be guarded by the licensee. It is felt that licenses should be renewed every two years and the fees from such licenses pay the cost of careful administration of the law, as well as the cost of greater enforcement of highway laws by the state sheriff. LAW ENFORCEMENT It is my belief that local officials should continue to be responsible for the enforcement of laws generally. It is my belief that the prin - cipal duties of the state sheriff's office should have to do with major 7 </seg>
            <seg id="p012">crimes and traffic violations in cooperation with the local law en - forcement agencies. I recommend an increase in the state sheriff's force in order to make this more effective. I recommend that no property tax be appropriated for state law enforcement and that the cost of administering state law enforcement shall be financed from revenue received from drivers' licenses, as above recommended. Believing that under present conditions the acquiring of fire arms is made too easy, I recommend the passage of. a uniform law in con - junction with other states in this section for the regulation of the sale of fire arms. MQUOB CONTROL Two years ago in accordance with a mandate from the people of our state, a liquor control law was passed. The law passed recog - nizes local sentiment. This is, to my mind, one of the most funda - mental requirements in a law of this character. I do not believe that major administrative changes are necessary or desirable at this time. Minor changes of an administrative character may be de - sirable. In case of making any such changes, extreme caution should be exercised to the end that the strongest features of our present law may not be destroyed. I commend the legislature of 1935 for their patience, care -and deliberation in working out. a law which experience has shown lends itself to conditions in this state in a manner which has been more satisfactory to the average • citizen than could reasonably have been expected. BINDWEED i I realize that one of the problems facing Nebraska is that of weed pests, particularly bindweed. I vetoed a bill which dealt with this subject two years ago because I considered it inequitable and unworkable. It seems to me that the problem of eradicating the bindweed, as well as other destructive weeds, is one that can and should dovetail with the Soil Conservation Program. I recommend that this- Honorable Body confer with those in charge of the Soil Conservation Program with the idea of making this subject a part of that Program. I do not believe that any legislation granting state supervision should extend beyond provision for a Weed Commissioner. Obviously the use of state funds in any considerable amount would be more than the state could stand at this time. *&gt; 8 </seg>
            <seg id="p013">SOIL CONSERVATION The Federal Soil Conservation Act under its present provisions requires legislative action by the states by 1938. It is expected that the incoming Congress will extend this time. However, it is suggested that as this session progresses, the preparation and passage of a bill may be necessary, this depending upon what action, if any, is taken by Congress. Nothing which we can do to conserve and preserve the soil and strengthen and fortify the basic industry of agriculture is more worthy of our complete sympathy and support. MORTGAGE MORATORIUM Inasmuch as the drouth has continued during the past year and has affected most of the state, it would only seem proper to extend the moratorium to provide for those who have a fair and reasonable chance to refinance their indebtedness. BUREAU OF EXAMINING BOARDS A year ago it was found that the Cosmetology Board was spend - ing funds in excess of those provided by law and in amounts greater than needed to administer this Board. The change in the administra - tion of this Department whereby the Director of the Bureau of Ex - amining Boards acts as Executive Secretary of the Board, has Improved administration and effected economies making possible reduction in license fees. It is recommended that these fees be reduced from $3.00 to $2.00. It is recommended that an engineers' and architects' licensing law be passed at this session. It is believed the passage of such a law will be instrumental in safeguarding, the life, health and property of our people. This is in line with the accepted policy of our state. STATE FAIR In 1929 the legislature of Nebraska authorized the State Board of Agriculture to issue debentures for the purpose of constructing a grandstand on the State Fair Grounds. The total amounts issued were $250,000.00. The present amount due is $237,500.00 plus $23, - 512.51 accrued interest or total indebtedness of $261,012.51. • The State Board of Agriculture has been able to pay current in - terest during the past two yeara. It is apparent, however, that at the present rate of interest which these bonds carry it will probably be impossible for them to be liquidated with revenue from the grand - stand receipts. I feel that there is at least a" moral obligation on 9 </seg>
            <seg id="p014">the part of the state because many purchasers of these bonds felt that the state was back of them. It may be possible that these bonds can be purchased below par. I recommend that provision be made authorizing the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture to refund the indebtedness owing on the outstanding NEBRASKA STATE FAIR GRANDSTAND DEBENTURES authorized by section 2-111, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929, at a rate of interest not exceeding three percent per annum and that section 72-202, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929, be amended to provide that such refunding bonds or debentures shall be eligible as investment for funds of the Board of Educational Lands and Funds. The average investment of the State Board of Educational Lands and Funds at the present time does not exceed three percent interest. In view of this, it appears to me that under this plan, a moral obligation of the state will be discharged. The State Fair Board will be benefited by having its fixed charges reduced $5,937.50 per year. They should be able to start paying off principal during the next year with In - creased amounts of principal payments in succeeding years. The state funds will be safely invested at a current rate of interest. STATE BONDING LAW The Supreme Court has just handed down a decision which ren - ders the State Bonding Law invalid. The opinion has not yet been received. When this opinion is received, in the event the reasons given for rendering this law invalid are such as can be corrected by legislative enactment, I recommend the passage of a new State Bonding law Including such corrections. ; CONCLUSION These constitute the specific recommendations which I, as Gov - ernor, desire to present to you at this time. I submit them for your earnest consideration. I recognize the mutuality of interest which exists between us in taking whatever steps may seem necessary and vijal to the welfare, of Nebraska. My budget message, which will be submitted later, will include a discussion of other important subjects. I welcome the opportunity to consult and' advise with you in solv - ing the problems with which you have been entrusted. We are met at a time when our, basic industry, agriculture, has been sorely afflicted. In almost seventy years of our existence as a state we have gone through periods of stress many times. We have always recovered. We have constantly advanced as a state. With 10 </seg>
            <seg id="p015">! the courage which we have inherited from the pioneer stock of this state, we will continue to advance. Let us look to the future with a spirit of optimism and hopefulness. Respectfully submitted, R. L. COCHRAN, Governor of Nebraska 11 </seg>
