            <seg id="p007">7 TWENTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT EXPERIMENTAL WORK The work of the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station for the current year has been as follows: The funds for the Station are secured from three source*, namely : The Adams and the Hatch appropriations are received from the Federal Government in amounts shown by the financial statement of this report. The Experiment Station also uses cer - tain other funds appropriated for general University mainte - nance and set aside by the Regents at their annual meeting for the maintenance of departments in the College of Agriculture and the Experiment Station. Direct appropriations are also made by the Legislature for certain specific purposes, such as hog cholera investigation and the work of State Entomologist and St;ite Botanist, who are respectively Entomologist and Botanist of the Experiment Station. These appropriations are under control of the Regents of the University and are expended for the purposes authorized by the legislature. Phe State makes direct appropriations also for the niainte - e of Substations at North Platte. Valentine, Mitchell, and ertson. Nebraska. An appropriation is also made for Agri - iral Extension work of the Experiment 8tation and the cultural College. Under the law. the Adams fund must be expended strictly for original research and cannot be used for general administration, for printing, or for farm demonstrations. The Hatch appropria tion may be used for geneml administration purposes and for investigation. Tt can no longer be used to print bulletins of a popular or demonstration character. State funds which come thru appropriation by the Regents to departments in the College of Agriculture doing exj&gt;erimental work are available for all necessary purposes of investigation or demonstration, but these funds must largely be used in carrying on routine work of in - struction which has been planned by the departments. The larger demands upon the departments caused by the growth of the Agricultural College leaves less and less money from State ap - propriations available for experimental purposes. A fund of not less than $25,000 annually should be appropriated specif- </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 Agricultural Experiment Station of Nebraska ically for this purpose at the central plant, as is now done for the branch Experiment Stations located away from the central plant. Complete plans of work are prepared by each department at the beginning of the calendar year, covering the lines of investi - gation proposed for the current year. These are submitted to the Station Council for modification or approval. Plans are made for the utilization of all the funds available to the department, so that the work of the Station may progress in a systematic and orderly manner, so as to accomplish the largest results, and prac - tically no funds remain unappropriated for the pursuance of new lines of work. Such lines of work can only be undertaken when the projects now under investigation have been completed. Most lines of work continue for a series of years before final comple - tion. Problems requiring original research ar,e always pressing for investigation, but funds for taking up new lines of work have been so limited that very few new projects have l»een undertaken in the last three or four years. It is recommended by the men in the Experiment Station that one of the most important functions of the Station is to carry the results of experimental work to the people. This is done thru bulletins, thru farm demonstrations, and thru other methods of publicity. There is need at the present time of a rather large fund to use for demonstration in cooperation with the farmers of the State The present appropriation for Agricultural Ex - tension work is not sufficient for that purpose, and was not in - tended to be used largely for demonstration purposes. Many results of investigation are not adopted by the fanners because tlu*y do not have the information or they are not convinced that the methods recommended are adapted to their use. Farm dem - onstrations are intended to take the results of an experiment into a locality and show the people of the locality exactly how to use agricultural field men. Much of the publicity work con - nected with the Station is now carried on by the Department of Agricultural Extension which is described later in this report under a separate section. LINES OF INVESTIGATION Plant Diseasks. — The principal lines of investigation carried on in Plant Pathology during the fiscal year were as follows: An investigation of the dry rot of the Irish potato tubers. The results of this investigation are reported in Research Bulletin No. 1 which prescribes effective treatment. Investigations have also been in progress covering a new potato disease which is somewhat prevalent in western Nebraska and in Colorado. This disease prevents the maturing of potato </seg>
            <seg id="p009">Twenty-sixth Annual Report 9 tubers; altho many tuliers set on the vines. The disease is par - ticularly prevalent in the irrigated fields of the North IMatte Valley anil has l&gt;een a serious menace to potato growers in that Corn Invksi kjation. — Experiments have been in progress for many years bearing upon the selection of seed corn, the rates of planting and the effect of inbreeding and crossbreeding upon yield. It is probable that the rate of planting will never be de - termined in such a way that specific instructions may be given to farmers govern ing the number of plants per hill producing the largest yields. This may be determined for a particular field in a particular year. but the results may not be applicable to farms where different soil conditions obtain or where the years are abnormal either from drouth or excessive rainfall. The general principle is well established that soils which are extremely fer - tile, especially valley soils which have some subirrigation. will mature ■ thicker stand of corn than less fertile soils or those where moisture is deficient. T'pon our upland soils we are likely to grow a heavier stand of corn than can be matured under even moderate drouth conditions. In years of abundant July and August rainfall, heavy stands of corn, namely, three or four stalks per hill, are likely to give the largest yield i&gt;er acre, but under drouth conditions heavy plantings always suffer more than thin plantings, so that for upland conditions and average years our experience would indicate that from two to three stalks l»er hill on planted corn is better than from three to four stalks per hill. Where total food value per acre is the object to be sii ii red and where corn is not to he husked but to be used in t* w&gt; silo or fed in the stalk, thicker plantings are desirable, since &lt; of the effects of thick planting is to reduce the size of the e - more rapidly than it reduces the yield of fodder per acre. The differences in elevation and in rainfall in different sec - tions of the Stale have led to the establishment of six different corn areas in which different varieties are recommended. The more western sections and those having the higher altitude are adapted to smaller and earlier maturing varieties than the east - ern sections. Experiments carried on at the substations and hv farmers show that the varieties most successful in eastern Nebraska do not mature in central Nebraska, since the corn season is shorter and the available moisture is liable to he less as you proceed westward. There is great necessity for the selec - tion and improvement of native varieties of corn in the central and western portions of the state, to secure greater uniformity and higher yielding qualities in the native varieties. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 I»k&lt;;rees of Tnbreedinc. — Experiments with inbreeding "f corn carried on at this Station tend to show that corn deterio - rates very rapidly when erossfertilization between plants is pre - vented. The vitality and yield of the corn inbred for three years shows a very marked decrease in yield ;md also a marked purifi - cation of characters. Ifhe two methods of seed selection now in use by the Experi - t Station are — first, to select the progeny of the hijjh yield - ears planted by the ear-to-row method, for the seed of the fol - ing year. In this method it is possible that some advantage accrue from detasseling every alternate row and saving seed • from the stalks which have been detasseled. This insure* of all the ears which are used for seed. A method also in use at the Station is that of planting the seed-plat thicker than is desirable for field purposes. When the seed-plat is planted at the rate of four or five stalks j&gt;er hill all the plants are under severe competition with each other and cmtj the more vigorous stalks succeed in producing good ears. While these ears are not likely to be of the show type, they have been produced under harder competition than they will experience under field conditions and this process of natural selection has weeded out the weak and degenerate stalks. The selection of the best developed ears from seed-plats where corn has been planted under this condition has given excellent results at this Station when planted the following year under field conditions at the normal rate. Ek T ATEE Requirements of Corn. — A study of the water re - ?ments of corn has been continued with much the same re - i as is shown in the preceding Report, which is available upon ication. Winter Wheat. — For the past twelve years work has been in progress to select pure strains of Turkey Red wheat which are of superior yielding power to the mixed strains in general use. Out of many thousand original selections, three strains have been selected for general distribution and these have now been planted for three years under field conditions in comparison with wheat previously grown on the same farms. These varieties under com - petition have shown the advantages of selection, especially where conditions of growth have been normal. In the year 1912 con - ditions were extremely abnormal and in some instances, under severe drouth where all wheat suffered greatly, increases in yield were not apparent. These varieties will continue to be crown by farmers and their final distribution will depend upon their superior yielding qualities. Tt is expected that these vai-ietie* </seg>
            <seg id="p011">Ticenty-gixth Annual Report 11 will have a permanent value so long as they are kept pore and unmixed At the present time the department is continuing itB experiments with ninety strums which have not yet been put on the market for distribution. Out of these we expect to get su - perior strains which will be suitable for distribution among the farmers of the State. I Fourteen varieties of oats have been tested for a number of rs. but none have proved superior to Kherson under condi - is at this Station. An effort is now being made to select pure lins of Kherson oats by the same method which has been used the improvement of winter wheat. Prop Rotation and Fertilization Experiments. — During the year twenty acres of uniform land has been set aside for •iments covering different methods of crop rotations and the : of commercial fertilizers upon the yield of alfalfa and i craps. Two hundred and forty twentieth-acre plats have laid out for this purpose. I Nine different fertilizer treatments will be used upon land pped continuously to corn, in comparison with each other and h no treatment. Tn these experiments, nitrogen, phosphorus. I potassium in the form of commercial fertilizers will be used, h singly and in combination, while stable manure will be used two different rates. The various treatments that will be rep - pnted with the same crop will be: 1. No treatment. 2 Nitrogen fertilizer. .*!. Potassium fertilizer. 4. Phosphorus fertilizer. 5. A mixture of a nitrogen fertilizer with a potassium fertilizer. fi. A mixture of a nitrogen fertilizer with a phosphorus fertilizer. 7. A mixture of a potassium fertilizer with a phosphorus fertilizer. 8. A mixture of a potassium with a phosphorus and a nitrogen fertilizer. 3. Rarnynrd manure, five tons per acre. 10. Bamvard manure, ten tons per acre. t Three distinct crop rotations with several different fertilizer itments will be studied with reference to yield and composi - i of the crop. ISoil Investigations. — The study of the loess soils of the nsition Region has been continued. The first report, dealing </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 Agricultural Experiment Station of Nebraska I the soils of the area as a whole, was presented at the Eighth ■national Congress of Applied Chemistry last September, detailed study, which will appear as a Station bulletin, is well advanced. Various articles dealing with the chemical physical properties of soils in the loess area were published e Twenty-fifth Annual Report. * studies on the relation of the nonavailable water of the soil lie hygroscopic coefficient are reported in Research Bulletin 3. Seep Potatoes.- -Experiments in the selection of seed pota - toes has continued. The Stntion strongly recommends that onch fanner secure his own seed potatoes from pure selections by the use of the straw mulch. By placing a mulch of straw over the potatoes after planting, they are protected from excessive heat and excessive drouth so that they do not overripen before dig - ging. If these potatoes are then placed in a cold cellar or pit where they will not ripen unduly in storage, they will be found to be of good quality for planting the next season. Our experi - ments indicate that seed grown and stored in this manner is equal to the seed shipped from the Red River Valley and other northern points. A single year of growing ordinary seed by thiB process seems to restore its vitality and producing power. EEREniTY Investigations. — Heredity investigations have been nued during the current year and a vast amount of data ng upon Mendel's law has been compiled and published as irch Bulletin No. 2. Eii.age for Beef Phoduction. — Investigations have been in ress comparing rations in which corn silage was used either heavy, a medium, or a light ration, with rations in which Mage was used. The results are published in Bulletin 132, h are summarized as follows: (1) In comparing bran, linseed-meal, and cold pressed cot - tonseed cake, each as a source of protein supplementing corn - meal and silage, the cold pressed cake proved to be worth 50 per cent more per ton than wheat bran, and linseed-meal 18 per per cent more per ton than cold pressed cottonseed-cake. Tn the use of each of these supplementary protein feeds with • rn-meal and prairie hay. the cold pressed cottonseed-cake showed a value per ton 22 per cent greater than wheat bran, and t!:e linseed-meal 28 per cent more than the cottonseed-cake. (2) Where alfalfa was used in connection with corn-meal and silage, or corn-meal and prairie hay, large gains were made </seg>
            <seg id="p013">13 without the use of a concentrated protein food. The gains in both ex]&gt;crinients where alfalfa whs fed were larger, less eoatlj, and much more profitable. These experiments, supplementing what had previously been found, show that beef can be produced in Nebraska at a lower cost and with greater profit on a com - bination of the corn plant and alfalfa hay than on any other com - bination of foods available in the state. ft) These experiments show that corn silage gives larger w than shredded corn-stover when each is fed with corn meal alfalfa, and for beef production is worth 60 per cent more ton. Bi i &lt;'orn-stover has a value 80 per cent as great as prairie and the jwrtion consumed is fully as Valuable. Prairie hay h usual market price is not profitable for fattening cattle. 1(5 1 Tn comparing a ration consisting of a heavy feed of corn - il. alfalfa, and a light feed of silage, with a ration consisting i medium quantity of each feed and a ration consisting of a t feed of corn, alfalfa, and a heavy feed of silage, yearling n being fattened for market made cheaper and more prof - »le gains on the larger feed of corn and smaller feed of corn Klfi) Tn growing calves to be fattened later for market, the ipest gains were made on a liberal ration of corn silage and lfa without grain, the cost of gains increasing in proportion he amount of corn-meal fed. 1 7) These experiments show that there is a great variation in the capacity of individual steers to make gains under like conditions. The data do not show that the individuals of any breed make larger-gains than those of another breed. The varia - tion in gain seems to be fully as great within a breed as between representatives of different breeds. (8) Type or conformation seems to be a controlling factor, the lowest, more compact types having something of an ad - vantage in gains and much in early maturity over the rangy K(9) Gains seem to correlate to a considerable degree with y capacity as indicated by the size of the middle girth, the test gainers having relatively larger middle girths at the same [rht in most instances. (10) While the average gains made by all dairy bred steers are nearly the same as those made by the beef bred steers up to the age of twenty-three months, the latter showed in most in - stances a higher condition of flesh, a larger proportion of high priced meat and sold for a higher price per hundred, returning </seg>
            <seg id="p014">larger profits to the feeder on the basis of the same initial cort per hundred. An experiment was conducted in 1912 to determine the rela - tive efficiency of corn silage and pasture for fattening cattle in summer. Each lot was fed a grain ration consisting of corn and 20 per cent cold pressed cottonseed-cake. The gains of the two lots between June 1 and September 10 were practically equal. The costs of the silage and the pasture were not accurately figured altho the land required to produce the silage was not over one-fourth as great as the land required to pasture the steers. The lot running upon pasture outsold the silage fed lot by 50 cents per hundred. This, however, was an error, as upon slaughter it was shown that the cattle fed upon silage produced a much higher quality of beef, being whiter and of better color, than the lot fed upon pasture, which showed yellow fat and the meat experts of the packing house declare that the carcasses of the cattle fed upon silage were worth fl per hundred more than those fed upon grass. i Cations for Dairy Cattle. — Experiments are in progress to rmine the value of silage in the ration for dairy cattle, in l&gt;arison with alfalfa alone or alfalfa and prairie hay in ad - in to the grain ration. While it is well understood that re possesses a very high feeding value for dairy cattle, no t data are available in Nebraska covering the relative value ilage with other feeds available for milk production. This ■riment is undertnki-n to collect such data. EIog Cholera Serum Production.— The Experiment Station established a plant for the production of hog cholera serum •h is used as a preventive of cholera when applied nnder suit - conditions. Some misapprehension exists among hog ;rs as to the use of serum as a protection against cholera. I Serum is not recommended as a cure against cholera after individual has been attacked by the disease. The most ac - ite way to determine whether an individual is suffering from Icra when the herd is affected is by taking the temperature of animal. Tf the temperature is above 10.'{ degrees, the use of mi is not recommended except in large doses. If the tempera - • is normal, the use of twenty-five cubic centimeters of serum each 100 pounds of live weight will protect the animal against lera for a limited period and where cholera is well developed he herd so that the animal is thoroly exposed to cholera the tection will be more permanent. Hog raisers wishing to produce reasonably permanent im </seg>
            <seg id="p015">V r 15 nmnity should use the simultaneous method of injection in which a limited amount of virulent cholera blood is injected along with the proper amount of serum. This produces a mild case of cholera in each animal from which they soon recover, producing immunity for a considerable period. Where animals of high value on ac - count of their pedigrees or breeding qualities are to be protected against cholera, the double method of injection may be used, namely, a standard dose of serum should be injected without cholera virus. This produces a limited degree of immunity in the animal. One week after the injection of serum the hog should be treated by the simultaneous method, injecting cholera virus and a second dose of serum. T T nder this double method of protection, the loss from cholera by vaccination is practically eliminated. Farmers who have used serum in the case of an outbreak vithout testing their animals by a thermometer to determine whether or not cholera actually exists in the herd before serum is used have sometimes failed to secure any benefits from the use of serum and in consequence have lost faith in its efficiency. There were many such instances before sufficient experience was pained in the use of serum to emphasize the importance of using the temperature of the animal as an indication of its freedom from disease. Animals in infected herds which do not yet show external symptoms frequently have a temperature of from 106 to 108 degrees and when such temperatures exist the use of serum is not recommended except in greatly increased doses and then a considerable loss should be expected. The output of the serum plant at the present time is about 250.000 cubic centimeters per month. Sufficient experience has been gained in this and other states to show that it is impossible for any serum plant to produce serum as rapidly as it is required during an outbreak of cholera. Experience also shows that this serum may be stored for several months and that by storing serum during periods when cholera is not prevalent the capacity of the plant for emergencies can be greatly increased. The ap - propriation of $ 15.000 by the last Legislature for a serum plant and for its operation, providing that serum should be sold at cost, left only a small fund, which is now about |7,000, with which to operate the plant and store serum for emergencies. The cost of producing serum depends greatly upon the volume of serum produced. Large plants are operated more cheaply in proportion to the serum produced than small plants. A fund of |25.000. to be used as a revolving fund for storing serum, would greatly increase the efficiency of the plant and would materially </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 Forestry. — For several years, experiments have been in prog - rets to determine the best varieties of trees for posts and for shelter belts both at the central Station and at the North IMatte farm. A bulletin reporting progress in this work is under prep - aration at the present time. Cooperative Experiments. — This Station is cooperating with twenty farmers in the production of selected strains of Turkey Red wheat. The Station is cooperating with the Polk County Corn Club in developing a practical method of seed corn selection for the farmers' use. The Station last year kept records on the weights, gains, and feed used by W. H. Bowman of Beatrice. Nebraska, in feeding 22S head of steers on blue-grass pasture, the grain ration consisting of corn and cold pressed cottonseed-cake. The follow- ing records were secured : The Station is eooj&gt;erating with the United States Depart- Bt of Agriculture and with the farmers in three localities in lucting dairy cow tests where the individual record of each cow is kept to determine the profit or loss. The Station is cooperating, thru its Extension Department. with the United States Department of Agriculture with three different localities by supervising field agents located in the county, to assist farmers in methods of agricultural practices. Tt is to be hoped that State aid will he available to the University so that it can give further financial support to work of this character. The North Platte Experiment Station is cooperating with the Bureau of Plant Industry with its dry-land agricultural in - vestigations to determine the methods of tillage and crop rota- tion most suitable in the Great Plains area. This Station is also cooperating with the Bureau of Plant Industry thru the Substation at Mitchell. Nebraska, in studvine the same problems of crop rotations and in the investigation of irrigation problems. tage weight of steers April 1 870 lbs. age weight of steers June 28 1.177 lbs.

This includes, studies il tillage, crop rotations, tests of varieties, soil moisture igation, cattle feeding, and swine feeding. The year 1912 was one of average rainfall, altho, following the disastrous drouth year of 1911, crops were in a precarious condition, especially during the early part of the season. The yields of winter wheat upon summer tilled land were only fair, producing a maximum of 21 bushels per acre. Rains during the latter part of the summer assisted materially in maturing the corn crop, which was an average crop for that region. The crop yields for 1912 are reported in Bulletin 135 which is now in E Since the establishment of the Station, the question of eco - ical pork production has been studied in an extensive way, it 1,200 pigs having been fed upon experimental rations in last six or seven years. Bulletin 124. giving the details of stigations reported in Bulletins 121 and 123. has been pub - ■d during the current year. I The Station is carrying on lines of investigation in feeding re* for baby beef. Calves are purchased at weaning time from oining ranches and placed in the feed lot. where they are I'd for from t!ix to eight months, using the following rations: 1. Corn, cottonseed-meal, and prairie hay. 2. Corn, alfalfa 80 per cent, prairie hay 20 per cent. 3. Corn, silage, and alfalfa. 4. Corn, silage, and prairie hay. 5.

THE VALENTINE SUBSTATION trhe Substation at Valentine was established in 1910, for the lose of determining the suitability of the Sand Hill country general farming. Work has been carried on to demonstrate value of alfalfa on light, sandy soils, especially where there an underflow from higher lands, producing subirrigation. to the present time, experiments have not been very sucoess - upon land where no subirrigation was present, but where pr is supplied from an underflow not too close to the surface, lfn hns been established and successful crons have been </seg>
            <seg id="p018">18 Agricultural Experiment Station of Nebraska Km. &lt;iriniin's alfalfa has shown a superior hardiness under tu conditions, but the degree of superiority has not been mined. I Considerable attention has been given to planting Jack pines, pines, and deciduous trees for a shelter belt. The conditions ailing during the last two years have not been favorable, but ir stand of pines has been secured by very persistent atten - , which included the use of water and mulches to prevent H&gt;ration. The deciduous trees planted have grown with few •ptions and produced a much better stand than was secured he pines. Time enough has not yet elapsed to determine the tive hardiness of the different varieties planted. I An effort has been made to secure a stand of alsike clover and te clover in the native meadows by disking the sod and sowing ly in the spring, on land where considerable moisture is avail - p from subirrigation. It is too early as yet to determine ?ther the clovers thus sown will continue and become valuable the native meadows. I Experiments have been carried on with several varieties of atoes, to determine their relative efficiency, but as yet no re - de report is available. t During the present winter an experiment in fattening cattle ieing carried on to determine the relative efficiencies of differ - rations in fattening yearling steers. The rations in use are r ollows : Lot 1, 20 pounds of silage. 7 pounds of prairie hay. and 6 pounds of corn. Lot 2. 14 pounds of alfalfa and 6 pounds of corn.

THE SCOTTSBLUFF SUBSTATION* I The experiments conducted at this point are confined chiefly the various crops and cultural tests under irrigation, hut •The Seottsbluff Experiment Farm is located on the North Platte Reclamation Project, six miles east of Mitchell and about eight miles northwest of Soottsbluff, Nebr. The tract consists of 160 acres of land Irrigated from the Government canal. Tho the entire tract is irrigable, about 30 acres are devoted to dry land experiments. The land was withdrawn from entry by the Department of the Interior </seg>
            <seg id="p019">about 30 acres are reserved for dry land experiments. The ex - periments under irrigation include crop rotation, cultivation, methods of irrigation, the growing and testing of various crop varieties in order to determine those best adapted to the local conditions; also the testing of shade and fruit trees and of small fruits and shrubs. During the year 1912 there were 662 plats in use, ranging in size from a quarter of an acre to row tests of corn and sorghum. Considerable land was devoted to growing trees from seed and cuttings. Vegetables were also tested in a limited way, in order to determine the best varieties for the locality. ITn dry farming, the experiments were confined to crop rota - is. tillage methods, and the testing of dry land crops to de - nine their adaptability to conditions in western Nebraska. Rotation op Props T'ntier Irrigation. — Thirty-one rotations, including alfalfa, sugar beets, corn, flax, oats, potatoes, and wheat, were used. The average yields per acre obtained in 1312 were as follows: 20 plats of first year alfalfa. 2.62 tons: 14 plats of sugar beets averaged 17.11 tons; 5 plats of corn, 56.1 bushels: 2 plats of flax. 26.6 bushels; 18 plats of oats, 96.2 bushels; IS plats of potatoes. 226.8 bushels; 6 plats of spring wheat, 46.2 bushels. I Wheat Varieties. — Nine varieties of wheat have been grown. ■ highest average yield for the white wheat was with the De - ice, which produced 39.8 bushels per acre. The hiehest yield red wheat was the Bluestem. producing 37.5 bushels per acre. Oat Varieties. — The highest average yielding variety of white oats was the Colorado No. 37. which averaged 66.3 bushels. The Sixty -day or Kherson yielded 58.5 bushels. The difference in the time of ripening of the early and the medium early varieties was from 12 to 16 days. This is a matter of much importance in sec - tions that nrejtoitpd by hailstorms annually, the early-maturing varieties beingThore likely to escape. B Barley Varieties. — Fourteen varieties of barley were tested. &gt;se included six 6-rowed varieties, three 2-rowed. four hooded 1 and one hooded beardless. The bald varieties weigh 60 buildings were erected by that Department. The farm is under a Super - intendent detailed by the office of Western Irrigation Agriculture, I*. S. Department of Agriculture. The work is supported by Federal appropria - tion thru the Department of Agriculture and State appropriation thru the University of Nebraska. The buildings on the farm outside of the orie trial three structures have been erected from State funds. </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 Eids per bushel. The best yield secured with these was 39.2 ielB. The yield produced was : Gi 262, yielding 39.2 bushels, hooded barley produced 40.2 bushels, weighing 48 pounds, fornia Feed, the highest yielding 6-rowed barley, produced bushels. Imported Franconian No. 680, a 2-rowed type, luced 68.3 bushels. Oohn Vabietiks. — The flint corn matured better than the dent corn. The highest yields were 53.6 bushels for flint. The ob - jection to the flint is that it forms the ear low down and is diffi - cult to harvest. The average yield of 23 corn varieties was 43.3 bushels per acre. Potato V\rietips. — The test of varieties of potatoes included 13 old-established varieties and 50 seedlings. The best yield was obtained from the Pearl, which yielded 615 bushels per acre. Xinetv-flve and four-tenths per cent of these potatoes were mar - ketable as determined by passing thru a 2-inch screen. The best medium seasoned variety was the Eureka, yielding 476.6 bushels per ncre. of which 05.1 was marketable. Of the seedlings grown, about 10 seemed to be promising. Irrigation and Cultivation of Potatoes. — Potatoes were planted on three different soils, namely, on alfalfa sod, stubble, and fallow land. On each of these soils 12 plats were deeply cultivated and ditched deeply for irrigation, and 12 plats were ■hallow cultivated and ditched shallowly. In each case, on two plats alternate rows were irrigated thruout the season. Two plats were irrigated so that the plants should never lack moisture. Three plats were irrigated in alternate rows, but not until the plants showed actual need of water. I The largest yield was obtained on alfalfa land, where alter e rows were irrigated under shallow cultivation and ditching, all cases the alfalfa sod produced the largest yields and the bble the lowest yield. The percentage of culli on the stubble d ran from 50 to 75 per cent higher than on the alfalfa sod. I Fall Irrigation. — Tn two years' experience, fall irrigation given larger yields of small grain than where no fall irriga - i took place but where grain was irrigated in the spring only. i average yield of wheat on fall irrigated land was 36.4 ihels, against 30.4 bushels on land not fall irrigated, a differ e of 6 bushels per acre. With oats, the average yield on fall gated land was 81.5 bushels per acre, against 65.7 bushels on d not fall irrigated, a difference of 15.8 bushels in favor of </seg>
            <seg id="p021">1 irrigation. The barley yielded an average of 40.1 bushels iicre on fall irrigated land, against 28.5 bushels per acre on : not fall irrigated, a difference of 11.6 bushels per acre. THE CULBERTSON DEMONSTRATION FARM The last Legislature made an appropriation to establish a 1 (eiuonstration Farm at Oulbertson. The land for this farm was selected on April 13, 1912, and is located one-half mile east of the town of Culhertson. Twenty acres of this land came into im - mediate possession of the University, the balance of the land being held by the tenant until the crop was harvested. t)uring the year 1912, the Station erected a dwelling house ii small stable and has put the land in condition for use ng the present season. No experimental results have as yet secured. This land is all under an irrigation ditch, and a ion of the farm will l&gt;e cultivated under irrigation, while the nee will be cropped without the use of irrigation water.

In addition to this. 12 Short Courses or Institute Schools were held, each covering one week, where agricultural subjects were discussed very nmch more in detail than can be done at a Farmers' Institute. E'he University, thru its Extension Department, has under - ii a number of new lines of work to assist in the improvement irm methods. I Partly with the assistance of the United States Department Agriculture, three farm demonstrators have been located in State. These men are paid largely by local subscription and funds available thru the United States Department of Agri - hire or other outside sources, but it is hoped that the State n will furnish funds which will enable the University to as - directly in this work. I In the spring of 1912. seed corn trains were run over railroads pring practically all the corn-belt territory of Nebraska, dis - sing the importance of using a high quality of seed corn for nting the crop and drawing attention to methods which have ved successful in practical operation. I During the present year the number of Farmers' Institutes I exceed those of the previous year, and the number of agricul - il Short Courses will he niateriallv increased. t^or the biennium which will dose March 31. 1913. the Ex - ion Department received an appropriation of $35,000. The rth of this work and the new lines which will be undertaken e it important that a larsrer anpronrintion shall be available the next biennium. and the Regents have asked for an ap - &gt;rintion of $."0,000 to cover the work coming under this de - ment of the University. The meetings of Organized Agriculture, held during the week of January 20-24. 1913. called together a large number of farmers interested in improved lines of agriculture, horticulture, live stock breeding, etc. Most of these organizations met at the Uni versity Farm, the State Horticultural Society and the State Board of Agriculture meeting in the City, where a fine display of fruit and corn was made in the City Auditorum. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The agricultural press, and especially those papers located within the State, have shown their appreciation of the work of the Experiment Station by giving liberal space to the experi - mental work reported and in every way facilitating the extension of useful agricultural knowledge. </seg>
