            <seg id="p005">OF THE State Board of Charities and Corrections To His Excellency, Chester II. Aldrich, (Kiveruor of Nebraska In presenting the sixth hieuuial report for this department we are more impressed with its importance, and better satisfied with what it has accomplished in l)ettering conditions in caring for unfortunate people, than ever before. The law makes it our duty to inquire into the methods and practices in use in the .liaritable and correetionable institutions of the state and in \ -I'l-fil counties and to make such recommendations as may seem advisable or necessary. This can be ascertained only ♦hrough frequent personal visits. These institutions belong to the people, but comparatively few ever visit them, and without some authorized ML'ent to represent them in visitation. 1 1 1 - lion, and in publishing reports concerning; them, few people would ever have any authentic information relative to them. I-i ty for this is manifested as we realize that about r cent of our population is ;iT some time during 1 1 1 ■ of our charitable or correctional institutions of the or state, a large majority of whom are without friends. ve bo other representative to appeal to the authorities d with their keeping for such ekaagea or improvement - needed for their better care.

            <seg id="p006">IB, insane asylums, jails and penitentiary in excess of h-reased ratio in population I believe we should enact strict marriage laws, establish an adult reformatory, an tic colony, a state labor colony, a hospital for the treat - of people suffering from gonorrhea and syphilis, and a lome for the aged and indigent. These we will consider separately, giving reasons that exist for thceir establishment : An Adult Reformatory. These have been established in Colorado, Illinois, Indiana -.. Massachusetts. Michigan. Minnesota, New Jersey. New York. Ohio. Pennsylvania, Vermont. Washington, and Wis - !i. and what they are accomplishing in comparison, or rather in contrast, witli the reports as to state prisons might ■d as evidence in the consideration of why Nebraska needs an adult reformatory. The first one of these established was in Massachusetts, but the first in actual operation was in New York slate. ;it Elmyra. In most states those committed to the reformatory range be- B sixteen and thirty years: in some, however, the maxi mum age is thirty-five. Some states provide for the commit - ment of first-time offenders only: others leave it to the discretion of the jilgri. and some prohibit the admission of eo&amp;victed of the crime of murder. In my opinion, a nHtdty should be established where agricultural pursuits would be the principal occupation and a school of letters should also be established in connection therewith. I am thoroughly convinced that an adult reformatory, prop - erly located, where these young men and first-time offenders could receive an inspiration from the simple farm life, be taught useful trades and given school advantages under wd 1 qualified and exemplary officers, guards and instructors, aided ir indeterminate sentence and parole law, would be instni- ntal in reforming a large per cent of them, who, if compelled to associate with hardened and confirmed criminals, would otherwise continue in a life of criminal acts. From an in </seg>

How important then that this class of men should be separated from the vicious criminals, and the state should make the most of its opportunity for their reform. Iistics support us in tlie contention that if this class of •e separated from the hardened criminals that ninety per I those that are normal, when given proper employment •hool advantages under well-trained, exemplary guards ell qualified free teaehen with high ideals, upon their rge will become useful citizens.

It should lie located on a larjre tract of good agricultural land where farming and dairying could be successfully carried on. An Epileptic Colony, It is safe to say that of the more than two thousand people that are in our State Insane Hospitals that over two hundred are there on account of epilepsy who. while not normal, are a great majority of the time sane, and it seems criminal to compel this class to he daily associated with the insane. In visitint: ■ate hospitals, these people make pitiful pleas for their discharge : tiny converse rationally, and insist that if required to associate with the iaamae that they too will become so. It i* true that a part of the time they need custodial care, and not knowing just when these emergeaeiea will ariae, they anal constant eare, and should we not provide ;&gt; wp </seg>
            <seg id="p009">CHARITIES AND CORRECTION 9 I have visited a hospital for the care of these unfortunate people at Panoaa, Kansas. The institution is now less than nine years old. and is located upon a section of land. The colony is made up of a collection of buildings, providing for the classification of the inmates which represent homes, and with the exception of (die each for males and females who are inclined to leave the institution, tney are open huildings. Pot I In- scientific treatment hy specialists in this line, epileptic in - ane are also cared for at this institution in huildings especially titled and prepared for this purpose. The establishment of a colony fur this class jtives school advantages to a large number of children that would not he permitted to attend public school or who. from sensitiveness or liability to sei/.ures. would not ad a public school wit ii any regularity. &lt;&gt;n account of the crowded condition now existing in our insane hospital*, it being necessary to transfer about forty epileptic patients from one of our hospitals to the Feeble Minded Institute at Beatrice, saggestfl that it is not necessary to irive these people the constant watch that is necessary for the insane, so that from an economic point of view a separate place for their care should In- provided. From the small per rent of recoveries, epilepsy seems to be almost incurable, which, for the protection of future posterity, makes it abso - lutely necessary to give this class constant custodial care. &lt;&gt;t' the patients admitted at the Parsons institution, twenty pot cent had attacks of epilepsy before they were five years of age. A State Labor Colony. The establishment of a State Labor Colony for vagr, tramps, and confirmed inebriates would relieve our jails and poor farms of this class and require them to assist in th»-ir support and form habits of industry and sobriety. My idea is that they should be committed to the institution indefinitely and remain there until those in charge considered that their discharge would not be a burden upon society. From continual and excessive drinking many people have brain sieknes^ BOOM violent and allusive, and with their liberty unrestrained »re dangerous to those with whom they come in contact. </seg>

It is safe to say that fifteen (15) per cent of the population of the institutions previously named are there through resultant effects from syphilis. E study and observation 1 am satisfied that venereal \ outnumber tuberculosis diseases five to one, and are e grave in their results upon children and adults. I eminent physician in New York state, in an address be - le State Conference of Charities and Corrections of that among other things, said. "It is inconsistent to placard a in which there is a case of (ierinan measles and to refuse cally to do anything to protect the public from the ?s of syphilis and gonorrhea." Kher physician went a step farther and advocated a law would require physicians to report cases of venereal s to the public health authorities for registration. Iiw requiring persons who applied for a marriage license sent a certificate from a duly licensed physician, showing freedom from venereal diseases, would certainly tend to the spread of the disease. I following was an actual occurrence in this state: A t at one of our insane hospitals died after being there a onths.

            <seg id="p012">12 NEBRASKA STATE BOARD Jails and Lockups. Jails and lockups are about the same thing the country over, as I have visited them in other states and find but little differ - ence. Some are mere pens, often located in dark, low base - ments, without modern sanitary conditions, and where the sun - light never enters. A few might be classed as models, being on first or second floors of buildings, with modern sanitary conditions and an abundance of light and fresh air, but the great majority are ordinary, with only medium accommoda - tions for light and ventilation, and many without city water or toilet accommodations, and with such conditions, of necessity unsanitary. One of the excuses offered for this condition of the county jails is that they are so seldom used. In Nebraska there are ninety -two counties, and about eighty of them have county jails, the most of which accommodate one or more prisoners during the year. In not more than half a dozen of these counties are there over 100 prisoners during the Douglas county, in which is Omaha, the metropolis of the state, containing one-eighth of the population of the state, and large railroad and manufacturing industries and live stock packing institutions, had over 1,400 prisoners during the past year, and in all the other jails of the counties there were less than 2,600 during the year, making a total of about 6,000 pris - oners in the county jails. In asking for a census of all the county jails on a certain date. 1 found there were about 250 prisoners held on that date. Ba discussions by social service clubs and conferen es and correction and prison reform movements, a new dawning upon us as to the construction of jails along •y lines. Several counties adopted propositions at the •ction for the erection of new jails. One of the best maintained and conducted jails in this state has about 200 prisoners during the year, nine one year on a certain date and fifteen the next, or an average of twelve pris- </seg>

This in opportunity For a classification of tin* prisoners, separ - ating the hardened criminals from young and first-time offend - ers. This jail is always found bright and clean, the prisoners doing all the laundry and kitchen work, take care of the build - : the large lawn ami Bower i&gt;eus m tne court house square, and assist in the janitor work. 1 speak of this one in particular because I considdcr it one of the l&gt;est regulated and managed jails in the state. There are in this state also about 2iM) city jails or lockups. Many of these resemble stalls or pens and are provided with v.-ry little, it any. accommodations for the prisoners. As a rule they are much more unsanitary than the eounty jails. About 20. (MM) prisoners are thrown into these places during the a large number of them being arrested for drunkenness or vagrancy, and are held only a few hours; many of whom are tramps. The overcrowded city jail creates conditions more appalling than those found in county jails. A workhouse or farm, that would give employment to short-timers, would help to solve the problem of making indus - trious persons out of many of these, who. without such environ - ment, are bound later to become vicious criminals. ■ins state one ot the duties of the judge of the district is to prescribe rules and regulations for jails upon the ing: The cleanliness of the prison and prisoner, classification of :iers, lighting and ventilation, the employment of medical and surgical aid when necessary, employment of insp»" supplying of every prisoner with a Bible, the punishment of prisoners tor violation of rules of the prison, and such other r. -filiations as the judge may deem necessary to promote the welfare of said prisoner, providing that said rules shall not be contrary to the laws of the state. A copy of the rules so prescribed shall be delivered by the countv commissioners to the sheriff, who shall cause a copy of ■nifi rules to be posted up and continued in some conspicuous </seg>

From our visitation of jails we are of the opinion tluit some of the nWcril who are charged with this duty have been negligent, or some miscreant has removed tliese rules, for we have noticed then in only h small per cent of the jails, and invarialily where we have found llit-iu they have beea in better condition. ..■ .nidges have taken Occasion to go further in the in; # &gt;f humanity than simply prescribing rules. I call to mind u MB where a judge had sentenced ;i woman to serve a jail Me, but after visit ing the jail of the county, directed tin - journal entry amended in the case to show that when that comity provided a suitable place for incarcerating a woman !ier jail sentence should begin, and until then she was rel the custody of the sheriff. !»■ -his county has just completed a million dollar court house and jail, the jail occupying the upper or fifth Moor, with Mi area of about S6.000 square feet, lias cells for the accoimuo- B of 180 men and forty-two women. The male and female departments are separated by several rooms which will be used for laundry purpose*, linen, packages, visitors' corridor, and - for the jailer and matron, and two large rooms for .'iivenile court purposes. Kvery cell has stationary wash bow! ■ad toilet, and is provided with hot and cold water, and ■ ti-iii of ventilation which changes the air in all the cells every y minutes. Cement and steel make up the entire ■fracture, and the steel used is of the latest unproved quality The location of the jail gives the greatest advantage poaaible for light and fresh air. and at the same time decreases the op - portunity for escape. From observation 1 am certain that jail deliveries have a tendency to increase the criminal tendencies in the individual, and that more precaution should be taken ii. their construction, so as to make them as nearly as possible • proof. Poor Farms. Keports received from the \arious counties for one JFCM that fift ! the ninety-two counties of the stat. </seg>
            <seg id="p015">CHARITIES AND CORRECTION 15 persons during the year, .and besides this, over 1,300 people received outside aid from the counties. The cost of maintain - t these fifty different poor farms is about $150,000.00. uglas county alone cared for 1,741 at a cost of $65,000.00. The law of our state providing for county poor farms has the distinction of being one of its most ancient, having been passed in its present form in territorial days by the legislature of 1866. It has not been improved upon or amended except by an addition of two sections, which relate to care and education of children. At our poor farms we find two general classes — the defective nd the dependent. In the defective group there are the in - sane, feeble-minded, blind, deaf and dumb, and epileptics. In le dependent group there are those on account of sickness, isease, poverty, old age, and deformity. The make-up of lese groups without classification makes it necessary for the constant association of the idle and industrious, the weak - minded and intelligent, the vulgar and the decent. If these county poor farms must continue it is only fair to ie refined and unfortunate poor to whom misfortune has come fter a life of toil, that they should be free from the humilia - on and demoralizing conditions that exist in many of these Imshouses or county poor farms. If in some way provision utside of our poor farms cannot be made for the idle, idiotic nd vicious, some thought should be given to classification. Except for the provision made for soldiers and sailors, their ives or widows, there is in this state no public hospitals px - ept for the insane or crippled children. Our poor farms are ■quired to receive many who are sorely in need of special ttention and nursing, and as a rule they have no equipment to ender this service. The most sacred place to any one, whether rich or poor, is home; so we should give to theie people not only food and rlothing, but with that provide such comforts as will make them feel that they have indeed a home and not a charitable nstitution. </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 NKHRASKA STATE HOARD Of places we have visited outside of the state for the public care of the poor, the oue that appealed most strongly to us was ;:t the Cooley Farms at Cleveland, where the city has a tract of Marty 2,000 acres of high rolling land. At these farms are located the infirmary or alinshouse. tubercular sanitorium, cor - u farm or workhouse, and a municipal cemetery. The infirmary or alinshouse consists of a vast building surrounding :ral court of nearly half an acre, in which are tiower beds aud fountains. On the day of our visit we found over M hundred (700) inmates. An inscription on one of the arches that seemed very suggestive was that "Soldiers of industry should have protection the same as soldiers of war." E; located on this large tract of land, there is ample op - ty for the employment of those who are able to perform On the sides of the building surrounding the court is a porch over twenty feet wide, with a cement Hoor. Iistiuctive feature is a separate building for the Home for Couples. The eight rooms on the first Hoor have outside h windows, giving the effect in the summer t iin«- of a OMjjr ;e by itself. This is to be their humble home togeth' is both shall live. There are eight rooms on the second ivhich can be used when needed. The motto of the home o lose money is better than to lose love." The poor farms of Nebraska represent an investment of nearly a million dollars, and the average number receiving ;it the poor farm, outside of Douglas county, would \&lt; than nine to each institution. If the amount of money in\ in these poor farms were transferred into a half dozen modern district homes, to care for the people now at the poor farms, it would be sufficient to arrange for several buildings at each of them where the inmates could be classified as to character and conduct, and receive much more consideration than under the present plan. This would furnish a home when the normal, unfortunate person, "who had fought and lost in the battle of could spend their remaining days in bonu:-like surround I believe this subject should have tin* consideration ol the lawmakers in the near future. </seg>

The amount of money required for the ■rvics of a probation officer in each county would be judici - laly expended. A graduated salary could be provided. for the ifferent counties in proportion to their population, which •ould not necessarily need to make it burdensome in counties with a small population.

Bir last legislature passed an indeterminate sentence and le law, and by this act lias permitted Nebraska to join with •ge number of the other states in what, in my opinion, is a : sane method in dealing with those possessed of criminal encies. A person may commit a crime because he is lacking in the ••leinents of self-control: such a person should have custodial .arc under proper influeMccs. How long such care will be re - quired for him to acquire that control no jury or judge at the time of trial is able to determine, and if not competent to do so. why permit the fixing of an exact time when such a person should be given his liberty I Under our present law the minimum term for the various offenses is a sufficient length of time to have ascertained I thing about his previous life, character and tendencies of his relatives or others with whom he has associated, and whether during this time he has acquired a desire to reform. Without determinate sentence the prisoner knows that it is up to him to make good. A perusal of the statistics showing the re - sults from the operation of this law during the little over six- </seg>

Professor Frank W. Booth, Superintendent. This institute was provided by the legislature of 1869. Dur - ing the first school year 12 pupils were enrolled; the number of all those who have attended this school is at date 870. At the beginning of this biennium there were 178 pupils. The treatment given pupils is such that they become most attached to the institution, and regret leaving it for their homes for summer vacation. What can be accomplished for the otherwise normal deaf child is surely a revelation. We realize this when we hear those who never heard a sound recite in a modulated voice. The present superintendent, being a strong advocate of the law in force relative to teaching the aural method, is carrying out the intentions of the law in the primary departments, and that it may be continued throughout the school course, he believes that another building should he provided, so that those given the aural training could be thus segregated and separated from the environment of those using to a large degree the sign or manual method. During the present biennium the auditorium and gymnasium building has been completed, which not only adds to the enter - tainment, but to the development of the children. On my last visit I was favorably impressed with the industrial work in the carpenter shop. Hat racks, stands, tables, and many other articles of value are being made by the pupils under a com pt-tent graduate from one of the leading manual training schools of our country. The cheerful and contented dispositions shown by the chil dw speaks volumes of praise for the management and untiring patience of a well equipped corps of teachers, and the result has been tin- bringing of light am 1 sunshine into lives which till JJ ill OIIlt*rW lor liH \ C Dctrll cl IJlclIlH. </seg>

Both arc cheerful and express high hopes as to what they will be able to do for their own support in the near future. This custom of permitting the pupils any profit arising from the sale of their work prevails in all the in - dustrial departments. With the boys this is principally from the sale of their brooms, hammocks, and fly nets for hones, while the girls' profits arise principally from the sale of fancy embroidery and needle work, bead work, raffia baskets, etc. </seg>
