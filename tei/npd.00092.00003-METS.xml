         <seg id="p002">SUMMARY 1926-1930 and 1932-1936, points out the following facts: Ihe equipment expense per acre was higher during the first than the second period for all tenures, owners, part-owners, and tenants. =&gt; Ai i£T nsei. per acr^ for P 3""™"1"3 «*s «¦» for the first period and 51.02 for Ac second period, as compared with $2.03 and $1.47 for owners and $1.99 and $1.19 for tenants, respectively. The cause for the wu^T °" Part-°wner farms was largely their greater acreage. When iarms were analyzed according to sizes, tenants were found to have the lowest equipment expense per acre on all except the largest farms: part-owners had the highest expense on farms less than 161 acres in size Ihere was a decline in the equipment expense per acre for each kind %T XJ r°, m the smaJlest to the iargest farms " each period. Ihe higher eqmpment expense per acre during the first period was due to a larger investment in equipment and to smaller-sized farms than were found in the second period. The first period was a time of in creased use of automotive farm machinery and each kind of tenure in - creased its investment in this type of equipment. During the second period adverse crop conditions caused farmers to buy less machinery and to reduce equipment expenses although near the dose of the period d.sease among horses and shortage of feed again caused many farmers to turn to tractors for farm power </seg>
         <seg id="p003">J Equipment Expense per Acre on Farms j; in Nebraska : 1926-1930 and 1932-1936 ARTHUR W. MEDLAR 1 ' PART 1—1926-1930 ?'¦ The purpose of this study was to ascertain the equipment expense i per acre for groups of farms of various sizes for three different kinds of land tenure. The period covered was five years, 1926 to 1930. The .farm tenures were designated as owner, part-owner, and tenant. The ' source of data used was account books kept by farmers. These data were gathered and recorded by the Department of Rural Economics and the Agricultural Extension Service. Each record covered a farm business ; ior one year. From some farms, records were secured for only one year; j from other farms, records were secured for two or more years. From j this explanation it may be clearly seen that the number of records and the number of farms were not necessarily the same. -The records were classified in six groups according to size of farm: (1) less than 81 acres, (2) 8l! to 160 acres, (3) 161 to 240 acres, (4) 241 to 400 acres, (5) 401 to 800| acres, and (6) over 800 acres. ; Certain terms used in this bulletin may be defined as follows: An! owner is a man who owns and operates his own farm. A part-owner is an owner who rents additional land and operates it \ ; with His own as a single farm unit. "¦¦ A tenant operates land owned by another person. Fai;mcapital is the value of the farm assets at the beginning of the year. Its main are land, buildings (except dwellings), livestock, equipment, and feed and supplies. : The farm operators' capital is the value of the items mentioned above, whichl are owned by the operator. Investment in equipment is the book value of equipment at the be - ginning of the year. , . . .'..¦,¦. The equipment expense for the farm is the beginning inventory plus the value of machinery bought, of repairs for tractors, trucks, and general farm equipment, and one-half of the expense for fuel, oil, repairs, and license 1 for the'automobile minus the closing inventory, the income from equipment hiredout, and the income from sale or exchange of any . farm equipment. "¦¦[.. The investment and expense are taken from the farmers records. Interest on the equipment investment is calculated at 6 per cent on the inventory value and added to the book expense to determine the total expense per acre. No| charge is included for housing, insurance, or taxes. Fain and Minor of Georgia found that taxes equaled one per cent of the inventory value. 2) Davidson of lowa allowed two per cent of the 'Hit study mi undertakenwith the aid of student help furnished by the federal NYA prosram. - 'John R.

         <seg id="p004">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 319 inventory value to cover housing and insurance.3 These rates, totaling three per cent of the equipment investment, would probably be a fair charge under Nebraska conditions. The expense per acre without interest is found by dividing the expense per farm by the number of acres per farm. The expense per acre with interest is found by adding to the above expense 6 per cent of the equipment investment per acre per farm.

There was a gradual increase in the number of records from 112 in 1926 to 944 in 1930. There was also a continuous in - crease in the number of records in each tenure during the period.

There were so few records in Group 1 for part-owners that conclusions based on that group are likely to be less reliable than conclusions for other groups. Records from owner farms constituted 29 per cent, part-owners 32, and tenants 39 per cent of the 2,096 records. The percentage distribution of records according to the size of farms was as follows: Less than 81 acres 3.5 per cent; 81 to 160 acres 25.4 per cent; 161 to 240 acres 25.4 per cent; 241 to 400 acres 29.1 per cent; 401 to 800 acres 10.9 per cent; and over 800 acres 5.7 per cent. The acres per farm, operators' capital, and equipment investment and expense for each of the kinds of tenure are given in Tables 3, 4, and 5. The capital is an indication of the operators' investment, which varied from 1926 to 1930. la the less-than-81-acre group the owners' and the tenants' capital decreased in amount each year except 1927 to 1928.

         <seg id="p008">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 319 study the trend of the farmers' investment in equipment. There was j general tendency for owners to increase their equipment investment from 1926 to 1928, decrease it in 1929, and increase it again in 1930. Some exceptions to this tendency occurred on farms of 81 to 160 acres for 1929 and 1930 and on farms o( 401 to 800 acres for 1927. The part - owners increased their equipment investment in much the same manner throughout the period as did the owners. There were some years when they bought little or no machinery in some of the groups. Examples may be cited in groups operating 81 to 160 acres and 241 to 400 acres in 1929 and in groups operating 161 to 240 and 401 to 800 acres in 1928. The variations in the increase in equipment investment among the tenants were much the same as for the other two kinds of tenure. The equip - ment investment per farm was greater at the close of the period than at the beginning for all tenures in every size of farm group. This in - dicates increased purchases of machinery over the entire five-year period. There was a tendency for equipment expense per farm and per acre in each tenure to increase from 1926 to 1929 and then to decrease. Figure 1 shows the equipment expense per acre for different tenures and sizes of farms. The position on the chart shows that there was a tendency for equipment expense per acre to decrease as the farms increased in size. The figure also shows that there was a general tendency for equipment ex - pense per acre to increase up to 1929 and then to decrease. Most of the exceptions to this tendency were the result of an increased investment in equipment for the year or of insufficient data. The high and the low equipment expense per acre varied among the different size groups for the different tenures. Data in Table 6 show the highest expense per acre for tenants in the less-than-81-acre group and the lowest cost for tenants in the over-800-acre group the same year. The data also show that the highest equipment expense per acre occurred in Equipment eipenso per acre. Owneri $b.OO •—~.Part-oi»nar« s_2j.

The low equipment expense per acre was found on the tenant farms for all group sizes except the iess-thari-81-acre group, where owners had the least expense. i Table 6. — The relation of size of farm to high andlow equipment expense \ ¦ : I .'-" . ¦ :"• :; per acre. \ ' High expense per acre Low expense per acre Size . ¦ , ¦ i . ¦¦I Tenure | Year J Amount Tenure | Year (Amount Less [than 81 Tenants 1928 $5.58 Owners j 1927 $1.71 81 to 160........Part-owners 1928 2.99 Tenants; 1926 1.17 161 to 240.

The effect of these variations on equipment expense per farm and per acre may be illustrated by the group operjting 161 to 240 acres. The investment on owner farms increased for , ; three successive years, and then decreased one year and increased again in 1530. The equipment expense per farm and per acre followed the same trend except in. 1930. The'larger equipment investment that year did not increase the equipment expense per farm as it had in previous years but the larger number of acres per farm did decrease the equip - ment] expense per acre. The; tenants' equipment investment per farm in the same group in - , creasedieach year except 1928. The equipment expense per farm and per acre increased each year except 1930, when| both decreased. The de - crease in the expense per acre, was the result jof a greater decrease in the equipment expense per farm than in the size of farm. Although the equipment investment in 1928 was below that of the previous year, both the equipment expense per farm and per acre increased as a result of i greater expenditures for repairs and other equipment expense. T|he part-owner farms had the same trend in equipment investment as did tenant farms, but a more. irregular equipment cost per acre. When the equipment investment increased in 1927 the equipment expense per farm decreased because of less repair and other expense, and the • equipment expense per acre decreased because there was only a slight decrease in the acres per farm. The following year the investment de - . creased, the acres per farm increased, and the equipment expense per farml increased in part because o£ depreciation j expense. The result was an increase of 41 per cent in the equipment expense per acre over the previous yean .. .¦'• '-','_: -X:: "-. :.'-:~: .¦.¦(;;:;:. ; ¦ ; -¦'. '¦: . </seg>

Since depreciation, repairs, i fuel, oil, and blacksmithing depend largely upon the amount and value of machinery, it follows that there would be the same tendency for equipment expense to increase. With no marked change in the size of fa'nris in any of the different size groups the expense per acre conse - quently increased during the period/Farmers curtailed equipment expense in 1930 and this reduced the equipment expense per acre and accounted for the one year when equipment expenses per farm and per acre did not follow the same trend as equipment investment per farm. </seg>

         <seg id="p016">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 319 PART H—1932-1936 This study covers the five-year period 1932-1936. There were 4,588 farm records, more than twice as many as there were for the 1926-1930 period. The first part will show the relation of size of farm and tenure to equipment expense for different tenures and for the state as a whole. The second part will show similar relations for seven of the nine type-of - farming areas of the state. The number of records by year and tenure are given in Table 9.

The smallest numbers of records from owners and part-owners were obtained in 1933 and from tenants in 1932. The records were divided among the tenures as follows: owners 26.1 per cent, part-owners 31.9 per cent, and tenants 42.0 per cent.

The part-owners' capita) decreased in 1935 as a result of a smaller investment in grain and livestock. There was a general tendency for capital to decrease in each for the 401-to-800 and over-800-acre groups from 1932 to 1934 and to increase to 1935. Owners' farm capital decreased from 1935 to 1936 in both size groups. Part-owners' and tenants' capital increased in the 401-to - -800 and decreased in the over-800-acre groups from 1935 to 1936. The change in capital throughout the period was influenced less by a change in land values than by the change in investment in equipment, livestock, and grains. The investment in equipment throughout the period had a tendency to follow much the same trend as capital per farm, although there were exceptions for some years. There was a general decrease in the equip - ment investment of owners from 1932 to 1934 on all sizes of farms ex - cept those under 8! acres and an increase from 1935 to 1936 in all groups except the 81-to-160 and 161-to-240-acre groups. The investment in equip - ment was less at the close of the period than at the beginning except in the less-than-81-acre group. This indicates that owners as a group were not purchasing much machinery during the period until 1936. The part - owners' investment followed much the same trend as that for owners. The increase during the last two years through the purchase of new equipment did not offset the loss for the first three years because of depre - ciation. In every group size the equipment investment in 1936 was less than in 1932. The tenants' investment in equipment generally decreased from 1932 to 1934 and increased to 1936. Exceptions were in the 81-to - -160-acre size for 1936, due in part to a decrease in size of farm, and in the 241-to-400 and the over-800-acre size for 1935, due again in part to change in size of farm. Tenants had a larger investment in equipment in the less-than-81-acre size at the close of the five-year period than at the beginning, but a smaller investment in all other size groups. The equipment expense per farm followed very closely the trend of equipment investment per farm for the three tenures in the six size groups. The trend of equipment cost per acre without interest for each tenure in all groups is shown in Figure 4. Owners' expense per acre tended to decrease from 1932 to 1934 and to increase to 1936. Exceptions were found m the less-than-81-acre size in 1934 and 1935 and in the 401 - -to-800-acre size in 1934, due to a change in equipment investment. The equipment expense per acre in the over-800-acre size did not follow the trend of the other groups, largely because of variations in the size of ioT" 7 rtoWncrj' equipment expense per acre decreased from 1932 to 1934 and increased to 1936 in the three size groups between 161 and 800 acres.

In the smallest-sized group the higher expense resulted from a larger investment and a larger equipment expense per farm. In the next size group it resulted from fewer acres and a greater equipment expense per farm. The equipment ¦ expense per acre was highest for owners in the other four size groups. The higher expense in the 161-to-240 and in the 241-to-400-acre groups was caused by a larger investment in equipment and a larger equipment expense per farm than for either tenants or part owners. The equipment expense in the 401-to-800-acre size was practically the same for owners and part owners. Owners had larger farms, less investment in equipment, and more equipment expense per farm than part-owners. As a result of a combination of these three factors the owners had one cent per acre more expense than part owners. The equipment expense per acre in the over-800-acre size was practically the same for all tenures, being only ; one cent per acre less for part-owners than for the other two tenures. Part-owners had larger farms, more invested in equipment, and a greater equipment expense per farm than either owners or tenants.

         <seg id="p024">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 319 The percentages in Table 16 show the relation between the equipment investment per farm and the equipment expense per farm without and with interest charges. Equipment expense without interest was 27 per cent of the investment on owner farms in the less-than-81-acre group. The percentage decreased in the next two size groups and then increased as farms increased in size, reaching 35 per cent of the investment for farms over 800 acres. The per cent decreased from the Jess than 81 acres to the 241 to 400 acre group of the pan-owner farms, then increased to 32 per cent for the farms over 800 acres in size. The per cent decreased from the less than 81 acres to the 81 to 160 acre group of the tenant farms and then increased for each succeeding group size. There was a tendency for expense without interest to be around 25 per cent of the equipment investment in the groups under 400 acres and around 33 per cent in the groups over 400 acres. When the interest charge was included the per - centage increased to about 31 per cent in the first four groups and about 38 per cent in the last two groups. These percentages are somewhat lower for the 1932-1936 period than for the 1926-1930 period, partly because o£ a lower equipment expense during the second period and a larger invest - ment in equipment during the first period. The size of farm, capital, equipment investment, and expense per farm and the equipment expense per acre without and with interest are given in Table 17 for the periods 1926-1930 and 1932-1936 for each size of farm in the study. The equipment expense per acre with and without interest was least for the part-owners in each five-year period and for the average of the ten years in the study. The part-owners had the largest investment in equipment and the largest equipment expense per farm.

         <seg id="p025">i' Equipment Expense per Acre on Farms in Nebraska largest. The equipment expense per acre on owners' farms was greater than! on tenants' farms. Their farms averaged 25. acres larger in the 192^-30 period and 4 acres larger in the years 1932-1936 but this difference in size was not enough to onset the disadvantage of larger investments and (greater expenses per farm. The data in the table indicate that part - owners, as a group, make more efficient use of their capital in equipment thaneither the owners or the tenants. Although they have a larger investment in equipment and a greater equipment expense per farm, they operate more acres and thereby reduce their equipment expense per acre below that of either owners or tenants. The second division of the study for the years 1932 to 1936 is based on the same records that were used in the first part of. the study. It is o£ economic interest to know whether owners, part-owners, or tenants have the largest equipment expense per acre in the various size groups in the different type-of-farming areas. The most economical size of farm does not'always have the same number of acres in different type-of-farming areas.; Tenants have a tendency to rent farms which will utilize their labor! and equipment most profitably and part-owners rent other land in order- to adjust the size of their farms in a Way that will get the most out jof their available resources, including equipment, which they find necessary for operating the land they own. Owners have a tendency to invest more money in equipment, and thereby increase their equipment expense, as they - are financially able to purchase equipment which may relieve manual labor. The adjustments which are made by the different tenures are not all made at the same time. That is a problem, which is solved by the individual, but when farms are considered as a group each kind of tenure meets its own problem when encountered. The data in Table 18 show the number and size of farms in seven type^of-fanning areas. Owners in Area 183 A had slightly larger farms in the less-than-81-acre size than either part owners or tenants. Tenants had die largest farms and part-owners the smallest farms in the 81-to-160 - -acre size. Part-owners had the largest and tenants the smallest farms in the 161-to-240-acre size although there was little difference in size of farms in the various tenures.: Owners had the largest farms and.tenants the 'smallest in the 241-to-400-acre size group. Part owners had the largest and owners the smallest farms in the 401 to 800-acre size. In connection with the data just given for Area 183 A the data in Table 19 show I the amount of equipment expense per farm and per acre. The owners had the highest equipment expense per farm and per acre in the less-than-81-acre group. The tenants' equipment expense per farm and per kcre were less than for either the owners or part-owners in die 81 - -to-160-acre group. The owners had the highest equipment expense per farm [and per acre in this group. The cause of their high equipment expense per acre was an increase in equipment expense per farm without a corresponding increase in acres per farm. Part-owners' equipment expense per acre was higher than for tenants and less than for owners. The difference in the size of farms among the tenures was only two acres but </seg>

Tenants with smaller farms kept both the equipment expense per farm and per acre below either owner or part-owner in the 241-to-400-acre and the 401-to-800-acre sizes. Area 145 represents a more intensive type of farming, especially on farms of 160 acres or under, than Area 183 A. Tenant farms are 10 per cent larger than owner or part-owner farms in the less-than-81-acre size. The tenants had the least equipment expense per acre on farms, largely because their equipment expense per farm was 65 per cent of the owners' and only 37 per cent of the part-owners' expense. The owner farms in the 81-to-160-acre size were the largest and their equipment expense per acre was more than for tenants and less than for part owners.

         <seg id="p030">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 319 Enough data have been presented to show that different tenures have a tendency to group in size and equipment expenses as a result of the efforts and ability of owners, part-owners, or tenants to make adjustments between land, labor, and equipment. Tenants did not rent many small or many very large farms; they kept their equipment expense per farm and per acre lowest in practically all group sizes in all type-o£-farming areas. Owners, because of large investments in equipment and smaller farms than part owners, had higher equipment expense per acre. Part - owners reduced their equipment expense per acre below the owners, especially in the 241-to-400-acre and 401-to-800-acre groups in the same areas by an increased size of farm and a decreased equipment expense per I arm.
