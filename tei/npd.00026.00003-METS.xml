            <seg id="p007">GENERAL REVIEW REORGANIZATION The Commission was reorganized January 8. 1909, by the election of Commissioner Henry T. Clarke, Jr.. as chairman. \V. II. Cowgill of Holdrege loeeaeded Omhumm .1. A. Williams, having been elected November '.i, 1908, for a full term of &gt;ix years. All employes appointed at the organization, of the (Vcimission, together with those subsequently chosen, were con - tinued in service. The office force is at present constituted as follows: Henry T. Clarke, Jr., chairman; Dr. II. J. Winnett. W. II. Cowgill, commissioners; Clark Perkins, secretary; U. G. Powell, rate elerk ; Gertrude C. Wells, reporter; O. D. Boyer, chief clerk- C. W. Spears, clerk; Emma M. Doyle, Violet M. Martin, stenographers. tMiss Mabel Wilson, who had been employed as stenographer •tit-ally since the organization of the department, died Xo - ber 12, 1909. The Commission passed a resolution of regret November 30, 1909, the text of which will be found in t III. of this report.

Senate File No. 133 — To provide for the physical valuation of railroads and other public service corporations in Nebraska by the State Railway Commission, defining such corporations, and providing for the employment of clerical and expert help and the manner in which the expenses incurred shall be paid. Senate File No. 143 — To require railway companies, express companies and telegraph companies to furnish reasonably ade - quate telephone connections between their offices, buildings and grounds and public telephone exchanges operating in towns where such offices, buildings and grounds are located, and giving the State Railway Commission power to require such service to be furnished. t Senate File No. 2."&gt;."&gt; — To provide for transfer facilities by mon carriers at track crossings at grade, determining how expenses of such track crossings shall be paid, and giving State Railway Commission power of enforcement. Senate File No. 339 — To require all railroads in Nebraska operating gasoline motor trains or gasoline motor cars to main- K separate closets for men and women on the same, and rate smoking apartments, and giving the State Railway mission power of enforcement. ■ The Commission in its First Annual Report recommended following changes in the Railway Commission Act : II. Provision that all moneys turned into the treasury as s collected by this department be appropriated for the use the department in addition to other appropriations. 2. Provision for trips of inspection authorized by subdi - vision i, section 2, and a systematic physical valuation of rail - road properties. 3. Amendment of subdivision o, section 2, to include all </seg>
            <seg id="p009">9 Kaon carriers under the jurisdiction of the Commission in statistical report required to be made annually to the rnor. 4. Elimination of item 11, subdivision o, section 2, re - quiring a statement in the annual report of "the average amount of tonnage that can be carried over each road in the state with an engine of given power." ■ 5. Amendment of subdivision a, section 5, to provide for answer in writing or satisfaction of a complaint as to rates re assigning a date for hearing thereon. 6. Extension of time for filing reports by common carriers, for year ending June 30th, from August 1st to September 1st; broadening the scope of section 9 requiring such reports to specifically include and call for detailed information applicable to express companies, telegraph companies, telephone companit's, street car companies, sleeping car companies, and all other car - riers within the jurisdiction of the Commission : elimination of certain impracticable, useless and burdensome items called for in such reports, and the substitution of others whose value has been demonstrated. 7. Amendment of subdivision b, section 10, by requiring parties to any proceeding before the Commission, who desire to appeal from an order entered under such section, to do so within a specified time, and providing that upon default of such action, the order shall become final. t8. Provision for the protection of the Commission in the cise of certain powers in case the Supreme Court should ain the contention that it is limited in the exercise of such ers by specific legislation, regardless of the genera] grant erred by the constitutional amendment under which it was ted. 9. Extension of the Commission's powers to include the awarding of reparation in cases where rates eharged are found to be excessive or discriminatory. (See order of the Coauui in the matter of formal complaint No. 41, Snnmel Katz et al v. C , St. P., M. &amp; O. Ry. Co., in Part III. of this report.) tlO. Amendment of subdivision b. section 2, to include the lation of rates and charges of common carriers other than e engaged in the transportation of freight or passengers, is needed for the protection of the Commission in the exer - of authority over telephone and telegraph companies in the contention referred to above, that it is limited by ific legislation, should be sustained by the Supreme Court. 11. Amendment of subdivision g, section 14, to provide that certain exceptions may be made under the anti-discrimina - tion statute in favor of other classes of traffic than freight, pro - vided the legislature should consider such exceptions desirable. 12. Amendment of subdivision c, section 15, to provide that </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 no new rate, schedule or classification may be made effective until approved by the Commission. 13. Provision for the creation of the office of public weighmaster. K14. Provision for expediting the settlement of claims for damage and overcharge by railroad and express companies. With the exception of the recommendations as to physical valuation and settlement of claims, the legislature did not see fit to carry into effect any of the above suggestions. The Com - mission is still impressed with the desirability of many of these changes, and again calls them to public attention in the hope that the legislature of 1911 will enact some, if not all of them, into law. After these recommendations had been formulated and transmitted to the Governor and the legislature, the fact was brought forcibly to the attention of the Commission that the Railway Commission Act is defective in another important par - ticular, to-wit : Subdivision f of section 14 prohibits false bill - ing, false classification and false weighing by railway companies and common carriers, and provides for the punishment of officers, employes or agents responsible therefor, but it does not apply to shippers guilty, of such offenses. At the request of the Com - mission, a bill was drawn by the Attorney General for the pur - pose of correcting this defect, and was sent to the Governor on March 4, 1909, after the time for introduction of bills by members had expired, with request that a special message be transmitted to the legislature, recommending its passage, bul in the rush of business attendant upon the close of the session. the matter was lost sight of and the bill was not introduced. Other complaints have since been made to the Commission on this account, and we are now more than ever convinced of the ne - cessity of such amendment as will effectually prohibit this per- Iious practice on the part of shippers, as well as on the part the carriers. The injustice to the carrier, which is liable to ere punishment for the same offense, and to business com - itors of unscrupulous shippers, is manifest. Wholesome re - ts would doubtless follow the incorporation into the state r of a provision similar to paragraph 3, section 10, of the eral Act to Regulate Commerce, which is as follows: "Any person and any officer or agent of any corporation or company who shall deliver property for transportation to </seg>
            <seg id="p011">11 any common carrier, subject to the provisions of this act, or for whom as consignor or consignee any such carrier shall trans - port property, who shall knowingly and wilfully, by false bill - ing, false classification, false weighing, false representation of the contents of the package, or false report of weight, or by any other device or means, whether with or without the con - sent or connivance of the carrier, its agent or agents, obtain transportation for such property at less than the regular rates then established and in force on the line of transportation shall be deemed guilty of fraud, which is hereby itonlmnd to be a misdemeanor, and shall, upon conviction thereof in any court of the United States of competent jurisdiction within the dis - trict in which such offense was committed, be subject for each offense to a fine of not exceeding five thousand dollar imprisonment in the penitentiary for a term of not exceeding two years, or both, in the discretion of the court." The obscurity of the law with reference to the jurisdiction of the Commission over other carriers than railroad companies is constantly being pointed out by litigants, particularly in matters affecting telegraph companies, telephone companies and street car companies. A cast- is now pending in the Supreme Court (Western Union Telegraph Co. v. State of Nebraska) in which the contention is raised that on account of this ob - scurity the Commission has no control over the rates of tele - graph companies. While this point is likely to be decided before another legislature convenes, there are numerous other discrepancies in the law, so far as it affects street railway companies, express companies, car companies, sleeping car com - panies, telegraph companies and telephone companies which should be corrected by the inclusion at proper places of terms and provisions relating specifically to such companies. Another matter to which attention should be called at this time, in order that it .may be corrected, is a mysterious change of the anti-pass law by the last legislature, whereby it is made necessary for the state to prove the use, as well as the accept - ance, of a pass in order to secure conviction. This result was accomplished by the simple expedient of changing the phrase "accept or use" to read "accept and use." The Commission is advised that several prosecutions have already been dismissed on account of the impossibility of proving the use, as well as the acceptance, of the pass. In its original form the law </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 was effective in curbing the free pass evil, and insidious amend - ments should not be permitted to rob it of its vitality. Th» attention of the Commission has further been directed to the fact that, with the exception of grain elevators of a given capacity, shippers desiring track connections with any railroad company are entirely dependent upon the good will of the rail - road company, and in the event the railroads refuse to furnish them, no procedure or method is provided by law whereby such track connections can be secured. In this connection, your at - tention is directed to the provisions of the Minnesota and fed - eral statutes covering the question. Paragraph 6 of Section 1 of the federal Act to Regulate Commerce, as amended June 29. 1906, provides: "Any common carrier subject to the provisions of this ac upon application of any lateral, branch line of railroad, or o any shipper tendering interstate traffic for transportation, sha construct, maintain, and operate upon reasonable terms a switc connection with any such lateral, branch line of railroad, o private sidetrack which may be constructed to connect with i railroad, where such connection is reasonably practicable am can be put in with safety and will furnish sufficient business to justify the construction and maintenance of the same ; anc shall furnish cars for the movement of such traffic to the bes of its ability without discrimination in favor- of or against an such shipper. If any common carrier shall fail to install ant operate any such switch or connection as aforesaid, on applica tion therefor in writing by any shipper, such shipper may mak complaint to the Commission, as provided in section 13 of th and the Commission shall hear and investigate the sam and shall determine as to the safety and practicability thereo and justification and reasonable compensation therefor and th Commission may make an order, as provided in section 15 o this act, directing the common carrier to comply with the pr visions of this section in accordance with such order, and sue order shall be enforced as hereinafter provided for the enforc ment of all other orders by the Commission, other than orders for the payment of money." tThe Commission, since the filing of its last report, ha &gt;me thoroughly convinced that so much of the presen utes as provides for appeals from orders of the Commissio matters pertaining to regulation of railroads and commo iers, and involving questions other than the reasonableness •ates, to the district court and from thence to the Suprem rt, should be so amended as to provide for appeals from th </seg>
            <seg id="p013">13 Commission, upon the evidence submitted to the Commission direct to the Supreme Court. Under the present practice, whe a complaint is filed with the Commission against a commo carrier in matters involving questions other than the reason ableness of rates, the Commission, after hearing and investig tion, makes its order. The enforcement of the order is suspendec by the mere filing of a petition in the district court of the stat or in the federal circuit court, whereupon the case is trie&lt; de novo, and from the judgment rendered either party ma appeal to the higher state or federal courts. The serious obje tions to such procedure are : First. Either party, and particularly the carriers, may see fit to withhold important evidence, which might have material weight with the Commission, in reaching its conclusion, and which the parties may intend to introduce upon appeal; or the defendant carriers may see fit to refrain from making any &lt;le - fense whatever in the hearing before the Commission. The effect in the latter case is to place the Commission on the same level with an examining magistrate in a preliminary hearing, and in the former case, where material evidence introduced for the first time on the trial in the court results in a reversal of the Commission's order, it reflects more or less upon the judg - ments of the Commission and raises a doubt as to its usefulness as an administrative and quasi-legislative department of our gov - ernment. Should the recommendations of the Commission in this respect be enacted into law, both parties to a controversy will, on an appeal, be required to stand on the evidence sub - mitted before the Commission, and will undoubtedly refrain from withholding any evidence in their possession material and necessary to a proper judgment. Second. The great, and what seems to he unnecessary. delay in securing a final judgment, which deters parties from prosecuting just complaints and amounts almost to a denial of justice. The case of Village of Hallam v. C, R. I. &amp; P. Ry. Co. (see pages 138-143, First Annual Report) furnishes an excellent illustration of the force of the Commission's position in this regard. The records of this department show that on July 1"\ 1908, the plaintiff in that action filed its petition before the Commission, setting forth that a street in the village of Hallam intersected and crossed the right-of-way and main line tracks </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 of the defendant and that the defendant company neglected, failed and refused to provide a suitable crossing as required by law. On August 24, 1908, a hearing was held and the order of the Commission issued August 29, 1908, directing the defend - ant to construct and maintain a proper crossing on or before Kraber 30, 1908. On September 29, 1908, the defendant its petition in the district court, objecting to the order e Commission. Notwithstanding the earnest efforts of the Commission and the Attorney General's office to secure a speedy f, as provided for by statute, the evidence was not taken the case submitted until January 8, 1909. This case is still ing in that court, as the judge has failed to hand down his ngs and enter judgment. When this shall occur, an appeal lies to the Supreme Court, which, if taken, will hardly ecided within a half year. We believe that the people of the state in adopting th constitutional amendment creating the Commission, and th legislature in prescribing the foregoing appellate procedur fully intended that citizens or localities suffering from the de linquencies or exactions of common carriers should be provide&lt; with an instrument whereby justice could be secured with minimum of expense and delay. The Commission and the Attorney General's office have taken an interest in seeing that the orders appealed from should receive the proper attention and be upheld when tried in the courts. This has added greatly to the expense and labors of both departments, and would be avoided if the Commission's recommendations are enacted into law. Another argument, which, while not an inducement, should ive its proper consideration, lies in the faet that if appeals from the orders of the Commission lay direct from the Com - mission to the state Supreme Court, aggrieved carriers would be prevented from transferring cases to the federal courts by appeal, where the still greater expense and delay involved have the further effect of discouraging the prosecuting of just grievances. It is illogical and incompatible with the scheme and policy of state government that the state regulation of its domestic commerce, or of the facilities of domestic commerce, may be </seg>
            <seg id="p015">15 transferred by appellate procedure to the federal courts, instead of to the state courts, at the direction of a common carrier. UNIFORM TELEPHONE ACCOUNTING. As a result of difficulty encountered in securing satisfactory reports from telephone companies, the Commission accepted an invitation to meet with the Nebraska Independent Telephone •iation at its annual convention in the assembly room of the Lindell hotel at Lincoln, on January ]."&gt;. 1 !&gt;&lt;)!». Following an extended discussion, the association appointed a committee i confer with the Commission on the subject, which, together h a committee representing the .Nebraska Telephone Com - iy, met in the Commission's office on January lflth and agreed &gt;n a plan whereby the Commission undertook to prepare a tative system of accounting to be considered in detail at a &gt;r conference. The Commission's plan was prepared and submitted at an - other meeting with the committee, held on April ltith. and. with certain minor modifications, was found acceptable to the tele - phone representatives. The results of the Commission \s labors were embodied in circular No. 37. prescribing a uniform classi - fication of accounts for telephone companies, issued May IS, 1909, and circular No. 39, explanatory thereof, issued July 1. 1909. These circulars were supplemented by a comprehensive system of blank forms, calculated to enable the telephone companies to carry into effect the ideas of the Commission. specimen sets being furnished to all applicants without charge. It is confidently believed that as a result of this work, the tele - phone business, particularly of the smaller companies of V bra.ska, will be established upon a more stable footing, anil that the intent of the law will be realized by enabling them to make comprehensive reports of their operations through the Commission to the public. CLASSIFICATION. Although several new classifications have been adopted in Western Classification territory since our last report, the Com- </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 Ion has seen fit to continue Western Classification No. 44, certain modifications (see general order No. 13 amended, III.), effective in Nebraska. This course was decided upon a series of hearings in which the carriers presented at h their reasons for desiring the new classifications adopted. As a result of this action, Nebraska shippers have been shielded from changes of classification which would have amounted, in the aggregate, to a 20 per cent, increase of the average carload minimum, and it is not believed that the interests of the carriers have suffered thereby. As a few specific instances of proposed changes which were prevented by this action may be cited the following: Agricultural Implements and Vehicles — Increase of carload minimum from 20,&lt;MH) pounds to 24,000 pounds. Brick and Hollow Building Tile — Increase of carload min - imum from 30,000 pounds to 40,000 pounds. Beer — Increase of carload minimum from 24,000 pounds to 28,000 pounds. Steel Culverts— Change of rating from second class, less carload, to double first class on certain grades, and from fourth class, carloads, with 20.000 pounds minimum, to fifth class with 30,000 pounds minimum. Canned Goods — Increase of carload minimum from 30,000 pounds to 36,000 pounds. Fodder Shredders — Increase of rating, less carloads, from third class to second class. KCorn Huskers and Shredders — Increase of rating, carloads, i fourth class with 14,000 pounds minimum to third class 12,000 pounds minimum. Fanning Mills. K. D. — Increase of carload and less carload rating from third class, minimum 16,000 pounds, to second class. minimum 20.000 pounds. Iron Oil Barrels — Increase of carload rating from class D to class B. K Creamery and Cheese Factory Apparatus — Increase of car - rating from class A with minimum of 20,000 pounds, to third class with minimum of 18,000 pounds. Butternuts, Black Walnuts, Cocoanuts, Hickory Nuts and Pecans — Increase of carload rating from class A to fourth class. Paper Pails, folded flat — Increase of carload rating from fifth class to fourth cl.i- Sheet Iron Pipe Lined with Cement — Increase of carload rating from class B to fifth class, and carload minimum from 24,000 pounds to 26,000 pounds. </seg>
            <seg id="p017">17 Galvanized Steel Tanks, nested — Increase of carload rating from fifth class to fourth class. Requirement to the effect that each package in all less carload shipments must lie plainly and indelibly marked, show - ing the name of the consignee and the name of the station, town nr «ity. and state, to which destined, and providing for the of pasted labels, cloth lin^d. metal or leather tags only. ■The compulsory use of a uniform bill of lading under which and damage claims must be presented to carriers within months after date of shipment. As a general proposition, the Commission is favorably di» - posrd toward the idea of a uniform classification of freight. now being advocated by shippers and carriers alike, and toward which end a committee of railroad traffic experts is working in conjunction with the Interstate Commerce Commission. But until such time as tangible results along this line shall have been achieved, it will continue to excr.-ise its authority for the protection of Nebraska shippers from unwarranted, sudden and radical changes of classification, which, of course, are equiva - lent in most cases to corresponding changes of rates. If ri sary. to accomplish this purpose, it will follow the example of certain other state commissions by preparing and publishing a classification of its own. REDUCTION OF EXPRESS RATES The policy adopted by the Commission and the Attorney (;ciieral for the enforcement of the Sibley Act, providing for a X per cent, reduction in express rates, has been fully vindi by the courts. Following the temporary injunction granted by the Supreme Court April 10, 1908, to restrain the express com - panies from charging greater rates than those provided by law. and the appointment of a referee to take testimony upon the Attorney General's motion that the injunction be made perman - ent, extended hearings were held in New York City. St. Louis and Omaha. The state was ably represented by Hon. W. T. Thompson, Attorney General, and by Mr. I'. G. Powell, rate clerk of the Commission, and Mr. L. E. Wettling, accountant. BThe state's case was largely based upon statistics contained le monthly station reports made to the Commission by the ms express companies, and deductions developed therefrom. </seg>
            <seg id="p018">18 I as found that while the gross earnings had been materially eased during the first year under the reduced rates, as com - ■d with the last year under the old rates, the expenses were correspondingly increased, and that, in consequence, the result was highly favorable to the prosperity of the express panies. I The main contention was with reference to the divisio spenses between state and interstate business. It was foum the companies made no effort whatever to charge a prope iortion of the expenses on through or "bridge" business [fie passing entirely through the state) to other state ugh which it moved, but charged it all to Nebraska, anc state insisted upon and secured a fair allowance in th The report of the referee sustained the state at every point, and the decision of the Supreme Court thereon, recently ren - dered, was equally gratifying. The full text of these important opinions will be found in Part V. of this report. It may not be improper, at this time, to state that the Commission and the Attorney General were urged, in the begin - ning of this litigation, to institute a large number of prosecutions against the express companies for individual violations of the law, and they were bitterly criticized in certain quarters for choosing what then seemed to be a more conservative course. It should now be clear to everyone that had the other plan been followed, it would merely have resulted in the Commis - sion's hands being tied by a federal injunction, and it is ex - ceedingly doubtful whether any beneficial results would have been achieved for the people of the state for many years, if ever. As the matter stands, every shipper of express between points in Nebraska has enjoyed a 25 per cent, reduction in rates since April 15, 1908, and the companies have been perpetually enjoined from increasing these rates until authorized by the Commission. Their only recourse now lies with either the Com - mission or the United States Supreme Court. Surely this result is more satisfactory to the average citizen than an expensive tangle of litigation, the only successful result of which would have been the penalizing of the companies, thereby increasing their expenses and rendering more difficult the task of proving the reduced rates compensatory. </seg>
            <seg id="p019">19 OTHER LITIGATION The most important cases in which the Commission is inter - ested at the present time arc those of State of Nebraska ct al v. C, B. &amp; Q. /»'//. Co. &lt;■/ '//. reported n pagM 16 and 17, First Annual Report. These are ad ions to prevent the railroads from putting into effect any other rates on live stock, potatoes. grain and grain products, etc. than those fixed hy the Aldrich bill, and to prevent violation of the anti-pass law and the two - cent fare law and the orders of the State Railway Commission. They were originally commenced in the Supreme Court of the state by a petition for injunction restraining the several rail - roads from violating the regulatory laws of 1!M)7. which was granted, but the eases were subsequently removed by defendants to the United States circuit court, where they are now pending. A large amount of testimony has already been taken on behalf of the C, R. I. &amp; P. Railway Company by a special examiner, and it is hoped that a final adjudication will be reached in the not distant future. tThe most perplexing problem encountered by all states in ition of this nature has been the division between interstate intrastate traffic, both in the matter of earnings and expenses, hoped that one of the results of this litigation will be the litigation by federal authority of a fixed and definite rule by h such separations may in the future properly be made. 1A11 laws, the validity of which are questioned in tlirse endings, are in full force and effect while the litigation is rogr&lt; 1 Other cases in which the Commission is directly or in - :tly interested have been disposed of or are pending, as ws: Missouri Pacific h'lj.

REDUCTION OF PULLMAN RATES On May 26, 1909, the Commission addressed a communi - cation to the traffic department of The Pullman Company at Chicago, Illinois, urging the propriety of a revised schedule of rates which would not only result in substantial reductions to travelers in Pullman cars between points in Nebraska, but would also adjust the rates upon a more equitable basis than was then in effect. As a result of this action and subsequent conferences with Pullman officials, a new schedule was made effective October 1, 1909, which complied in all substantial re - spects with the suggestions of the Commission (see special orders Nos. 590 and 590-A issued upon application Ne Part III). </seg>
            <seg id="p022">22 (The net result of the new schedule is an approximate-re - ion of 21 per cent, in the rates and a readjustment whereby ges are graduated at the rate of 5 cents for each additional miles, instead of at the rate of 25 cents^ for each additional miles, as was the former practice. Bit must be said, in justice to The Pullman Company, that it 'ed a commendable spirit of co-operation in the matter and ■hanges were accomplished with as little friction as any with h the Commission has had experience. CLASS RATE INVESTIGATION On July 6. 1909. the Commission issued its general order No. 19 (see Part III.), requiring the various railroads in Ne - braska to appear on specified dates and show cause why a certain schedule of elass rates, as set forth therein, should not be adopted. It subsequently appearing that this action, if taken in advance of a decision in the rate cases pending in the United States circuit court, might have a tendency to confuse the issues and jeopardize the interests of the state, the proposed hearings were deferred until after December 1, 190!), with the understand - ing that later dates would be assigned for the respective roads to appear and make their showing. In the meantime, the Commis - sion is fortifying its position concerning a general reduction of class rates by the collection of data covering certain representa - tive periods, which will show the volume of traffic moving under these rates in Nebraska, the revenue derived therefrom and the probable loss, if any, to the railroads under the proposed rates. t While considerable time will be required for the accomp - lent of results in this direction, the Commission believes well considered action, which will stand the test of the ts, is preferable to a hasty and ill-advised decision which i not be sustained.

It may be said in this connection that while a number of important questions have been decided under formal proceedings. as will appear from the opinions and orders reported in Part III., the usefulness of the Commission is by no means confined to this form of activity. The 503 informal complaints filed dur- ing the year cover a wide field of business interests, ranging from trivial and unfounded grievances to meritorious cases in- volving large sums of money and established principles of jus The Commission has. in fact, become a clearing house for the public in its dealings with the railroads and other common carriers under its jurisdiction. Many abuses which would other wise go uneorrected on account of the practically endless annoy and difficulty attendant upon their prosecution, are daily laid before it by means of correspondence or personal interviews. These matters, if the facts presented appear to warrant such action, are taken up with the responsible official of the company involved, and it is the rule rather than the exception that speedy adjustment of the difficulty is reached. Where hearings are n*-.-- easary. it is the custom of the Commission to hold them in its office at Lincoln, but in certain instances, if it appears that the convenience of a considerable number of people can be served ■ I I f^ J* f^ 1 1 r I w\ t^ r A T*i^ Fl 4* I t 1 H T / h T* h f^ ** T\ I U /~j j~fc c* I 1 1 1 VI Y1 fY w\ ¥ 1 U Q \ "\T l^ V iuvicuj , l "~J lit ilv 11 1 HI \t L Iltr 1 LJlcti.

APPLICATIONS As will be seen from the summarized list in Part III., 329 special orders have been issued during the past year, practically all of which have been made upon applications for authority to change rates. Most of these changes have been in the nature of reductions, but whether for that purpose or otherwise, they have invariably been closely investigated before authority was granted, and no order is ever issued until the Commission is fully satisfied that it is justified by existing conditions. I The last legislature passed what is known as the stocks and Is bill, house roll No. 578, requiring the approval of the mission before any common carrier or public service cor - tion can issue stocks, bonds, notes or other evidences of btedness payable at periods of more than twelve months • the dat t thereof. Since this law became effective twenty- I orders have been issued thereunder, the full text of which be found in Part fll. of this report. In this eonnec', ion, we desire to call attention to the neces - sity of keeping a close 'heck upon the revenues derived from issues of securities under this law, as well as upon the expendi - tures of same, if the full benefits of state supervision are to be obtainen. This will necessitate the permanent employment of an engineer to examine and report upon the valuation of public service properties and an additional clerical force to keep the necessary records. The states of New York and Wisconsin, which are pioneers in legislation of this kind, fully appreciate the importance of liberal expenditures along these lines, and their experience has been sufficiently satisfactory to justify Ne - braska in following their example.

The demands upon this department are constantly increasing by reason of additional duties and powers imposed and conferred by law, and by reason of a more thorough and better understand- ing on the part of the public of the functions of the Commission. To accomplish its work properly, the Commission should have the most detailed information and the most expert advice. This is particularly true of the questions involved in stock and bond issues, and rate investigations and litigation. These questions involve amounts of great proportions and deep concern to the state, and this department should not be embarrassed or deterred in securing all the information it deems necessary or of probable value in obtaining beneficial results by the fear that the amounts appropriated will not be sufficient to cover the cost </seg>

            <seg id="p078">78 all submitted on the same record and argued in the same briefs. And inasmuch as complainants each attack the reasonableness of the rates charged by the defendant company for the transportation of part or all of the following commodities in carload lots between Omaha and 'Flor - ence, to- wit: crushed stone and rock, lumber, lime, cement, stucco, brick ■ sand, and ask for reparation on shipments previously made under rates so attacked, we deem it proper to consolidate them and to dispose of them in one order. Florence is a suburb of Omaha, situated on the main line of the defendant railroad running north from Omaha, its southern terminus, about five miles distant from the Omaha postoffice and from the freight depot and switching yards of the defendant. It is a growing city of about fifteen hundred (1,500) inhabitants. (,s two large lumber yards, a canning factory and the pumping u and reservoir of the Omaha Water Company and such other 5, etc., usually to be found in such a suburb. The reports of the dant company to the Commission disclose the fact that during the from July 1, 1907, to June 30, 1908, the defendant, which has a poly of the freight moving by rail in and out of Florence, handled ■t hundred fifty-five (855) cars of freight to and from that city. Prior to January 1, 1907, the defendant company, and for five years imore prior thereto, published, charged and collected from shippers the transportation of freight and -commodities such as coal, ice, hed rock, stone, sand and other commodities of like character in &gt;ad lots between Omaha and Florence, a maximum rate of five irs ($5.00) per carload; and for cement, brick, lime, stucco and r commodities of like character, a rate of one and a half (1V4) cents ■hundredweight, with a minimum charge of six dollars ($6.00) per car. These rates, which were originally published as commodity rates under what was then termed "special orders," expired by the terms of such orders at the expiration of the year they were published. The rates prescribed under these "special orders" were continued by tacit agree - ment or the reissue of such orders, until on or about December 31, 1906. The defendant company failing and refusing to reissue the same (ex - cept in the case of ice and coal, which it still maintains), the following schedule of rates, provided for in the commodity and class rate tariffs of the defendant, became effective on carload shipments Rate per Minimum Commodity. 100 lbs.

A similar rate applies between Nehawka and Weeping Water to Lincoln, a distance of fifty (50) miles. It further appeared from the evidence that the defendant company on different occasions transported shipments of machinery and brick from Omaha to Florence at a rate of $3.00 per car. It further appears that the complainants shipping lumber to Florence K-e almost, if not entirely, since the taking effect of the new rates, sed to ship lumber from Omaha to Florence by rail, but find it cheaper haul it by wagon from Missouri Pacific sidetracks at Thirtieth and rd streets, Omaha, a point located about half way between Florence and defendant's Omaha yards. It will be noted from the foregoing that where no specific com- Eity rate is effective, lumber, lime, cement and stucco take class ites, and, with the exception of stucco, the same minimum of 30,000 ids, and that brick, stone, sand, ice and coal take class E rates and the same minimum of 30,000 pounds. In other words, when no special commodity rate is effective, for the purpose of rate making, subject to the minimum, lumber, cement, lime and stucco are on a parity and take the same rate; and brick, re, ice, coal and sand are on a parity and take the same rate. The defendant insists that the flat carload rates above cited, apply- ing on roads other than the defendant, are switching rates, and that in establishing such rates they are more or less arbitrary and disregard the usual elements considered in determining a fair rate, i. e. : distance, size of load, value and character of the commodity, and that such rates do not constitute a fair comparison or basis on which to dispose of this case. Commodity. per Car. Coal and coke $ 5 00 Ice 5 00 Live stock — other than horses and mules 4 00 Horses and mules 6 00 All carload freight not specified above 6 00 </seg>
            <seg id="p081">81 They further argued that, inasmuch as Florence is outside the Omaha switching limits and that all traffic to and from Florence is handled on the main line on regular billing, a large part of it being carried by regular trains and only a small part by switching trains, a so-called "switching rate" should not be made. I This contention is sustained by the Supreme Court of Iowa in the of State v. Chicago, Milwaukee d- St. I'tuil Railway Co.. 55 N. W. 331, rhich it was held that "an order of the Railroad Commissioners defendant railroad company transfer cars delivered to it by another )any, from its station to another point, as a switching service, will be enforced where such point is beyond the yard limits, and the ice rendered is on the main line, and is done under orders as in :ase of trains, and not under the direction of the yardmaster." Ehe five dollars ($5.00) per car flat rate, is not necessarily a switch - ite. The defendant publishes it as a commodity rate in its regu - issued tariff, and an examination of the commodity tariffs of other ska railroads will disclose an occasional flat rate per car. Ehe statute provides that in cases involving the reasonableness of "the lowest rates published or charged by any railway company lbstantially the same kind of service, whether in this or another shall, when introduced in evidence, be accepted as fttmm fade ice of a reasonable rate for the services under investigation." iter 72, article 8, section 5b, Compiled Statutes 1907.) B Under the provisions of that section, we may accept the five dollar i0) flat rate per car on coal and ice as prima facie reasonable, apply it at least to commodities taking the same class and requiring tantially the same service. I The record does not disclose what is the cost of transporting a car t-een Omaha and Florence. It is difficult, if not impossible, to irately determine such cost, yet the failure or inability of the ndant to furnish proof in this regard, or the general statement that defendant is not earning more than a reasonable return on the value ts property, should not and cannot overcome the presumptions ere - by the statute in favor of the rates contended for. I A flat carload commodity rate can hardly, in fairness to the rail - companies, be made applicable generally between every town five s apart, or unreasonably extended outside of or beyond the switching ts created by the railroads themselves. We are of the opinion, therefore, that the present rates charged and collected by the defendant company are, under the facts above set forth, unreasonable and excessive and discriminatory; that, while conditions may not justify the extension of defendant's switching district to Flor - ence and a resulting extended application of a flat rate per car, the near - ness of Florence to Omaha, the amount of traffic handled between those two points, the fact that defendant company, for its own convenience, often handles carload freight through its Omaha switching crews, and the other facts developed herein, entitle the complainants to relief and we further find upon the foregoing facts that the following schedule of rates is a </seg>

In disposing of this case, we do not deem it necessary to disturb the present rates of five dollars ($5.00) per car on ice and coal, irre- spective of weights, voluntarily maintained by the defendant Such disparity as may exist between the ice and coal rates as compared with the rates above established on other commodities, cannot fairly constitute an undue and unjust discrimination. The Commission is called upon for the first time in a formal manner. in all three complaints, to compel a railroad company to make repar- ation. We can find nowhere constitutional or statutory authority specifically granting such power to the Commission. The power to grant reparation is judicial in its character, and is one of the powers usually exercised by a court. The constitution of the State of Nebraska (article V., section 1) vests all the judicial power of the state in the courts named in that section, and in such other in- ferior courts in the municipalities as may be created by the act of the legislature. The constitutional amendment creating the Commission provides inter alia: "The powers and duties of such Commission shall include the regulation of rates, service and a general control of common carriers as the legislature may provide by law." If it were the intent of the legislature that the Commission should, in its exercise of the power of regulation of rates, and of general control of the service of the railroads, order reparation in the proper case, it would have been clearly expressed. The only provision of the statute which can possibly be construed to authorize the Commission to make an order of reparation, is paragraph d of section 2 of the Commission Act, empowering the Commission "to correct abuses and prevent unjust discriminations, extortions and over- charges in rates of freight and passenger tariffs • • • and to en- force the same by having the penalties inflicted as hereinafter provided. through proper courts having jurisdiction." It would require a strained construction of the law to read into this section authority vested in the Commission to order reparation. The several decisions of the Interstate Commerce Commission, cited by counsel for complainants in support of his contention that this Com- </seg>
            <seg id="p083">83 En has the power to order reparation, are not in point, as the federal gulating interstate commerce confers specific authority upon that ission to grant such relief. We must therefore hold that the I'om - n is without jurisdiction or authority to order reparation. ORDER.

            <seg id="p085">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 85 "new" company, which operates a telephone exchange in Norfolk, Neb - raska, a city having a population of about 5,200 inhabitants. The defendants operate jointly the only express office at Norfolk, in the center of the business district, no part of which is more than three (3) blocks distant from their place of business. This office is connected with the exchange of the Nebraska Telephone Company, hereinafter re - ferred to as the "Bell" company. The "new" company, at. the time of the hearing on this complain had installed and in service in Norfolk, five hundred and sixty (560) tele - phones, consisting of one hundred and twenty (120) business telephone and four hundred and forty (440) residence telephones, of which latte number, twenty-three (23) were on country lines; while the "Bell" com pany had installed and in operation about one thousand and forty-tw (1,042) telephones, consisting of one hundred and fifty-five (155) busines telephones, six hundred (600) residence telephones, two hundred an sixty-five (265) farm line telephones, and twenty-two (22) extension telephones. The defendants refuse to have one of the "new" company's telephones installed in their office, and it is the prayer of the complainant that an order issue from the Commission, compelling them to provide such a con - nection. It appears from the evidence that eighty (80) per cent, of the total number of the "new" company's subscribers are exclusive — that is, hare the "new" company's telephones only, and that of its one hundred and twenty (120) business telephones, thirty-six (36) are exclusive. Complainant was the only witness, appearing and asking for the relief prayed for. A petition, signed by some eighty-five (85) business men and firms of Norfolk, asking that the defendants be required to install one of the "new" company's telephones in their place of business, was offered in evidence. At the same time, the defendants offered In evidence a statement, signed by some seventy-nine business men and firms of Norfolk, many of whom had signed the petition offered by the complain - ant, to the effect that they had no complaint against the telephone service maintained by the defendants, and that the present service was entirely satisfactory to them. The Commission does not assume that those who signed both pe - tition and statement meant to be understood that they did not desire the defendants to install the "new" company's telephone, but rather that the service furnished by the "Bell" company was efficient, adequate and satisfactory, so far as they were concerned. There nowhere appears in the record anything criticising or com - plaining of the efficiency or quality of service afforded by the "Bell" company and its connections with defendant's office. It further appears that the "Bell" company is ready and willing to furnish service to any and all persons in Norfolk desiring same, at its published rates, save and except the complainant herein. The refusal of the "Bell" company to fur - nish the complainant herein its service, is made the subject of a separate </seg>
            <seg id="p086">86 complaint, and should not affect the issues as between the parties to The defendants contend that the added telephone service is not an CMMtlgl convenience to the express companies . nor to their patrons at Norfolk, and in support of such contention submitted the following state - ment of facts : Packages destined to Norfolk are delivered from thirty (30) minutes to two (2) hours after arrival of trains in the day time. Express mat - ter arriving in the night is delivered at a seasonable hour in the morning. Delivery failing by reason of absence of consignee or failure to provide street address, postal card notice through the mail is given of the ar - rival of the freight and, if requested, delivery is made if consignees are within the delivery limits. Eefendants submitted the following facts, based on an examination Ir delivery sheets for one day, and the assertion of the witness that fair average for each day in the year, to- wit: Ilbout ninety-five (95) per cent, of the express business is done with lelivery limits, where deliveries are made from two (2) to three ( i daily. In making deliveries, the drivers collect any outbound shi s. Of the five (5) per cent, balance on inbound shipments, about on (%) is consigned to transients having no local addresses, and on (%) to local parties living beyond the delivery limits. Packages tutting at Norfolk for shipment beyond, average about sixty (60) pe and all come from five or six business firms, except four (4) to six ( ages received from scattered patrons. These facts would be entitle luch greater weight were they the result of an examination and iging of the delivery sheets covering a considerable period of tim I It further appears that a record kept of telephone calls received the "Bell" telephone in the defendants' office, on all subjects, does exceed twenty (20) per day, of which frequently not more than ten concern express business. ■Under the foregoing state of facts, this Commission would hesitate, le matter were left entirely to its discretion, in compelling the de - ants to install the "new" telephone. I The express companies, in undertaking to transport express matter, t supply reasonable facilities, having in mind not only their own •enience, but that of the public as well. The determination of the nt and character of equipment employed, the manner of service and rates and charges, are properly left, in the first instance, to the Tnent of the officers of the express company. And as was said in case of People* Telephone Co. r. EnnUi n R. Co. of M. et al. Reports Wisconsin Commission, R-40: |[t is only where there is a disregard of public accommodation or nience, or a conflict betweeen private interest and public duty, or Nation of any obligation to the public, whereby the latter suffers or ely to suffer a wrong, because of the inadequacy of the facilities rhed, or services rendered, or discriminations practiced, or excessive es exacted, that interference by the state for the purposes of regu - is Justified." </seg>
            <seg id="p087">87 In the "Express Cases," 117 U. S. 24, the court said: |3o long as the public are served to their reasonable satisfaction, a matter of no importance who serves them.

If 3 done, the railroad company owes no duty to the public as to the ular agencies H shall select for that purpose. The public requires irriage, but the company may choose its own appropriate means of ige, always provided they are such as to insure reasonable prompt - and security." |\'o issue is presented in this case as to whether or not the express &gt;anies should furnish the public adequate telephone service for the ose of transacting business with their stations or offices. Such a has not only been self-imposed, but has been enforced by the courts the commissions. Peoples Telephone Co. v. Eastern B. Co. of M. , supra. J. E. Hart et al v. C. &amp;• N. W. Ry. Co., Neb. Com. Rep. F-46. Meyers r. A. T. d- S. F. fly. Co.. 100 Pac. Rep. 12. Nor is there such an issue presented by the facts as appeared in the case of Peoples Telephone Co. r. Eastern R. Co. of M.. supra. That case involved the telephone service furnished by the railroad company in the city of Superior, a city having a population of about 40,000 people, and large industrial, manufacturing and commercial interests. Two telephone companies, having approximately a like number of subscribers, were oper - ating exchanges in that city and the defendant company, with the excep - tion of two of its offices, was furnishing the telephone service of one company exclusively. I The testimony of a large number of the patrons of the railroad com - r demonstrated conclusively that the telephone facilities in its city e and general freight offices were inadequate for the satisfactory per - lance of its duty to the public, and it was specifically found that in ir to provide adequate telephonic connections with its said offices, ould be necessary to install in each of the said offices one of the tioner's telephones, connected with its exchange in that city. In its opinion, the Commission says, however: "If one telephone company is able to furnish all the service reason - ably required for the public convenience, the railroad cannot be com - pelled to duplicate the service by installing the system of another com - pany; but the railway company cannot, by agreement with any telephone company for the use of the latter's system to the exclusion of all others, limit its obligation to the public, either in the extent or character of the service reasonably necessary for the public convenience." (If the principles established by the foregoing cases are correct, it Id appear that when two telephone companies are operating separate anges of about the same size and capacity in a city, and the railroad ■xpress companies have installed the telephone of one company in r several offices, connected with its exchange, and its patrone can h such offices without unreasonable delay or hindrance over such </seg>
            <seg id="p088">88 Eone and receive satisfactory service, said railroad or express com - could not be compelled to install the telephone of the other ny. The Commission is of the opinion, however, that if there is a wide margin between the number of subscribers of one company and those of another, the fact that the company having the fewer number of subscrib - ers was ready to furnish service to all desiring same, would not justify the railroad or express company in disregarding the evident preference expressed by the subscribers to the larger exchange, and would hold that the failure of the company to install the telephone of such larger exchange would constitute a failure to furnish adequate and reason - able service. The obligations of the express companies and the power of the Commission in the present case are, however, not limited by the rules of the common law. Sections 23 and 24, chapter 72, article 8 of the Com - piled Statutes of 1909, known as the "Bartos Act", provide : "Section 23. That every railway company, express company or telegraph company doing business in this s&gt;tate shall furnish reason - ably adequate telephone connections between its offices, buildings and grounds, and the public telephone exchanges operated in the towns where the same are located. I Sec. 24. The State Railway Commission of the state of Nebraska is ty authorized and empowered to require and compel the furnishing ch service. Upon complaint to the Railway Commission of the state ibraska that any telephonic service with any railroad, telegraph or !8R company's buildings, offices or grounds is inadequate or in any ■ct unreasonably or unjustly discriminatory or that such service 3t be had, it shall be the duty of said Commission to investigate the , and if, upon investigation, the Commission shall find that any honic service is inadequate or unreasonably or unjustly discrimina - or that such service cannot be had, it shall determine and by order reasonable regulation, practice or service to be installed, imposed, •ved and operated in the future." I We are of the opinion that under the facts established in this case, provisions of said section 23 are mandatory, and that an order should e, compelling the defendants to install and maintain in their office lorfolk a telephone of the "new" company, connected with its Norfolk tange. I Had the legislature considered that connection with one exchange sufficient to reasonably fulfill the duty to the public, or that under circumstances it might be sufficient, the word "exchanges" would ously not have been used, and the statute would have been so worded o leave some room for the Commission to exercise its discretion, ed force is given to these conclusions by an examination of the nals of the legislature enacting the law, which shows that an amend - t, having for its purpose the insertion of the word "exchange" in e of "exchanges" was offered and defeated. ■Defendants offer constitutional objections to the validity of this ite, and cite numerous cases in support of their contention. We do deem it necessary to discuss the questions raised on these grounds. </seg>
            <seg id="p089">89 as it is the policy of the Commission to treat all enrolled bills, not vetoed by the Governor, as valid, and to leave the question of a statute's con - stitutionality to be determined in the courts. The complainant further contends that the refusal of the defendant to install and maintain a telephone of the "new" company in their Nor folk office constitutes unjust and unreasonable discrimination in favo of subscribers of the "Bell" company, as against those of the "new company. If, under the rule laid down in the ''Express Cotes,' 1 supra the defendants can select their own agency for furnishing telephone con nection with their office, and that agency is ready and willing to furnis such connection, it can hardly be held that the refusal of said defendant under such circumstances and those established in this case, to insta and maintain the other, or "new" telephone constitutes an unjust di crimination. Complainants further contend that the telephone connections fu nished are not reasonably adequate, in that the defendants refuse to in stall the "new" telephone, and argue in support thereof that the exclusiv subscribers of the "new" company should be regarded and treated as th patrons of an express and telephone company in a town having but on exchange, where the express company refuses to furnish any telephon connection. The Commission would unhesitatingly issue its order unde such a supposed case, but under the facts established in this case, con sidering the character of business done by the defendants and the man ner in which it is conducted, the location of the business subscribers o both telephone companies with reference to the office of the defendants the small percentage of business done with the exclusive subscribers o the "new" company, and the fact that the service of the "Bell" compan furnished by the defendant is efficient and satisfactory, so far as it used, it must hold the telephone connections furnished by the express company to its patrons to be reasonably adequate.

MODIFIED ORDER HENRY T. CLARKE, Jr., Chairman: This matter comes on to be heard on a rehearing granted the defend- ant company on exceptions taken to the order of the Commission hereto- fore entered herein, under date of November 28, 1908. The complainant herein, a resident of Tecumseh, and manager of the Johnson County Home Telephone Company, having an exchange at that point, complains that subscribers and non-subscribers of the defendant company are charged for toll messages Between Tecumseh and Vesta 15 cents; that non-subscribers of defendant company are charged for toll mes- sages Between Tecumseh and Crab Orchard 15 cents; Between Tecumseh and Sterling 10 cents; K defendant's subscribers are charged only five cents; and asks for der requiring the defendant to "desist from charging one person than is charged any other one person for talking between the same No allegation or complaint was made, or evidence introduced to the effect that the rates charged non-subscribers were of themselves un- reasonable or excessive. Defendant answered, admitting the existence of the schedule of toll &gt;) as set forth in the complaint, and alleging that, while the five-cent made subscribers was non-compensatory, it was forced through com - ion and was necessary in order to support its exchange at Tecumseh ; that, inasmuch as the rates in question were open to all persons on the same terms, there was no unlawful discrimination. From the evidence it appears that the Nebraska Telephone Company was the first company to establish and operate telephone exchanges at Tecumseh and Sterling; that Mr. Rothell is operating the only exchange at Crab Orchard; that no exchange is operated at Vesta, but that defend - ant company operates and maintains a public pay station at that point; that subsequently mutual companies were consolidated into the Johnson County Home Telephone Company and exchanges extended, built and operated at Tecumseh and Sterling. The rates obtaining at these exchanges are as follows: Town Company Business Residence Farm lp. 2p. 4p. lp. 2p. 4p. Tecumseh Nebraska $2.50 $2.00 $1.25 $1.50 $1.25 $1.00 $1.50 Johnson Co. 2.00 1.00 1 25 Sterling Nebraska 2.50 2.00 1.50 1.25 1.00 1.50 </seg>
            <seg id="p092">92 Johnson Co. 1.50 1.00 1.25 Crab Orchard Rothell 1.50 1.50 1.50 The Johnson County company offers farm line subscribers only, an additional exchange, unlimited service, at a blanket rate of twenty-five cents per month. I 'he farm lines of the various exchanges overlap each other. It ap - that some thirty farm subscribers to the Crab Orchard exchange oned its officers for lower rates than the $1.50 rate, and justified it ggesting that the independent exchanges at Sterling and Tecumseh ■d service at a $1.25 rate; that in order to retain its subscribers at nseh and to help Mr. Rothell's company retain its subscribers, and atect its toll business, the Nebraska company put in the special five - toll rate to subscribers. fiis special toll rate of five cents was admittedly non-compensatory, unagers of the Nebraska company and the Telephone Traffic Asso - i (independent) both testifying that fifteen cents is the lowest table minimum for toll business, and Mr. Canon, the complainant, ing that on a ten-cent minimum there would not be much profit or loss. Krhe manager of the Nebraska Company testified that the rates paid s Tecumseh subscribers for Tecumseh exchange service were fair reasonable for that service alone, and that the special toll rate to Orchard and Sterling exchanges was furnished at a loss. It further appears that fifteen cents is the charge made in other lo - calities for a similar service by the Nebraska company, where no compe - tition exists. Do the foregoing facts constitute an unjust discrimination under the Section 14 of the Railway Commission Act provides: I 'If any common carrier subject to the provisions of this act, directly idirectly • • • • shall charge, demand, collect or receive from person, firm or corporation, a greater or less compensation for any ice rendered or to be rendered by it than it charges, demands, collects eceives from any other person or corporation for doing a like and emporaneous service, the same shall constitute an unjust discrimina- I'a. If any • * • • common carrier subject to the provisions of act, through or by its officers, agents or employes, makes or gives undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular &gt;n, company, firm, or corporation or locality, or subjects any par - ar description of traffic to any undue or unreasonable prejudice, delay or disadvantage, the same shall constitute an unjust discrimi - nation • • •" I The questions presented to the Commission for decision are: Firtt, discriminatory for a telephone company to charge a lower toll rate ne locality than that charged in a different locality for the same dis - ce of service, when the only important difference as to the circum - ees and situation of the two localities is that in the locality where the ler rate is charged there is no competition, and the lower rate has i made to meet competition . </seg>
            <seg id="p093">93 Ee Nebraska Telephone Company charges a toll rate of ten cents to bscribers between the towns of Sterling and Tecumseh, which is a mileage rate than it charges for a similar service between other in the state, the rate prevailing in almost all cases being fifteen Eie Nebraska company owns and operates exchanges and long dis - lines throughout the entire state. It first occupied the Sterling and iseh field, and had constructed and in operation, exchanges and toll representing a considerable investment. Its toll rate of fifteen under the evidence, was not excessive or unreasonable. I Subsequently the Johnson County company enters into competition puts in a toll rate for long distance service between those points of cents, which its manager, the complainant, testifies does not probably e the company much profit nor occasion any loss. A considerable portion of the Nebraska company's investment at Tecumseh and Sterling consists of farm lines, for which service its farm patrons pay $1.50 per month for one exchange service, with an additional charge for each call to outside exchanges. The Johnson County company, upon entering the field, puts into effect a farm line rate of $1.25 per month, with unlimited toll service to its neighboring exchange at an added rate of 25 cents per month. It is generally admitted by telephone managers that in agricultural communities the average exchange is largely dependent on the retention of farm line connections, because of the fact that there is a relationship between the residents in town and farmers in the vicinity, and that there - fore, in many cases, one farm line telephone will mean the retention of a residence telephone in the town. The business prosperity of a town or enterprise in such places is dependent largely, if not entirely, upon the farmers, and it is essential that under modern conditions there be reason - able and satisfactory telephonic communication between the business house in town and its customer on the farm. In fact, defendant's wit - ness testified that in several cases their town exchanges had been wiped out because of the fact that competing companies had developed the farm line business with greater success. It is insisted by the defendant company, and it is apparent to the Commission, that the failure of the Nebraska company to meet the com - petitive toll rate between Sterling and Tecumseh would result in its toll lines remaining idle, and the probable loss of many subscribers to both exchanges. Must it be said that under the law the Nebraska company must submit to such a loss or be compelled to maintain the lower rate, which it claims to be non-compensatory, all over the state on the same mileage basis? Such a contention the Commission believes to be neither sound nor just The Commission is being called upon continually to approve the applications of many so-called "independent" companies, as distinguished from the Nebraska company, for permission to increase their rates and rhar?p^ Tnvpfitisr&amp;tinn Anil hpftrinflm hflvp (ipvplmipri thp fact with hut </seg>

Rts competitor having been driven out, the local company then suddenly vers that its rates are non-compensatory and that it is doing business loss, and files an application for leave to increase its rates. Under Kper showing, the Commission cannot do other than grant such ssion. The new schedule of rate.s may be as great as those charged Nebraska company when its local competitor first entered the field. Ehere is no benefit gained from such competition by the public, except porary reduction in rates, and the Nebraska company is compelled ler a loss, part or all of which might be saved were it permitted et the competitive rate. Eis apparent that the adoption of such a rule by the Commission and urts would subject the Nebraska company to unreasonable com - e attacks without restraint, whether made in good or in bad faith, bject it to heavy loss, without commensurate good to the public. The test under the statute is whether or not the lower com - petitive rate afforded its Tecumseh and Sterling patrons constitutes an undue and unreasonable preference or advantage as against non-competitive territory. In the case herein submitted, the reasonableness of defendant's rates were not challenged, nor was any evidence introduced tending to prove that the defendant was making or giving to any locality nny muhn m unreasunuhlt itdntntuijt . other than the fact that it was charging a lower toll rate in one locality than that charged in a different locality. fhe Commission is of the opinion that in the absence of proof that a toll rate is unreasonable or excessive, the fact that the same corn - in another locality, for the purpose of meeting local competition, es a lower rate for a similar service, does not of itself, and in the ce of further proof that it subjects the town affected to any undue reasonable prejudice, constitute an unjust discrimination. I In its disposition of the above question, the Commission has treated situation, for the purpose of the argument, as though the toll rates in ition were the same for subscribers and non-subscribers alike. KThe defendant insists, and with some show of reasoning, that the itenance of a rate of five cents to subscribers and fifteen cents to non - icribers for a given toll service, does not constitute unjust discrimina - , on the following grounds: First. That, as between subscribers and non-subscribers, the service </seg>

That the subscribers' business between Tecumseh and Ster - ling is always sent over the iron circuits, whereas the non-sub - scribers' business "sometimes (perhaps not always)" goes over the copper circuits, which cost about four times the cost of the iron circuits. b. That the service is handled in a different manner; that the subscriber gets his toll connection directly through the operator at the central office, while the non-subscriber gets his connection through a higher-priced operator, handling the toll department. c. That the subscribers' business is large in volume, as com - pared with the non-subscribers' business; that it comes with such regularity that it can be figured upon, and can be apportioned with the other business among the operators, so as to obtain the great - est amount of work from these operators, while, on the other hand, the non-subscribers' business is very irregular and necessitates the calling away of an employe from his other work in order to give it attention. &lt;/ That the non-subscriber demands a higher grade of service; that frequently if he cannot get his connection at once, he drifts away, leaving the telephone company with the expense of making the connection; whereas, the question of time is not so important with the subscriber, who can always be found. e. That the non-subscribers' business comes from pay stations established in semi-public places, for which rent must be paid, and, in addition, a fifteen per cent, commission to the person own - ing the premises, while no such expense attaches to the sub - scribers' business. /. That there is a loss on non-subscribers' business at pay stations, arising from patrons dropping bad coins into the ma - chines, refusing to pay for overtime, etc., while these items are entirely absent on the subscribers' business. y. That the public pay station represents a much greater investment than the subscriber's station; that interest, deprecia - tion, etc., on the public pay station, booth and telephone must be charged against the tolls paid by the non-subscriber, while these items, so far as the subscriber is concerned, are included in the amount he pays for his exchange service. Econd. That the five-cent toll rate between Crab Orchard and iseh, and likewise Sterling, is open to all persons who wish to be - subscribers to any of those exchanges. Itt is clear from the record that it was competition or threatened corn - ion, and not the difference in the cost or character of the service, induced the defendant to make a difference in rates between its sub - &gt;ers and non-subscribers; nor is there evidence in the record to ort all of the arguments submitted in defendant's brief; yet, as the iion made by the Commission in this case will establish a precedent affect numerous telephone companies operating in the state, it deems oper to consider the arguments advanced by the defendant on their »To the argument that non-subscribers' toll business is always handled the more expensive copper wire circuits, and the subscribers' busi - is handled over the cheaper iron circuits, it is a sufficient answer </seg>
            <seg id="p096">96 E:e that defendant admits that subscribers' toll business is "some - handled over the copper circuits. Moreover, if the defendant ny was furnishing two classes of service, for which it charged nt rates, can it be maintained that it could arbitrarily or by a . rule prohibit one class of patrons from selecting that service tak - s lower rate? The record does not disclose the fact that at the three exchanges in volved, higher priced long distance operators handle the non-subscribers toll business, while a less expensive operator handles the subscriber business at the main switchboard. Plaintiff's attorney, in his brief, an swering this argument of defendant, makes the positive assertion tha separate toll operators were not maintained at any of the exchanges in rolved, with the exception, possibly, of Tecumseh, and at that point sub scribers and non-subscribers alike, when desiring toll connections, cal "long distance." Defendant's attorney, in his reply brief, passes th contradiction unnoticed. Assuming that such distinction did, in fac obtain, it is clearly not of sufficient moment to justify a difference in rat Eie fact that the volume of the subscribers' business is large as com - with the non-subscribers' business, does not justify a difference in It is a matter of common knowledge that one subscriber of a one company may be a large and extensive user of its toll lines lother a small user, yet they each must pay the same rate per call. The argument that the non-subscriber demands a higher grade of service, is also raised outside of any evidence introduced in the record. We do not believe they are any more prone to become impatient and cancel their calls than subscribers. Such a fact, however, is conjectural and cannot be estimated in dollars and cents. I The arguments that there is a greater loss in the non-subscribers' ness at public pay stations, arising from patrons using bad coins refusing to pay overtime, and that the public pay station booth rep - nts a greater investment than the subscriber station, and that the of maintenance of same must come entirely from toll charges, while cost of subscribers' stations are included and paid for by the sub - jer in his exchange rate, are the only propositions advanced that tend istify defendant's contentions. Eie evidence relating to use of bad coins was of a general nature, ts being submitted showing the exact amount so lost. The Com - n is confident, however, that if the amount of bad coins used at pay stations were known, as compared with the actual business cted at such stations, it would be so small as to add but little , to defendant's contention. t Defendant's arguments would have more weight were the lower 3 to subscribers limited to connections between subscribers. A sub - &gt;er may call up a non-subscriber at the distant exchange and, under evidence submitted in the record, will use the same facilities and ive the same service that the non-subscriber would use and receive i the call reversed. The schedule of rates and charges filed by the defendant company </seg>
            <seg id="p097">97 ■ this Commission shows clearly and conclusively that defendant does make a general application of the principle that subscribers are led to a lower charge per call on toll messages than non-subscribers. I Counsel for defendant cites the ruling of the Wisconsin Commissio le effect that it is lawful for telephone companies to afford free to Ice to their respective subscribers, provided the same is given to like, without discrimination; that in such cases the free toll servic be regarded as a part of the service which each company is providin its subscribers, and concludes that if the granting of a free to Ice to subscribers is not unlawful, the maintaining of a different rat toil calls as between subscribers and non-subscribers is not subjec jjection. B There is, however, an important and controlling difference. In the case te toll service, the toll messages do not require the recording of calls e additional expense of book-keeping and collections, as is the case i a charge per call is made. Again, in such cases it is regarded as *t of the exchange service, and is paid for in the exchange rate. I In the case herein submitted, defendant's witness specifically stated the rates charged for local exchange service were reasonable for local service i&gt;er .si-, and did not cover any of the expense of the service, admittedly furnished at non-compensatory rates. I We can well agree with the Wisconsin Commission in its ruling a company may furnish its subscribers a free toll service, the cost hich shall be included in the exchange rate, but we believe that this ild be practiced only under certain conditions. The local exchange is the nucleus of a telephone system. The large majority of its subscribers are led to avail themselves of its facilities principally for the purpose of communicating with the patrons directly connected with the local exchange. Competition or local conditions have often compelled or induced the company owning and operating exchanges in two neighboring towns, or two telephone companies operating ex - changes in adjoining towns, to provide a free unlimited toll service be - tween the two exchanges. In some cases only one rate is made, and cov - ers the two services, and in other cases a rate is provided for the service of the local exchange, and an added rate provided for the additional exchange service. It is generally admitted that as the number of subscribers of a tele - phone company increases, the cost per subscriber increases, and that the expense involved in maintaining a free toll service between the exchanges of two neighboring towns, for reasons apparent and unnecessary to discuss, is greater than where exchange service is limited to the one exchange and a charge made for each call to outside exchanges. I It is also a well established fact that, while all of the telephone com - •'s subscribers may use the long distance or toll service occasionally, e are some who use it continuously, and some who use it rarely, if II. Such being the case, i. e., the added or free toll service being ad - mittedly more expensive, and one class or number of patrons using </seg>
            <seg id="p098">98 SECOND ANNUAL REPORT same frequently, If not continuously, while another class uses it rarely, if at all, it is clear in the mind of the Commission that telephone companies should provide a rate applicable for the single exchange service, with an additional charge for each added exchange, and that under no circum - stances should a company be permitted to provide one toll rate to the public as against a lower and admittedly non-compensatory rate to its subscribers, which, though open to all, is enjoyed by the few at the expense of all. I What might be considered an exception to the above rule, and yet i not come within the rule, occurs in metropolitan cities when the phone system is of so great a magnitude that economy in construction, itenance and operation require the separation and division of the pany's exchange or switchboards into so-called "sub-stations," or langes. On the hearing, it appeared that the Johnson County company, man - aged by the complainant herein, offered the additional exchange service to farm line subscribers only, at twenty-five cents per month. The de - fendant criticises this as discriminatory against the Johnson County com - pany's other subscribers, and offers this fact as further justification of its practice of making the lower toll rate to its subscribers herein com- ETiile this is not an issue in this case, we believe it to be so closely cted with the main question involved herein and discussed in this n, that the position of the Commission with regard to it should be clear. One of the difficulties of telephone development has been to meet the demands of telephone users among the farmers who are located at or near a point half way between two exchanges. Some of the neighbors may have one company's telephone and some another's. Some are natur - ally tributary to the exchange of one company and some to that of the other company. They object or refuse to subscribe to either company unless provision is made whereby they can talk to their neighbors having the other company's telephones. The result has been that this class of subscribers, not in spite of, but by reason of their disadvantage in loca - tion, have been the beneficiaries of this added exchange service at a low blanket rate, and in many instances, as in this case, limited to them alone. It would seem to the Commission that where an added exchange service is given at a blanket rate to any one class of subscribers, it should be given to all. In such case, however, due consideration must be given to the well recognized classification of subscribers, and that where a business telephone is charged a higher rate for single exchange service, a proportionately higher rate for the added exchange service, or free toll service, is equitable and good practice. » Defendant further argues that the Commission is without power or ority to fix telephone rates, but does not question its power and duty revent unjust discrimination. For the proper disposition of the matters complained of in this case. </seg>

The ;ise of its admitted powers to prevent unjust discrimination will ict the evils Justly complained of. The Commission, for the reasons heretofore given, finds: Erst. That it is not unjust discrimination for a telephone company nt a lower toll rate in one locality than that granted in a different y, and which is not unreasonable, when the only important dif - e as to the circumstances and situation of the two localities is that a there is no competition, while in the other locality there is tition.

KUpon the above showing, petitioners prayed that the defendants be ired to make their tariff rates on lumber equal and the same from ha and Lincoln to all points in Nebraska on their respective lines ail road. I On September 8, 1908, the Lincoln Commercial Club intervened and a demurrer to the complaint upon the ground that the allegations forth in the same did not state facts sufficient to make a cause of »n against the defendants, and did not state facts sufficient to show violation of the laws of the state of Nebraska, regulating and govern - charges of common carriers in the transportation of freight.

Answers were filed by Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company, Chicago &amp; North-West - ern Railway Company, Union Pacific Railroad Company, and Lincoln Commercial Club. ■The case came on for hearing October 20, 1908, at which time F. letzer appeared for complainant Chicago Lumber Company, A.

White for Chicago &amp; North-We«t- Railway Company, and A. W. Field for intervening Lincoln Com - cial Club. I Complainants offered no evidence other than by calling attention to list of stations and comparison of rates contained in their amended tion referred to above. No evidence was introduced or contention e by complainants that the present rates were unjust. The burden of r argument rested on the recent decision of the Interstate Commerce imission, whereby the differential in favor of Omaha as against Lin - tan intermediate station between the southern lumber supply points Omaha) was declared unreasonable, and Lincoln given the same as Omaha. I Complainants argued, though there was no testimony offered, that differential in favor of Omaha on the old inbound rates was offset equalized by a varying differential in favor of Lincoln on outbound s; and that the wiping out of the differential on inbound rates from hern pine territory, at present the principal source of supply, and maintenance of the old and present differentials on outbound ship - ts in favor of Lincoln, would result in the destruction of Omaha as bolesale market for southern lumber, and the leaving to Lincoln of t would amount to a practical monopoly of that trade in this state; reas if their prayer was granted two competitive wholesale lumber kets would be maintained in the state.

WINNETT, Commissioner: I Investigation by the Commission of the complaint of William F. ispie, engaged in the shipment of stock and grain, and others, of ard, Nebraska, against the Missouri Pacific Railway Company and Western Union Telegraph Company: RIt is charged that the defendants have substituted a telephone service telegraph service at the depot of said Missouri Pacific Railway Com - i at Mynard, and that said telephone service is inadequate and unsatisfactory- It is also charged that the facilities for doing commercial business by telegraph, heretofore existing, have been discontinued, to the detri - ment of the complainant. A hearing- was had in the above case at the office of the Nebraska State Railway Commission on January 25, 1909, at which time it was Formal Complaint No. 55. </seg>
            <seg id="p103">103 developed by the evidence that the complainant was greatly incon - venienced in the shipment of live stock on account of not being able to get reliable information as to when cars would be furnished for such shipments, and also as to when cars would be moved after having been loaded. The evidence showed that it was not an infrequent occurrence for cars of stock to be loaded and have to remain at the station for several hours before being moved, owing to lack of facilities for getting information as to the time of arrival of trains, making it necessary to load stock in order to be in readiness for trains supposed to be on schedule time. I As to grain shipments, the evidence did not show that there had &gt; any great inconvenience, but it was shown that a son of Mr. spie's competitor had been installed as agent for the railway com - ' at Mynard and that the agent's father audits the accounts at said on, thus giving the complainant's competitor the advantage of a vledge of all business transacted through that station. tAs to the commercial telegraph, the evidence does not show that e is or has been a sufficient amount of this business to justify the mission in ordering it installed, under existing circumstances, in - uch as the showing is made that all messages will be received and smitted by telephone to Union, and thence by telegraph, the Western m Telegraph Company assuming responsibility for the same. I The Commission finds from the evidence that the service to stock pers is inadequate, but whether due to the change made from graph to telephone equipment, or carelessness on the part of the jraph operator in communicating information to the telephone oper - , or otherwise, we are not fully advised. KThe Commission further finds that the business at the stations of ay and Wyoming is of considerable amount, and is transacted by hone service, and up to this time there has been no complaint of ervice at said stations.

Attest: CLARK PERKINS, Secretary. [SEAL] Formal Complaint No. 58. Berger-Gallagher Bros. Co., Complainant, v. Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, Defendant. J. W. James for Complainant. Halleck F. Rose for Defendant. HENRY T. CLARKE, Jr., Chairman: The complainant herein, a partnership, is engaged in the business of loading, shipping and selling sand from a sand pit located near Brickton, Nebraska. In substance the complaint alleges that some time during the month of November, 1906, it entered into an agreement with the defendant company whereby defendant, upon the payment of nine hun - dred thirty-four dollars ($934.00) by complainant, was to construct a sidetrack from a point on its main line between Hastings and Red Cloud to complainant's sand pit, and that it was further agreed that the sum so advanced by the complainant was to be paid back to complainant by defendant, by a certain sum agreed upon, upon each car of sand shipped </seg>
            <seg id="p105">105 out by complainant until the amount so advanced by complainant was repaid; that defendant refuses to refund any of said sums to the com - plainant. Complainant further alleged, in substance, that defendant, prior and subsequent to the locating and construction of its sidetrack, constructed other sidetracks within the state to certain private industries (naming them), and that the original cost which was advanced by the private industries has been refunded by the defendant company; and that the above facts constitute a discrimination against the complainant. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which was in the nature of a demurrer, and to the effect that the complaint did not state a cause of action under the statute. On the hearing on the motion, defendant insisted and complainant admitted that a railroad company is under no legal obligation to con - struct a spur track from its line to the place of business of a ship - per for the private benefit of the owner in the shipping of his product; and that the carrier could not be held liable in damages for unlawful discrimination because of its refusal to build such track, although it had permitted to be built, and assisted in building, similar tracks to other industries. Harp v. Choctaw, O. dt G. By. Co., 118 Fed. 169. Affirmed C. C. A., 125 Fed. 445. Complainant insists, however, that defendant, having constructed the spur track to complainant's sand bank, was, under the law, obligated to repay complainant for the cost of same, on a basis similar to that on which it repaid other industries for the moneys advanced to defray the cost of constructing spur tracks to their industries. We cannot see the logic of this reasoning. If complainant relies on its contract with defendant to refund the cost of the spur track advanced, it is clearly a matter for the courts to grant the desired relief, and not within the jurisdiction of this Commission. Can it be said that if defendant entered into an agreemen. whereby it was to build the spur track in question for the complainant, and at complainant's expense, said spur track to be devoted to the exclusive use and to be subject to the absolute control of complainant, that, having in good faith and in the capacity of contractor constructed said spur track, the defendant's character or position as a contractor ceased, and 'hat, as a common carrier, it was under any greater obligation to bear the expense of same after completion than it was to construct it in the first instance? We are clearly of the opinion that the completion of the track by the defendant under such a contract does not change the situation or the position of the parties. If such a position were taken by the Commission and the courts, the railroad companies, admittedly better equipped and more willing to con - struct spur tracks for prospective patrons at a minimum cost, would thereafter refuse to accommodate the public in this regard. Nor, as previously stated, does the fact that the defendant company constructed spur tracks to other private industries at its own expense. </seg>
            <seg id="p106">106 said tracks being subject to defendant's ownership and control, add any - thing to complainant's rights or defendant's obligations in the premises. Any contrary ruling would clearly conflict with the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Missouri Pacific Rail - way Co. v. State of Nebraska, 164 U. S. 403, wherein it was held that KA statute of a state, by which, as construed by the Supreme Court i state, a board of transportation is authorized to require a railroad corporation, which has permitted the erection of two elevators by pri - vate persons on its right-of-way at a station, to grant upon like terms and conditions a location upon that right-of-way to other private per - sons in the neighborhood, for the purpose of erecting thereon a third elevator, in which to store their grain from time to time, is a taking of private property of the railroad corporation for a private use, in violation of the fourteenth article of amendment of the constitution of the United States." Counsel for complainant further argued, although it is not alleged in the complaint, that the defendant was repaying the advancements made by certain shippers for the construction of switch tracks by making an allowance of a definite amount on each carload shipped, and that by so doing it in substance reduced the rate and amounted to a device whereby a rebate was granted, and resulted in unjust discrimination as against complainant. Counsel cited and submitted cases holding "That the payment of a switching charge to a shipper for switching bis own freight over his own private tracks is clearly illegal, not even purporting to be on account of any service which the railroad was itself bound to perform as a common carrier; that the payment by a carrier of drayage charges for hauling feight to or from its terminal to certain shippers and not to others, also constituted an illegal rebate; that the lease of a wharf by a terminal company to a particular shipper, reliev - ing him from wharfage charges, exacted from other shippers, and giving him special facilities for storing and treating commodities which other shippers could not obtain at like expense, constituted an undue prefer - ence, where by reason of lack of space the terminal company could not have made similar arrangements with complainant's competitors." I The facts in these and other cases submitted are not analagous to one at bar in that in those cases the carrier participated in a device reby one shipper was able to make a shipment at a lower net rate i his competitors for substantially the same service, while in the i at bar, the defendant company has exercised its admitted right and retionary power to build and pay for a switch track to one industry refuses to pay for a switch track to a similar industry. I Counsel for complainant, for the purpose of argument, assumed that defendant was repaying advancements made by other competing ipers by making a specific allowance of a definite amount on each oad of freight shipped to or from their manufacturing plants. Such Kictice would be objectionable on the ground that it presents too the appearance of a purchase of property by the carrier with trans- Uon, which is contrary to law. State v.

Union Pacific Railroad Company, Defend- C. J. Smyth for Complainant. Edson Rich for Defendant. HENRY T. CLARKE, Jr., Chairman: I The complainant, a Nebraska corporation engaged in the manufacture sale of flour, and the operation of a flour mill in Omaha, Douglas ity, Nebraska, complains that the defendant company, a common car - engaged in transporting property between stations in this state, pub - !S and maintains the following schedule of rates on flour and wheat, it: Schuyler Columbus Ben ton To Omaha Omaha Omaha Omaha Omaha Rati Wheat 11.05 cents 9.35 " 10.2 9.35 " 9.35 " te per 1C i 00 lbs. Flour. 9.98 cents 8.5 8.5 8.5 </seg>
            <seg id="p108">108 that the rate on both wheat and flour from Omaha to the points abov named is the same as the rate on wheat, as above set forth, from sai stations to Omaha; that the maintenance and collection of a lower rat for the transportation of flour to Omaha than is charged for the trans portation of wheat is unjust and unreasonable relatively, and operate to unjustly discriminate against the complainant and in favor of mil located on defendant's lines at the stations above named; and that th maintenance and collection of a lower rate for the transportation o flour from the stations above named to Omaha than is maintained an collected for the transportation of flour from Omaha to said stations con stitutes an unjust, unreasonable discrimination against the complainan and in favor of the mills located on defendant's line at the stations abov named, and prays that the discrimination be abolished by raising th flour rate to the basis of the wheat rate, or vice versa. I J. the time of filing the complaint in this case, other complaints were by complainant against the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad *ny and the Chicago &amp; North-Western Railway Company, complain - lat said companies were maintaining and collecting a lower schedule tes from certain stations on their lines on flour than on wheat, and lur from such stations to Omaha than from Omaha to such stations. Phe millers known to the Commission to be operating at the stations i in the foregoing complaints were advised of the time and place of earing, and while a few set forth their objections to the granting f prayer of the complainant in letters addressed to the Commission, appeared in person or by representative. ■Inasmuch as the same principle was involved in all three cases, and schedules of rates complained of were admitted by the pleadings, the 8, for the purpose of taking evidence and submitting arguments, were lolidated. It appeared from the testimony that approximately ten per cent, of the stations at which mills are located on the lines of the defendants involved in these cases receive the benefit of a preferential rate in favor of flour as against wheat from such stations to Omaha; that the rate on flour from ninety per cent, of such stations to Omaha was the same as wheat, and that these mills were prosperous. If it is to be decided in these cases that flour is entitled to a cheaper rate than wheat, those stations from which flour takes the same rate to Omaha as wheat would have just cause for complaint, unless special or controlling circumstances justified the maintenance of a different rate from the stations herein involved. {Nothing appearing from the evidence that would justify a discrimi - &gt;n in favor of the ten per cent, of milling stations outside of Omaha igainst the remaining ninety per cent, the question presented for iion is on the general proposition as to whether flour should be trans - ed at a lower rate than wheat. As was said by the Interstate Commerce Commission in the case of Howard Mills Co. v. Missouri Pacific By. Co. et al, 12 I. C. C. Rep. 261, &amp; case involving the charging of ten cents per hundred pounds more for </seg>
            <seg id="p109">109 Eansportation of flour from Kansas points to California, than the contemporaneously exacted for the transportation of wheat between me points: I 'Flour is a manufactured article, and the general rule is that the material takes a somewhat lower rate than the finished product value of flour is greater than that of wheat, and this would tend to Fy a somewhat higher transportation charge. It is probable that, he whole, wheat affords a more attractive kind of traffic to the er than does flour, and this, too, would sanction a lower rate. It ue that in most parts of the country the classification of the two les is the same and the rates of transportation the same." (See Chicago Lire Stoat Exch. &gt;: C, G. W. K&gt;j. Co. d a/. 10 I. C. C. 429.) The evidence is not conclusive why the carriers departed from tne above rule in the first instance and placed a lower rate on flour than on wheat from these points. It is probable, as was suggested, that it was done for the purpose of permitting the millers at the favored stations to compete on more equal terms with Minneapolis millers, at that time en - joying favored rates. It was conceded, however, by defendants that what - ever the reason may have been (and particularly if the one above sug - gested were the right one) that, on account of changed conditions, the reasons for such exceptions to the general rule had ceased to exist. The fact that many other mills operating in the interior of the state are flourishing, who are not the beneficiaries of a preferential flour rate, tends to corroborate the evidence adduced and justify these conclusions. I As previously stated, none of the millers operating at the points plained of appeared and submitted evidence, and only two submitted ctions to any change, in the form of letters. At a previous hearing aother case involving the same questions, submitted on the application tie railroads and subsequently continued indefinitely, certain millers 'ating at the stations complained of did appear and in substance red the same arguments against any change as were submitted in letters herein referred to, to- wit: I That it requires for a barrel of flour about 280 pounds of wheat. uming that there was no shrinkage in the manufacture, this would e eighty-four pounds of offal, commonly known as bran and shorts, sold for feeding purposes. That the Omaha miller is able to dispose his offal at a better advantage. That the Omaha millers, by reason heir location, are able to procure wheat to a greater advantage than country miller, by reason of the greater supply moving to the Omaha ket and stored in the large terminal elevators, and the better grading ;rain at the terminal market. I It appeared from the evidence that complainant did not utilize any plies of wheat stored at any terminal elevators, by reason of certain is of expense which would render such purchase unprofitable; that purchases were made direct from country elevators, in competition l the country millers, or on the floor of the exchange in the cash n market. The question of grading is hardly material, but if so, should operate </seg>
            <seg id="p110">110 in favor of the cssntry miller, purchasing on his own inspection, while the Omaha miller must purchase subject to the inspection of a disinter - ested inspector. Assuming, as contended by the country millers, that there are natural advantages which Omaha millers enjoy by reason of their location, should the Commission passively or actively consent to or ap - prove of a schedule of rates, indefensible in itself, which arbitrarily destroys or overcomes such natural advantages? In the opinion of the Commission, such a practice would be contrary to well established princi - ples and would eventually lead to the same evils which existed prior to k recent rate legislation, whereby a railroad, by arbitrary action in Wishing its rates, could determine which locality should flourish or h shipper should prosper. ■Each locality is entitled to have and retain, as against all other lities, the benefits which naturally accrue to it by reason of its ad - ageous location.

Rep. 195-245; 4 I. C. C. Rep. 592. Interstate Commerce Commission v. L. dt N. Rd. Co., 50 Fed. Rep 295-306. The country millers insist that there is less risk attached to th transportation of flour than of wheat; that the only chance of loss i transit to goods shipped in sacks, such as flour, is pilferage, while wheat the chances are greater by reason of cars being strained an springing a leak; that in cases of wrecks, goods in sacks will be piled up and are easily gathered, while grain is wasted; that in cases of flood grain soaked with water is worthless for anything except distilling pu poses, while flour 'becoming wet forms a coating next to the sack, leavin the goods inside of the coat intact. Ehese propositions, while possibly true, are not of sufficient force to f the maintenance of a lower rate on this manufactured product on the raw material, particularly when the general practice is to e the former article the same or a higher rate than the latter. Besides, as was held by the Interstate Commerce Commission in the case of Chicago Lire Stock Exchange v. C, G. W. Ry. Co., 12 I. C. C. Rep. 451: "In determining what the relation should be between the rates Iged for transporting two different freight articles, value is often mportant factor, but this is not alone because of the greater risk lected with the transportation of the more valuable articles. Im - ements made during recent years in the roadbed and equipment of iers have rendered the item of risk in many cases of little conse - ce. The value of the article is important, principally, because of learing upon the value to the shipper of the transportation service; the value of the service is and has always been considered by Iers one of the most important elements to be considered when fixing -ates to be charged for transportation." While the relative value of flour and wheat does not appear in the </seg>
            <seg id="p111">111 El, it is a matter of common knowledge that a hundred pounds of is worth one hundred and fifty per cent, or more, of one hundred 8 of wheat. I The country millers at the stations herein involved are on equal is with the Omaha millers, so far as obtaining wheat west of their ons, to be marketed as flour at Missouri River points and beyond, is ■erned. A milling in transit privilege is allowed, whereby a miller olumbus can ship grain from a point west of Columbus, stop it for ing at Columbus, and ship the manufactured product through Omaha oint of destination at the same rate as the Omaha miller, to-wit: the at rate. By reason of the foregoing facts, the Commission is of the opinion that the present differential in favor of flour as against wheat from the stations herein named to Omaha, is unjustly and unduly discriminatory, and so finds.

B Tariff No. 3333 of the Chicago., Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Com - r, carries the following rule: "The following exception to above basis will govern on live stock (except racing stock): Regular rates will be charged to the fair; no change of ownership having occurred; with proper evidence from the secretary of its exhibition, it will be returned free at owners' risk. Rac - ing stock will be charged for at full tariff both ways. The regular live stock contract must be executed with valuation as follows: etc." Circular No. 652-C governed shipments to and from fairs on the Missouri Pacific Railroad up to and including 1908: I 'All freight from points within the state of Nebraska intended for bition at the state fair at Lincoln, during the year 1907, may be d to Lincoln at tariff rates, all charges prepaid, except specimen , grain, grasses, alfalfa and vegetables, which may be billed free, presentation to the agent at Lincoln of a certificate from the ?tary of the fair that the goods have actually been on exhibition, have not changed ownership, they will be returned free. On presen - n of the same certificate to the agent at the station from which the ment was originally made, the prepaid charges will be refunded, ided that all articles shipped be returned. If any part of the </seg>
            <seg id="p116">116 Iinal consignment be disposed of at Lincoln, the agent will retain i proportion of the prepaid charges as may be due at tariff rates to oln on the articles not returned. The certificate of the secretary le fair must be surrendered to the railroad agent when the prepaid gee or any portion of them are refunded. The following exceptions he above basis will govern on live stock: Racing stock will take tariff rates both ways; on all other live stock, no change of owner - having occurred and with proper evidence from the secretary of exhibition, it will be returned free at owner's risk; the regular stock contract must be executed, with valuation as follows: etc." The practice of the Union Pacific Railroad Company is publisheu In G. F. O. No. 10252, and reads as follows: "The freight will be waybilled at owner's risk of damage, at regula rates, to each point of exhibition; and at the close of each fair, on pre sentation of a certificate from the secretary of the fair of its exhibitio and that no change of ownership has occurred, the inbound charges wil be reduced to one-half of the tariff rate. Exception: On shipments o fruit, grain or vegetables, exhibited at fairs or exhibitions in Kansa Nebraska, Utah, Idaho (between points on the Oregon Short Line Rai road), Colorado, Wyoming or Montana the freight charges will be r funded upon presentation of certificate from secretary that such ship ments have been placed on exhibition, etc." Item 3 carries this rule: "The usual live stock contract must be executed in the regular man - ner for shipments of live stock, with valuations as follows: etc." I "Rule No. 4 : Shipments of race horses are not to receive the benefit lis rule, but are in all cases to be charged full tariff rates both ways, ness, sulkies and other articles transported with shipments of race es, will be charged for at tariff rates on such articles. Shipments arses, mules and asses to or from state or county fairs held at points he Union Pacific Railroad will be charged full tariff rates both ways." Kie rules governing on the Chicago &amp; North-Western Railway are r to those of the Union Pacific. It appears that there are in practice apparently discriminatory rules which operate to the detriment of complainant, but that under the pro - visions of the law the power to correct the same in this instance does not appear to be given this Commission. ■Subdivision g, section 14, article 8, chapter 72, Compiled Statutes 907, provides as follows: f Nothing in this act shall prevent the carriage, storage, or handling eight free of charge or at reduced rates for the state, or for any county or town government, or for charitable purposes, or to and fairs and expos: tions for exhib'uon thereat." Ee legislature intended evidently to allow the railway companies cise reasonable discretion in handling the commodities enumer - l the section above quoted. Cases might arise where the con - ' the carrier would not be justified while pretending to operate the authority conferred by the above statute, and this conduct amount in certain cases to an unjust discrimination that would t the Commission in declaring against the same by the issuance order to prevent further abuses, but until it is made clearly to that there has been an abuse of discretion by the defendants in </seg>
            <seg id="p117">117 carrying certain commodities free or at reduced rates, this Commission will take no action. I It could not be successfully contended that the Commission could )el the railway companies, against their will, to carry freight for of the purposes enumerated in the statute above mentioned, free or reduced rate. The defendants therefore have a right to make reas - le classifications of commodities to be carried free or at reduced rates for the purposes above mentioned. ORDER.

NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION HENRY T. CLARKE, Jr., Chairman. Attest: CLARK PERKINS, Secretary. [SEAL] Formal Complaint No. 77. L. A. Northrup, Complainant, v. Miller Telephone Company, Defendant. Fred A. Nye for Complainant. H. Ehresman for Defendant. HENRY T. CLARKE, Jr., Chairman: The complainant, Mrs. L. A. Northrup, complains that the Miller Tele - phone Company, a mutual telephone association operating an exchange at Miller, Buffalo county, Nebraska, neglects and refuses to attach com - plainant's telephone to its line, and refuses to grant her telephone service. A hearing was had, due notice having been given to all parties, at Miller, Nebraska, August 24, 1909. I From the evidence, it appeared that the defendant company is a ual telephone association, operating an exchange and farm lines at around Miller, Nebraska. While neither the articles of incorporation by-laws was introduced in evidence, it appeared that the defendant pany was organized without following carefully the requirements of law, and that some three or more years ago residents in Miller and arms adjacent thereto organized for the purpose of providing for tele - le service at that point. Members of the association subscribed $20.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p123">123 130.00 to the stock of the company, from the proceeds of which the odant company built the exchange and the lines, the members furnish - their own telephones. I Subsequently, the members of the defendant company found that the unt paid in by the several members was not sufficient to cover the ;nse of building the exchange and lines, and at a regular meeting, notice having been given, made an assessment on their respective ibers of ten dollars ($10.00) each. ■Later, articles of association were drawn, executed and filed with :ounty clerk of Buffalo county. I Some time subsequent to this, the monthly dues paid by the members he association and subscribers of the defendant company being in - dent to pay the expenses of the defendant company, the association, meeting regularly held, made an assessment upon all subscribers of iollars ($6.00). I Under the rules of the association, a subscriber having subscribed bis original telephone thirty dollars ($30.00) in stock, was permitted lave additional telephone service upon subscribing and paying ten irs ($10.00) more for each additional telephone, in consideration of i stockholder furnishing material, his own instruments, and paying the cost of the connections. This provision was open to all sub - &gt;ers alike. KPhe first assessment of ten dollars ($10.00) was made only against stockholder, irrespective of the number of telephones owned by and served by the defendant company; the subsequent assessment t dollars ($6.00) was made against all telephones. It further appeared from the evidence that when the company was organized, C. M. Foltz, the father of the complainant, subscribed twenty dollars ($20.00) to the stock of the defendant company, paid for his own telephone, and far a considerable length of time was afforded tele - phone service by the defendant company. The stock was issued to Mr. Foltz, but was never delivered. E further appeared that Mrs. Northrup, the complainant in this case daughter of Mr. Foltz, furnished the money for the stock and is the ble owner of the same. I Demand was made by the company upon Mr. Foltz at various times ay the ten-dollar and six-dollar assessments, and upon his refusal ay tie same, his telephone was disconnected. Both the complainant Mr. Foltz at the hearing refused to pay such assessments and stated they would dispense with the telephone service rather than pay i assessments. I Complaint was further made that the defendant company was dis - inating against complainant in that it was furnishing service to one &gt;rn, who was not the owner of any stock, and who had never paid any ssment other than the monthly dues for telephone service of thirty - (35) cents, paid by all subscribers to cover the expense of operating central exchange. </seg>
            <seg id="p124">124 From the evidence it appeared that the rule of the company is not to furnish service or build its lines to any subscriber a distance of more than one (1) mile. Osborn was located a distance of two (2) miles from the defendant's lines and in the direction of a neighboring exchange. With the consent of the company, and in consideration of Mr. Osborn construct - ing his own line for two miles to the defendant's line, the defendant com - pany permitted such connection, and is furnishing him service upon the payment of the central dues charged all subscribers. Mr. Osborn averred his willingness as was corroborated by the officers of the defendant com - pany, to become a stockholder of the defendant company on the same terms and conditions as all other stockholders, at such time as the rules of the defendant company would permit. At the same time, Mr. Osborn is a subscriber to another exchange and, with the consent of both ex - changes, is operating a switchboard at his residence without charge, whereby the subscribers of the two companies may communicate with one another. t Complainant justified her refusal to pay the assessments to the de - ant company by reason of the poor and inadequate service furnished, has been prompt in the payment of her central dues, and at the time le disconnection of her telephone from defendant's lines had paid for ral months in advance. It appeared from the testimony that complainant was not alone suffering from the poor and inadequate service afforded by defendant company; that all subscribers suffered to a greater or less extent, and that the proceeds of the assessment made were used in a large measure to improve the service. All of the stockholders of the defendant company, with the exception of the complainant, have paid the assessments. I In the case of Rushville Co-op. Tel. Co. v. Inin, 27 Ind. App. 62, the ndant company had a rule that all money due it or its toll connec - s was payable at the office of the secretary on or before the 5th day he month succeeding the maturity of such indebtedness, and if not 1 on or before that date, the service of the delinquent should be ontinued until the indebtedness was paid. The subscriber was in - :ed to the company eighty (80) cents for dues for the month of June, ch he failed and refused to pay, although payment was demanded at place of business prior to the 13th day of July, the date of disconnec - . The court, in sustaining the telephone company in disconnecting. I "It cannot be denied that a rule of the company requiring these athly payments to be made in advance would not be an unreasonable e, and that upon refusal so to pay, service could be denied. The ipany must protect its plant and keep up its efficiency, and may en - ce a rule that insures a reasonable revenue and its prompt receipt. :an maintain an efficient service only through prompt payment of its •s and tolls, and because of that fact it may use a summary remedy denying service for non-payment. ••••••• t "Keeping in view the nature of the company's duties and the service .ay be compelled to render, it must be held that the company may irce the payment of its current dues and tolls by the summary </seg>
            <seg id="p125">125 remedy of denying service, regardless of the fact that the subscriber claims the company is indebted to him." This case is quoted with approval in the case of Buffalo Co. Tel. . Turner, 118 N. W. 1064. The principle laid down in the above cases applies with equal fore to mutual telephone companies, where the members of such companie for the maintenance of the service, subscribe and pay their pro rota por tion of any expense necessary to maintain such service. The stockholder of the defendant company, with the exception of the complainant, hav all paid for the maintenance and up-keep of the service of the defendan company sixteen dollars ($16.00), in addition to what the complainant has paid, which amount the complainant still refuses to pay. It is apparen that had these assessments not been paid by the stockholders of the de - fendant company, no service worthy of the name could have been give The complainant being a stockholder of the defendant company and refu ing to bear her portion of the expense necessary to maintain the com pany's lines and exchange in proper condition to afford a fair service, not entitled to demand service at the hands of the company upon the pa ment of the central dues alone. She is, however, entitled to a refund o such an amount as has been paid in by her for central dues, for whic she has not received any service. I While the situation with reference to the furnishing of service to &gt;rn appears to be a discrimination, we are of the opinion that, under evidence, the facts are not such as constitute an undue and unjust rimination. KThe Commission finds that upon the defendant company refunding , sum to the complainant as she has paid in advance for central dues, for which she has received no service, the complaint should be lissed. ORDER. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission that upon the refunding to the complainant herein of such sums as have been paid by said complainant as central dues in advance, for which no service has been given, the above complaint be dismissed. ■ Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 2nd day of Septem - 1909.

The evidence rs that there is no store or any mercantile interests now at Constance; the postoffice of Constance has been discontinued by the government; the blacksmith shop which existed there for a time has moved to ton, and that there are no interests now at Constance except a Catholic •ch, parsonage and public school.

            <seg id="p129">129 APPLICATIONS. In the Matter of the Application of Union Stock Yards Company of Omaha (Limited) for Permission to Increase Switching Rates at South Omaha. HENRY T. CLARKE, Jr., Chairman: I This matter arises on the application of Union Stock Yards Com - ' of Omaha (Limited) for permission to increase certain of its switch - rates. The applicant herein is engaged in the operation of a stock 8 at South Omaha, Nebraska, and, as a part of its service, carries on conducts a general switching business of carload freight between the stries located on its rails and the transfer tracks of connecting It appears from the testimony that this company was first organized in 1884; that the original occasion for its organization was to meet the demand of the carriers who required stock yards facilities, where stock destined to markets beyond could be loaded, unloaded and fed in transit. Gradually packing industries were induced to locate on or adjacent to the property of the applicant, and a live stock market was developed, which has now grown to large proportions. In the beginning the track facilities were built by the carriers, and the switching was performed by the railroads themselves or by one railroad for another. As the business of the yards developed and the congestion of traffic increased, it became apparent that, in order to avoid confusion and furnish prompt and adequate service, the switching must be performed by one company. An agreement was accordingly entered into, whereby the applicant herein bought the tracks built by the railroads and undertook to perform the necessary switching service. It does not appear from the record when the switching business was first taken over by the applicant, nor the basis on which it was performed. It does appear, however, that on April 27, 1896, a certain agreement was entered into in writing by and between the applicant herein and Union Pacific Railway, Fremont, Elkhorn &amp; Missouri Valley R. R. Co., and Burlington &amp; Missouri River R. R. in Nebr., in words and figures as follows: I At conference held in Omaha, Monday, April 27, 1896, between sentatives Messrs. W. A. Paxton and W. X. Babcock of the Union E Yards and Railroad Company of South Omaha, and the Union Ic Railway, represented by Messrs. E. Dickinson and J. A. Munroe; I. &amp; M. V. R. R. by A. H. Merchants; B. &amp;. M.

On all outbound shipments of dead freight (with exception of cinders and rubbish) loaded by packers, including shipments of packing house product, dressed beef, etc., a switching charge of two ($2.00) dollars per car to be made. This is not to apply on cars destined to Omaha, on which the maximum switching charge will be one ($1.00) dollar per car. "5. On cinders and rubbish loaded by packers, a charge of one ($1.00) dollar per car for switching to connecting lines. "6.

The rates provided for in this agreement are still in effect on state business, and it is the object and prayer of the petition filed herein to increase the following switching rates: 1. For live stock received from or delivered to connecting lines, from 50 cents to $1.00 per car. 2. For all commodities received from connecting lines for industries located on the tracks of the applicant, from $1.00 to $2.00 per car. P.

For switching cars from one part of petitioner's yards to another, or from the tracks of one industry to those of another, from 50 cents to $1.00 per car, whether loaded or empty. </seg>
            <seg id="p131">131 Inder the application, two questions present themselves forcibly to ammisslon: First, are the applicants entitled to the relief prayed Second, upon whom shall the burden of paying the increased fall? The carriers doing business with the applicant were duly notified o the filing of the petition herein, but in order that no question of juris diction, etc., should arise, the Commission did, on the 17th day of Augus issue an order, directed to all carriers doing business between station in Nebraska, again advising them of the petition filed herein and com manding them to file their answers on or before August 27, 1908, and further, to show cause why they should not be compelled to absorb an and all of such additional switching charges to be allowed the applican herein, as might appear to the Commission to be just and reasonable. Inuring the course of the original hearing it developed that certain :hing service and facilities (more particularly the switching of cattle q transit, shipped on through rates, and the movement of empty and id cars between industries located on applicant's tracks) was being shed free, or at a charge disproportionately low to the charges made sther classes of service. An order was therefore entered, fixing mber 5, 1908, as the date for hearing with reference to all facilities service furnished and performed by the applicant. A copy of the r was mailed to all industries located on applicant's tracks. I The business of the applicant, as heretofore stated, includes the ing and feeding of live stock, in addition to the switching of cars and ;ht to and from the industries located on the applicant's tracks, from to the tracks of connecting carriers; also between the various indus - located on applicant's tracks, and also between the transfer tracks Dnnecting carriers. I The Commission is of the opinion that its jurisdiction with reference tie business of the applicant extends only so far as it is devoted to sportation. This includes all trackage, motive power, rolling stock, estate and improvements devoted entirely to switching, and the load- ing and unloading chutes. ■The value of the switching plant &gt;ars to be: as established by the testimony, 57V4 acres of land at $19,000 per acre ...$1,092,500 Iiiles of track at $12,500 per mile 433,500 gines at $11,000 each 55,000 iglnes at $6,000 each 36,000 ad house, machine shop, sand house, oil house, coal platform, pipe line, etc 17,000 hinery and tools in shop 15,000 ellaneous buildings S.SM r cars 500 eking tools 500 :k tools 1,000 $1,653,500 </seg>
            <seg id="p132">132 The value of the chute plants appears from the testimony to be: I These values are submitted by the employes of the petitioner herein, real estate values offered were corroborated by the testimony of ry D. Reed, who qualified as an expert, having served on the board of ew for the city of Omaha for three different years (1897, 1898, and ) and as county assessor of Douglas county for the four years from to 1908, in which capacity he had occasion to assess the property itn involved. The other values submitted were subject to the examination and criticism of the representatives of the various carriers, who, it would seem, were in a position and thoroughly qualified to controvert or cor - rect any misstatements or inaccuracies in applicant's testimony, so far as it related to values of trackage, rolling stock, motive power, etc. The attitude of the carriers, however, throughout the entire investigation was enigmatical, at times disclosing a half-hearted opposition to the proposed increase, but at no time challenging directly the reasonableness of the increased rates applied for. Iln the absence of any expert testimony obtained by the Commission the failure of the carriers to controvert them, the values submitted ;r oath by the applicant must be presumed to be fair for the purpose bis inquiry. I The Commission is not sufficiently advised at this time to 'eel ified in fixing a definite value on the property of the applicant de - d to switching purposes, but it is of the opinion that there is a cient margin between the value of the property, as disclosed by the mony, and the value on which the increased earnings under th« &gt;osed new schedule would pay reasonable dividends and depreciation ges, to sustain it in generally granting the petition of the applicant. I Six per cent, interest, if allowed on the applicant's valuation, would unt to $112,046.46, and a depreciation allowance on the entire plant tching and chutes), exclusive of land values, would increase it by »04.06, making a total for depreciation and interest of $150,950.52.

This is in strong contrast with the business of and 1897: applicant during the years 1896 1896 1897 1907 Earnings $120,659.26 $162,127.79 $277,368.22 Expenses 70,909.00 95,289.50 266,463.35 Net earnings $ 49,749.79 $ 66,838.29 $ 10.904.87 Expense ratio 59% 59% 96% The increase in the ratio of expenses to earnings from 59 per cent. E6 to 96 per cent, in 1907 is explained by the general increase in cost or and materials, and is specifically illustrated by applicant's ex - showing that wages have increased from 1896 to 1907 from 9.4 per on the yardmaster's wages to 53.85 per cent, on track foreman's ; that the 1896 wage scale applied to 1907 business would have de - ■d the wage expense by $23,352.61; and that the increase in payroll Eison of increase in wages and greater number of men employed in 1907 over 1896, amounted to $91,375.84. In addition to the expense items shown above, the applicant is re- quired periodically to expend large sums of money in constructing and maintaining viaducts over its tracks at South Omaha. In 1908 the appli - cant was required to expend $60,000 as its proportion of the reconstruc- tion cost of the viaduct over Q street. It further appears that the average annual cost of repairs paid out tie petitioner during the past seven years is $1,674.28 on the L street $2,200.27 on the Q street viaducts. Of this amount only $95.09 ap - ?d in the expenses submitted by petitioner for its 1907 business, be - b the railroad which does the repairing was slow in sending in the repair bills. Under this showing, the petitioners are clearly entitled to some relief. From the evidence it appears that during the year ending Decem- ber 31, 1907, petitioners handled 230,405 cars as follows: Inbound. Outbound. Total.

            <seg id="p135">135 This statement does not take any account of the switching of empty cars in for loading or the switching of empty cars out after unloading. The empty car switching set forth in the above statement includes only the empty cars switched between the transfers of various railroads, on which a revenue was received. Included in this statement are some 2,246 cars of cattle fed in transit, for which no charge was made. This has been the practice since the petitioner took over the business of switch - ing, and is a part of the agreement heretofore referred to. This is a ser - vice requiring the switching of loaded cars into the chutes and out from the same, as well as the unloading and loading of such cars, and by the present practice all expense incurred in its performance is being paid by parties receiving no benefit whatever. The Commission has no information as to what proportion of this business is state and what is interstate, and is therefore not in a position to issue an order covering same; but it is the opinion of the Commission that a revenue should be derived from this It further appeared from the evidence that the expense, labor and time involved in the movement of cars, loaded and empty, between in - dustries located on applicant's tracks was as great as on movements from the transfer tracks of connecting carriers to those industries, and in the opinion of the Commission the same rates should apply. There is also included in this statement 9,044 cars of grain switched in to the Updike Elevator Company from connecting railroads, on which no charge is made. This is defended by the applicant on the grounds that, having switching facilities, etc., it was to their interest to increase their business, and that it was necessary to offer the Updike Elevator Company terms equal to those which they might obtain on other carriers' tracks; that by making a free inbound switch it secured the switching of 8,607 cars out from that company and an added revenue to petitioner of $2.00 per car. No request is made herein to increase these rates, and no material or satisfactory reason or objection was submitted to the end that they be disturbed. It is also to be noted that the statement of cars switched includes cars, empty and loaded, which were moved in swiching as a part of an interstate movement What proportion or number of the cars detailed in the foregoing statement were switched as an incident of a purely state movement does not appear from the evidence. It was estimated, however, knowing the number of cattle, hogs, and sheep shipped to and from the stock yards from and to points in the state, that 61,257 cars of stock switched by the applicant should be credited to strictly intrant ate The testimony as to the exact number of dead freight cars switched Miscellaneous 19,110 1,276 13,332 AS Total , 131,590 nside switching 92,477 224,067 6,338 Grand total nMN </seg>
            <seg id="p136">136 Eplicant as an incident to a purely intrastate movement, was un - a and indefinite, but the witnesses were positive that the so-called tate shipments were few as compared with the interstate shipments. The Commission is not advised of any reason, so far as the charge of applicant are concerned, why any distinction or discrimination shou be shown in favor of intrastate shipments, as distinguished from inte state shipments. On the contrary, it is the opinion of the Commissio that, in arriving at a decision as to what is a just and equitable charg for the service performed, they should be treated alike. If this is don and applicant's petition granted, the total increase in revenue, based o the business of 1907, would be approximately $102,000 annually, or a tota net revenue of $112,934.87, an amount some $38,015.65 less than 6 p cent for dividends and 6 per cent, on depreciable property, as submitte by the applicant. The Commission, however, is of the opinion that a charge of $1.50 for switching and unloading live stock is out of proportion to a charge of $2.00 for switching dead freight to and from the industries on de - fendant's tracks, and should not exceed $1.25, being 75 cents for switching and 50 cents for unloading. The evidence shows that the applicant averaged from ten to twelve cars per switch on live stock, involving in a great number of cases the movement from the transfer switch of the connecting carrier to the un - loading chutes of the loaded cars, and the immediate return of the empties. Only occasionally, and then only in periods of severe con - gestion, does it appear that loaded or empty live stock cars were required by the exigencies of the case to be switched to the storage tracks and held until the transfer tracks were open and the connecting carrier ready to receive them. iOn the contrary, it is shown that the switching of dead freight to from the various industries involves, in a large number of cases, leparate movements, and sometimes more. The trackage of the pack - industries at their loading and unloading docks is of so limited a acter that only a few, and in the case of one company, only two, cars be moved per switch. It is of vital importance that there be on hand 11 times a sufficient number of empty cars to supply their needs on ound shipments and sufficient supplies in the way of coal, etc., in t to meet unforseen possible contingencies, such as strikes, etc. KThis necessitates the storage of empty cars and inbound dead freight ined to the packers on tracks of the applicant, and, when any par - lar car is needed, the drilling of it out of the string on the storage ks and movement to destination. I It appeared that the majority of cars used by the packing industries lired repairs and usually icing; that in the switching here provided the charges for dead freight switching to and from the packers, the )wing service is required in a large number of cases: 1. Switching from transfer track to holding or storage track. 2. The drilling out of the empty on the storage track 3. Switching to repair track of packing house. </seg>
            <seg id="p137">137 4. Switching from repair track to icing track of packing house. 5. Switching from icing track to loading dock of packing house. 6. Switching from loading dock to holding or transfer tracks. These several movements, irrespective of distance, taking into con - sideration the small number of cars moved per switch, as compared with the live stock switching, and the larger amount of trackage and ground used for holding or storage purposes, justifies a greater difference in the rate than that submitted in applicant's petition. Ehe Commission is of the opinion that the applicant, under the facts closed by the record in this case, is entitled to an increased revenue ximating the amount to be derived from increased rates provided this order. Konsidered with the decided increase in operating expenses, two appearing in the record, in considering applicant's petition, should ; passed unnoticed: iThe applicant is performing a greater service in switching a car 908 than it did in 1896, for the reason that the cars in use at the ent time are uniformly of much greater weight and capacity. The iwing table of comparisons taken from the Official Railway Equipment ister, a publication regarded as authentic and used by railroad ials, for the years of 1893 and 1908, is convincing: CAPACITIES OF CARS.

This is evidenced by some sixteen exhibits, covering approximately 2,000 switching rates published by those carriers and offered by the applicant. Mr. Buckingham, general manager of the applicant company, and for many years in charge of the Omaha switching rates of the Union Pacific Railroad Company, testified that the service rendered at ap - plicant's yards was as great or greater than the service rendered within the several switching districts of the Union Pacific in Omaha, for which the minimum charges are $2.00 and $2.50 per car. It is further to be noted that certain of the carriers have already published interstate tariffs agreeing to absorb the increased charges here - in provided for, and at no time during the entire hearing did any of the various representatives of the carriers directly challenge the proposed rates as unreasonable or unjust. Phe question now arises: Upon whom shall the burden of paying the used rates fall? Obviously, any inside switching should be paid r the industry served in each case. With reference to dead freight ed from or delivered to connecting carriers, there is no obligation ty resting on them that they absorb and pay these charges, other that all shippers should be treated without discrimination. I The Commission is of the opinion that the carriers should absorb pay for any increase in switching charges on live stock shipments in provided for. The evidence is clear and undisputed that they have oading or unloading pens of their own at South Omaha; that, in fact, induced the organization of the applicant company and have used its ks and pens for a period of some twenty years, and by so doing have &gt;ted and designated them as their unloading station. ias 1908 60,000 1U,UUU 52,452 40,292 79,107 39,52 63,56 </seg>
            <seg id="p139">139 All stock shipped to South Omaha is intended by the shipper and the carrier to be delivered into the stock yards. It is the duty of a railroad company to provide pens, unloading facilities and yardage for its live stock traffic. That the companies originally interested admitted this in effect, i8 shown by the terms of the agreement of 1896. Now that the cost of operation has increased, and at the same time the value of the unit of service (to- wit: the increased capacity of cars), they should not refuse to pay the increased value and cost of service which they are obliged by law to furnish and perform.

I the Matter of the Application of Antelope Mutual Telephone Company of Elgin for Permission to Increase Rate for Switching Farm Lines. HENRY T. CLARKE, Jr., Chairman: KThe applicant herein operates a telephone system in Antelope ity, its principal exchanges being located at Clearwater and, icularly, Elgin. »Up to the present time it has been furnishing switching and ex - ige service to certain mutual and farm line telephone companies •h connect with applicant at its Elgin switchboard. The com- </seg>
            <seg id="p146">146 Ei involved in this application are mutual companies known as edar Valley, the Pleasant Valley, the Bunker Hill, and the Mutual Line telephone companies, hereinafter called the "farm line" inies, and the Cedar Mutual Telephone Company. Irhe said farm line companies own and maintain certain party , varying from fourteen to twenty-one telephones to the line, iting in different directions from Elgin. They operate no ex - ge of their own, and at present are dependent upon the applicant such service, for which they pay twenty-five cents per month 'phone. The Cedar Mutual Telephone Company operates an exchange at Oakdale, a town about eleven miles northeast of Elgin, and serves some two hundred and twenty-five subscribers. Up to the present time this company and the applicant herein have afforded an un - limited interchange of service, without additional cost to their re - spective subscribers. Three of the party lines of the Cedar Mutual Company, serving some fifty-three telephones, extend to Elgin and are connected with the switchboard of the applicant at that point. Ehe prayer of the application herein is for permission to increase ate for switching the said farm lines from twenty-five cents to cents per month, and to charge those subscribers of the Cedar il Telephone Company who are naturally tributary to the Elgin nge and do their trading at that place (some twenty-five or more mber) the same rate. ■ill of the companies interested were duly notified, and a hearing held at Neligh on February 11, 1909. II t appears from the evidence that up to March, 1908, there wer telephone exchanges operated at Elgin, otoe by the applican one by the Northern Antelope Telephone Company; that the farm were then connected with the applicant's exchange, which a time was furnishing a more or less unsatisfactory fourteen-hou ice to its own two hundred and twenty-five subscribers and som mty-five additional telephones; that for this service the farm were paying twenty-five cents per month per telephone. Ther not appear to have been any contract as to the length of tim lg which this service was to be furnished at that price. The tbiee lines of the Cedar Mutual Telephone Company involved in this application were, previous to the consolidation of the two ex changes, connected with the Northern Antelope County Telephone Com pany's exchange at Elgin, and a free interchange of service was afforde the subscribers without additional charge under an agreement whic expired some time during- August, 1908. There does not appear to h&amp;v been any contract between those companies for a continuance of th interchange, nor was any provision made for its continuance by th consolidated company. The applicant herein, on or about December 12, 1908, called a meeting of its own stockholders and those of the other companies hereiu </seg>

Upon the Commission's attention having ;ied to applicant's failure in this regard, it was ordered to t and continue the service in question pending the filing of its on and a determination by the Commission of the rights of the It further appears from the evidence that the number of telephones belonging to and operated by the applicant is two hundred and eighty - four; that by reason of contracts for free interchange with other com - panies, including the telephones of farm lines for which it furnishes a switching and exchange service, its patrons can now reach approximately twelve hundred telephones; that this service includes free long distance connection with Oakdale, Neligh and Clearwater exchanges, which service its subscribers and farm line patrons did not enjoy previous to the consolidation; that a satisfactory twenty-four hour service has been substituted for the previous uncertain and unsatisfactory fourteen-hour service; that the value of its property is approximately $12,000 to $13,000; that the company has never declared any dividends, except through the practice of making reduced rates to its stockholders; that the cost of operating and maintaining its exchanges (i. e., central office and switchboard), exclusive of depreciation, interest charges, taxes, insurance and pole line maintenance, is forty-four cents per telephone, if apportioned against not only its own telephones, but also those for whom it switches, including some fifty-three telephones on the three lines of the Cedar Mutual company in question. It further appears that prior to the 3rd of June, 1908, the accounts of the company were kept in such a manner as to make useless an examination of the same for the purposes of this inquiry. This is not a condition peculiar to this company, but is characteristic of every company of this size and character which the Commision has had occasion to investigate. I A statement for the period from June 3, 1908, to December 10, 1908, ed in evidence by the applicant, shows expenditures to have been 19.10 as against receipts of $1,570.69, or a net revenue of $181.59. statement, however, is not given great weight by the Commission the reason that during this period its stockholders were not paying Full rate charged non-stockholders, which henceforth they must pay, for the further reason that in the statement of disbursements there certain items which were not proven to have been properly charge - to operation and maintenance; and at the same time the statement d to show other items of expense, properly chargeable to operation ng that period, for which warrants were issued, but which do not :ar in the account of disbursements for the reason that they were tanding and unpaid. </seg>
            <seg id="p148">148 The only satisfactory evidence to which any considerable weight can be given is the evidence of the cost of central exchange operating of forty-four cents per telephone per month. That this cannot be far wrong is evidenced by the fact that the Cedar Mutual company, oper - ating an exchange having some one hundred and seventy-five stock - holders, who maintain their own lines and telephones and pay fifty cents per month, and ten rented business telephones paying $1.50 per month, and about forty rented residence telephones paying $1.00 per month, ■aid rented telephones being maintained by the company, is unable to lay aside any surplus or devote any appreciable amount toward re - placements. While the evidence is not altogether satisfactory or conclusive, the Commission is of the opinion that, under the facts established in this case, the rate of fifty cents per month per telephone for switching and exchange service furnished the farm line companies is reasonable, and that the application of petitioners should be granted. I 'he situation of those subscribers or stockholders of the Cedar il company on the lines connecting with applicant's exchange at is different. A certain number, possibly some twenty-five or more, aturaHy tributary to Elgin, and it is clear to the Commission that xchange at Elgin should receive some compensation, in addition free interchange with the Cedar Mutual exchange at Oakdale, for jrvice performed. While it is proper and legitimate for two telephone systems to arrange and agree on a free interchange of service, the Commission is of the opinion that it is without power to enforce an order compelling two companies, contrary to the wishes of either, to furnish and maintain such a free exchange. This practice is quite common among telephone companies in th state, and is the result of active or threatened competition. It converts what is naturally and properly a long distance or toll service into exchange service. It results in greater cost of operating to such com pany, which is apportioned among the subscribers and is hidden in th exchange rate. The benefits derived from it are open to all; but ther is one class of subscribers who seldom have occasion to use a Ion distance service, while another class would use it often, even when toll charge is made for each call. It therefore results that that clas who use the long distance service more or less under any condition ar securing same at an exchange rate, on the same basis as that clas who do not use it {[t is the opinion of the Commission' that, in fairness to the patrons local exchange, and particularly those who do not use the county ing distance service, rates should be provided for a service limited lie local exchange service, and an additional blanket charge for d exchange or county service, or a separate charge for each long nee call. The present practice, however, of exchange service is of such a nature as to contravene the provisions of the statute ing to unjust discriminations. </seg>
            <seg id="p149">149 There are some fifty-three telephones on the three party lines of the Cedar Mutual company, which are connected at the Oakdale end with the switchboard of that company and at the Elgin end with the switchboard of the applicant. The evidence is contradictory as to how many of these fifty-three telephones are naturally tributary to the Elgin exchange, and it is obvious that unless the two companies desire and arrange for an interchange of business on some basis, the Commis - sion could not find what number of telephones are naturally tributary to the Elgin exchange; and even if that could be determined there still remains the fact that there are other telephones on these party lines, and that the Elgin operators would have difficulty in distinguishing on in calls whether or not they originated at those telephones tributary to Elgin which were paying for that service. I The Commission is therefore of the opinion that unless the two panies can agree on the basis for interchange of service, the ap - int should be permitted to disconnect the party lines of the Cedar nal Telephone company. I In the event of this taking place, some provision should be made reby the patrons of each company may communicate with each other i reasonable long distance charge per call. During the course of the hearing the representatives of the farm lines involved complained that the applicant herein was furnishing free switching and exchange service to the German Mutual Telephone com - pany. It appears that that company entered into an agreement whereby, in consideration of the applicant's furnishing the service aforesaid, it would construct and maintain a clear long distance wire between Elgin and Petersburg. This agreement has been in force four years and has six years to run. While it doubtless will result in the subscribers of the German Mutual company securing this service at a lower rate than farm lines, it is clear that it was entered into in good faith by both parties to the agreement; that it is not a device for the purpose of discrimination, and does not constitute an unjust discrimination.

            <seg id="p150">150 Special Order No. 448. Application Jfo. M. Be Matter of the Application of the Auburn Telephone Company for .uthority to Increase Its Rates. H. J. WINNETT, Commissioner: K'his application was filed in the office of the Nebraska State Railway nission on January 25, 1909. On February 5, 1909, a remonstrance filed in behalf of the City of Auburn, signed by J. B. McCarty, r, and E. B. Quackenbush, city attorney. The matter was assigned for hearing on February 9, 1909, and all parties being present at that time, the Commission proceeded to the tak - ing of testimony. It was developed by the evidence that there had been a telephone exchange in Auburn for a number of years, during which time the rates now in force were maintained, and of which there had been no complaint; but as the same rates were being charged for party lines and individual service, the Commission thought in this respect they were discriminatory. I The evidence of the applicant showed, and the Commission so i, that since the reorganization of the Auburn Telephone Company, e had been put into the plant a new multiple switchboard, cables been extended, iron wire had been replaced by copper, a new ex - ige building had been erected and an up-to-date metallic service tituted for the prior grounded system service, entailing an expen - se of about $31,000. ■At the same hearing it was admitted by the remonstrators that service had been greatly improved. On cross examination of the applicant, the remonstrators endeav - ored to show the cost of the plant, but nothing of value as to the actual amount of money put into the plant was brought out, aside from the amount expended for new construction since the reorganization and the amount paid for the original plant. It was also shown by the applicant that the money recently expended, as previously stated, was almost entirely consumed in the improvement of the plant within the city of Auburn. ■The remonstrators presented no testimony as to the value of the it, except a copy of the return made to the assessor of Douglas inct for 1908. |«"o evidence was produced giving information as to the actual value e plant, on which the Commission would be justified in fixing the any's earning power and establishing rates. The Commission finds the rates now charged and collected are lower, when the character e plant and service rendered is considered, than the rates charged her companies furnishing similar service. Bit appeared from the evidence that the applicant was charging, '.r the present schedule of rates, the same rate (1. e. $1.00 per month) single party, and two-party residence telephones. </seg>
            <seg id="p151">151 It is generally admitted that the single party or individual service is a better and greater service than the two-party line service, and the Commission therefore finds that maintenance of the two classes of service at the same rate is discriminatory and contrary to the pro - visions of the statute, and should be discontinued. Section 14 of the Commission Act, provides: "If any railway company or common carrier subject to the pro - visions of this Act, directly or indirectly, through or by its agents, officers or employes, by any special rate, rebate, drawback, or other device, shall charge, demand, collect or receive from any person, firm or corporation, a greater or less compensation for any service rendered, or to be rendered by it than it charges, demands, collects, or receives from any other person, firm or corporation for doing a like and con - temporaneous service, the same shall constitute an unjust discrimination, which is hereby forbidden and declared to be unlawful."

            <seg id="p154">154 In the Matter of the Application of Missouri Pacific Railway Company for Authority to Establish a Certain Schedule of Rates Between Omaha and South Omaha and Ralston (Seymour Park). A. R. Talbot for Applicant. Messrs. Baxter &amp; Van Dusen and James H. Adams for Remonstrators. HEXRY T. CLARKE, Jr., Chairman: Eiis matter arises on the application of Missouri Pacific Railway Com - for authority to establish the following rates on carload lots be- Omaha and South Omaha and Ralston (Seymour Park) : On lumber, 2% cents per cwt, minimum 40,000 pounds. On brick, 2 cents per cwt., minimum marked capacity of car, On lime, cement and plaster, 2% cents per cwt., minimum 40,000 pounds. On scrap iron, 2% cents per cwt., minimum 40,000 pounds. On stoves, 3% cents per cwt, minimum 35,000 pounds. On hay, 3 cents per cwt., minimum 20,000 pounds. On grain, 2 cents per cwt., with usual minima. On coke and coal, 34 cents per ton, minimum 40,000 pounds except when marked capacity of car is less, in which event marked capacity of car will govern. All interested parties having been duly notified, hearings were held at the office of the Commission on June 2, 29 and 30, 1909. From the evidence it appears that the portion of the Missouri Pacific railway extending from Sixteenth and Nicholas streets, Omaha, to Portal (a distance of some sixteen miles), was formerly owned and Iated by a terminal company known as the "Omaha Belt Railway"; Ralston (formerly known as "Seymour Park") is located 10.7 miles i Sixteenth and Nicholas streets, Omaha, and 4.56 miles from a point vn as "West Side Junction," where a branch of the belt line running outh Omaha joined the main line; that West Side Junction is ap - imately 6.25 miles from Sixteenth and Nicholas streets, Omaha, and miles from the Cudahy Packing Company's plant in South Omaha that the distance from Ralston to South Omaha is 7.9 miles. Prior to the filing of this application, it appears that the applicant herein took over the property of the Omaha Belt Railway and operated said property as a part of its lines. It further appears that at all times that portion of the line between Omaha and Portal, and particularly be - tween Omaha and Ralston (Seymour Park), has been operated as a switch - ing proposition, and at the time of the filing of this application the appli - cant herein, by its tariff No. 4922, had in effect for switching carload traffic between Omaha and Ralston (Seymour Park) a rate of $5.00 per I and between South Omaha and Ralston (Seymour Park) a rate of ) per car, likewise a tariff providing for a specific rate of $3.00 per on ice between Seymour Park (Ralston) and Cudahy Packing Cam - p's plant at South Omaha. ■ Remonstrances were filed to the granting of the application herein by Ralston Car Works, the Howard Stove Company and Shimer &amp; Chase, ■esenting the owners of the Ralston townsite. The applicant based its application on the ground that the present </seg>
            <seg id="p155">155 flat rate of $5.00 per car was unreasonable and that, inasmuch as the yard limits of the applicant extended only to Twenty-fourth and Boyd streets (a distance of about two miles from Sixteenth and Nicholas streets) and that inasmuch as service to or from Ralston involved a road haul, it should be treated as such in its tariffs, and that the rates applied for were, in fact, lower than the rates in effect on applicant's road and other roads within the state for road haul of the same commodities for similar distances. It further appeared from the evidence that the expense of handling shipments in regular trains, as distinguished from switching movements is greater by reason of the higher wages paid to the crews operating regu lar trains, as distinguished from the crews operating switch engines. The difference in the expense involved as between the two classes of move ments, however, was not specifically given. Applicant further presented in support of its petition, figures show - ing generally that five days was required to move a loaded car from Omaha to Ralston and return the empty; that, basing its estimates on a value of $900.00 for freight cars, its cost of operation, exclusive of trans - portation, was forty-two cents per day, or $2.12 for the five days' move - ment. This result was arrived at by allowing five per cent interest, five per cent, depreciation and $65.00 per year maintenance, making a total of $155.00 per year, or forty-two cents per day. It apears, however, that on foreign cars, the foreign road is allowed or paid only twenty-five cents per day. Mr. C. A. Ralston, whose business is the construction and repairing of railroad equipment, including box cars, and a man of some twelve or fourteen years' experience in the railroad business, testifying for the re - monetrators, made the following statements: that a 50,000 capacity box car, new, was worth from $500.00 to $516.00; that a 60,000 capacity box car, new, was worth $625.00; that an 80,000 capacity box car, new, was worth $825.00; that seventy-five per cent, of the applicant's cars were 60,000 capacity cars; that a majority of its equipment was ten years old, and that the average value of same was $450.00; that, allowing $609.00 as the average value of applicant's 60,000 capacity cars, applicant should receive in addition to the cost of transportation, for the use and maintenance of said equipment, not to exceed thirty-four cents per day. ilt further appeared that on or about September 5, 1907, the petitioner in made application to this Commission for authority to publish establish a new switching tariff involving all switching movements een its switching districts located between its Sixteenth and Nicholas it station and Portal; that while the proposed tariff involved, among r things, an increase in the switching rates between Ralston and cer - intermediate switching districts, it did not propose to change or the switching rate between Ralston and Omaha or between Ralston South Omaha. If this application were allowed, the rates charged would amount on lumber, 40,000 pounds, to $10.00 per car; 80,000 pounds, $20.00 per car; brick, 40,000 pounds, $8.00 per car; 80,000 pounds, $16.00 per car; scrap </seg>
            <seg id="p156">156 iron, lime, cement and plaster, 40,000 pounds, |10.00 per car; 60,000 pounds, $15.00 per car; 80,000 pounds, 120.00 per car; stoves, 35,000 pounds minimum, $12.25 per car. The remonstrators objected to the granting of the petition, not onl on account of the increases apparent from the foregoing figures, but fo the further reason that, so long as a switching rate is maintained betwee Ralston and Omaha and South Omaha, such switching charges are ab sorbed on carload shipments, with but few, if any, exceptions, by all rai roads performing a. road haul from which a revenue of not less than $15.0 is derived; whereas, if the switching rate is cancelled and a regular ra made effective, the various railroads terminating at Omaha and Sout Omaha would refuse to absorb any charges for the transportation of an freight between Ralston (Seymour Park) and Omaha or South Omah In other words, if the petition of the applicant is approved, the remon strators would not only have to pay the transportation charges for th switching of carload freight between the points mentioned, which ar now absorbed by the railroads, but would have to pay an increased rat amounting in some instances to over one hundred per cent. It appeared from the evidence that the remonstrators were induced to invest in property at Ralston and to locate their factories at that point by reason of the low switching rate effective between there and Omaha and South Omaha. It is clear to the Commission that remonstrators relied on a continuance of this rate, though it nowhere appears in the record that there was any assurance given to remonstrators by the ap - plicant, through its officers or authorized agents, that such rate would indefinitely continue. Ehe mere fact that remonstrators had invested in property at Ral - under the belief that these switching rates would be maintained itself, no reason why the carrier could not, when conditions warrant, ise such rates. Brtchanan v. V. P. By. Co., 3 I. C. C. R. 655. When, however, a rate has voluntarily been maintained by a carrier for a long period, the presumption arises that such rate is reasonable.

Ehere an advance is made in rates which have been long maintained, ie evidence shows that the traffic affected is large, important and ntly increasing, the advance will be held unjust unless satisfactorily ned. Tift et al v. Southern Ry. Co. et al, 10 I. C. C. R. 548. It appears from the evidence that prior to the organization of the and the locating of the factories of remonstrators and others at .on, there was very little, if any, movement of freight between Ral - and Omaha or South Omaha, except ice switched to Cudahy Packing &gt;any's plant at South Omaha, but that the business or traffic tendered :ant by the remonstrators and other factories, which will undoubtedly </seg>
            <seg id="p157">157 locate at that point if the present switching rate is maintained, will be large and will constantly increase. It is clear to the Commission that, in view of the foregoing, the evi - dence and arguments submitted by the applicant are insufficient to justify the approval of its application or the authorizing of any change or in - crease in its rates between these points. The fact that business between Ralston and Omaha and South Omaha is handled by a road crew is not, of itself, convincing. Applicant maintains, and does not propose to change its present switching rates between Omaha and South Omaha and many points located intermediate to Ralston and applicant's yard limits at Twenty-fourth and Boyd streets, Omaha, involving a road haul. In fact, it appears from the evidence that it is a common practice among railroads to maintain switching rates between points located outside of their yard ORDER.

Remonstrances to the granting of said application were filed by the chairman and clerk of the village board of Bloomington, setting forth that by charging and collecting the rates applied for, the applicant would be violating an ordinance of said village. Remonstrances were also filed from Franklin, with one hundred and three names signed to same, stat- ing that in their opinion they were paying all they should pay for the use of the applicant's instruments, considering the service given. It is also stated that no night service is furnished at Franklin After giving notice to all interested parties, so far as possible, a hear- ing in the above matter was held in the office of the Commission on June 25, 1909, all members of the Commission being present. I. E. Montgomery, president of the Republican Valley Telephone Company, appeared for the applicant. The remonstrators were not represented. Only two witnesses were examined, one being Mr. Montgomery and the other Mr. U. G. Powell, rate clerk for the Commission, who had previously examined the books of the applicant. Mr. Montgomery in his evidence claims that the present schedule of rates and charges maintained by his company is unremunerative, and that after paying the reasonable operating expenses there is nothing left for depreciation. The testimony shows that the applicant owns and operates telephone exchanges at Bloomington and Franklin, Nebraska, and now has in use approximately 400 telephones, divided as follows: Business. Residence. Farm. Bloomington 37 90 87 Franklin 39 108 27 The company also shows that it is switching approximately 195 farm line telephones, for which it is charging 25 cents per month per telephone. All of the telephones except five are on grounded circuit, and for the me- tallic circuit service the company charges 50 cents extra per telephone per month. A charge of $2.00 per year extra for desk sets is also made. </seg>

IFhe testimony and books of the company show that on January 1, the construction account of the company was $10,518.95. At that there was an account of $733.29 which was unpaid, but was paid after, making the correct construction account $11,252.24.

The manager of the applicant company, however, testified that his company had contracts for switching various farm line companies at the twenty-five-cent rate which had not yet expired. We are of the opinion that, until such time as the contracts in ques- tion have expired, no change should be made in the switching rate on farm line telephones. Upon the proper showing being made, thirty days prior to the expiration of all such contracts, that they have expired, the switching rates for farm line telephones prayed for in applicant's petition. will be granted.

            <seg id="p163">163 H. J. WINNETT, Commissioner: Application having been made by the Missouri Pacific Railway Com - pany for authority to discontinue the maintenance of an agent at the station of Glen Rock on said Missouri Pacific Railway, the matter was assigned for hearing at the office of the Nebraska State Railway Commis - sion on June 28, 1909. A remonstrance was filed by the citizens of Glen Rock to the granting of said application, and at the time of hearing Mr. E. B. Quackenbush appeared as attorney for the remonstrators and Mr. A. R. Talbot appeared for the railway company. The facts developed at the hearing indicate that Glen Rock is a vil - lage on the Missouri Pacific Railway, having a population of about one hundred persons, and situated approximately midway between Brock and Auburn, the distance from either place being about four and eight-tenths (4.8) miles. It appears, according to the testimony, that Glen Rock has been an open station since the building of the Missouri Pacific railway until some time in January of this year, when the station building was burned. Aa soon as possible thereafter, the railway company provided a depot con - structed of box cars, for the purpose of conducting the business at this station. On May 5, 1909, an informal complaint was filed in the office of the Commission by Mr. Lee Erisman, secretary of the Glen Rock Grain Com - pany, stating that the agent at that point had been discharged and the station closed. On May 6, 1909, a letter was written to Mr. B. P. Wag - gener, general attorney for the Missouri Pacific Railway Company, calling his attention to general order No. 6, issued by the Commission on January 27, 1908, which provided, among other things: "No change of freight or passenger depots or flag stations from their present location, or suspension of the sale of tickets, or the re - ceiving or forwarding of freight from stations now in use for such purpose, will be permitted without the consent of this Commission." Pursuant to this letter, the application herein was filed by the Mis - souri Pacific Railway Company. At the hearing, the railway company contended that the volume of business at Glen Rock did not justify the maintenance of an agent, and the showing made by the company, as well as the monthly station reports of said company for Glen Rock, on file in this office, substantiate this contention. However, the remonstrators attempted to show by their testimony that the railway company had been discouraging business at that point by giving poor service and by the employment of incompetent agents; also that the community is purely an agricultural one and that the crops for the past year (which was the period used by the railroad company as a basis for their showing of receipts at Glen Rock) were- the poorest they have had for thirty years. It also appeared from the evidence that the Missorui Pacific Rail - way Company maintains agents at Fort Crook, Juniata and Lawrence, </seg>
            <seg id="p164">164 Ihich stations the earnings of the railway company correspond very ■ly to the earnings at Glen Rock, which, as shown by the monthly on reports filed by said railway company with the Commission, inted to $3,209.22 for the twelve months from July 1, 1907, to July 1, including freight forwarded and received, both state and interstate, ticket sales. It is the judgment of the Commission that in fairness and justice to all parties concerned, an agent should be maintained at Glen Rock for a sufficient period to afford the citizens of that town and vicinity an oppor - tunity to increase the business of said station in a sufficient amount to justify the maintenance of an agent. ORDER (T IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Corn - on that the Missouri Pacific Railway Company be, and the same is iy directed to maintain an agent at the station of Glen Rock until try 1, 1910, at which time, in the absence of any material increase siness, and on proper showing being made, the said railway company be given authority to discontinue the service of the said agent at Rock.

Through Rates, Sum of Locals in Absence of Through Rate.

            <seg id="p236">236 SECOND ANNUAL REPORT Partnership Telephones. Crete, Neb., November 23, 1908 State Railway Commission, ■ Lincoln, Nebraska. Sir: E&gt;me criticisms have been offered here as to the way we have been cting our business in the way of listing names that are in reality ibscribers of our system. A veterinary surgeon has two of our telephones, one at his residenc and the other at the ofiice of a livery barn, which he also has for h office. He pays for both telephones. The liveryman has the "Bell" tele phone and pays for same. We listed the liveryman in our director the same as we do our regular subscribers and make no charge fo same, since both parties use both telephones as they please. The sam is done with the "Bell" Company, but they do not list any names bu what are actual subscribers. We extend the same courtesy to all pa rons where two parties use the same office. We still have another case where a doctor and a dentist have their general office together. The doctor has our telephone and has an ex - tension in the dentist's private office, and pays for both the direct tele - phone and extension. On the other hand the dentist has the "Bell" telephone and an extension in the doctor's office, each taking care of the calls when the other is out. We listed the dentist the same number as the doctor and we extend that same courtesy to all that have similar t.nother case where a man lives in his office (that is, sleeps there), has no other home. We have been giving him the advantage residence rate. We are accused of discrimination of the Railway Commission Law. Please give us the ruling on cases of the above mentioned, and the similar cases that may arise in our line. EPrusting that the above will give you sufficient information so that may be able to rule intelligently on the mentioned cases, awaiting »rly reply, we are, Yours very truly CRETE TELEPHONE COMPANY. Per B. G. MILLER, Manager. Lincoln, November 27, 1908. Mr. B. G. Miller, Manager, Crete Telephone Co., Crete, Nebraska. Dear Sir: K Replying to your favor of the 23rd inst, in which you ask for lgs from the Commission as to certain practices by your company, rhich there is some doubt as to whether or not the same con - ite discriminations contrary to law: </seg>
            <seg id="p237">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 237 You state that a veterinary surgeon maintains one of your telephones in the office of a livery barn, which he occupies as his own office, the telephone being used by the liveryman through a private agreement wi;h the veterinary surgeon. Furthermore, your company carries the name of the liveryman in its directory, in addition to that of the veterinary surgeon, without additional charge. Eie same situation seems to exist in regard to a telephone main - jointly by a physician and a dentist, who occupy a general office er and have adjoining private offices. I am directed by the Commission to say that it does not appear fro y mr statement that any person similarly situated, desiring this privileg baa been denied the same by your company, and therefore no di c 'imination contrary to law has been committed. If carried into genera F ractice, however, it is easy to see how this privilege might become a aouse, demoralizing not only to your own business, but to that of you c &gt;mpetitors as well. The Commission is therefore of the opinion tha o &gt;und public policy demands a reasonable and proper charge for tl ectra service given by publication in telephone directories of names persons who are not subscribers, but who use telephones regular t rough private arrangement with other parties who are subscriber Such charge should be uniform and applicable to all persons unde s'milar circumstances and conditions, the same as all other rates o c &gt;mmon carriers. Ei regard to the case of a subscriber who sleeps in his office and refore given a residence rate on his telephone, the Commission is opinion that the maintenance of a telephone in a place of business sumptive evidence that it is used for business purposes, and that ore the business rate* should apply.

R. to issue transportation to Mrs. Clara Akers of Scottsbluff, widow of an employe who was killed while in the service of said com - pany, for the alleged reason that such action would be contrary to law and to the rulings of this Commission: No correspondence has passed between this office and the Burlingto ab to whether or not Mrs. Akers could legally be furnished transport* tion. The attention of the Commission has been called to one or tw similar instances by widows of railroad employes and has replied tha while it had no authority to compel the railroad companies to issu transportation, there was nothing in the law to prohibit it in such case if they were so disposed. As a matter of fact, the law specifically provide that "nothing contained in this act shall be construed to prohibit or mak unlawful the giving of any such free ticket, free pass, or free transporta tion to • • * widows or dependent children of employes killed whi in the service of such railroad company." There is certainly nothing in the law or in the rulings of the Commis - sion which would require any railroad company to turn down an ap - plication for free transportation from the widow of a bonu fide employe who was killed while in the service of such company.

Dear Sir: Eindly refer to your letter of December 2nd concerning an informal aint received from the David Cole Creamery Company. In that you advised that the Commission has held hat where one express iny operates over two or more lines of road, straight mileage should plied on cream, and that the sum of the locals is permissible only l shipment is handled by two or more express companies or two re railroads, as the case may be. I Manifestly, I have no reason :o doubt such an order was issued, but unable to find a copy of it here, and as I wish to pursue the cor - &gt;ndence further and get this question settled, I will be obliged if you send me such copy. Thanking you in advance for your kind attention, I beg to remain, Yours truly, C. D. SU.MMY, Asst. Gen. Supt Lincoln, December IS, 1908. Mr. C. D. Summy, A. G. S., American Express Company, Omaha, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Eeplying to your favor of the 14th inst., in regard to informal com - of David Cole Creamery Company relative to correct charge on ent of cream handled by one express company over two lines of Contrary to your understanding, no formal order has been issued on this subject. The matter arose on an inquiry from Mr. Thornburgh, traffic manager of the Beatrice Creamery Company, as to what nrte should be charged "where shipments of cream are handled by one ex - press company over two different railroads." I replied to him under date of July 11th as follows: I "My understanding is, and I think the Commission will so hold, that straight mileage should be applied and not the sum of the locals. Of ■se, where shipment is handled by two different express companies wo different railroads, the sum of the locals will apply; but as I srstand the incident to which you refer, the Pacific Express Company charge of the entire movement, handling the same over the Union ific and Missouri Pacific railroads. In that case, as stated above, straight mileage rate should be applied." This position was subsequently confirmed by the Commission, but upon protest of Mr. G. D. Patterson, superintendent of the Pacific Express Company, that the facts had not been fully stated by Mr. Thornburg, the following informal ruling was adopted at a session of the Commission held August 1, 1908: "When shipper of cream is advised that an express company does </seg>
            <seg id="p242">242 Esh service on certain days in the week by the most direct route, of one railroad between two given points, and orders his ship - '.hose days made by a roundabout route, via the same express , over the lines of two railroads which furnish service on such should be compelled to pay, and the express company should rized to collect, a rate based on the continuous mileage covered roundabout route." ISxcept as it illustrates the general policy of the Commission on this Lion, the latter ruling is not directly in point. As stated above, how - the principle laid down in my letter to Mr. Thornburgh of July 11th endorsed by the Commission, both directly by the several members indirectly in the informal ruling last quoted. The statement in my r to you of December 2nd to the effect that "the Commission has held where one express company operates over two or more lines of road ght mileage should be applied," etc., is correct. Very truly yours, CLARK PERKINS, Secretary. December 31, 1908. To the Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Gentlemen : Milk and Cream Rates Between Points in Nebraska Under date of September 16, 1907, your Commission ordered common carriers to put into effect between points on their respective lines in the state of Nebraska, a schedule of rates on milk and cream. The order specifies that the hearing was on the application of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company, the Chicago &amp; Nor.h- Western Railway, the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, etc., etc., and of the express companies, only the Pacific Express Com - pany. However, the order was addressed to all common carriers, and we understood it as applying to the American Express Company, as well as to the railroad companies, and we issued and put a schedule imo effect on the date fixed by the order, namely November 1, 1907; and sub - sequently we issued the tariff in a printed form as Commodity Tariff No. 35, a copy of which is filed with your Commission, and a copy of which we attach hereto. You will note that one of the rules of this tariff as issued by the American Express Company provides: "When shipments pass over two lines of railroad, charge the local mileage charge over each line." You will also note that the tariff does not apply on shipments to be trans - ported exclusively over the Chicago &amp; North-Western Railway (the F. E. ft M. V.), for the reason that that company has arranged to carry such business between local points on its line. t recently had a complaint from the David Cole Creamery Com- Omaha, that on a shipment of cream in cans from Kennard, Ne - ro Omaha, routed by order of the shipper via Blair, Nebraska, we on the basis of the local mileage over each railroad line, as the t was carried part way over the Chicago &amp; North-Western and </seg>
            <seg id="p243">243 part way over the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha. There was some correspondence between our assistant general superintendent at Omaha and Mr. Clark Perkins, secretary of your Commission, and apparently Mr. Perkins is of the opinion that your Commission would hold that in the case of an express company, it could not charge on milk or cream be - tween points in Nebraska, on the basis of local, mileage over each line of railway. It seems to us that there must be some mistake abou: this, for the reason that such a ruling would make a lower charge on a ship - ment carried over two lines by an express company operating both lines than would be authorized if carried by the railroad companies themselves in baggage cars on passenger trains. The order putting into effect the rates named specifically states: i"Xow, on consideration of the evidence and of the rates in effect in •aska for the said transportation of cream and milk, we find that in r that justice may be done in the premises, the said rates of charges such service now in effect in Nebraska should be modified and iged so chat all shippers of cream or milk from and to all points in state may be given the same and equal rates of charge for like inces." I Our understanding of this provision of your order is that you intended the charge on milk and cream between points in Nebraska should be same, whether carried by railroad companies in baggage cars on pas - ;er trains, or whether carried by express. Kin addition to this, the shipper evidently routes these shipments via r, Nebraska, for his convenience and advantage, and properly would e under the ruling of your Commission August 1, 1908, in reference nch unusual routing. ■We believe, however, that our construction of your order is a proper and respectfully ask your approval of same.

The through rate be made up of the sum of the locals only when handled by two or 3 express companies or two or more railroads between whom no t through rate is maintained."

Sir: Rates on Milk and Cream on Shipments Passing Over Two Separate Lines of Railroad. Referred to in your letter of January 6th. It seems to me that there is one very important point that has been overlooked by the Commissio in this matter, and that is that under the order conveyed in your le ter of January 6th, you compel the American Express Company to mak a lower charge on a shipment of cream passing over two lines of rai road, than would be made under your authorized rates by the railroac companies for carrying Che same shipments on passenger trains. Eac railroad company would, under your order, make a separate mileage ra over its own line, and our Commodity Tariff No. 35, issued October 1 1907, in conformity with the order of your Commission, distinctly pro - vides that "When shipments pass over two lines of railroad, charge th local mileage charge over each line." This scale was filed with you Commission and, we presume, was accepted, and we think upon furth&lt; consideration of the matter by your Commission, you must decide tha the condition of a separate charge over each line of railroad should b accorded to this Company, the same as it is accorded to railroad com panies, and we respectfully ask that you present the matter again your Commission for further consideration. Yours truly, J. H. BRADLEY, General Traffic Manager Lincoln, January 13, 1909. Mr J. H. Bradley, G. T. M., American Express Company, KNew York, N. Y. Sir: Replying to your favor of the 9th inst. in regard to express rates on milk and cream shipments passing over two lines of railroad: The Commission gave due consideration to all points raised by your letter of December 31st before rendering the informal ruling con - tained in its letter of the 6th inst, and was convinced that no in - justice would be done to an express company operating over two or more railroads by requiring it to apply continuous mileage, regardless of what rates might apply on the same shipment if made otherwise than by exprew. </seg>
            <seg id="p245">245 The Commission does not admit that the fact that shipmen.s migh be routed via C. &amp; X. W. and C. St. P. M. &amp; O. from Kennard to Oman by passenger train at the sum of the locals on Blair, being somewha greater than the continuous mileage rate over the same lines by expres has any important bearing upon the question. The main point is tha the American Express Company operates an express line between Ken nard and Omaha, the shortest route being via Blair, which therefore b comes the natural and proper route over which shipments move, ant represents the mileage upon which charges should be assessed. Th mere fact that the two railroad companies would, if called upon, charg a greater rate, has no bearing for the reason that one of them (the C. £ P. M. &amp; O.) makes no effort to secure this class of business, and, furthe the cheaper express rate will compel the railroads to establish a co responding joint rate before they can hope to participate in the same. In regard to the provision in your Commodity Tariff Xo. 35, to which you call our attention, viz: "When shipments pass over two lines of railroad, charge the local mileage charge over each line," we have to say that this was overlooked at the time of filing and not brought: to the at - tention of the Commission until your letter of the 31st ult. was received. However, the mere fact that a tariff has been regularly filed does not validate any unlawful or improper provision contained therein, and such provision will be stricken out whenever brought to the attention of the Commission. The Commission expects you to comply with the ruling rendered on January 5th, and contained in its letter of January 6th, until otherwise ordered.

Clarke, Jr., Chairman, Nebraska State Ry. Commission Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Clarke: Mr. Kooser of the Missouri Pacific has been kind enough to show me your letter of the 12th inst., in which you refer to recent order of your honorable body on the question of absorption of switching charges assessed by the Stock Yards Company of Omaha. (Application Xo. 38.) Note you say: "The order does not require your road to absorb the increase on ice carloads." Xote further you say: "Your understanding of our conversation over the telephone that you would not be compelled to absorb this additional charge on ice movements, unless you were absorbing like amounts on ice or similar commodities at other points, under similar conditions, is correct." The situation is this: A short time ago the Missouri Pacific Railroad, </seg>
            <seg id="p246">246 SECOND ANNUAL REPORT through Mr. Kooser, applied to your Commission for the right to increas certain switching rates between Omaha and South Omaha and Seymou Park, asking that they be allowed to continue in effect the present ra of $4.00 per car on ice from Seymour Park to South Omaha, citing :h fact that the rate had been in effect a great many years; that it was agreed to before the Cudahy Packing Company had finally decided to 1 cate at Seymour Park as against other places which were available that time, and before they spent the considerable amount of money th has been spent in building ice houses and in perfecting the lake, etc and furthermore that the ice was all used for pre-cooling of cars use in transportation. Bour Commission allowed the present rate to be continued and it 11 in effect K'our Commission also granted the Stock Yards Company the right crease the switching rate on various commodities, including ice, $1.00 to $2.00 per car. I As we understand the matter now, the Missouri Pacific is not re - ed to absorb the increased switching rate of the Stock Yards Com - r and the Stock Yards Company is authorized to collect $2.00 per instead of $1.00 previously in effect. Es are not at this time commenting upon the qualification contained r favor. As a matter of fact, and as stated before your honorable we are not intereated in the compensation of the Stock Yards ny, provided it is not obtained at our expense. The writer will very much appreciate advice from you as to what the intention was with reference to the Cudahy Packing Company being required to pay the increased switching charge of the Stock Yards Company. Yours truly, J. A. McNAUGHTON. Lincoln, January 18, 1909 Mr. J. A. McNaughton, Cudahy Packing Company, South Omaha, Nebraska. Dear Sir: I Answering your favor of the 15th inst. with reference to the absorp - of the increased switching charges of the Union Stock Yards Com - v of Omaha, by the Missouri Pacific on ice, I have to say that the imission by its order and findings determined that the Stock Yards ipany was entitled to the increased switching rates allowed, and the railroads should be compelled to absorb those charges so far hey referred to intrastate live stock shipments. I The Commission did not direct the railroads to absorb the increased ching charges on dead freight shipments. The obligations of the iers, as appeared from the testimony in this case, are greater with rence to the handling of live stock than with reference to the lling of dead freight, and the Commission, recognizing this, limited </seg>
            <seg id="p247">247 K creased switching rate absorptions required of the railroads, by the to live stock shipments. Ehe failure or refusal of the carriers to absorb the increased switch - ites allowed by the Commission on dead freight would not be a ion of the order, and said increases would have to be paid by the W, and in this case by your company. I Should it appear that the Missouri Pacific is absorbing a switching ?e of $2.00 on traffic similar to the traffic between Seymour Park your plant, it might be subject to a complaint for discrimination, upon investigation, be compelled to treat all alike. Mr. Ransom in his arguments asserted that the law would compel the carriers to absorb all increases that might be allowed. The Com - mission was unable to take this position, and for this reason made your company and others concerned parties to the proceedings. Should Mr. Ransom's position be correct, and this we doubt (unless the question of discrimination enters), the failure of the Commission to order the carriers to absorb the increases on the dead freight would not prevent your obtaining your rights in the proper action at law.

It is my understanding that they shou elivered free within the corporate limits.

Dear Sir: Replying to your favor of the 20th inst., with further reference to free delivery limits of the various express companies: I Although we have made a diligent effort to secure an exact definition uch limits from each company, the results have not been entirely jfactory. For example, Mr. J. H. Butler, superintendent of the ms Express company, says: KI enclose herewith list of offices in Nebraska where we maintain delivery. I am not able to define the free delivery limits at these e, but as a rule they extend to the business district only." Mr. G. D. Patterson, superintendent of the Pacific Express Com - pany, says: "I herewith hand you list of the towns where free delivery service is given in the state of Nebraska. I cannot give you the limits governing the same, . because that is not of record in my office. The limit is usually made to cover the business portion of the city and where we get enough business to justify the limit, but I do not have such a record in my office." </seg>
            <seg id="p249">249 K'he United States Express Company has filed a map, showing its delivery limits in Omaha to be bounded in a general way on the i by William street, on the east by Sixth street, on the north by ; street, and on the west by 29th avenue. Khe American Express Company has filed a complete list of street ers to which free delivery will be made and a schedule showing es for delivery beyond such limits, as follows: On packages 15 pounds and under $ .15 On packages over 15 pounds to 35 On packages over 35 pounds to 100 On packages over 100 pounds to MO M Trunks, 50 cents, regardless of weight. Ko response has been received from Wells Fargo &amp; Company to our Jt for information concerning free delivery limits, so far as Omaha icerned. I find nothing in the law to sustain your understanding tha' free sry should be made to all points within the corporate limits, but, as i in my letter of the 18:h, no restrictions of existing limits can be without the consent of the Commission. In other words, if you n position to show that any of the express companies now refuse ake free delivery to poin s which enjoyed free delivery January 1, or subsequently, the Commission will take the matter up at once the offending company and order restoration of such service.

Dear Sir: We have filed a claim against the railroad company for some material we used in making grain doors at Wellfleet. I have a letter from them in which they mention something relative to the ruling made by the Interstate Commerce Commission restricting any claim over $1.20 for grain doors. I wish to ask if they are correct in giving us this in - formation. Will you kindly return this letter, together with reply? lhat the Interstate Commerce Commission has ruled that bills in excess of $1.20 per car for lumber furnished in making grain doors cannot be paid. The Interstate Commerce Commission has ruled that "a carrier may not lawfully reimburse shippers for expense incurred in attaching grain doors to box cars unless expressly so provided in its tariff." and that "stated maximum allowance per grain door and per car" must be specific - ally provided in such tariff. Under his ruling, the Burlington has pub - lished in supplement No. 5 to its G. F. O. 3457-B a provsion that "when cars furnished for grain or other loading requiring interior doors are not so equipped by the railroad company and such doors are furnished by the shippers, the actual cost thereof (but not to exceed $1.20 per car) will be paid by the carrier furnishing such doors."

Dear Sir: EVe have been annoyed in the past few days by parties demanding lone service in this town and also by farmers living along our lines, claiming we are compelled to give them service and install a tele - } for them. Our company is a mutual one in all respects, the line being built by stockholders who subscribed for stock to build our lines to their places. Our plan and rule has been that our subscribers are to own their own telephones and if party lives in town or country, the money received by the sale of stock should be used toward building the line to their places. We now charge $1.00 per month rental for the use of our lines and service (town or country) which is practically the cost of maintenance and operation. If a party in town demands a telephone, are we com - pelled to run a wire from our switchboard to his house and install a telephone at our expense if he requests it, and agrees to pay our schedule rate; also if our line passes a farmer's place, are we compelled, if he so requests, to give him service and furnish him a telephone? This, of course, would overburden our lines and our service would be very poor.

Ee assume that Mr. Hawley is the gentleman to whom Mr. R. L. r, manager of the Farmers &amp; Merchants Telephone Company, re - in a letter to the Commission dated March 20, 1909, in which I"Now it seems tha: the Highland Telephone Company, in violation ur understanding with them, have for some time past, installed a )hone in the town of Republican City, and we have been accepting l them 25 cents per month as switching charges. The writer, as man - of our company, was unaware of the fact that this subscriber was in corporate limits of this city, or had overlooked the matter until this t when he called the attention of the Highland company that they : discontinue the use of this telephone or pay to us $100 per month, same as to the subscribers in Republican City. This they refused I As a result of this information, we wrote the manager of the company r date of April 2nd, and you are doubtless familiar with the contents ur letter. You say you do not understand why Mr. Hawley should more than the rest of the members of your company. The reason is according to Mr. Keester's statement, Mr. Hawley is located within corporate limits of Republican City, while the other members of your pany are not. It is reasonable to suppose that a subscriber living in the local exchange radius of a telephone company will make more uent demands upon the service of said company than a member of rm line company residing in the country. At any rate, it does not appear to the Commission to be unreasonable that the local exchange should be protected in its territory in matters of this kind. Otherwise you can easily see that there would be no limita - tion upon the demands of the farm line companies, and this condition might eventually result in their taking away a large proportion of the local subscribers of the exchange and demanding service for them at the nominal rate prescribed by their switching contract </seg>
            <seg id="p258">SECOND ANNUAL REPORT 258 For this reason the Commission has held that service given under such switching contracts should be limited to bomi tide farm line sub - scribers, and that such service cannot be given to persons residing with - in the corporate limits of the town where the switching company's ex - change is located. It Is possible that Mr. Hawley would be entitled to a reasonable al - lowance on account of the fact that he owns and maintains his own telephone, but the Commission does not believe that 75 cents per month (the difference between the regular residence rate and the farm line switching rates) is reasonable. In the event of his being unable to agree with the Farmers &amp; Mer - chants Telephone Company as to what constitutes a proper allowance on this account, he may demand individual service from the Farmers ft Merchants Company the same as is granted all their other subscribers at the $1.00 rate.

Section 3 of said law is as follows: "The owner, consignor or consignee of any carload lots of grain, coal, merchandise or other property in course of transportation over ar^y railway within the state, transporting the same for hire, may request in writing any agent of the operators of such railway to weigh any such car- </seg>
            <seg id="p259">259 loads of grain, coal, merchandise or other property in course of trans - portation, and upon such request being received, it shall become the duty of the operators of such railroad to weigh the car or cars designated in such written request, together with their contents, upon such track scale as may be designated in such written request over which such car or cars in the regular course of transit will thereafter pass, and deliver to the person making such request a written certificate, showing the name and number of the car so weighed, the date of the taking of such weight and the place where weighed, with the number of pounds of gross and net weights after deducting the tare marked on the car from such gross weight, and the certificate so executed and delivered shall be admissible evidence against such railway company in any legal pro - ceeding thereafter instituted or then pending against any such carrier weighing and transporting the property contained in such car or cars of all of the facts stated in such certificate." Section 4 is as follows: "Wherever any carload lot of merchandise, coal, grain or other property shall be delivered for transportation for hire to any carrier by railroad within this state, consigned to any person at a station on the line of the railroad of such carrier, or upon any other railroad wi-hin this state, where no track scale is located and maintained, and such car in the course of transit will not pass a track scale on the line of the railroad of such carrier, or upon any other railroad within this s'ate, where no track scale is located and maintained, and such car in the course of transit will not pass a track scale on the line of such connect - ing carrier, it shall immediately become the duty of such initial carrier to cause the same to be weighed in the manner required by the third section of this act on the track scale located nearest the station to which such car is consigned, and to stamp upon the waybill for such car, all of the matters required to be set out in the certificate provided for in the third section of this act; but where coal, grain, merchandise or other property in carload lots is consigned to stations where track scales are located and the consignee requests the same weighed, such weights shall be taken, both gross and tare, with the car uncoupled, on such track scales at the point of destination."

Co. for a site to build an elevator and coal 8. It seems that they want us to buy one of the old elevators, and lave written the elevator companies for their prices. One of them ed that they would be glad to make us a price, but put it off several ; the other one made no reply. The railroad company say they will </seg>
            <seg id="p265">265 expect us to pay the expense of extending the switch which they estimate will be about $800.00, if they grant us a lease for an elevator. I Now, what we want to know is what our rights are and how or what :an do to facilitate matters. We have been organized a month or i, and we would like to get to business, and don't like to be dallied much longer. Those old elevators are not either one large enough good enough to do the business we expect to do. Please let us hear from you at your earliest convenience. Yours truly, THE RUSKIN GRAIN &amp; COAL COMPANY. J. H. WRIGHT, Secretary. v Lincoln, June 23, 1909. Mr. J. H. Wright, Secretary, Ruskin, Nebraska. Dear Sir: I Answering your favor of the 21st inst., I herewith enclose copy of the ite providing for the furnishing of equal facilities to grain elevators shippers. In this connection I have to say that the Commission, in the case Manley Elevator Co. v. M. P. It. R. Co., upon a condition precedent that the elevator company pay for the extension of stub sidetrack to within four feet of the right-of-way line in front of its elevator, ordered the rail - road company to construct and build such track. The order was sus - tained by the Supreme Court of the state, but was carried to the United States Supreme Court, and is there pending. I We believe there is no question but what you are entitled to this ice if you will pay for the track extension, but until the matter has l decided upon finally by the courts, we cannot say that this extension ild be made at the expense of the railroad company.

Very truly yours. CLARK PERKINS, Secretary. Schuyler, Neb., September 3, 1909. Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sirs: Eeferring to C. &amp; N. W. G. F. D. 8700 quoting transfer charges on billing between various points on their line. Will you kindly advise ler this applies only on freight that is transferred from the North - &gt;m or from other roads to the North-Western as well. In particular we wish to know if the charge of 5 cents per cwt. would have to be made at Humphrey, Nebraska, on shipments destined to points on the North-Western routed via Union Pacific to Humphrey. It is our understanding that since on this business the Union Pacific has not a publication sheet of transfer charges, it would be left open for the ship - per or receiver to make their own arrangements. In other words if we make our own arrangements with the draymen at Humphrey to accept shipments from the Union Pacific and transfer them to the North-West - ern, and the transfer charges included on the North-Western waybill as advances, neither the Union Pacific nor the North-Western would be liable under &lt;tbe present rules of the Railway Commission. Thanking you in advance for a prompt reply. Yours truly, WELLS-ABBOTT-NIEMAN CO. By GERALD EHERNBERGER, Secretary. </seg>

K)ur rate clerk is of the opinion that this tariff is intended to take of business originating on the North-Western line, but inasmuch as Inion Pacific has no tariff naming a rate on transfer shipment by line to the North-Western, this tariff would have to apply on inter - shipments where the shipment is billed through. i I ! you wish to avail yourselves of a charge less than 5 cents a hun - it would be necessary for you to bill to Humphrey and rebill at that to stations on the North-Western.

I Unless some provision for feeding in transit is made in railroad Is covering such a shipment, stoppage under the circumstances ed could not be made except at the higher rates generally charged short movements.

Dear Sir: Replying to your favor of the 15th inst., addressed to Commissioner Cowgill, in regard to proper classification of subscribers who use their residence telephones for business purposes: At a meeting of the Commission held on July 17th, the following in - formal ruling was adopted: "Where a subscriber of a telephone company is actively engaged in business, professional, commercial or otherwise, which is conducted ex - clusively from his residence, and the telephone is used in the conduct of said business, such telephone may reasonably be classified as a business telephone.

Dear Sirs: Answering your favor of the 26th, I quote below paragraphs 10580 - 81-82 of Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of 1907. Inside the corporate limits of cities of 5,000 inhabitants and over, the city has the right to make regulations regarding the crossing of railroad tracks, and provide pre - cautions and prescribe rules regarding same, etc. We have no printed pamphlet showing the laws governing the oper - ation of steam railroads and interurbans: 110580. Every railroad company shall have power to cross, intersect, and unite its railroad with any other railroad before constructed, at point on its route and upon the grounds of such other railroad com - r, with the necessary turnouts, sidings and switches, and other con - ence in furtherance of the objects of its connection. And every com - r whose railroad is or shall hereafter be intersected by any new rall - 1, shall unite with the owners of such new railroad in forming such rsections and connections, and grant the facilities aforesaid; and if two corporations cannot agree upon the amount of compensation to aade therefor or the points and manner of such crossings and connec - s, the same shall be ascertained and determined by commissioners, to elected as provided in this subdivision. </seg>

All railroad trains and locomotives without trains shall come to a full stop at least 200 feet and not more than 800 feet from the crossing of the other railroad, and the engineer shall sound two long blasts of the whistle before starting forward, except where said railroads maintain a semaphore and gate with torpedo attachment, and when the signals indicate the crossing to be clear no stop need be made. 110582. When trains or locomotives without trains approach a sing simultaneously, the one on the older road shall have the right ross first, and the last train to cross shall not start until the first i has cleared the crossing and signal indicates that track is clear.

Dear Sir: E.eplying to your verbal inquiry made while in the Commission's this morning, I beg to say that under the terms of the anti-pass railroad companies are permitted to issue free transportation to iyes retired from service on account of disability sustained while • service of a railroad company, and to dependent members of their iiate families. The law does not compel them to issue such transportation, but it makes a specific exemption of employes disabled while in railroad ser - vice from the prohibitions contained therein.

Dear Sir: Bteplying to your favor of the 27th ult., in which you suggest a method roviding telephone service in depots: I While the Commission is not inclined to give its approval to the plan ;ested by you, to-wlt: that you buy and maintain your own telephones, ill them in depots, extending wires outside the buildings and authoriz - the various telephone companies to attach their wires to same, either ridually or through the exchange, service to be given by said compan - bo the several depots under this method without charge, it will not t any objection to same at the present time. I As you are aware the telephone situation in this state as it relates ervice to railroad depots, etc., is rather unsettled, and there is quite xiety of arrangements in force at the present time under which such ice is given. Realizing that such service is more beneficial to the ■ral public than to any individual or corporation,, the Commission has felt called upon to interfere in cases where there appeared to be no rimination. It hopes in the course of time to reach an adjustment of question which will be equitable to all parties concerned, and pending l final determination, it will continue its present attitude of non-inter - aoe with all agreements between railroads and telephone companies re no intentional violation of the spirit of the law appears to have i committed.

Dear Sir: K Answering your favor of the 25th inst., I have to say that as the Commission has made no rulings or decisions on the subject of onsibility of common carriers to the shipper in the matter of delivery onsignments. KUpon receipt of a less than carload shipment and the proper notice ng been given to the consignee, the shipment is subject to demurrage ges if not called for and delivered within the free time allowed by ite or the tariffs of the company. The same applies to carload ship- I Further, in the matter of carload shipments, if no instructions are n with reference to setting the car on private or industrial tracks, placing of same by the railroad company on its team track where it be unloaded by the consignee, constitutes a delivery, and the same abject to demurrage if not unloaded within the free time allowed by Ate or tariff, the consignee having been duly notified. I If the carrier is directed to place same on an industrial or private k, it should do so, but in case the industrial or private track is filled other cars, a setting of the car at the nearest sidetrack where same be unloaded by the consignee, constitutes a delivery and will subject same to demurrage if not unloaded within the free time allowed by I or statute, the consignee having been duly notified. B herewith enclose a copy of the demurrage law, and if you have any cular case in hand which the above suggestions do not cover, kindly 8 know, and we will advise you further. Yours truly, HENRY T.

Yours truly. I. J. DUNN, Assistant City Attorney Lincoln, September 29, 1909. Mr. I. J. Dunn, Assistant City Attorney, Omaha, Nebraska. Dear Sir: I find your favor of the 24th inst. upon my return from an absence of several days. In answer thereto, I have to say that the proceedings in which the Commission placed a valuation on the street railway properties of Lin - coln were based on a complaint filed by the city, asking for a reduction in the fares. In said proceedings, the city engineer testified with refer - ence to the physical value of the property. The Citizens line had re - cently been completed, and the Commission had at its disposal receipts and vouchers showing the expense of constructing that line. The Com- E&gt;n itself, through its own agents, did not make a physical inspec - .nd valuation of this property. Our findings of value were based ly upon the evidence introduced by the city and the companies, through their experts, and upon the testimony of the accountants. It is not possible for the Commission, under the physical valuation law passed by the last legislature, to proceed at once to a valuation of the street railway properties in Omaha, until after the steam railroads shall have first been valued. Should however, a complaint be filed, chal - lenging the reasonableness of the rates charged by the street railway company at Omaha, the value of the property, of course, would be a ma - terial question, and in the event that sufficient testimony was not intro - duced by the complainant or the defendant whereby the Commission could arrive at a fair and just determination of the value of the property, the Commission would have to make a physical valuation through its own agents, provided that it had sufficient funds at its disposal. Under such circumstances only could the Commission proceed at an early date to a valuation of this property. Yours truly, HENRY T. CLARKE, Jr., Chairman. Omaha, Neb., October 11, 1909.

            <seg id="p282">282 SECOND ANNUAL REPORT reference thereto, and the principal data upon which such findings may I am directed by the Commission to request you to submit the fol - lowing to the honorable city council for its consideration: Bbe legislature of 1909, among other things, passed the "Physical tion Act," which received the approval of the Governor, and a copy ich is herewith enclosed. This Commission, having made an investigation of the cost, as evi - denced by the amounts expended in other states, for a physical valuation of railroads, estimated that the cost in this state of valuing the railroads alone would amount to $48,000.00 to $60,000.00, and advised the legislature to that effect. The legislature saw fit, however, to appropriate, for the purpose of carrying out the physical valuation of the public service cor - porations enumerated in the act referred to above, the sum of $40,000.00 only, and, realizing that the sum appropriated might not be sufficient to carry out the provisions of the entire act, specifically provided in the third section that steam railroads should be first valued, "and thereafter other public service corporations in such order to be valued as shall be determined by the State Railway Commission." Ehe Commission has not completed the valuation of steam railroads, 5 advised by the Attorney General that until such yaluation is com- I the state auditor and treasurer would undoubtedly be justified in ng to permit the Commission to expend for the valuation of any pub - rvice corporation, any of the sum so appropriated. I am further directed to say that a complaint has been filed by R. B Howell, W. G. Ure and Lysle I. Abbott against the company in question, attacking its capitalization and the reasonableness of its rates of charges The physical value of the property of the defendant company will be a proper question of inquiry, and it is important that the Commission, in order to arrive at a fair and correct judgment, be fully advised in this regard. Kin a similar case in which the city of Lincoln was complainant and local street car companies were defendants, the city of Lincoln put vidence the testimony of its own expert engineers and an expert ac - ltant appointed by the Commission for that purpose. I Should the city of Omaha desire to file a complaint separately against Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway Company, or intervene in the rell case, any evidence It might offer with regard to the physical valu - n of the defendant company would, of course, receive careful consider- &gt;To have a physical valuation made by an expert such as Prof. Cooley lichigan would not, in the judgment of the Commission, involve an nditure in excess of $2,500.00. ■The Commission, in the event of a trial, would, of course, avail itself le services of its expert accountant, or, should the complainants de - an outside accountant, appoint one, as was done in the Lincoln case.

Now, gentle - men, if you can grant the permission to Mr. Nunemaker to put the tele - phone in, it will be a great convenience to me, as my son and daughter are my deputies. Mr. Nunemaker refuses on the ground that you have given him no decision yet on a similar case. Yours truly J. A. CUMMINGS. Lincoln, October 6, 1909. Mr. J. A.

E'e have no record of a similar proposition being presented to the ission for a ruling. If the added telephone were to be placed in the building it might properly be treated as an extension telephone for an extension rate, open to all subscribers alike under similar cir - ances, should be provided. If the added telephone is in another ng and can be called through the central exchange, it should take gular party line rate. If you contemplate simply a private line not connected with the ex - change between your store and the postoffice, we can see no reason at this time why the Commission should offer any objections to such an arrangement being entered into upon terms mutually agreeable. Sucli arrangement, however, is open to attack should other parties desire the telephone company to provide them with a similar line under like or similar circumstances. Very truly yours, HENRY T.

            <seg id="p284">284 SECOND ANNUAL REPORT The request Mr. Cummings made The Saline Telephone Company and his explanation to you, are just a little bit different. The telephone he originally wanted installed in the pos'.offlce was to be connected with our local switchboard the same as any other telephone, the difference being that this postoffice telephone should only be called from his store or his residence. This is a similar case to the Friend school house, in which the telephone to be installed there was to be for the special use of the members of the school board, which I, as general manager of this company, have refused to install and that case has been presented to you. This request of Mr. Cummings, however, has already been settled by - placing a telephone in the office and one in the store, where they call each other direct and have no connection with our switchboard.

They persuaded the former manager to run two wires into their houses and connect to their telephones with a knife switch. By throwing the switch they have the use of two lines and only pay rent for one. It creates a dissatisfaction among the members who have only one line and causes me much trouble.

Under the anti-discrimination se of the Railway Commission Act enclosed herewith (see subdivision ection 14) it is unlawful for any undue or unreasonable preference advantage to be given any particular person, company, firm, corpor - n or locality. </seg>

Dear Sir: Chapter 108 of the Laws of Nebraska, 1909, page 428, being an ac to regulate the issue of stocks, bonds, and other forms of indebtednes of common carriers and other public service corporations, provides tha "A common carrier or public service corporation, etc., may issue stock bonds, etc., provided that such corporation shall have secured from th Nebraska State Railway Commission an order authorizing such issue, am the amount thereof," but this chapter does not provide what corporation are included under "public service" corporations. The preceding chapte however, at page 424, provides that the term "public service corporation may mean and embrace railway, railroad, telegraph, express, telephon and the railroad transportation property of stock yard companies, an the question arises in my mind whether the same limitation in chapte 107 as to what is meant by a "public service corporation" extends t chapter 108, and I would greatly appreciate it if you would advise m whether or not your honorable Commission have placed a constructio on what corporations are included in "public service corporations" unde the provisions of chapter 108.

The Commission has assumed, however, that this term embraced all corporations devoting their property to a public use and performing a public service, and that, therefore, it includes not only railway, railroad, telegraph, express and telephone companies, but likewise electric light, power, heating, gas and water companies.

You can readily see that if it were permitted, there would be practically no limit to the practice and that it might easily lead to gross discrimination, in which special rates and privileges would be concealed in the purchase price of equipment. I Should a supply company or any other outside party desire to pay part or all of the telephone service of any particular individual or in - iuals, the law would not interfere, but such payment would have to ona Me. so that there would be no question about the telephone com- Y receiving its full published rates in cash.

Dear Sir: IFhe Farmers &amp; Merchants Telephone Company of Alma, Nebraska, called our attention to the fact that it is maintaining five business ihones in its exchange at Republican City for $1.00 per month. The lar rate for business service in said exchange is $1.50. Irhe reason given for these exceptions to its regular rate is that the persons for whom these telephones are maintained formerly owned elephone exchange at Republican City and sold out to the Farmers &gt;rchants Telephone Company of Alma in 1903, with the understanding they should pay no more than $1.00 per month for business tele - e service. We do not understand from the statement given us that •itten contract to this effect was executed, but that it was merely rbal agreement. The Commission desires your opinion in writing as to whether such verbal agreement would justify the telephone company in giving a lower rate to these parties than to its other subscribers for similar service, under the anti-discrimination statute, enacted in 1907; also whether a written contract would justify the continuance of such an arrangement. ■Will you kindly advise us on these points at your earliest conven e? Very truly yours, CLARK PERKINS, Secretary. Lincoln, March 23, 1909. Nebraska State Railway Commission I incoln, Nebraska.

            <seg id="p292">292 the regular rate for business service in said exchange being $1.50; and that the reason given for these exceptions from the regular rate is that five persons who formerly owned these telephones had sold out to the Farmers &amp; Merchants Telephone Company of Alma, with the understand - ing that they should pay no more than $1.00 a month for business tele - phone service in the future. You desire the opinion of this department as to whether, under the anti-discrimination statute of 1907, such a verbal agreement would justify the telephone company in giving a lower rate to these parties than it gives other subscribers for similar service; also whether such a written contract would justify the continuance of such a discriminatory rate. I My judgment is that neither a verbal nor a written agreement to effect is valid at the present time. It will be presumed that the )hone company that made such an agreement and the persons by m the exchange was sold did so with a knowledge of the authority le legislature to establish reasonable rates for common carriers and revent unjust discrimination. When the legislature acted and fixed, sr directly or through the Railway Commission, another and different of service than that established by the company itself, or when it ed an act to prevent unjust discrimination, any such contract yields uch legal inhibition and becomes nugatory. I The principle involved in this question was determined by the Su - ae Court in the case of State r. Martyn, 117 N. W. 719. In that case as contended that Martyn was entitled to receive and the railroad pany entitled to give transportation by reason of a contract made r to the enactment of the anti-pass law; that the anti-pass law was mstitutional because it disturbed vested rights arising out of the ract previously made, and that the anti-pass law impaired the obli - ons of contract. By section 7, article 11, constitution, it is provided: KThe legislature shall pass laws to correct abuses and prevent unjust iminations and extortions in all charges of express, telegraph and )ad companies in this state, and enforce such laws by adequate ties." t Telephone companies are, so far as said constitutional provision is erned, to be regarded the same as telegraph companies. The court le case above cited says: Kit is also well settled that the internal commerce of a state — is, the commerce wholly confined to and carried on within the s of a single state — is as -much under state control as foreign or state commerce is under the control of the general government. J 1 * The exercise of this power necessarily includes the right to rfere with contract and property rights, so far, at least, as may necessary to prevent extortion and discrimination. From even a 'ory examination of the several acts of our legislature on this subject, 3 apparent that the contract under consideration was, and is, dis - linatory in its nature. We find that like contracts have been fre - atly declared to be so." (State v. Martyn. 117 N. W. 722.) KI am, therefore, led to the conclusion that this contract, being in nature of an unjust discrimination, is contrary to that portion of fat - way Commission Act which expressly forbids the same, and if said </seg>

I "Upon the payment of the freight charges, as above stated, does ita rstate character cease to attach to such shipment and is it thereafter, »r as subsequent demurrage charges that may accrue are concerned, ect to state regulation? ■'In this connection, your attention is specifically directed to the that car service rules are a part of the tariff provisions under which state shipments are made." I If the car service rules are a part of the tariff provisions under which interstate shipments are made, the contract of shipment is made reference thereto and the same must necessarily form a part there- The shipment is an interstate shipment and the railway company fully performed its part of the contract, in my judgment, when it has </seg>
            <seg id="p294">294 SECOND ANNUAL REPORT transported the goods to the place of destination and set out the car at t where the shipper is enabled to unload the same. The shipper's :t, however, is not completed simply by the payment of the freight i, since the freight charges are only a part of his obligation. The age charges that accrue after the free time has elapsed for the ' to unload the car, so accrue by virtue of the contract of shipment, Is interstate in character. In the case of Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Co. v. Texas, 204 U. S. 403, the Supreme Court of the United held: "An interstate shipment — in this case of carload lots — on reaching the point specified in the original contract of transportation ceases to be an interstate shipment, and its further transportation to another point within the same state, on the order of the consignee, is controlled by the law of the state and not by the Interstate Commerce Act." But, in my judgment, this decision is not authority on the proposi - tion stated in your communication. The demurrage charges accruing on an interstate shipment are easily distinguishable from the transportation charges from point of destination of the interstate shipment to another point within the same state accruing under a separate and different con - tract and under different laws than those under which the interstate ship - ment was made. In the case quoted the contract for interstate shipment was completed, so far as the common carrier was concerned, when it was delivered to the consignee at its original point of destination. In the case involved in your question the railway company performed all its ob - ligation at the time it transported the car to the point of destination named in the bill of lading and tendered delivery. The payment by the shipper, however, of the freight charges might or might not amount to a complete fulfillment of his contract obligations to the carrier. The duty to un - load the car was upon him, and also the obligation for the payment of demurrage in case he failed to unload the car within a given length of time after delivery. Kt appears that the Interstate Commerce Commission has taken, and ercising, jurisdiction over demurrage charges on interstate ship - i by the adoption of the following rule: I Demurrage rules and charges must be observed as strictly as trans - ,tion rules and charges. The Commission cannot, therefore, recog - as lawful any rule governing demurrage, the application of which pendent upon the judgment or discretion of some person, or which des for exemption therefrom in certain exigencies in the creation lich the carrier has no part. Interstate tariffs containing such rules be corrected or canceled." (Supplement No. 1, to Tariff Circular ■ I find that in the application of the John Deere Plow Company for &gt;fund of demurrage charges on an interstate shipment or shipments. Interstate Commerce Commission held as follows: "Demurrage charges are not alone exacted as compensation for the use of equipment beyond the free time allowed but primarily and principally are intended to accomplish the prompt loading and unloading of equipment in order that other shippers may have the use of it, as well m, in instances where cars are placed upon the tracks of railroad </seg>

From an examination of the opinions of the Supreme and circuit courts of the United States and the holdings of the Interstate Commerce Commission, I am led to the conclusion that the matter of demurrage charges on interstate shipments falls within the jurisdiction of the Inter - state Commerce Commission rather than that of the State Railway Com - mission, even though the demurrage charges accrued within the state of Nebraska. I am led to this conclusion also from the fact that these demurrage charges are an incident to and grow out of an interstate transaction Very respectfully, W. T.

I We desire your opinion on the proposition as to whether the action ny railroad company in the carrying, storing or handling of freight of charge or at reduced rates under the provisions of this section, be made the basis of a complaint for discrimination, and whether the mission can, on its own motion upon complaint, compel a railroad pany to transport, store or handle any particular class of freight of charge or at a reduced rate for the state, or for any city, county )wn government, or for charitable purposes, or to and from fairs and &gt;sitions for exhibition thereat.

I am inclined to the belief that this provision was enacted for the purpose of enabling railroad companies to carry or handle freight free of charge or at reduced rates for the government, municipalities, charity or exhibition, at its option. As an abstract proposition I do not think the Railway Commission would have a general authority in the premises. There might be cases, however, where the conduct of a carrier would not be justified while pretending to operate under the authority conferred by the statute above set forth, and its conduct might amount in certain cases to an unjust discrimination. I would not feel like holding that a case might not arise where the Commission would be without authority to act in the premises to prevent any unjust discrimination where the carrier might be pretending to operate under the authority conferred by this statute. Where the carrier, however, is acting in good faith, I think it is doubtful if the Commission could intervene and prevent the carrier from exercising reasonable discretion in granting concessions or ad - vantages enumerated in the statute, in the exercise of its option. The question you submit is an abstract one, and until a concrete case arises and I am advised of the cognate or attending facts and circum - stances, I would not be able to give an opinion that would be satisfac - tory either to the Commission or to myself. Very respectfully, W. T. THOMPSON, Attorney General. &gt;o. 15. (Copy.) Lincoln, May 17. 1909. Mr. G. F. Rose Genoa, Nebraska.

Kam directed by the Commission to request you to give an opinion ting at your earliest convenience on the above propositions. Very truly yours. CLARK PERKINS, Secretary. Lincoln, August 7, 1909. Nebraska State Railway Commission Lincoln. Gentlemen : I am in receipt of your communication of August 5, submitting the following questions and requesting an opinion thereon: E. Would a train consisting of six cars, of which five or less carry lgers, be required, under section 1, house roll 374 of the late legis - , to be manned by a full crew provided for in said section for trains re than five cars carrying passengers? ■I. What ie the responsibility of conductors running trains not equip - with full crews, under the act, particularly as to whether they d be liable as officers or agents of the railroad company, under section said actr </seg>
            <seg id="p299">299 First. I have made a careful examination of the provisions of sec - tions 1 and 4 of the act referred to. Section 1 provides as follows: I "That it shall be unlawful for any railroad company doing business In state of Nebraska, to operate or run over its road or any part Bof, or suffer or permit to be run over its road or any part thereof, ide of the yard limits, any passenger, mail or express train carrying engers, whose regular equipment consists of more than five cars, a crew consisting of less than one engineer, one fireman, one Con - or, one brakeman and one flagman and further provided that pas - er trains whose regular equipment consists of five cars or less may perated with a crew consisting of one engineer, one fireman, one con - or and one brakeman or flagman." In the foregoing it is provided that a mail or an express train carry ing passengers, which has a regular equipment consisting of more than five cars, must be provided with a crew consisting of not less than on engineer, one fireman, one conductor, one brakeman and one flagman. Tl particular matter treated of in this section of the statute is "a mail o express train carrying passengers, whose regular equipment consists o more than five cars." It seems to have been the intention of the leglsl ture that if any train was operated whose regular equipment consisted of more than five cars, irrespective of the particular number of ca carrying passengers, it was unlawful for it to run over any part of th road outside of the yard limits, unless it contained a crew consistin of not less than one engineer, one fireman, one conductor, one brakema and one flagman. E: is my opinion that a mail or express train consisting of more than ars carrying passengers, whether the passengers are carried in one r more, is required to be equipped with a crew of not less than one eer, one fireman, one conductor, one brakeman and one flagman. Second. Section 4 of said act provides as follows: "That the officers or agents of any railroad company doing business in the state of Nebraska who shall send out on its road, or cause or suffer or permit to be sent out on its road or any part thereof, outside of the yard limits, any passenger or freight train which is not manned in accordance with the provisions of sections one, two and three of this act shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be fined not less than one hundred dollars ($100) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each offense and shall stand committed until such fine and costs are paid, and any railroad company in the state of Nebraska whose officer or officers, agent or agents or any servant or servants, shall be found guilty of such misdemeanor, shall be liable for any damages caused by the violation of the provisions of this act." KFhis section is a penal statute. Penal statutes are to be strictly con - id. This statute makes officers or agents alone criminally responsible. agents spoken of are "officers or agents of any railroad company do- Dusiness in the state of Nebraska who shall send out on its road, or e or suffer or permit to be sent out on its road," trains, etc. I do not think that the term "officers or agents," mentioned in this statute, was intended to include conductors. The statute does not in express terms include them. As conductors are not such officers and agents as send out trains upon the road, I do not think they could be </seg>
            <seg id="p300">300 held to be included in the term "officers and agents," as employed and used in this section of the statute. Such officers as would be amenable to this provision of the law, in my opinion, would be those officers and agents of the company who are clothed with authority to, and who do, send out, or cause to be sent out, trains upon the road of the company. Very respectfully, W. T. THOMPSON, Attorney General. &gt;o. 18. Lincoln, August 18, 1909. Hon. W. T. Thompson, Attorney General. Dear Sir: K'here have been filed in this department numerous complaints by us parties, complaining that the railroads running through their have been constructed in such a manner as to prevent the free and al flow of water, and to cause, particularly in times of flood, back - r, thereby resulting to the damage of the complainants. Complainants realize, of course, that they can recover damages, but they also realize that such relief is expensive and slow, and the purpose of their complaints is to compel the railroad company to so construct its track as to permit the free and unobstructed flow of water and to obviate backwater in case of flood. Bi the Commission Act we find no specific authority giving us juris - n in such matters other than paragraph n of section 2, providing: "Said Commission shall have the power to adopt rules and regulations to govern its proceedings, the mode and manner of conducting investi - gations and hearing of railroad companies, common carriers and other persons before it, with reference to the fixing of any rate or rates, classifications and charges for the transportation of freight and cars, the making of any orders provided for herein or under the laws of this state relating to the control and regulation of railway companies and common carriers, and other acts required of it by the laws of this state, provided that no person desiring to be present at any such investigation or hearing by said Commission shall be denied admission." I Inasmuch as the experience of the Commission thus far has been that plainants securing affirmative relief through order of the Commission on the Commission to prosecute all appeals taken (and they usually taken from such matters), we hesitate to assume jurisdiction in e cases and throw an extra burden upon your department, when, as understand it, relief in each case will result in a benefit, not to the lie, but to particular individuals, who have recourse not only in a for damages, but in a court of equity to correct the abuse com- ■Will you kindly investigate the law with reference to this matter advise us whether or not, in your opinion, we should, under the and the circumstances, assume jurisdiction in these cases? Yours truly, HENRY T. CLARKE, Jr., Chairman. </seg>
            <seg id="p301">301 Lincoln, August 19, 1909 Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln Gentlemen: I am in receipt of your communication of August 18th, stating that there have been filed in your department numerous complaints to the effect that railroads running through private lands have been so con - structed as to prevent the free and natural flow of flood waters, causing them to back flow and resulting in injury to the premises of certain indi - viduals. You request my advice as to whether or not the Commission should assume jurisdiction in cases of this character. It has been repeatedly held by the Supreme Court of this state thac overflows resulting from negligent construction of a roadbed by railroad companies, resulting in injury to another, is an actionable cause for which indemnity may be recovered. It has been declared by this Court that the rule of common law that surface water is a common enemy and the owner may defend his premises against it is the law of this state, »if damages result to adjoining proprietors by reason thereof, he is liable therefor. This rule, however, is a general one and is sub - ject to another common law rule that a proprietor must so use his own property as not to unnecessarily and negligently injure his neighbor, and if, in the execution of an enterprise affecting surface or flood waters, he is guilty of negligence, which is the natural and proximate cause of injury to his neighbor, he is accountable therefor. ( Lincoln &amp;■ B. H. H Co. v. Sutherland, 44 Neb. 526.) The right of action for such injuries is a private right. Adequate damages may be recovered in such cases in the courts of law. If the dam - ages resulting from the negligent construction of an embankment which causes the surface or flood water of a stream or natural outlet for sur - face water to back up and flood the premises of an owner of real estate are oft-recurring, such negligent construction might constitute a private nuisance which could be abated by injunction in a court of equity on private suit of the injured person. There are two classes of nuisances — private and public. A private nuisance is one that affects a single indi - vidual or a determinate number of persons in the enjoyment of some private right not common to the public; a public nuisance is one that, affects the people at large, and is a violation of a public right, either by a direct encroachment upon public property or by doing some act which tends to the common injury or by omitting to do, in the discharge of a legal duty, that which the common good requires. Over the latter, which may be occasioned by the negligence of railroad companies, I am inclined to think the Railway Commission has jurisdiction and may properly make orders that have for their object the removal of the causes which produce the nuisance; but over nuisances that are only pri - vate in character, I have serious doubts of the authority of the Commis - sion. The complaints that you mention in your letter do not, in any event, involve more than private nuisances. There is no express authority to be found, either in the constitutional </seg>
            <seg id="p302">302 SECOND ANNUAL REPORT amendment creating the State Railway Commission or in the statute passed by the legislature defining its powers and duties, giving the Com - mission authority over cases of this kind. When orders are made by your Commission it is incumbent upon you, and the legal department, to defend and enforce Che same. This has to be done at the cost and expense of the state. Therefore, before any matter is taken jurisdic - tion of by your Commission, in which orders are to be made, the authority of the Commission to act should be clear and orders should be made for the most part only in cases affecting the public, as distinguished from those affecting private, rights. From all orders made by the Commission against railroad companies an appeal may be tak^n by the companies to the district court. Experience has taught us .hat such an appeal is almost universally taken. The taking of such appeal, except from orders fixing rates, has the effect of suspending the order until the appeal is determined by the court. To me it seems unfair that the pub - lic should be compelled to pay the cost and expense of the litigation inciient to the orders made by the Commission, where the rights sought to be established thereby are private rights and affect private interests, as distinguished from public rights or rights which affect a considerable portion of the public. Viewing the matter from the standpoint of expediency or ability, I may add that no sufficient appropriation has been made either to your or the legal department to take care of litigation that naturally arise from the procedure incident to such cases as yon mention. K" cannot persuade myself that it was the intention of the legislature nfer authority upon the Commission or require it to take upon itself uty of adjusting matters of this character. I For the reason that the right to do so is not expressly given by and could only be assumed by placing a strained construction upon provisions of law defining the powers and duties of the Commission, for the other reasons above suggested, I do not think the Commis - ought to entertain complaints of this character, but that they ild be presented to the courts whose jurisdiction is certain and where &gt;er redress can be had.

ORDER OF THE COMMISSION. HENRY T. CLARKE, Jr., Chairman: Under date of June 15, 1908, the Nebraska State Railway Commission issued its general order No. 16, which provided as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p303">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 303 business in the state of Nebraska be, and the same are hereby notified and directed from and after the first day of August, 1908, to cease and desist from charging and collecting for messenger service where no messenger service is actually performed. EiVhere a toll line company has a contract with a local exchange, by the local exchange receives a percentage or part of the toll rates siness destinating or originating on its line, the connecting of its ribers with the toll line at its switchboard will not be deemed mes - r service within the meaning of this order, unless provided for by blished rates, filed and approved by this Commission." Ewas not the intention of the Commission to deprive any local tele - company of a fair rate of compensation for delivery over its switch - of toll messages originating on the lines of a connecting carrier. IPhe occasion for the order arose from the practice of certain com - ;s charging a messenger fee over and above their regularly filed published toll rates, where no messenger service was performed. ery being made through the switchboard and over the lines of the exchange with whom relations were maintained for such purpose. »e opinion of the Commission, delivery fees in such cases should be by the long distance company out of its regularly published rate, not collected from the patron in addition to the long distance rate. Iubsequent to the issuance of said general order No. 16, complaint filed in the office of the Commission that the Northern Antelope ihone Company and the Northwestern Telephone Company were ;ing and collecting an arbitrary line charge of ten cents on all in - lg long distance calls at their exchanges located at Neligh, Bruns- Orchard, etc. Krhe said companies sought to justify said charge by reason of the that, previous 10 the issuance of said general order No. 16, they had their schedule of rates and charges, which included, among other ;s, the ten-cent arbitrary or line charge on all incoming long dis- I calls. The mere filing of the schedule of rates in question, which was in compliance with the requirements of the statute, and the subsequent ex - action of the charges therein provided for by the companies, unre - stricted by the Commission, does not constitute an approval of said rates, by the Commission within the meaning of general order No. 16. tThe Commission is also of the opinion that the exaction of an arbi - f line charge of ten cents on all incoming long distance calls, with - a corresponding charge being made on outgoing long distance calls. eby making the charge to a party calling Neligh from Battle Creek :y-five cents, as against a charge to a party calling Battle Creek from gh twenty-five cents, constitutes unjust discrimination and is there - unlawful. It further appears that under the terms of a contract entered into* by the Northwestern Telephone Company with the Nebraska Telephone Company under date of December 20th, 1905, and expiring January 1st, 1910, it was expressly agreed that the Northwestern Telephone Company should receive fifteen per cent, (not, however, exceeding fifteen cents </seg>
            <seg id="p304">304 SECOND ANNUAL REPORT 11 y one communication) of all tolls collected by the Northwestern hone Company on its toll business over the Nebraska Telephone any's lines originating at Neligh, and should make no charge for inger service on inward calls over the toll lines of the "Nebraska hone Company to subscribers of its exchange unless a messenger :e was ac-tual'o performed." ft further appears that under the terms of said contract, said North - rn Telephone Company was to receive two and one-half cents for completed call switched through its Neligh office. Ehe Commission cannot but conclude from the foregoing that this ary line charge of ten cent;: is unreasonable and excessive, and The Commission is of the opinion that on all long distance business a single or through rate should apply for the completed service, and that a local exchange handling long distance calls, originating or destinating at the telephone of a subscriber of said exchange, should be paid for its service by the long distance company out of its regularly published rates, and that unless some unusual circumstances change the conditions in a given case, no local line charge should be permitted in addition to the published toll charge on long distance business.

IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the line charge of ten cents made by the Northwestern Telephone Company and the Northern Antelope Tele - phone Company on all incoming long distance calls, be and the same is hereby disapproved. I IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Northwestern Telephone Com - r and the Northern Antelope Telephone Company be, and the same are by notified to cease and desist from charging and collecting any charge for local exchange service, in addition %o the regular and pub - id long distance charges, on long distance calls originating or deeti - ag at the telephone of a local subscriber of said companies; this order ecome effective March 1, 1909.

X. That on June 15, 1908, the defendant Nebraska Railway Commission, after hearing thereon, made and entered the following order: "It is hereby ordered that all telephone companies doing business in the state of Nebraska, be, and the same are hereby notified and directed, from and after the first day of August, 1908, to cease and desist from charging and collecting for messenger service where no messenger service has been actually performed. Where a toll line company has a contract with a local exchange, whereby the local exchange receives a percentage or part of toll rate on business destinated or originated on its lines, the con - nection of its subscribers with the toll line at its switchboard will not be deemed a messenger service within the meaning of this order, unless provided for by its published rates, filed and approved by this Commis - sion," which order was duly mailed to plaintiff during the month of July, 1908. XI. I That prior to December 1, 1908, plaintiff, in answer to its inquiries as hether or not its said rates filed with defendant Nebraska State Rail- Commission April 8, 1908, were by it approved, was advised by mun - &gt; of said Commission and by its secretary, that the rates so filed were roved when they were filed without objection; and no objection hav - been made to plaintiff's said rates, and relying upon the approval of rates, the plaintiff continued to charge and collect for the use of &gt;wn lines, ten cents on each message coming into its exchange over Nebraska Telephone lines, destinating at one of the 'phones of plain - i said exchange, which charge was in addition to toll charge made .he Nebraska Telephone Company therefor. XII. I That it was the practice of the defendant, the Nebraska State Rail- Commission, to treat and consider all rates and charges filed with i approved, unless objection thereto was made by said board, and the man carrier so filing said rates, notified of disapproval of same by board. XIII. That on February 17, 1909, after due notice to plaintiff and hearing, the defendant Nebraska State Railway Commission made the following finding: "That the exaction of such line charge of ten cents is un - reasonable and excessive; that on all long distance business a single or through rate should apply for completed service, and that a local </seg>
            <seg id="p308">308 exchange handling long distance calls, originating or destinating at th telephone of a subscriber of an exchange, should be paid for its servic by the long distance company out of its regular, published rates, and tha unless some unusual circumstance change the conditions in a give case, no local line charge should be permitted in addition to the pu llshed toll charge in long distance business," and thereupon said M braska State Railway Commission made the order appealed from by d fendant herein, and on February 17, 1909, mailed to plaintiff a cop thereof. XIV That plaintiff has all the time during the past three years paid from its earnings a monthly dividend of 1 per cent, to its stockholders, and during all of said time only nominal salaries have been paid to its man - aging officers, and all four of the stockholders of the plaintiff hold office and assist in the management of the affairs of the plaintiff. The present Income from the business of the Nebraska Telephone Company, based upon the collection of the connecting fee and without the 10 cents on inward calls, is not equal to the cost of central operators, and the cost of making out the reports and the cost of collecting the tolls of the Nebraska Telephone Company. The effect of the order complained of, unless additional compensation be received from the Nebraska Telephone Company, will be to still further reduce this income about $10.00 per month, after allowing the 10 per cent, on inward business which the Nebraska Telephone Company offers in lieu of the 10-cent connection fee CONCLUSIONS OF LAW I. Eat subscribers for 'phones of plaintiff at its said exchange at are, by virtue of monthly rentals paid to plaintiff, entitled to con - i by plaintiff, at its central in the city of Neligh, with every tele - instrument in the said city of Neligh on said exchange of plaintiff. II. Ehat said order of February 17, 1909, is and was an order changing ,tes allowed to be charged by plaintiff and could not under the law 'orced until the expiration of 30 days after mailing same to plaintiff. III. That said order made by said defendant, the Nebraska State Railway Commission, February 17, 1909, and appealed from by plaintiff, was an order fixing through rates for messages over the telephone line of the Nebraska Telephone Company and lines of plaintiff to and from sub - scribers of plaintiff's said exchange, and did not operate to prevent plaintiff from charging and collecting from the Nebraska Telephone Com - pany ten cents, or any reasonable charge, for connecting the lines of the Nebraska Telephone Company with its exchange and its subscribers' 'phones, nor for the use of the plaintiff's telephone line on such long </seg>
            <seg id="p309">309 I nee calls, nor to prevent plaintiff from an application therefor ha\ he through rate apportioned by defendant between plaintiff and th aska Telephone Company, but would operate to prevent the chargin collecting of said ten cents from the patrons of said companies, i ion to the regular published rates of the Nebraska Telephone Com for such long distance calls, and in the record of the hearing b Nebraska State Railway Commission, in making said order, the de mt Nebraska State Railway Commission so expressed its intention ) the effect of its said order, to which finding plaintiff excepted. IV. I That, the provision of said order that the same should go into effect larch 1, 1909, was unlawful, and that the intention of defendant to rce the same on and after March 1, 1909, and prior to the expiration drty days from the mailing of the same to plaintiff, was contrary to and would entitle plaintiff to have defendants restrained from putting arce said order prior to March 20, 1909, and that said order in all r respects was and is not unreasonable. I It is therefore considered by the court that the order appealed from in, does not operate to prevent plaintiff from charging the Nebraska phone Company ten cents, or any reasonable race on all incoming long ince calls over lines of plaintiff to its subscribers, but does operate revent plaintiff from charging to the persons using the lines of the -aska Telephone Company and plaintiff for such calls, ten cents, ny sum in addition to the regular published and approved long dis - e charge for such calls; that such order is not unreasonable; that temporary order of injunction issued heretofore be, and the same by is dissolved, perpetual order denied and this cause dismissed. ■ It is further considered and adjudged by the court that each party his own costs, to which order and judgment the plaintiff excepted. I And this cause coming on further to be heard on the motion of plain - to set aside the judgment for a new trial, said motion is overruled, hich plaintiff excepted. Plaintiff is given 40 days from the adjourn - t sine die of the court to prepare and submit a bill of exceptions ; and laintiff's request a supersedeas bond is fixed at the sum of $1,000.00. ANSON A.

            <seg id="p310">310 ILofore made in this case, and having heard the evidence and argu - a of counsel, begs to submit the following report of his findings of and conclusions of law: FINDINGS OF FACT. 1. Wells, Fargo &amp; Company is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Colorado and is engaged in the express business in 28 states and in the Republic of Mexico. The total mileage which it oper - ates is 50,000. It operates in Nebraska on Che lines of the St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island Railroad Company. It has a capital stock of $8,000,000 00 divided into 80,000 shares of $100.00 each. Its total earnings for the year ending June 30, 1907, were $22,934,425 and its total expenses were $19,566,403.00, leaving a net revenue for that year of $3,381,172.57 or 14.9 per cent, of its gross income. It has a total mileage in Nebraska of 115 and its gross revenue for August, September and October, 1907, from Nebraska intrastate business was $1,640.69. This express company pays the railroad upon which it operates in Nebraska 50 per cent of its gross express receipts. I!. The company claims that it lost in 1907 upon its Nebraska intra - business for the months aforesaid $13.85, or 8-10 of 1 per cent, of its 3 receipts for those months. Applying the Sibley rates to these &gt; months of its 1907 business, the company estimates that its loss r those rates for the same months of 1908 was approximately $112.64, 4 per cent, of its gross intrastate receipts. Neither this claim nor estimate takes any account of receipts from sales of money orders '. increased business resulting from reduced rates. 3. The company's exhibit A, which was introduced for the purpose of showing its receipts and expenditures on express business between stations in Nebraska, and the gross charges on money orders sold in Ne - braska for the months of August, September and October, 1907, is as follows: EXHIBIT A.

It also includes the route agents' salaries. likewise apportioned upon a percentage basis, determined by the Nebraska mileage; and expense of superintendence, by which is meant the salary and expenses of the superintendent in charge of the division within which the Nebraska mileage of this company is situated. This charge is further distributed according to the ratio which "the total intrastate earnings bear to the portion of the interstate earnings earned in Ne- braska, based on the Nebraska mileage. If the method employed by the company in the apportionment of expenses as shown in the foregoing tables is the proper method, and if the money order revenue is rightly left out of account, the Sibley Act cannot be lawfully enforced and judgment should go in its favor, unless the Court shall hold that it was bound to satisfactorily show that its dis- bursements were under all the circumstances reasonable and proper dis- bursements, and that it failed to make such showing. 6. The actual effect of the Sibley law upon the company's intra- state business is shown with substantial correctness in the state's exhibit 19 for the months of April, May, June, July and August, 1908. This table is made up from the monthly statements sent to the Nebraska State Railway Commission by the agents of the company and is as follows: STATE'S EXHIBIT 19. Wells, Fargo &amp; Co.

            <seg id="p315">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 315 It will be noticed that counsel differ in their methods of apportioning expenses only with respect to item 6 of exhibit 19. The state makes the apportionment, except as to stable expenses, on the percentage that the intrastate revenue bears to the total state and interstate revenue, while the company divides all the terminal expenses according to the ratio which the number of intrastate packages bear to the number of interstate packages. I believe the state's method of apportionment is a fair method. At any rate, I cannot find that it is so manifestly inequitable as to justif} the Court in adjudging the Sibley Act (which perhaps contem - plates that method) to be unconstitutional. K. I find that the revenue derived from the sale of money orders in iska is properly regarded as part of the company's intrastate reven - and if the company's claim that the Sibley rates are confiscatory &gt;e sustained only by holding such revenues not intrastate revenues, ontention should, I .hink, be overruled. 8. The average cost of transportation to the express company over all the lines operated by it is 46 per cent, of its gross receipts, and there being no evidence on the subject, I cannot find that the charge of 50 per cent, of the gross revenues upon Nebraska intrastate business is a reasonable and proper charge. The legislature may have, after full in - vestigation, found the charge excessive and they may have based the Sib - ley Act upon that finding. If so, the Court cannot presume the finding was wrong and make the presumption the basis of a decree nullifying the law. It is not enough for the company to come into court and say, "We paid out so much money to this official and so much money for that pur - pose and therefore a rate law which leaves an inadequate balance or no balance at all is confiscatory and void." Involved in the limitation upon express rates is, of course, a limitation upon railroad transportation charges. Therefore, to presume that these charges are reasonable may be to presume that the rate law is unconstitutional. K. I find that whether the money order receipts be taken into ac - or not as part of the company's intrastate revenues, the Sibley Act t confiscatory if the method of apportionment adopted in the con - tion of exhibit 19 is not an unlawful method. 110. The value of the property devoted to the Nebraska intrastate ness does not appear, but it is evidently small and is certainly not igh to possibly affect the conclusion which I have reached. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW. B Applying to this case the principles laid down in the case of the us Express Company, my conclusions of law are: B First. That the Sibley Act, so far as it affects Che business of s, Fargo &amp; Company Express, is not conflscatory. ■Second. That judgment on the merits should be rendered in favor te state and against the company. JOHN J. SULLIVAN, Referee. </seg>
            <seg id="p316">316 No. 15310. State of Nebraska, Plaintiff; v. The Adams Express Company, Defendant. The undersigned, having heard the evidence and arguments of coun - sel, begs leave to submit the following report: FINDINGS OF FACT. Et the conclusion of defendant's evidence the state filed a motion dgment in its favor, and the undersigned, after hearing arguments the motion, prepared a report of his findings of fact and conclusions I 'his report, on account of the state having subsequently elected to ■raw its motion and introduce evidence, was never filed; but as it with the whole of the material evidence given by the defendant, and 8 in part the questions involved in the final submission, it is reproduced : The questions involved in this action are (1) whether chapter 91, Session Laws 1907, commonly known as the "Sibley Act," is under any circumstances valid legislation; and (2) whether, if valid, it can, under existing conditions of business, be constitutionally enforced against the defendant, the Adams Express Company. Section 5 of this act is as follows: "If any express company should fail to comply with the provisions and conditions of this act, they shall be fined on conviction a sum not less than ten dollars or more than one thousand for each offense." It is asserted by counsel for defendant that the penalties prescribed by this section prevent the express companies from securing a judicial inquiry into the validity of the statute, except by incurring a prohibitive risk, and constitute, therefore, a violation of the equality clause of the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution. Two federal cases — Catting r. Kansas City Stock Yards Co., 183 U. S. 79, and Ex parte Younq, 28 Sup. Ct. Rep. 441 — are cited in support of this contention. As - suming that each overcharge constitutes a separate offense I am, never - theless, of opinion that the act does not fall within the condemnation of the caaes cited. Manifestly the penalties prescribed were not intended to prevent the express companies from resorting to the courts for the pur - pose of testing the validity of the rates established; and it is evident, too, that they are not calculated to have that effect. Unless the Court deals with this question on an assumption which it must feel practically certain is false and groundless, it cannot accept the theory that the prob - ability of prosecutions and collection of penalties is so menacing and de - terrent as to amount to a denial of the equal protection of the laws. Be - sides, the penalty section is a separable part of the act. It may be stricken out without affecting the other sections. Whether the rates prescribed by the Sibley Act are, as applied </seg>
            <seg id="p317">317 to the defendant under present conditions, so unreasonably low as to make their enforcement equivalent to the taking of property for pub - lic use without just compensation, or to a denial of the equal pro - tection of the laws, is a question more difficult of solution. The At - torney General on behalf of the state produced no evidence at the trial but, assuming that the evidence of defendant and the warrantable in - ferences therefrom do not overcome the presumption that the act is valid and enforceable, moved for judgment making the preliminary injunction perpetual. The facts are not disputed, but. counsel differ as to the conclusions which they afford. The defendant is a common carrier. It operates in twenty-eight states and upon 34,862 miles of railroad and other lines of transportation. It is not incorporated, but is a joint stock company. It has a capital stock of $12,000,000.00, 120,000 shares and 2,700 shareholders. The territory in which it oper - ates is divided into three departments. The western department, which includes Nebraska, has a mileage of 18,652. The Nebraska mile - age, being all the Burlington lines in the state, is 2,514. The company has 272 offices in this state and about 450 employes. The value of the property employed in carrying on its entire business is not disclosed, but the estimated value of the portion devoted to the service in Ne - braska is between $50,000.00 and $60,000.00. The gross revenues of the company upon all its lines for the year ending December 31, 1907, were $27,822,738.23, and its operating expenses for the same period — the expenses incurred in earning these revenues — were $27,356,345.17, leaving a net profit of $466,393.06, or 1.6 per cent, out of the gross receipts. The total number of Nebraska shipments, interstate and intrastate, during 1907, was 1,853,024, of which 849,376, or 45.8 per cent, of the total, were intrastate, upon which defendant collected charges aggregating $277,727.76, being an average of 32.7 cents per package. The cost of earning these revenues is quite clearly shown in tabulated form by exhibit 5, a copy of which, revised by defendant's counsel for the purpose of eliminating conceded errors, is as follows: </seg>

Items 1 to 8, inclusive, in the above table, and items 18 and 19, represent local expenses only; that is, expenses in - curred exclusively in carrying on the Nebraska intrastate and inter - state business. Items 9, 11, 12, 14, 15 and 17 represent expenses con - nected with and properly chargeable to the western department. Items 10 and 16 represent expenses of the western division of the western department, of which Nebraska is a part. To determine the portion of western department expenses chargeable to Nebraska the mileage basis is adopted. The Nebraska mileage is 40.1 per cent of the mile - age of the western division of Che western department, and so Ne - braska business is charged with 40.1 per cent, of the expenses of that division; and the Nebraska mileage being 13.4 per cent, of the mile - age of the western department, Nebraska business is charged with 13.4 per cent, of the expenses of that department. All these expenses are further divided between intrastate business and interstate business on the ratio that each class bears to the other. This division results in charging the domestic business with 45.8 of the entire expenses chargeable to Nebraska business. I The points upon which counsel differ with respect to Che con - ions to be drawn from the evidence will be, perhaps, more readily eived by inserting here a revision of exhibit 5, made by the At - ey General, and used in the argument of the case. It is as follows: ADAMS EXPRESS COMPANY. Readjustment of Exhibit 13 of Witness Glenn's Testimony. June, 1907.

In my opinion the view of the At - torney General, except as to the item of $613.32, which was collected under occupation tax ordinances, is the correct view. As express com - panies are, under the present revenue law, subject to general taxation only upon their property and franchises {Wmtmu Umim Nqprapl Onuihit. 103 N. W. 84; Xebnukn IWq*MI Oh ••. Unit. 160 N. W. R. 471) and as such property and franchises are employed in carrying on both intrastate and interstate business, the justice and propriety of an apportionment of general taxes, as an item of local expenses, are manifest. When such apportionment is made it appears that the total net earnings for 1907 upon Nebraska intrastate business was $14,336.29, which is approximately 5 1-6 per cent, of the gross earnings. IThe rates prescribed by the Sibley Act have been in effect since 11 15, 1908, and there has been presented by defendant, as part of evidence, a tabulated statement showing their practical operation June, 1908, as compared with June, 1907. This statement is :ribed in the record as "exhibit 13." It was constructed on the e theory that exhibit 5 was constructed and contains the same irs. A revision of exhibit 13, prepared by the Attorney General to Form to this understanding of the effect of the evidence, is aa jws: 12 umber of pieces handled: June, 1907, state 64,142 — 46.6 per cent, of total June, 1907, interstate 73,515 — 53.4 per cent, of total June, 1908, state 82,815 — 48.4 per cent, of total June, 1908, interstate 88,276 — 51.6 per cent, of total June, 1908.

            <seg id="p324">324 I The percentages adopted in making the foregoing revision were e used by counsel for both parties in revising exhibit 5, and it may, efore, be assumed that it is correct, except as to the apportion - t of taxes. A further revision, based on the assumption that the ipation tax will be the same this year as last, shows net earnings June, 1908, of about $544.00, or approximately $6,528.00 for the June is, according to the defendant's evidence, an average th in the express business. Some other facts, which may have an important bearing upon the case, should be here mentioned. The number of interstate packages han - dled in Nebraska in 1907 was 1,003,648, upon which there was collected $655,027.52, being an average of 65 cents per package. The average revenue on each intrastate package handled in 1907 was approximately 33 cents, and the average profit upon each package was 1.7 cents. The average re - duction of charges effected by the Sibley Act is 23.6 per cent. The average revenue on each domestic package in June, 1908, was 27 cents. The in - crease in tonnage in June, 1908, over June, 1907, was 29.1 per cent. The increased cost of handling this business was $664.19 and the increased revenue obtained from it was $210.72. Prom the foregoing statement of facts it will be seen '.hat on de - fendant's own showing it will probably earn under the tariff of rates prescribed by the Sibley Act, taking no account of the money order business, not less than 2 2-5 per cent, upon its gross receipts for domestic transportation. And if the relation between profits on June business and profits on business for the entire year is not limited to 1907, but holds good generally, this percentage would be increased to nearly 3 per cent. The margin of profit on each transaction is exceedingly narrow, and but for the multitude of transactions the business would doubtless be carried on at a loss. It is contended by counsel for defendant that in transport ing commodities the service rendered by an express company is peculiarly a personal service, in estimating the value of which, profits resulting from a large volume of business is an element entitled to little or no con - sideration. An express company, as a common carrier of freight, is by the common law, by the constitution of this state, and by the fourteenth amendment of the federal constitution, entitled to charge reasonable rates and receive just compensation for the services which it renders to the public. This much is settled by conclusive authority, but wha r . constitutes reasonable rates and just compensation is still an open and debatable question. The line of separation between lawful limitation of maxi - mum charges and confiscation of property by enactment is still, prac - tically, undefined. As said in Covington v. Sanford, 164 U. S. 578: I "Each case must depend upon its special facts and when a court, hout assuming itself to prescribe rates, is required to determine sther the rates prescribed by the legislature for a corporation trolling a public highway are, as an entirety, so unjust as to destroy value of its property for all the purposes for which it was acquired, duty is to take into consideration the interests both of the public and Lhe owner of the property, together with all other circumstances tha: fairly to be considered in determining whether the legislature has, </seg>
            <seg id="p325">325 Ir the guise of regulating rates, exceeded its constitutional authority practically deprived the owner of the property without due process lw. • • • xhe utmost that any corporation, operating a public way, can rightfully demand at the hands of the legislature when ting its general powers is that it receives what, under all the [instances, is just compensation for the use of its property as will ist both to it and to the public." And in Smyth ,: A me.". 169 U. S. 464, the Court, after review ing its own previous decisions in rate cases, laid down this rule: "We hold, however, that the basis of all calculations as to reasonable - ness of rates to be charged by a corporation maintaining a highway under legislative sanction must be the fair value of the property being used by it for the convenience of the public. And in order to ascertain that value, the original cost of construction, the amount expended in permanent im - provements, the amount and market value of its bonds and stock, the present as compared with the original cost of construction, the probable earning capacity of the property under particular rates prescribed by statute, and the sum required to meet operating expenses, are all mat - ters for consideration, and are to be given such weight as may be just and right in each case. We do not say that there may not be other matters to be regarded in estimating the value of the property. What the company is entitled to ask is a fair return upon the value of that which it employs for the public convenience. On the other hand, what the public is entitled to demand is that no more be exacted from it for the use of the public highway than the services rendered by it are reasonably worth." iThe rates prescribed by the Maximum Rate Law considered in S [me* had never been put in operation and the conclusion reached by Court that the law was confiscatory was a probable conclusion based 1 the application of those rates to the business of the railroads dur - the three previous years. The finding of the Court as to the effect le rates upon the business of the seven roads which were defendants tie action is thus stated by Mr. Justice Harlan: "We are of opinion that as to most of the companies in question there would have been, under such rates as were established by the act of 1893, an actual loss in each of the years ending June 30, 1891, 1892 and 1893; and that, in the exceptional cases above stated, when two of the companies would have earned something above operating expenses, in particular years, the receipts or gains, above operating expenses, would have been too small to affect the general conclusion that the act, if en - forced, would have deprived each of the railroad companies involved in the suits of the just compensation secured to them by the constitution." I So it appears that Smyth v. Ames, while laying down general prin - !8 and affirming the doctrine that the constitutional limit of legis - e power is the right to establish reasonable maximum charges, ishes no practical standard or test of reasonableness. Considering present scope of the decisions upon this subject Mr. Justice Brewer "otting v. Goddard, 183 U. S. 79, after reviewing Smyth r. Amu other rate cases, said: I "As to parties engaged in performing a public service, while the er to regulate has been sustained, negatively the Court has held that legislature may not prescribe rates which if enforced would amount confiscation of property. But it has not held affirmatively that the ilature may enforce rates which stop only this side of confiscation. </seg>
            <seg id="p326">326 I leave the property in the hands and under the care of the owners out any remuneration for its use. It has declared that the present e of the property is the basis by which the test of reasonableness is e determined, although the actual cost is to be considered, and that value of the services rendered to each individual is also to be con - red. It has also ruled that the determination of the legislature is to resumed to be just, and must be upheld unless it clearly appears to It in enforcing unreasonable and unjust rates." In determining whether the rates fixed by the Sibley Act are reason - able or confiscatory it should be borne in mind that the defendant in this case enjoys a monopoly of the express business on the lines of the Burlington road in Nebraska. It should be also remembered that it is engaged in a business in which the state or the general government might itself properly engage. To a limited extent it is in competition with the general government which is carrying small packages of merchandise in the mails without substantial profit, and perhaps without any profit at all. Defendant is, in the conduct of its business, using the public high - ways which were established for public purposes by the exercise of the sovereign power of eminent domain. Being a monopoly, its profits are virtually guaranteed profits and, though exceedingly small upon indi - vidual transactions — so small in some cases as to verge upon the vanish - ing point — are nevertheless in my judgment, large enough to afford just compensation and to prevent judicial interference with the rates fixed by the statute. When an individual engages in business properly within the scope of government; when he takes upon himself a function of the state »nd exercises for his own advantage one of the powers of government, it may be, as suggested by Mr. Justice Brewer in Cutting v. Goddard "that he voluntarily accepts all the conditions of public service which attach to like service performed by the state itself." At any rate, the de - cisions of the Supreme Court of the United States cited in Smyth &gt;: Antes contain expressions indicating that under some circumstances rates or charges fixed by the legislature for a distinctively public service may not, although unremunerative, come under the ban of the fourteenth amendment. But the rates here considered are not unremunerative. Ac - cepting the conclusions of fact drawn by defendant's counsel from the evidence, as shown by their revision of exhibit 5, *I find that the net profits of the Adams Express Company on its express for the present year upon shipments beginning and ending in the state will be not less than $6,528.00, or 2 2-5 per cent, of the gross receipts. This percentage of profits exceeds by 4-5 of 1 per cent, that received last year upon the company's entire business under rates voluntarily fixed by itself. As before stated, the value of the property devoted to the Nebraska business, Interstate and intrastate is between $50,000.00 and $60,000.00. The net earnings upon the percentage of this value properly chargeable to domestic business is, it must be conceded, a very liberal return upon the company's investment. But it is said that the service which defend - ant renders is a personal service and that that interest on its investment is not a fair test of just compensation. The service rendered by every carrier of freight is a personal service, and the chief distinction between </seg>
            <seg id="p327">327 express companies and railroad companies is that the former, at some of their offices, "pick up and deliver," and exercise always over freight in transit a special rather than a general supervision. If the railroads con - ducted the express business themselves instead of farming it out to the express companies, it would hardly be claimed that the "pick and de - livery" system, or the element of expedition, or of special supervision, or of all combined, would require that just compensation for express serv - ice should be determined by a different standard than that generally ap - plied in dealing with common carriers of freight. As said in 01 Paci/ic Express Co., 115 N. W. R. 619: BThe rights, the liabilities, and the duties of the defendant as a ion carrier, are measured by the rights, liabilities, and duties of the iad company over whose lines it operates and within the boundaries I limited field of transportation within which the express company &gt;8 on its energies." Another claim put forward by defendant is that as its franchise is subject to taxation it is, by the state's admission, a thing of value de - voted to the public service upon which it is entitled to receive a fair re - turn. I do not think that either sound law or sound philosophy justifies the claim that a carrier has a constitutional right to charge rates based upon intangible values resulting from a monopoly given to it by the pub - lic without recompense. But if I am wrong there is another answer. Profits resulting from reasonable rates ought generally to afford a fair indication of franchise value; but as value depends chiefly upon rates collectible, it is evident that profits received when the carrier was under no statutory restraint in fixing rates cannot be accepted as a test of value under a rate law which, perhaps, only aims to stop at the hither side of confiscation. When rates are reduced franchise values shrink. The value of defendant's franchise in former years gives no reliable indication of its present value and is, in my judgment, a negligible element in the problem to be solved. Whatever the value of the franchise may be, the profits of the business will, as I view it, afford just compensation for its use and for the use of the tangible property as well. It is true, as counsel for defendant assert, that the business of the Adams Express Company is of vast magnitude and requires for its successful operation ability of the highest order; but it must be remem - bered, too, as said by the Interstate Commerce Commission in a recent case, that the cost of providing that ability and all other cost and ex - pense of operation and management are paid and deducted from the gross earnings, before the profits of the business are determined. According to the most conservative estimate, there will stand to the credit of the Nebraska intrastate business, taking no account of money order receipts, a profit of not less than $6,528.00 for the current year, after all who have contributed mental or physical effort — from the genius who organizes and directs at the top to the pick-up-and-delivery boy at the bottom — have received full and fair compensation for their services. While this is an exceedingly moderate profit considered with respect to the number of transactions, it cannot, I think, be said that legislation which does not permit more is unconstitutional. The fact that Nebraska intrastate </seg>
            <seg id="p328">328 Kess yielded a net revenue of 5 1-6 per cent, in 1907, while the net ue from defendant's entire system was only 1.6 per cent, repels the etion that the Sibley law was an arbitrary enactment, based upon ason or investigation whatever. For these reasons I advise that the state's motion for judgment be sustained. Since the foregoing report was written, a new point of controversy has emerged. It is now pointed out by counsel for the express company that the company's general auditor and the auditor of the western de - partment, in apportioning terminal costs on the package basis, overlooked the fact that while intrastate transactions were twice handled in Ne - braska the interstate transactions were handled but once. An estimate for the year 1907 based on an actual count for March and September of that year indicates that there were 1,698,752 handlings of domestic trans - actions and 1,003,648 handlings of interstate transactions, or, in other words, that the handlings of domestic transactions were 62.8 per cent of all the handlings within the state. It is now contended by the ex - press company that items 2 to 6 of exhibit 5 are items of terminal costs that ought to be distributed according to the ratio which the domestic handlings bear to the interstate handlings. These items aggregate $146,231.91, which, distributed on the basis proposed, would result in charging domestic business which produced a revenue of $277,727.76 with $91,833.63, and interstate business which produced a revenue of $655,027.52 with only $54,398.28. In other words, the terminal costs of domestic busi - ness would be 33 per cent, of the revenue derived from it, and the termin - al cost of the interstate business would be only 8.3 per cent, of the revenue derived from it. An apportionment according to this method shows that the express company carried on its Nebraska intrastate busi - ness in 1907 at a loss of approximately $12,000.00. This result, in view of the fact that there was then no rate law, naturally suggests a doubt whether the result reached is a correct result. If it is correct, the Sibley Act is conflscatory and judgment should go in favor of the company, un - less the Court shall hold that the company was bound, as a condition of obtaining relief, to show affirmatively that its expenditures in the con - duct of its business were, under all the circumstances, reasonable or necessary. In my opinion the package method of apportionment is not a correct method and so I find that the several items of terminal costs should be divided between intrastate business and interstate business on the revenue basis. The largest item, $66,493.07 commission paid to agents, has no relation at all to the number of pieces handled; it is based entirely upon revenue. And it is inferable, too, from the evidence that agents' salaries, an item amounting to $8,582.00, are based chiefly upon revenue. Indeed, I do not see how upon this record it can be held as a matter of law that terminal expenses must be distributed on the package basis and not otherwise. What is there, for instance, about stable hire and horse feed, or office rent or charges for fuel, light or telephones that makes distribution according to the ratio between the handlings in the two classes of business imperative? Is there any im- </seg>
            <seg id="p329">329 memorial usage or custom or any maxim of commerce that requires i la it certain or even probable that if one individual was about to engag in the domestic business and another in the interstate business that the would conclude negotiations for a division of terminal expenses on tl package basis rather than on the revenue basis; and in the absence of contract would a law providing for a distribution of such expenses o the basis of revenue be unconstitutional? The legislature, it must b presumed, made full investigation of the express business and in adoptin the Sibley law acted with wisdom, intelligence and Justice. It must be presumed, too, that the law is valid and enforceable unless its invalid! is clearly shown. The Court is therefore bound to sustain it by appro ing, if necessary, the revenue method of distributing terminal charges unless it clearly appears that such method is intrinsically unjust. The express company has made no attempt to show the effect by actual test of the Sibley law upon its business except for the month of June, 1908. The state has, however, made such showing for the months of April, May, June, July, August and September, 1908. This showing may not be entirely accurate, but it indicates with reasonable certainty that as a result of increased business the company is now earning be - tween 4 per cent, and 4.5 per cent, on gross receipts, exclusive of receipt* from the sale of money orders. If these money order receipts be added to the ordinary earnings of th« company it will make its percentage of profits between 5 per cent, and 5.5 per cent.; and in my opinion they should be so added. The charge for a money order is essentially a charge for transportation. The thing the purchaser pays for is the carriage of his money from the station where the purchase is made to some other point upon the com - pany's lines. Of course, the identical money is not again returned to - him, but it is in fact transported, and the charge for the service is probably about the same as though the coin or bills had been put into a separate package and consigned to himself. The salary of the agent who sells the order and the clerk who enters the sale upon the books and of the porter who carries the money to the train and of the messen - gers who handle and care for it in transit are all based in part upon the services rendered in connection with the transaction, and these salaries, together with the cost of light, fuel, stationery, etc., go eventually into operating expenses and become a factor in the problem which is here presented for solution. Whether money orders are paid within or with - out the state is not disclosed by the proof, but if that consideration is important no presumption can, of course, be indulged which would re - sult in invalidating the Sibley Act. One other point requires attention. Before the Sibley law can be condemned by judicial sentence it must be shown that there is no just or fair doubt about its conflscatory character. Whoever accuses it must make his accusation good by producing the requisite quantum of proof. It will not do for a carrier to come Into court and say, "Last year my receipts were so much and my expenditures so much and the latter being in excess of the former, the rate law limiting my charges is unconstitu- </seg>
            <seg id="p330">330 tional." He must do more; he must make a full disclosure; he must show the sums paid out, the purpose for which they were paid, and that the payments were under the circumstances reasonable or necessary. In other words, he must show that the business was honestly and provident - ly conducted. In this case the amount paid the Burlington road for transportation in 1907 was $159,727.76, or 57^4 per cent, of gross receipts from domestic business. This is a larger percentage than is paid to any other railroad for like services. It may be an entirely proper charge or it may be an unreasonable exaction. There is no evidence tending to establish either hypothesis. It is a matter doubtless which was in - quired into by the legislature — a matter upon which a legislative conclus - ion was reached which would, in the absence of other sufficient reason, justify the enactment complained of. Counsel for the company assert that the contract with the Burlington road was the result of competitive bidding. This may be so, but it is not proven; and if proven it would not per se establish the reasonableness of the charge. The public is entitled to have its commodities carried at fair rates and it cannot be subjected to excessive charges by any arrangement between the railroads and the express companies. If a railroad farms out the express business, it must be on terms that will enable the express carrier to operate at a profit without imposing excessive charges upon its patrons. If any con - tract will not permit this to be done, whether it be the result of com - petitive bidding or not, such contract is void. It was entirely competent of the legislature to deal with the item of railroad transportation as an element in the cost of carriage and to reduce it if so disposed to the verge of confiscation. This item cannot take sanctuary in a contract between the railroad company and the ex - press company. The presumption that it is reasonable cannot be in - dulged at the expense of a statute enacted, perhaps, on the assumption that it is unreasonable. I Some witnesses for the express company have given their conclusion the rates charged by it are reasonable rates, but I do not attach h importance to this evidence. I do not believe a statute adopted i all constitutional formalities can be thus sworn off the books. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW. My conclusions of law are: First. That the Sibley Act, so far as it affects the business of the Adams Express Company, is not conflscatory. Second.

IPhe undersigned, having duly qualified under the order of reference tofore made in this case, and having heard the evidence and argu - £ of counsel, begs to submit the following report of his findings of and conclusions of law: FINDINGS OF FACT 1. The defendant is a Nebraska corporation engaged in the express business, having a total mileage of 21,815 miles and operating in 25 states and in the province of Ontario. Its capital stock consists of 60,000 shares of the par value of 1100.00 each It employs in its service 5,325 people on all lines, and in the state of Nebraska 286 people. It maintains 2,366 offices upon all its lines and 156 offices in the state of Nebraska. For the year ending June 30, 1907, it declared a dividend of 6 per cent, and added to its surplus $353,355.03. Its gross earnings from express transactions for the year ending June 30, 1907, were 17,487,639.00, and the entire cost of producing those earnings was $6,849,932.00. Its gross revenues for the same period from Nebraska intrastate business was $169,557.13. The mileage operated in Nebraska is 376 miles upon the Missouri Pacific and 977 miles upon the Union Pacific. The number of intrastate transactions handled during said period was 340,000 and the number of interstate transactions handled was 574,000. The average revenue per shipment on intrastate business was 49.6 cents and the average revenue per ship - ment upon interstate business was 71.5 cents. The capital stock of the company is owned chiefly by the Union Pacific Railroad Company, the Wabash Railroad Company and the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company. P. The Pacific Express Company keeps no separate account of its iska business, but it has introduced in evidence a statement of earn - and expenses upon all its lines for the year ending June 30, 1907, i shows the ratio of expenses classified to gross freight earnings, statement is known as exhibit 8, and is here set out: EXHIBIT 8.

The company has also given in evidence a statement known as "exhibit 9," which purports to give the gross revenue on intrastate busi- ness for the state of Nebraska for the year .ending June 30, 1907.

They claim that the state's revision of exhibit 4 should be further revised as follows: Revision of exhibit 4, offered by the state and purporting to be a statement of the domestic earnings and expenses of the Pacific Express Company in the state of Nebraska for the year ending June 30, 1907 Gross receipts $169,557.13 Expenditures: Transportation, figured at 50% $84,778.56 Ilnal cost — the total terminal expense of is which were testified to by Mr. Patterson 102) amounts to $86,208.23 actually paid out bin the state.

Witnesses for the company have made computations from which they conclude that the average reduction of revenues from domestic business would, under the Sibley Act, amount to about 20 per cent. This evidence is of slight importance in view of the fact that since the law has been in effect it apears by actual test for the months of April, May, June and July, 1908, what the effect of the law has been upon the company's intra- etate business. A tabulation based upon the reports made by the com- pany to the Nebraska State Railway Commission shows the gross intra- state earnings for the months named and the expenses incurred in con- nection therewith. This tabulation is as follows - Pacific Express Company. Intnwtate Revenue and Expenses in Nebraska, April, May, June and July, 1908.

Counsel for the company insist that the state's method of apportioning terminal costs on the revenue basis is wrong and that the apportionment should be made on the transaction basis, which would result in charging the intrastate business with 60.85 per cent, of the terminal cose, instead of 52.2 per cent. They have proposed the fol- lowing revision of exhibit 6 without conceding its correctness: Revised exhibit 6, showing intrastate revenues and expenses in Ne- braska of the Pacific Express Company, for April, May, June and July, 1908, figuring terminal cost on the transaction basis, and eliminating money order earnings and the cost of same.

Making a total net profit of $6,384.17 Whether the terminal cost be apportioned in accordance with the claim of the state or in accordance with the claim of the company the net profits of the company upon its gross intrastate receipts, exclusive of the money order business is, at this time, between 9 per cent, and 10 per cent; and, including the money order business, between 10 per cent. and 11 per cent.

SULLIVAN, Referee. No. 15308 State of Nebraska, Plaintiff v. ■United States Express Company, De idant. Eie undersigned, having duly qualified under the order of reference fore made in this case, and having heard the evidence and argu - of counsel, begs to submit the following report of his findings . and conclusions of law: FINDINGS OF FACT. 1. The United States Express Company is an unincorporated associa - tion doing an express business in 23 states, 1 territory and the Dominion of Canada. It operates a total mileage of 29,886. It operates in Nebraska on the lines of the Rock Island and Pacific Railroad Company. Its total earnings for the year ending July 31, 1907, were $17,232,219.00 and its total expenses were $16,969,681.00. Its Nebraska intrastate earnings for the same period were $15,236.48, the result of handling at 34 offices 29,641 shipments at an average cost of 51.4 cents per shipment. This express company pays the railroad upon which it operates in Nebraska 55 per cent, of its gross express receipts. 12. The company claims that it lost in 1907 upon its Nebraska intra - i business, $227.17, three-fourths of a cent upon each package carried Vs. per cent, of its gross receipts. Applying the Sibley rates to its business, the company estimates that its loss under those rates for was approximately $1,616.89, or 5% cents on each package or 14 cent, of gross receipts. Neither this claim nor this estimate takes account of receipts from sales of money orders or increased business lting from reduced rates. KThe company's exhibit J, which was introduced to show the which the various items into which general expenses have been fled bears to the gross earnings of the entire system is as follows: EXHIBIT J.

It is here set out: EXHIBIT K. United States Express Company.

            <seg id="p338">338 4. In constructing the foregoing table the general expenses are charged against Nebraska intrastate business in the ratio which the total general expenses bear to the total receipts, and the division ex - penses are charged against the Nebraska intrastate business in the ratio that such expenses bear to the total earnings of the division. Terminal expenses are apportioned between domestic and interstate business partly on the transaction basis and partly by ascertaining the actual cost of individual transactions. If the method employed by the company in the apportionment: of expenses is the only proper and legal method and if the money order revenue is rightly left out of account, the Sibley Act cannot be lawfully enforced and judgment should go in favor of the company, unless the Court shall hold that the company was bound to satisfactorily show that its disbursements were, under all the circum - stances, reasonable and proper disbursements, and that it failed, as to a substantial part of such disbursements, to make such showing. El find that a distribution of terminal expenses between state and :ate business, according to the ratio which the revenue derived one class bears to the revenue derived from the other class, is and proper method of distribution, and think if the contention of mpany that the Sibley rates are confiscatory cannot be sustained . on the assumption that such method is illegal, the contention I be overruled. K. I find that the revenue derived from the sale of money orders &gt;braska is properly regarded as part of the company's intrastate ess, and if the company's claim that the Sibley rates are conflsca - can be sustained only by holding that such revenues are not do - c revenues, the contention should be overruled. 7. The average cost of transportation to the express company over all the lines operated by it is 46.8 per cent, of its gross receipts and there being no evidence on the subject, I cannot find that the charge of 55 per cent, of the gross revenues upon Nebraska intrastate business is a reasonable and proper charge. The legislature may, after full investi - gation, have found that the charge was excessive and it may have based the Sibley Act upon that finding. If so, the Court cannot presume the finding was wrong, and make the presumption the basis of a decree nulli - fying the law. Involved in the limitation upon express rates is a limita - tion upon the charges of railroad companies for transportation. To pre - sume that these charges are reasonable might, therefore, be to presume that the rate law is unconstitutional. It may be, too, that the legislature, upon investigation, found that a salary of $25,000.00 a year to the presi - dent of the company was not paid for actual services rendered in the conduct of the business and was not, therefore, a reasonable expenditure. If the law in question was based on such a finding, or on findings of that character, the Court cannot in my opinion declare the statute an outlaw without some incriminating proof. It is not enough for the com - pany to come into court and say "We paid out so much money to this official, or so much money for that purpose, and therefore a rate law </seg>
            <seg id="p339">339 which leaves an inadequate balance, or no balance at all, is confiseatory and void." 8. The actual effect of the Sibley law upon the company's intra- state business is shown with substantial correctness in the state's ex- hibit 8 for the months of April to August, 1908, inclusive. This statement is made up from the monthly statements sent to the Nebraska State Rail- way Commission by the agents of the company. The intrastate earnings shown on this statement, are actual money collected by the company. The expenses for transportation were assessed on the same percentage as shown in the contract between the company and the railroad. The terminal, general and division expenses of the company have been appor- tioned on the revenue basis, the basis upon which nearly all the trans actions of the company are conducted.

The American Express Company, Defend- ■Fhe undersigned, having duly qualified under the order of reference lofore made in this case, and having heard the evidence and argu - es of counsel, begs to submit the following report of his findings of and conclusions of law: FINDINGS OF FACT. 1. The American Express Company is a joint stock association, and is engaged in the express business in 28 states and in four provinces of Canada. The total mileage which it operates is 43,860. It operates in Nebraska on the lines of the North-Western Railway Company. Its Nebraska mileage is 1,365. Its total earnings for the year ending De - cember 31, 1907, were $30,755,197.00 and its total expenses were $30,096, - 038.00, leaving a net revenue for that year of $659,159.00 or 4.6 per cent. (should read 2.14 per cent., see exhibit 4) of its gross receipts. It has 159 offices in Nebraska, and its gross revenue from its Nebraska intrastate business for the year ending December 31, 1907, was $143,138.64. This express company pays the railroad upon which it operates in Nebraska 48% per cent, of its gross express receipts. 12. The company claims that it lost in 1907 upon its Nebraska intra - i business $146.56 or 1-10 of 1 per cent, of its gross receipts. Apply - the Sibley rates to its 1907 business, the company estimates that its under those rates for 1907 would be approximately $10,758.54 or 9.7 cent, of its gross intrastate receipts. This estimate takes no account icreased business resulting from reduced rates. 3. The company's method of ascertaining the cost of conducting the Nebraska intrastate business is set forth in detail in its exhibit 3, made part of the testimony of Mr. Bradley, the company's general traffic man - ager.

The only difference between the company's exhibit 3 and the state's revision of it is in the apportionment of general expenses and in the method of ascertaining the terminal cost of Nebraska interstate business at points of origin or destination outside the state. I find that the state's method of ascertaining this outside terminal cost is not inequitable or unjust, and I, therefore, adopt it as a correct method. Under this method the company's net profit upon gross receipts on intrastate busi- ness in 1907 was about 6 per cent, instead of 4.6 per cent, as claimed by the company. 4. The actual effect of the Sibley law upon the company's intrastate business is shown with substantial correctness in the plaintiff's table No. 2 for the months of April, May, June, July, August and September, 1908, based upon the monthly statements sent to the Nebraska State Rail- way Commission by agents of the company. This table is as follows: TABLE NO. II. Earnings and Expenses American Express Company for Year of 1908. Using same process of figuring as used by Mr. Bradley, exhibit No. 3, taking the six months, April to September, 1908, inclusive, as an aver- age six months, as shown by the reports to the Nebraska Railway Commission.

            <seg id="p344">344 SECOND ANNUAL REPORT TABLE NO. II Intrastate Revenue and Expense for Year 1908 This table is constructed upon the same theory that the company's exhibit 3 is constructed. It shows that since the Sibley law has been effective the company's net income is 4.08 per cent, of its gross receipts from its intrastate business, assuming that the company's method of apportioning general expenses and of ascertaining outside terminal expenses is the only correct method. The percentage of profit under the method of ascertaining outside terminal cost proposed by the state, and which I find to be a correct method, would be, of course, much greater, but whether the state's method or the method of the company in the ascertainment of outside terminal expenses be adopted, the Sibley rates, so far as they affect the business of this company, are not con- flscatory. 5. I find that the company has properly regarded and dealt with receipts derived from the sale of money orders as part of its intrastate revenue. 6. The average cost of transportation to the express company over all the lines operated by it is 43% per cent, of its gross receipts and, there being no evidence on the subject, I cannot find that the charge of 48 V4 per cent, of the gross revenues upon Nebraska intrastate business is a reasonable and proper charge. The legislature may have, after full investigation, found that the charge was excessive and it may have based the Sibley Act upon that finding. If so the Court cannot pre - sume the finding was wrong and make the presumption the basis of a decree nullifying the law. It is not enough for the company to come into court and say, "We paid out so much money for this purpose or that, and therefore a rate law which leaves an inadequate balance or no balance at all is confiscatory and void." 7. The value of the property devoted to the Nebraska intrastate business does not appear, but it is evidently small and is certainly not enough to possibly affect the conclusion which I have reached. 8. Involved in the limitation upon express rates is a limitation upon railroad transportation charges. It may not, therefore, be pre - sumed that these charges are reasonable unless it can be done without presuming that the rate law is unconstitutional. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW.

That judgment on the merits should be rendered in favor of the state and against r .he company. JOHN J. SULLIVAN, Referee REPORT AND ORDER OF THE COURT. No 15310 State of Nebraska, v. Ki Express Company. ES, J. This is an action in equity by which the state of Nebraska, as plain - tiff, has invoked the original jurisdiction of this Court to enjoin the de - fendant, (the Adams Express Company), from charging or receiving for services between places in Nebraska any sum in excess of 75 per cent, of certain charges exacted by defendant under its schedule of rates in force on the 1st day of January, 1907. The reduction of rates in question was sought to be accomplished by an act of the legislative assembly of that year, which reads as follows: BAH persons, associations or corporations engaged in the trans - tion of money or merchandise for a money consideration in cars than freight cars and on trains other than freight trains shall emed an express company within the meaning of this act. "Within thirty days after the passage and approval of this act, all express companies doing business in this state shall file with the Rail - road Commission a complete schedule of the rates and classifications charged for the transportation of money or merchandise within this state by such company, which was in force on the first day of January, A. D. 1907. "Express companies may charge and receive for the transportation of merchandise within the state of Nebraska any sum not exceeding seventy-five per cent, of the rate as shown in the schedule provided for in section 2 of this act until after the State Railway Commission shall have provided a greater rate. IProridtd that nothing in this act shall be construed to change repaid rates on merchandise weighing one (1) pound or less, and Im) fmtkmr, that no provision of this act shall reduce any special Mt rate in force for the transportation of cream, milk, or poultry y charge to a sum less than fifteen cents; and prociikd furthir nothing in this act shall abridge the authority of the Railroad lission to make a reduction in any rate provided for in this act. Bit any express company shall fail to comply with the provisions and tions of this act, they shall be fined on conviction a sum not less ten dollars or more than one thousand for each offense. B'The Nebraska State Railroad Commission, and if there be no mission, then the Governor, with the assistance of the Attorney ;ral, are hereby empowered to enforce the provisions of this act." I The act above quoted was passed by the legislature in the exercise tie power of the state to regulate defendant as a common carrier of ■ess matter or articles of commerce between places in Nebraska. De - iant threatened to disobey the law, to prevent the state from control - its internal commerce on defendant's lines of transportation between </seg>
            <seg id="p346">346 SECOND ANNUAL REPORT places in Nebraska, and to charge and collect for intrastate services com - pensation in excess of the maximum rates fixed by the legislature. The Biey General thereupon commenced this action and obtained a re - ing order preventing the defendant from carrying out its threat of disobedience. Early in the history of the litigation defendant challenged the juris- Ei of the Court and filed a petition and bond for removal. The : was thereupon lodged in the Circuit Court of the United States e federal district of Nebraska, where the defendant was unable to Sn its contention, and the cause was remanded to this Court. On r pleas and after a full hearing the jurisdiction of the Court and ght of the state to maintain the action, were sustained. State r. Adams Express Co., Neb 115 N. W. 625; State v. The Padlic Express Co., Neb , 115 N. W. 619. Having finally adjudicated those questions they will not again be referred to in this op'nion. After the settlement of the preliminary questions the defendant filed its answer, alleging among other things: First, that a horizontal cut of twenty-five per cent, of its rates was Etical and unreasonable; that the rates thus fixed by the statute Dflscatory; that the defendant is thereby deprived of its right to onable profit on its business and its property investment, and therefore the act is unconstitutional. Second, that the penalties provided by the act for a violation of its provisions are so unreasonable, excessive and drastic as to prevent the defendant from securing a judicial inquiry into the validity of the statute without incurring a prohibitive risk, and that they therefore constitute a violation of the equality clause of the fourteenth amendment of the federal constitution. The allegations of the answer were controverted by a reply, and after the issues were thus joined, the Honorable John J. Sullivan was appointed as a referee to take and report the evidence, together with his conclusions of facts and law to the Court, with all convenient speed. A large amount of testimony was taken, which is now before us, together wUh the referee's report. His findings of facts were generally for the plaintiff, and his conclusions of law are as follows: "My conclusions of law are: first, that the Sibley Act (which is the statute in question), so far as it affects the business of the Adams Express Company, is not confiscatory; second, that judgment on the merits should be rendered in favor of the state and against the defendant company." To this report the defendant has filed exceptions so voluminous that Eote them would extend this opinion to an unreasonable length; but of them as are necessary to a correct disposition of the case, to - r with the particular findings of fact to which they refer, will be ■ced, considered and decided under proper subdivisions. The case has been argued and submitted on its merits, and therefore If the report of the referee is sustained judgment must be entered for </seg>
            <seg id="p347">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 347 the state; while, on the other hand, if the exceptions are allowed we may make such disposition of the case as we think the evidence requires. Defendant first excepts to the report as a whole, and particularly to the findings of fact contained therein, "Because the same are not sus - tained by the evidence." The determination of the question thus raised requires a careful examination of the testimony taken by the referee. K making the investigation we start with the presumption that the in question is a valid and constitutional exercise of legislative lieuyttn r. Fanners Loan d Truxt Co., 154 U.

In the case last cited the rule is well s.ated as Elvery legislative act comes before this Court surrounded with the aption of constitutionality, and this presumption continues until t under review clearly appears to contravene some provision of nstitution." IFhis rule places the burden of proof on the defendant, and before we strike down the statute it must show by a preponderance of the &gt;nce that the rates fixed thereby are so low as to be clearly con - tory. Chicago. M. d- St. P. By. Co. v. 1'omplcins. 176 U. S. 167-173; arte Young, smmt. The facts of this case, which are not in dispute, are that the defend - ant is a common carrier; it operates in twenty-eight states and upon 34,862 miles of railroad and other lines of transportation; it is not in - corporated, but is a joint stock company; it has a capital stock of $12,000,000.00 divided into 120,000 shares, which are owned by 2,700 share - holders, whose identity is not disclosed. The territory in which it oper - ates is divided into three departments. The western department, which includes Nebraska, is operated over 18,652 miles of transportation lines. The Nebraska mileage, all of which is upon the Burlington lines, is 2,514 miles. The company has 272 offices in this state and about 450 em - ployee. The value of the property employed in carrying on its entire business is not disclosed, but the estimated value of the portion devoted to the service in Nebraska is between $50,000.00 and $60,000.00. The revenues of the company upon all of its lines for the year ending December 31, 1907, were $27,822,738.23. Its operating expenses for the same period were $27,; 56,345.17, leaving a net profit of $466,393.00, or 1.6 per cent, of the gross receipts. I Assuming the burden of proof above mentioned as to the remaining , the defendant produced as witness Mr. Glenn, the auditor of the ern department and Mr. Waters, the general auditor of the company, is a summary of their evidence, has placed in the record its exhibit 'his, after having been revised by counsel to correct errors, shows the business of the company in this state for the year ending Decem - 11, 1907, resulted in a net income of $12,689.94. Those witnesses were ward recalled and an attempt was made to show by them that the inal expenses properly chargeable to Nebraska business would re- </seg>
            <seg id="p348">348 SECOND ANNUAL REPORT duce the net earnings of the company for the year 1907 to approximately $8,216.03. The plaintiff, however, challenges the truth of this evidence and claims by its construction of exhibit 5 that the net earnings of the defendant in this state for the year 1907, were in fact $14,336.29, or ap - proximately 5 1-6 per cent, of its gross earnings. It will be observed by an examination of the original exhibit 5 that the defendant has built up an estimate of what it conjectures would have been the result of the business of 1907 had the statute in question then been in effect. By assuming that there would have been no increase in the business, that all of the general expenses and office salaries would have remained exactly the same, defendant contends that it would have lost $14,812.65 on the business of that year. In this calculation, how - ever, no account has been taken of the money order business, and it has been assumed that only $15,000.00 of the total revenue would have been unaffected by the rate reduction. It is further assumed that the new rate would not have added anything whatever to the gross revenue of the company. It is also erroneously claimed that the expenses would not be reduced or affected by reason of the reduction in rates. Again, it ap - pears that the defendant made no deduction from the expenses charged to the Nebraska business for that portion of the general expense which it incurred in conducting its through business, business which neither originated nor terminated in Nebraska, and which is called its "over - head" business. By these devices the defendant has attempted to show that if the statutory rates were in force for the year 1908 it would lose on its Nebraska intrastate business $15,812.65. It may be conceded that by loading the Nebraska intrastate business with a sufficient amount of so-called terminal expenses, together with a proportionate amount of the expenses of administration, it is possible to show that the Nebraska business for 1907 was conducted at a loss, which lo*« would be increased for the year 1908; but the evidence introduced for that purpose is not convincing. It must be borne in mind that prior to the passage of the Sibley Act the defendant had, with a free hand, made its own rates and charges, and it is not to be believed that it had voluntarily made a rate under which it had been conducting its Nebraska business without profit for more than a generation. The findings of the referee that the defendant's business in Nebraska for the year 1907 waa remunerative, seems to be warranted by the evidence, accords with sound reason, and is therefore sustained. Coming now to a consideration of defendant's Nebraska intrastate business for the year 1908, we find that the company has introduced in evidence a statement of its transactions for the month of June of that year, which it has used as a basis of its claim or contention that the rates fixed by the statute are confiscatory. We are of opinion, however, that this evidence does not furnish a satisfactory test of the effect of the act, and is not worthy of serious consideration. At the time defend - ant closed its testimony and rested its case, the statute had been in force tor at least sixteen months, and the result of the rates fixed thereby could have been clearly and accurately shown. Yet the company declined to </seg>
            <seg id="p349">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 349 make such a showing, and rested its case on conjecture, assumption and insufficient comparison. We are therefore of opinion that this showing does not meet the burden of proof which the law places upon the defendant. On the other hand, the plaintiff has shown from the monthly reports made by the defendant company to the Nebraska State Railway Commis - sion up to and including the month of October of the year 1908, that the reduction complained of has resulted in a large increase of defendant's intrastate business without a corresponding increase of expenses, and has produced a net income amounting to more than four per cent, of its gross receipts, exclusive of its money order business. It also appears that if that item is added to the ordinary earnings of the company (and we agree with the referee that it should be so added), its profits will be increased to about 5.5 per cent. Surely this is not confiscation, and the rate com - plained of is at least to a considerable extent, remunerative. It is claimed, however, that the referee has arrived at the foregoing results by an improper method of apportioning expenses to the intrastate business, and this seems to be the main contention between the parties. It appears that the referee has apportioned the expenses on a revenue basis, while the defendant insists that the only correct method of appor - tionment is the transaction or package basis. The referee has found, from an estimate for the year 1907, based on an actual count for the months of March and September, that there were for that year, 1,698,752 handlings of domestic, and 1,003,648 handlings of interstate transactions. In other words, that the handlings of domestic transactions were 62.8 per cent, of all of the handlings within the state. It is now contended by the defendant that the item of terminal cost ought to have been dis - tributed according to the ratio which the domestic handlings bear to the interstate handlings. The referee has found, and this is not contested, that these items aggregate $146,231.91, which, distributed on the basis proposed, would result in charging the domestic business, which produced a revenue of $277,726.76. with $91,833.36, and the interstate business, which produced a revenue of $655,027.52, with only $54,398.28. This would make the terminal cost of the domestic business 33 per cent, of the revenue de - rived from it, and the terminal cost of the interstate busness would be only 8.3 per cent, of the revenue received therefrom. As was said by the referee, "An apportionment according to this method shows that the de - fendant carried on its intrastate business in 1907 at a loss of approximate - ly $12,000.00." This, to say the least, is incredible. The fact, as we have above stated, that the defendant, before the passage of the act in question, had been unrestrained in fixing its rates, causes us to doubt the correctness of this method of apportionment, and while we do not hold that a fair distribution of expenses cannot be made on the package basis, we are of opinion, for many reasons, that the apportionment of expenses on a revenue basis affords the easiest and most practicable solution of this difficult question. We also find from the evidence that the defendant has in many ways </seg>
            <seg id="p350">SECOND ANNUAL REPORT 350 pursued and offered sanction for this method. Indeed, until this conten - tion arose it seems to have considered its business throughout the whole country as an entirety, and to have deducted its expenses and calculated its profits on the revenue basis. Again, it is a well known fact that the expense of a particular transaction may not be, and often is not, the same at the point of shipment as at the point of destination. The amount paid by defendant to its agent at its different points for the same hand - ling is not always the same. To illustrate, suppose a shipment originates at an office where the pick-up and delivery system is in operation, and terminates at a point where that method is not pursued, but where the consignee is required to visit the express office in order to obtain the consignment. In such a case to double the charge at either point would not produce the correct amount of terminal expense. For further illus - tration, suppose a package is shipped from an office where the agent re - ceives as his compensation a commission of say, 10 per cent, of the amount charged for the shipment, while the receiving office is in charge of an agent who receives a salary. In such a case it would be imprac - ticable and incorrect to double the amount of the agent's commission at the shipping office to obtain the amount of terminal expenses of that transaction. Kt further appears that the largest item, to- wit: $66,493.07 commis - paid to agents, has no relation at all to the number of pieces hand - but is based entirely upon the revenue derived from the business (acted at their offices. It is also inferable from the evidence that ts' salaries, an item amounting to $8,582.00, are based to some ex - upon revenue. So we do not see how, upon this record, it can be as a matter of law, that terminal expenses must be distributed upon mckage basis and not otherwise. For the foregoing reasons we are constrained to sustain the finding of the referee, which adopts the revenue basis for a distribution of ter - minal charges. In concluding the discussion of this question, it must be borne in mind that where an attempt is made to strike down a rate statute, it is in - cumbent on the party complaining to make full, fair and complete dis - closure. Now, while it appears from a careful reading of the evidence that in many, and perhaps most things, the defendant has made full and fair disclosure, still in some matters it has failed to do so. We find that there is a large sum charged to the intrastate business as expenses of administration. We are told that this includes the salaries of the de - fendant's general officers. It appears that the company has declined to state the salary of a single one of such officers, and we are wholly with - out any knowledge as to the amount, much less the reasonableness of each salaries. Under a showing of this kind the defendant could, without danger of detection, or even adverse criticism, load the Nebraska state business with an expense which would render it so unremunerative as to require us to strike down the act in question. Again, it appears that the defendant is a joint stock company, and it is fair to presume, in the ab - sence of disclosure and proof to the contrary, that a majority of its stock </seg>
            <seg id="p351">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 351 is held and owned by its officers and directors. In such a case salaries could readily be made so exorbitant, unreasonable and excessive that by charging to the intrastate business a proportionate amount thereof, that business would appear to be unremunerative. Finally, the evidence shows that the amount paid to the Burlington railroad for transportation for the year 1907 was $159,727.76 or 57.5 per cent, of the gross receipts from domestic business. This appears to be a larger percentage than is paid to any other railroad for like services. It may be an entirely proper charge, or it may be an unreasonable ex - action, and there is no evidence in the record tending to establish either proposition. Counsel for the defendant assert that its contract with the Burlington road was the result of competitive bidding. This may be so, but it ie not proven, and if it were proven would not establish per se the reasonableness of the charge. The public is entitled to have its com - modities carried at fair rates, and cannot be subjected to excessive charges by any arrangement between the railroad and the express com - pany. If a railroad farms out the express business it must be on terms that will enable the express carrier to operate at a profit without impos - ing excessive charges upon its patrons. Any contract which will not per - mit this to be done, whether it be the result of competitive bidding or not, is void, in so far as it affects the rights of the public. Eor the foregoing reasons we are of opinion that the defendant has to show by competent evidence, a fair and full disclosure that the in question are confiscatory, and its exceptions upon this point lerefore overruled. Having sustained the report of the referee as to the main facts of this controversy, we come now to the consideration of his conclusions of law. It appears that a like question was before the federal Supreme Court in Wilcox v. Consolidated Qm Co. of .Yew York, 29 Supreme Court Rep. 192, where it was held that a court of equity ought not to interfere by injunction with state legislation fixing gas rates, before a fair trial has been made of continuing the business under such rates; and the case must be a clear one before the courts should be asked to interfere by injunction with state legislation regulating gas rates, in advance of any actual experience of the practical results of such rates. That case is an instructive one, and many of the questions involved in the case at bar were there litigated and determined adversely to the defendant's conten - tion herein. Similar questions were also before that Court in the City of Knoxville v. Knarrilk Water Works Co., 29 Supreme Court Rep. 148, and it was there said: KThe courts should not enjoin the enforcement of a municipal ance fixing the maximum water rates on the ground that such ance is invalid under United States constitution, 14th amend - as confiscatory, unless the confiscation is clearly apparent." I The case of Chicago d- Grand Trunk By. Co. v. Wellman, 143 U. S. was one to test the validity of an act of the legislature of the state Michigan, fixing a maximum rate of passenger fare. It was contended lat case that the rate was confiscatory. Mr. Justice Brewer delivered opinion of the Court, from which we quote as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p352">352 SECOND ANNUAL REPORT "Ib the validity of a law of this nature dependent upon the opinion of two witnesses, however well qualified to testify? Must courv and Jury accept their opinions as a finality? Must it be declared, as matter of law, that a reduction of rates necessarily diminishes income? May it not be possible — indeed, does not all experience suggest the probability — that a reduction of rates will increase the amount of business, and, therefore, the earnings? At any rate, must the court assume that it has no such effect; and ignoring all other considerations, hold, as matter of law, that a reduction of rates necessarily diminishes the earn - ings? If the validity of such a law in its application to a particular company depends upon a question of fact as to its effect upon the earn - ings, may not the court properly leave that question to the jury and decline to assume that the effect is as claimed? There can be but one answer to these questions. If the contention be that the legislature has no power in the matter, and that an act fixing rates, however high they may be, is necessarily unconstitutional, it is enough .o refer to the long series of cases in this Court in which the contrary has been decided." Concluding the opinion Judge Brewer said: "Surely, before the courts are called upon to adjudge an act of the legislature fixing the maximum passenger rates for railroad companies to be unconstitutional, on the ground that its enforcement would prevent the stockholders from receiving any dividends on their investments, or the bondholders any interest on their loans, they should be fully advised as to what is done with the receipts and earnings of the company; for if so advised, it might clearly appear that a prudent and honest manage - ment would, within the rates prescribed, secure to the bondholders their interest, and to the stockholders reasonable dividends. While the pro - tection of vested rights of property is a supreme duty of the courts, it has not come to this, that the legislative power rests subservient to the discretion of any railroad corporation which may, by exorbitant and unreasonable salaries, or in some other improper way, transfer its earn - ings into what it is pleased to call 'operating expenses.' * * • The silence of the record gives us no information, and we have no knowledge outside thereof, and no suspicion of wrong. Our suggestion is only to indicate how easily courts may be misled into doing grievous wrong to the public, and how careful they should be to not declare legislative acts unconstitutional upon agreed and general statements, and without the fullest disclosure of all material facts." Kin the case at bar counsel have devoted a considerable part of their to a eulogy of the ability, probity and integrity of their witness. By opinion we do not intend to in any manner reflect upon the character le officers of the express company, but confine ourselves to the be - that full disclosure has not been made. We think our decision herein should be ruled by the principles an - nounced in the foregoing cases, rather than by the case of Cottiny r. Kan mu City Stork Y&lt;ir&lt;h Co.. 183 U. S. 79, which is cited and relied on by counsel for the defendant. In that case the service was rendered by the owners of property, in such a position that the public had simply an inter - est in its use, while in the present case the defendant has devoted its property to the discharge of a public service. It should also be remem - bered that the judiciary ought not to interfere with the collection of rates established under legislative sanction unless they are so plainly and palpably unreasonable as to make their enforcement equivalent to the taking of property for public use without such compensation as, under all the circumstances, is just both to the owner and to the public. Judicial </seg>
            <seg id="p353">353 Ilerence should never occur unless the case presents clearly an id all doubt such a flagrant attack upon the rights of property, unde uise of regulation, as to compel the court to say that the rates pr id will necessarily have the effect to deny just compensation fo te property taken for public use. This state of affairs cannot 1 to exist in the case at bar, for it not only appears that the rate by the statute are not confiscatory, but afford defendant a muc er percentage of income on its Nebraska intrastate business tha which, by its own testimony, it claims to receive upon its general ess considered as an entirety. For the foregoing reasons the referee's conclusions of law upon this point are sustained. Defendant further contends that the act in question is unconstitution - al because of the enormous fines which it imposes for a failure to comply with its terms, and it is thereby denied the equal protection of the law. It is a sufficient answer to this contention to say that the act does not in any manner deny the defendant the right to test its validity in the courts; and the reasonableness of the rates fixed thereby are now by this proceeding under judicial inquiry. It also seems clear that the penalty clause is not a necessary or inseparable part of the act, without which it would not have been passed. In such a case if, when the objectionable part of the statute is eliminated, the balance is valid and capable of being enforced, the valid portion of the act will be upheld. Wilmx r. Consolidated Gas Co. of New York, .supra. This is a familiar principle which has been often announced by this Court, and we do not hesitate to say that in order to avoid striking down the act in question we would, if necessary, eliminate the penalty clause. Scott r. Flovcern. 61 Neb. 620; State r. Stuht, 52 Xeb. 209, and cases there cited. It is also urged by counsel for the defendant that what its property is worth for taxation, or what its business produced, for that purpose, must be considered or reckoned with when the inquiry is directed to the amount upon which a legitimate return may be claimed. This question was squarely presented and passed upon in the case of Wilcos &gt; golidated Gas Co., supra, where it was said: I "The assessed value for taxation of the franchises of a gas company ishes no criterion by which to ascertain their value, when testing reasonableness of gas rates as fixed by statute, where the taxes are ted by the company as part of its operating expenses, to be paid of its earnings before the net amount applicable to dividends can iscertained. ■"The future assessment of the value of the franchises, it is presumed, be much lessened if it is seen that the great profits upon which value was based are largely reduced by legislative action." I Counsel for defendant complain of the failure of the referee to in - lorate in his report their theory of the case, which they have desig - ■d the ultimate facts, and by motion have asked us to require him to e it a part of his findings. We are of opinion that this request lid be denied. The statement so entitled is not in evidence. It is ply a summary of the conclusions of counsel as to what the evidence 13 </seg>
            <seg id="p354">354 K5, and is properly made a part of their brief. It was used by them part of their oral argument, but as its conclusions were repudiated e referee, he properly refused to make it a part of his report Finally, upon a careful consideration of the whole case, we are of opinion that defendant's exceptions should be, and they are, overruled; and the report of the referee is sustained. This requires us to enter Judgment for the plaintiff, and this we do without hesitation, because we are convinced from the evidence that the rates complained of are not clearly shown to be conflscatory, but are, to some extent, at least, remunerative. When this fact appears, the courts should not interfere to strike down the statute, but should require the complainant, if the rates are deemed to be too low, to resort to the rate-making power, or the tribunal charged with rate regulation for relief. The statute in question clearly provides that the express companies, in case the rates fixed there - by are found to be unreasonable, may apply to the Nebraska State Railway Commission for relief, and that tribunal is given full authority to in - crease such rates. Eor the foregoing reasons judgment will be rendered for the state, lie temporary restraining order now in force herein is made perma - but our judgment must be so construed as not to in any manner ere with the right of the defendant company to apply to the State ay Commission for a revision or an increase of rates, if, in any it shall deem them unreasonable; and the power of that tribunal int any and all proper relief, is not to be affected thereby. JUDGMENT ACCORDINGLY REESE, C. J., and ROSE, J., not sitting State of Nebraska, Plaintiff, v. The Adams Express Company, Defendant.

Clarke, Jr., and John A. Williams, as members of the Nebraska State Railway Commis - sion, Defendants. MEMORANDUM OPINION THOMAS C. MUNGER, D. J.: This case is submitted upon a demurrer to the complainants' bill. An act of the legislature of Nebraska, (Chapter 90, Session Laws, 1907) prescribes certain duties and modes of procedure relating to the State Railway Commission. The Commission by law is clothed with the gen - eral power of regulation of railways within the state. Section 7 of this act is as follows: K (Appeal from Decision of Commissioners.) If any railway company, ion carrier, or any person or persons affected thereby, shall be tisfled with the decision of said Railway Commission, affirming, re - vising, annulling or modifying any rate or rates complained of in said fial schedule, or any subsequent schedule which may be the sub - of investigation or with the decision of said Commission with mce to any rate, classification, rule, charge, order, act or regulation or adopted by them, upon which there has been a hearing before Commission, except as otherwise expressly provided for herein, such dissatisfied railway company, common carrier, person or persons, Kfile a petition, setting forth the particular cause or causes, of tion to such decision, act, rate, rule, charge, classification, or order, either or all of them, in the district court of the county where the i of action arose in this state, sitting as a court of equity, against Commission as defendant. I Said action shall have precedence over all other causes on the &gt;t of a different nature, criminal cases excepted, and shall be tried determined as other civil causes in said court. Either party in action may appeal to the Supreme Court of this state, and said il shall be at once returnable to said Court and said action so lied shall have precedence in said Court of all causes of a different icter pending therein; provided, that if the district court be in )n at the time such right of action accrues, the suit may be filed g the term and stand ready for trial after ten days' notice. K(a) (Trial — Burden of Proof.) In all trials under the foregoing e, the burden of proof shall rest upon the plaintiff, who must show ear and satisfactory evidence that the rates, regulations, orders, </seg>
            <seg id="p357">357 Iiflcations, acts or charges complained of are unreasonable and it to it or them, and the record of the decision upon said hearing e said Commission, shall, when properly authenticated by said nission, be received in evidence in the trial of said cause; that said or rates affirmed, revised or modified, or that any said rate, classi - on, rule, charge, order, act or regulation, is prima facie just and mable." Section 10b provdes that orders of the Commission shall remain i effect "until finally adjudged to be unreasonable and unjust in a cou of competent jurisdiction, provided that no further hearing need be hat before said Commission with reference to said order or orders, prwidei further that if said railway company, common carrier, person or person affected by said order or orders shall commence any proceeding or pro - ceedings as hereinbefore provided affecting any decision, rule or orde of said Commission, said order or orders shall be held in abeyance unti finally determined in said court." By the terms of section 11, if any railway or common carrier vio - lates or refuses to obey any order finally established, the Commissioner, or any person interested, may apply in a summary way by petition to the district court of the county in which the disobedience occurs and the court shall proceed to hear and determine the matter speedily as a court of equity, and may enjoin the further violation of the order. The complainants are the Chicago &amp; North-Western Railway Com - pany and the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railway Company, and it ap - pears that each owns a separate line of railway through the city of York, Nebraska, not heretofore connected by any tracks or other trans - fer facilities, and that the Railway Commission made an order directing the two complainant companies to build a transfer track connecting their lines of railway in that city. The bill alleges that this order is unreasonable and that it violates the constitution of Nebraska and the constitution of the United States, in that it deprives the complainants of their property without due process of law, and the prayer is for a decree setting aside the order and enjoining its enforcement. In support of the demurrer it is contended that the bill does not- dis - close facts sufficient to bring it within the equitable jurisdiction of this Court. The bill undertakes to set forth a cause of action under the pro - visions of section 7 of the act of the Nebraska legislature heretofore cited. The caption to this section, denominates the proceedings as an "Appeal from Decision of Commission." By the terms of this section, any railway company, common carrier or any person or persons affected, who is dissatisfied with the decision of the Commission may file a petition in the district court of the county where the cause of action arose in this state, sitting as a court of equity against the Commission as defendant, the petition setting forth the particular cause or causes of objection to such decision or order. That this remedy is not confined to orders re - lating to rates of charges seems apparent from the further provisions of the act, especially section 10b. (See Grand Rapids &lt;&amp; I. Ry. Co. r. Hunt, 78 N. E. 358.) </seg>
            <seg id="p358">358 While the statute does not prescribe what objections may be made E petition, subdivision a of this section of the statute limits the of the suit to a determination whether the order is "unreasonable ust" to the plaintiff. The statute does not confer the right upon Kourt hearing such an action, to make any new rate, order or regu - i, and the only power given the court is to decide whether or not ecision of the Railway Commission, in the form in which it has al- ready been made, is reasonable and just. In this respect the Nebraska statute differs from the statute of Vir- ginia, cited in the case of Prentix v. Atlantic Coast Line Co U. S (Nov. 30, 1908), 25 S. C. R. 67. Under the Virginia statute the appellate court is given the power to substitute such order as in its opinion the Commission should have made. It was accordingly held that until that court acted, the matter was in its legislative stage, and that under the constitution of Virginia, the court was given the final legislative action in prescribing orders. Under the doctrine of the separation of judicial from legislative Isrs provided by the Nebraska constitution, as construed by the Su - ae Court of the state, the legislature could not cast upon the courts legislative acts of fixing rates, and making orders and regulations railways and common carriers, and the language of the section in tion does not assume to do so, but only confers on the courts the sion of the reasonableness and justice of the orders of the Commis- sion, which is a judicial function. Nebraska Telephone Co. r. State ex rel, 55 Neb. 627-635. (See Chicago, Milwaukee d- St. Paul By. Co. v. Minnesota, 134 U. S. (Elliott on Railroads, Sec. 691.) The scope of the powers conferred on the courts under section I the Railway Commission Act of Nebraska, has not been defined by Jupreme Court of this state, but the construction now given is con - id by a review of similar statutes and decisions construing them. Jon 6-6 Vi, Chapter 53 Laws of Indiana, 1905; Section 16, Chapter Laws of Wisconsin, 1905; Chapter c. 737, page 2092, Laws of New , 1905; Article 285, Constitution of Louisiana, 1898; Section 9, Chap - 40, Laws of Kansas, 1905; Section 15, Chapter 10, General Laws Min - ta, 1887, as amended by Chapter 106, Laws 1898; Section 4565, Texas Revised Statutes, 1895.) The construction placed upon these statutes may be stated as follows : (1) No power is thereby granted to the courts to make or modify Border or regulation, made by the Ralway Commission, but the juris - on given to the court is to declare, judicially, that a rate, order •gulation is unjust or unreasonable, or was not adopted in due form of law. (2) The jurisdiction thus conferred is distinct from the power to declare an order or regulation conflscatory, and gives the courts authority </seg>

Granting that the statute gives such jurisdiction to the state courts, may the aggrieved party have his action in this court, instead of in the state court, where there is the requisite diversity of citizenship and amount in controversy, or other ground of jurisdiction of the federal courts, or may the action given by this statute be pursued only in the state court? "The jurisdiction of the federal courts is granted to them by the conetitution and laws of the United States, and no state legislation may impair, restrict, or destroy it. Wherever the citizens of a state may secure a trial and decision of their controversies in its courts either by original suits, by appeals, or by other proceedings, citizens of different stales have the right to the determiuation by the courts of the United States of like controversies between them which involves the requisite amounts; and no state, by conferring exclusive jurisdiction of such controversies upon its own courts, by prescribing exclusive methods of commencing litigation, by prohibiting the payment of claims save upon the order of its own courts or by any other means, may strike down that right or take away the plenary power of the national courts to enforce their lawful adjudications." Barber Asphalt Par. Co. r. Morris, 132 Fed. 945-949. Every element that is required to make up a controversy such as the federal courts take cognizance of is involved in this case. The rights of the complainants are presented for decision in such a form that under this statute a judicial tribunal is capable of acting upon it. Smith v. Adams, 130 U. S. 167-173. Traction Co. v. Mining Co., 196 U. S. 239-250. In case of Platt v. Lecocq, 158 Fed. 723, there was in question the right to proceed under a statute of South Dakota, which provided that if </seg>
            <seg id="p360">360 fler made by the Railway Commission of that state was not obeyed, erson interested might apply to the state courts, "and said court proceed to hear and determine the matter speedily as a court of , and without the formal pleadings and proceedings applicable to try suits in equity but in such manner as to do justice in the prem - which is similar to section 11 of the Nebraska act Ehe carrier filed a bill in the federal court to enjoin the enforce - of an order of the Railway Commission and the Commission filed a bill to enforce it. It was held that the state statute could be en - 1 and administered in the federal court and it was said: "The court below, therefore, in the hearing ot this case and this court upon this appeal stand in the place of the circuit court of the state, and have plenary power under the statutes of South Dakota to determine the original question of the reasonableness of the rules and practices of the express company, and 'to do justice in the prem - ises'. " No reason is suggested why the legislature of the state may not ex - tend the equitable rights of the parties as the legislature has attempted to do in this case. When such new rights, or new remedies are created by a state statute the federal court will enforce such right either on the common law or equity side of its docket as the nature of the new right or new remedy requires. Cummings v. National Bank, 101 U. S. 153-157, (Statutory suit to enjoin illegal levy of taxes.) Gormley t: Clark, 134 U. S. 338-348, (Statutory right to establish title.) Cowley v Northern Pacific R.

Mann. 151 Fed. 145-152, (Statutory proceeding to sell land :edent to pay debts.) B Traction Co. v. Mining Co., 196 U. S. 239, (Statutory action to con n real estate.) It is contended that complainants have an adequate remedy at law, as they may defend an action under section 11 to enforce the order. Two answers may be made to this contention. First, the action given by sec - tion 11 is not necessarily at law, if indeed it is a legal action in any case, as the section provides the court shall "hear and determine" the matter "*• a court of equity" and may enjoin the disobedience as a part of the proceedings. In the second place, failure to take action under section 7 might forfeit all remedy of the person aggrieved, which might have been vindicated by such suit. It is not perceived why the right is given to have a Judicial decision on the reasonableness and justice of the order, if such right decides nothing. It would seem that unless the ag - grieved party avails himself of such right, he would be concluded as to the matter, which might have been litigated by that form of action and that if he omits to take such action, or if the decision is against him, he may not re-litigate such questions in an action to enforce the action of </seg>
            <seg id="p361">361 ■Commission. The purpose of section 7 seems to be that all such tions may be put at rest before the final question of the enforcement le order is attempted. It is also contended that there is no equity in the bill because it not allege lack of notice to complainants; that there was fraud; that lainants raised the question of jurisdiction before the Railway Com - on, that a valid defense was there interposed; or that the Commis - was asked to set aside the order. It is also said that the order is ed to be void and therefore complainants may not have it set aside. Eie statute giving the right of appeal to the courts does not make ch requirements, and complainants have alleged all that the statute Darragh v. Wetter, 78 Fed. 7-11. It follows that the demurrer must be overruled. </seg>
