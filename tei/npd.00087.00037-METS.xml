The silages; were fed in groups of cows and the vitamin A content of their milk determined. The vitamin A determinations were made by feeding the silage or the milk to groups uf rats svhosc body stores of this vitamin had been depleted by being fed a vitamin-A-ilcficicnt ration. Approximately 7KII rats were useil in these experiments. There were no apparent ill effects ol feeding as much as 3.2 grams of the A.I.V. silage per rat \kt ii.ii for eight weeks. This svas 20 to 30 per cent of the food consumed. The A.I.V. silage contained only slightly more vitamin A than ilitl the molasses silage. The ordinary corn silage contained less snaniin A lhan either the A.I.V. or molasses silage. The soybean silage svas inferior t.i any of the other silages as a source of vitamin A. Milk produced by cuss's receiving these silages as the only source "I roughage ranked in ihe same order of vitamin A potency as did the silages, namely A.I.V. silage, molasses silage, and common silage. On the other hand svhen a good grade uf alfalfa hay served as the unit source uf roughage, the milk produced contained more vitamin A than ilnl the miJk produced by cms receiving A.I.V. sihgc as the unly roughage. In another cx|*riiucnl one group of cosvs svas fed both molasses silage anil alfalfa has. while a second group received A.I.V. silage .mil allalfa has. The has svas feci nil libitum and the group which received the mulasses silage consumed rhe most hay. In this instance, ihe milk produced by the group receiving the mulasses silage con - tained more vitamin A than did the milk produced by the A.I.V. silage group, which svas probably due to the greater consumption of alfalfa hay. </seg>
         <seg id="p003">The Vitamin A Content of Soybean Silage and of A.1.V., Molasses, and Common Corn Silages, and the Effect of Feeding these Materials upon the Vitamin A Content of Milk 1. li HATHAWAY, H. P. DAVIS. AND J. C. BRAUER During the past few years a number of attempts have been made to improve methods of forage-crop preservation. Several factors have been responsible for these efforts. The first is the problem/common in many regions, of unfavorable weather conditions at the time of harvesting. The second is the desire on the part of progressive dairymen to increase the food value of milk by the use of feeds of high nutritive value. Lasdy, the extrerrje shortage of feeds, which was caused by the drouth of the past few years, has in sonic instances made it desirable to preserve any avail - able forage and also to conserve as much of its nutritive value as possible. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the relative vitamin A content of soybean silage and of A.1.V., molasses, and common corn silage and to study the effect of feeding these silages upon the vitamin A content of milk. ¦ ! REVIEW OF LITERATURE Various substances have been added to different crops during the process of ensiling in order to insure their preservation. One of the most widely used methods is that developed by Virtanen (8-14) which is known as the A.I.V. method. In order to prevent the destruction of carbohydrates which occurs when lactic acid is formed in silage, mixtures of hydrochloric and sulphuric acids were used. The mineral acids may be replaced by lactic acid, sodium sulphate, or other compounds (sulphur trioxytetra - chloride, sulfuril oxychloride, thionyl chloride, and chlorosulphonic acid). Sufficient acid is sprinkled on the fodder to produce a pH of 3.6 to 4.0. According to Virtanen, fodder with a pH of less than 3.0 is not suitable for consumption and if the pH is above 4.0 there is a loss in feeding value. It has been said that this method checks plant-cell respiration and bacterial activity, inhibits proteolysis, preserves soluble carbohydrates, carotene, and vitamin C, and prevents losses due to unfavorable weather conditions at the time of harvesting. ¦'•'¦' Peterson and associates (4) used the A.I.V. method to preserve two lots of alfalfa and one lot of soybeans. There was no apparent loss of carotene in the silage and no unusual changes were noted in milk production. There was a.definite increase in the carotene and vitamin A content of the butterfat when the A. I. V; silage was fed. However, the carotene and vitamin A values were not as high as those previously found for pasture feeding. Hayden and associates (1) preserved a mixture of alfalfa and clover with mineral acids. The silage had a pH of 431 instead of 3.6 to 4.0 as recommended by Virtanen. One group of cows received the acid silage as the sole roughage while another group was fed ; dry chopped hay. Two other groups received corn silage at the rate of two pounds per hundredweight and were reversed between acid silage and long </seg>

The acid silage was fed ad libitum and the hay feeding regulated to supply the check group with about the same amount of dry matter. The vitamin A and carotene values per unit of fat produced were almost: identical for the different groups at the same stage of the experiment. Krauss and Washburn (3) reported that the milk of!cows fed A.I.V. allalta silage produced slightly better responses when fed' to rats than the milk produced by cows fed alfalfa hay. ! Watson and Ferguson (15) measured the value of j artificially dried grass, grass silage made with added molasses, and A.I.V. grass fodder on the yield and quantity of milk produced when these materials were led to Shorthorn cows. Artificially dried grass, molasses silage, and A.I.V. (odder raised the carotene content ot milk to a level similar to that of the average ol the grazing season for the pasture-fed cows. However, the A.I.N . fodder was not as efficient as were the other two materials. _ Peterson. Bird, and Beeson (5) studied the vitamin A content of A.I.V. alfalfa silage and green alfalfa. From the results obtained, they suggested that the carotene in green alfalfa was more effectively utilized than that in A. I. V. silage, since green alfalfa, when fed to rats on the same dry - weight basis as A.I.V. silage, increased the vitamin v A potency of the huttertat over the A.I.V. values. Petersen. Fitch, and Allen (6) found that the carotene content of the huttertat produced by cows declined when alfalfa hay was fed and increased when A.I.V. alfalfa silage was fed. This decline in carotene content was due to the necessary reduction in amounts of hay to approxi - mate the dry matter in the silage. Hcgsted and Bohstedt (2) found that the milk produced by cows fed molasses alfalfa silage and A.I.V. alfalfa silage contained approximately the same carotene and vitamin A values. PREPARATION OF SILAGES ' Permission to prepare A.I.V. silage was obtained from the Chapman Dairy Farms, of Kansas City, Missouri, who control the licensing of patents of the A.I.V. silage in the United States. During the second week of August, 1934, a hollow-tile upright silo was rilled with 109 tons of corn silage preserved by the A.I.V. method. This fodder was short and immature and contained little or no grain. It was finely cut and sufficient water was added to allow the corn to pack properly. The chopped fodder was elevated into the silo by means of a Mower and the acid solution was pumped into the silo by means of an electric pump. The acid solution was sprayed on the corn as it fell from the blower in order to get a light but even covering of the acid. Acidity tests were run with the corn fodder to determine the quantity of the mixture of hydrochloric and sulphuric acids, with a molecular ratio oi ¦1:1, that should be added. These determinations showed 'that approx - imately 12 gallons of the acid mixture should be added per ton of fodder 1 Thr ml.iki- wj, |&gt;rc|..ircil urulrr Ihe uipersi i ..I Dr. I', A. limit... </seg>
         <seg id="p005">j Vitamin A Content of Silages in order to give a pH of 3.5 in the fodder after treatment. The acid solution was pumped from 200-gallon galvanized iron water tanks, coated with asphalt paint. In filling this silo with 109 tons of corn fodder, 17 carboys of hydrochloric and 2J4 carboys of sulphuric acid were used. The cost amounted to 50.3 cents for the hydrochloric acid and 13 cents for the surphuric, or 63.3 cents per ton for acid. When the silo had 103 tons of corn silage in it, the silage was sprinkled with a solution of 4 ounces of oil of mustard to 3 gallons of water. It was then covered with tar paper and on top of the tar paper were placed 6 tons of firmly packed silage. The top two feet of silage beneath the paper were given twice as Nnuch acid as was applied to the remainder. The silage showed little or no evidence of heating during settling. The silo was not opened until about the'middle of the winter and there was practically no spoilage be - neath the paper. The soluble acidity was determined daily for sixty days. As the silage came from the silo, it varied from 0.96 cubic centimeter of one-tenth normal sodium hydroxide to 3.82 cubic centimeters per jgram, or an average of 2.86. In this work the method oudined by the Associa - tion of Official Agricultural Chemists was followed and phenol phthalein was used as an indicator. During the'third week in August, 1934, a trench silo holding 210 tons was filled with corn fodder of the same quality, but instead of having acid added, cane molasses was added at the rate of 50 pounds of molasses to a ton of, corn fodder. The molasses was mixed with water, at the rate of five pounds of water to one pound of molasses, and the molasses - water was added by means of a hose which extended into the blower. This silage went through the various heating stages that ordinary silage goes through, but produced a very palatable and good quality of silage. The acidity varied from 1.71 cubic centimeters of one-tenth-normal sodium hydroxide to 2.21 cubic centimeters per gram of silage, or an average of 1-97* " ¦•; ¦ p.yA.t A . During the fall of the year 1935, the filling of the silos was begun September 27 and was completed by^October 3. A trench silo was filled with molasses (silage, the hollow tile upright silo was filled with ordinary silage, and a second upright silo with the A.I.V. silage. The methods of preserving the silages were the same as were used during 1934. The soybean silage was made during August, 1935, and was placed in the bottom of a stucco silo. : ¦7* .colony Management The breeding colony consisted of pied male and. female rats. The room had. east, light, tile floor, steam heat, and ventilation by means of fans. The temperature was governed by a thermostatic control during the winter, and summer heat was reduced by a water cooling system. The breeding stock was reared on the Steenbock ration composed of the following!(in percentages): ; 1. Yellow corn, 76. 4. Ground alfalfa, 2.0. 2. Linseed oil meal, 16. 5. Sodium chloride, 0,5. 3. Crude casein, 5. 6. Calcium carbonate, 0,5. </seg>

In addition to this ration the animals received milk daily and lettuce several times each week. VITAMIN A DETERMINATIONS Since vitamin A is a growth-promoting vitamin, the vitamin A deter - minations were made by comparing the growth produced when groups ot rats whose body stores of vitamin A had been depleted by being fed a vitamin-A-free ration, were fed the silages or milks as a source o. this vitamin. Pied rats reared in our laboratory were used in all the experi - ments. Male and female rats 22 to 25 days old and weighing between 35 and 4i grams were fed a vitamin-A-free basal ration until depleted This ration was composed as follows: Basal Ration 1 P-ct- Casein -' jg Starch•'' .. 53 Yeast * 15 Hydrogenated vegetable oil "' 10 Salt mixture " a The antirachitic factor was supplied by irradiation of the starch and the yeast with a Cooper-Hewitt quartz mercury-vapor lamp 7 run at 2 4 amperes 250 volts. One hundred grams of starch or yeast was spread uniformly over an area of 60 centimeters square in metal trays' and then irradiated tor 40 minutes at a distance of 60 centimeters. All experimental animals received distilled water to which iodine was added once a week in the manner suggested by Sure (7). The rats were weighed once each week except near the end of the depletion period, at which time they were weighed daily. The litters were allotted so that as far as possible related animals were distributed throughout all the groups] Each rat was placed in an individual cage at weaning, and was housed alone until the experiment was completed. A negative control which received only the basal ration, and a positive control, which received the basal ration supplemented with reference cod-liver oil 8 daily, were selected from each l.tter except when several litters were started on the vitamin A supplements at approximately the same time. The feeding of the silages and milks was begun when ophthalmia was in its incipient stage or when there was a cessation of growth.

The silage samples which were used for the vitamin-A determinations were finely ground in a food chopper and stored in an electrical refrigerator at 4°C. At this time the pH of the A.I.V. silage samples was determined by the quinhydrone electrode and was found to be between pH 3.5 and 4.0. Once eachweek a rat _ weekly allowance of silage was weighed into a bottle and this quantity was fed during the following Week. The milk was bottled in half-pint milk bottles and stored at O°C. until fed. 7 RESULTS A preliminary experiment was first conducted in order to learn ' whether or notthe rats would consume the silage in the moist condition and also to determine what quantities of the silage must be fed. In this preliminary trial the vitamin A content of the A.I.V. silage was compared to that of the molasses silage. The various silages were fed as shown in Table 3 from 0.2 to 3.2 gram levels. In this preliminary trial no apparent ill effects resulted from feeding as much as 3.2 grams of the A.I.V. silage per rat per day. The rats ate the silages readily, and it was evident that smaller levels should be fed. 7 In Experiment I (Table 4) the vitamin A content of the A.I.V. silage was compared: to that of molasses silage. The groups of rats receiving 0.025 gram and 0.05 gram of the A.I.V. silage made an average gain per , Table l.—A comparison of the groups of cows used in the experiments. ~~ Time. ' .

In both experiments the molasses-silage milk was superior lo the A.1.V.-silage milk in vitamin A potency, although the results of Experiment 1 indicate no marked difference in the vitamin A content of these two lots of silage. The difference in vitamin A content of these milks was probably due to the fact that the cows in the molasses-silage group ate more alfalfa hay than did the cows in the A.f.V.-silage group. In Experiment IV (Table 6) the vitamin A contents of the milks produced by cows receiving either A.I.V. silage or alfalfa hay as the only source of roughage were determined. As shown in Table 2 'each Table 6—Summary of the average gains in weight of rats fed various daily quantities of mil/^ as the source of vitamin A.

It was evident from this experiment that, as in Experiment I, though there was no marked difference in the vitamin A potency of the A.I.V. and molasses silage, there was a slight trend in favor of the A. I. V. silage. The ordinary silage on-the other hand contained less vitamin A than did either the A.I.V. or the molasses silage.

The food consumption of these group's nf cows is shown in Table 2. The groups of rats receiving 1.0 and 1.5 cubic centimeters of A.I.V. milk made an average gain per rat of 56 and HI grams respectively, while the groups fed corresponding levels of molasses-silage milk gained 50 grams and 76 grams respectively. The groups fed the corresponding levels of ordinary silage milk gained 3,1 and 59 grams. The A.1.V.-silage milk seemed slightly more potent in wt.-imin A than was the molasses-silage milk, but the ordinary-silage milk was inferior to both the A.I.V. and molasses milks. j In Experiment Vll (Table 9) the vitamin A contents of A.1.V., molasses, ordinary, and soybean silages were compared. These silages were pre - served during 1935. The groups of rats fed 0.10 and 0.15 gram of A.I.VJ. silage made an average gain per rat of 67 grams and 86 grams respecV tively. while the groups fed corresponding levels of molasses silage gained 67 grams and 89 grams respectively. The groups of rats fed 0.15 gram, 0.30 gram, and 0.35 gram of ordinary silage made an average gain per rat of 62 grams, 95 grams and 99 grams respectively. The groups of rats led 0.10 gram, 0.20 gram and 0.30 gram of the soybean silage made an average gain per rat of 52 grams, 84 grams and 90 grams respectively. Again there was no appreciable difference between the vitamin A content of the A.I.V. and molasses silage, and the ordinary silage was inferior to those silages as a source of this vitamin. The soybean silage contained less vitamin A than any of the other silages. </seg>

CONCLUSIONS From these data it was evident that under the conditions of these experiments the milks produced by cows receiving A.1.V., molasses, or ordinary silage as the only roughage ranked in the same order of vitamin A potency as did the silages, namely A.1.V.-silage milk, molasses-silage milk, and ordinary-silage milk. On the other hand when a good grade of alfalfa hay served as the only source of roughage the vitamin A content of the milk produced was greater than that produced by cows receiving the A.I.V. silage as the only roughage. When both alfalfa hay and A.I.V. silage were fed as the roughage and when the amount of alfalfa hay consumed by the coWs in this group was less than that consumed by the comparable group of cows on alfalfa hay and molasses silage, then the vitamin A content of the milk produced was greater in the milk of the group which consumed the greatest amount of alfalfa hay. The soy - bean silage contained less vitamin A than any of the other silages. </seg>
