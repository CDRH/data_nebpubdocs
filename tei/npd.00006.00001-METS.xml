The policy of our society for the past s.veral years has beea o take one subject and give it as thorough discussion as could &gt;e in the limited space allowed in an annual report. "The Apple" was the first special report for th»- year 1*'.»4. This vol - ume is all distributed, or out of our office for distribution, so now ire issue another apple report, the beginning of a second aeries. This volume is given mainly to the apple, propagation, growing, and marketing, together wirh the insect pests and means of fighting them as far as nv Imtc b.-.-n able to determine. </seg>

            <seg id="p017">ANNUAL REPORT. GROWING APPLE TREES UNTIL THEY ARE READY TO PLANT INTO ORCHARD. JAMES P. DUNLAP. In so short a space it is not possible to give all the little de - tails, but on things omitted the planter will have to use his better judgment, and once or twice, though yon should fail, try again. Practice will make perfect. The tirst thing to do is to prepare the ground to plant the seeds on for this summer. Fallow is best to do this. Plow deep in the spring, and then again and again every four or tive weeks through the entire season. Let the last plowing be about the tirst of October, then late in October smooth it down with either tioat or heavy harrow. It is theu in tine condition for planting in the spring. The object of summer fallow is that it pulverizes the ground deep and well. It conserves moisture, it gives the land a rest, it destroys weeds, helps to clear the land of insects, and leaves the land easier to cultivate the next season. And &lt;&gt;n so costly a crop as apple seedlings or grafts it well repays for the rest vear. The next thing is to procure good, fresh seeds. If bought on the market they "should be tested. Or they may be saved from the cider mill by mixing the pomice with water and as soon as the pomice begins to float stir well to separate seeds from the pumice. Then let them settle and the seeds will sink and the pomice float and they can be separated. ID </seg>
            <seg id="p018">12 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. The seeds may be layered in sand and kept in a cold place until spring, but must not be allowed to sprout before planting; or they may be dried and kept until next March, when they should be put to soak, changing the water every few days to prevent souring. As early in April as the ground can be worked mark out with any suitable implement about two inches deep and rows three feet apart. Drill in the seed and cover one inch deep. Go over the land immediately with a wheel-hoe or some implement that will make surface cultivation about two inches deep, but do not disturb the seed rows. This cultivation is to prevent drying, baking, and cracking of the ground. Keep a clean cultivation until about the first of August, then discontinue cultivation to give fhe plants a slow growth and time to ripen their wood before digging time. And when the plants are about four inches high thin to about one inch apart in the row. &lt;ireat care is needed to protect the seeds from being destroyed by mice and squirrels. On this account it is generally consid - ered dieaj)er to buy the loots from where they are grown in large fields than it is to grow them in small patches. Dig the roots in the last half of October. A horse digger is best for this purpose. Small lots may be dug with a spade. When the roots are dug sort them, tying the good grades in bunches and pack away in the cellar to be grafted in winter. The small roots may be lined out and' grown another year, or they may be set in rows four and one-half feet apart and six inches apart in the rows for budding. The next season applet may be budded in May if dormant buds have been kept in cold storage, but July and August is the best time to do the budding. To do this, some ten days before setting the buds trim the lower part of the stalk so as to give a clear place to work. Then take from the tree of the variety that you want to propagate. Take a twig of the new growth on which the terminal bud is formed. Cut off the leaves, leaving about </seg>

Then cut the twig from the tree and protect it from hot sun; then on the north side of the stalk, where the bark is smooth, make a slit in the bark from the ground upward about one and one half inch; then make a cross cut through the bark at the upper end of the upright cut; then raise the two corners at the lower side of the cross cut. — this is to allow the bud to enter easy; then with a keen-edged knife cut off a bud, taking the bark and a small slice of wood about an inch long, leading the bud about the middle; take the bud by the leafstalk, set it in the place prepared on the stalk, and gently slide it down between the bark and wood until it sets snugly under the bark, then wrap above and below the bud with basswood bark or raffia, leaving only the point of the bud and piece of leaf-stalk exposed, and at the end of the two weeks the wraps are to be taken off. In May budding stalks should be left ten days longer; in July and August budding the stalks should be left until the last half of October, and then cut off three-fourths of an inch above the bud. and the following spring all sprouts are to be kept broken off except the one that comes from the bud. (lean cultivation is to be kept up each year until the middle of August, and then discontinue to give the trees time to ripen their wood before winter, and in two years from the bud the trees are large enough to plant ou€ in orchard. The objections to budding apples are that the budding must be made above the ground, and so many of the seedlings are subject to blight and sun-scald, and some grow faster and others slower than the trees that are worked on them so much. So that I would not recommend budding of the apple except in progagating new varieties, as a plant may be multiplied faster by budding than by grafting, and in case of double work which will be desired later on.

If you chouse varieties that do well in your locality it means success. If you choose varieties that are not adapted to your locality it means failure of the orchard. Tie the scions in bunches and carefully label and pack in dry leaves in outdoor pits. Cover the pits with board roof to keep out the rain or snow. The grafting is to lie done in the cellar, away from frost, any time in the winter. To do this take four parts rosin, three parts bees-wax, and three parts tallow, melt together and mix well with this wax No. 24 cotton yarn. An easy way to do this is to drop a ball of yarn in the kettle of melted wax. and when the wax has soaked through the ball take it out and squeeze out the surplus wax and wind the yarn on any convenient sized reel. fhen take of the roots ami scions that you have stored away, ut the scion eight inches long, then make a long slanting cut at the butt end. then between the heart and the long side make an upward cut about one-half inch, then cut off the top of the root with the same slant as the scion, then make a downward out so that the cut of the scion and the cut of the root are as near alike as practicable, then set and push them together so that the union of the bark and wood will be even with each other, then cut off about two and one-half inches of the root. then wrap a few rounds with wax thread to hold them in place. and the graft is finished. Tie the grafts in bunches and set them upright in the cellar and cover them with sand. Keep the sand moist until spring. Use &lt; are to keep each kind separated and the varieties marked. As early in April as the ground can be worked, mark off in rows four and one-half feet apart, and set grafts six inches apart in the rows; set deep enough so that about one inch of the scion will be above ground: by this pro - cess apples will strike roots from the scions and get on their own roots. </seg>

In the last half of October apply a wash composed of MM pound of cayenne pepper made into tea. two quarts of blood, and twenty gallons of water. This is easiest applied with a spray pump from a barrel on wheels. Hun between the rows. or it may be applied by other means. This is to keep off rabbits or other vermin. Next spring, as soon as the ground can be wafted, commence and keep up a thorough surface cultivation the same as the tirst year, always discontinuing cultivation in the middle of August. Go through and trim the trees in shape in June. In fall apply the pepper wash, and the, next spring'the treees may be set in orchard, or if larger trees are desired the same cultivation may be continued one year longer. In digging the horse digger is best. Care must be used to neither get the roots frosted or dried and you then will have a good lot of trees. To make double worked trees. This is only necessary where the varieties that you wish to grow are subject to sun scald or other weakness of the trunk. In that case take a tree that has a hardy trunk that grows about as fast as the tree you wish to propagate. If you wish to grow Red Jnne the Whiting No. I'll might be as good as any. It is hardy of trunk and grows about as fast; if Kops of Wine, Duchess of Oldenberg for trunk; Joua - than Top, Walbridge for trunk, and so on. always taking a fast growing hardy trunk for fast-growing top, and a slow-growing hardy trunk for a slow-growing top. In growing the trees for the trunks use a long scion and a short root, so as to get them on their own roots as soon as possible; do all the work just as directed for other grafted trees. </seg>

Do the budding work just as has been described, with the exception that when the growth from the bud has grown one foot pinch the top off it to make it throw out a thick head, and you will then have your de - sired tree on a hardy trunk. Cultivate and dig all the same as directed for other trees and you will then have the work, of grow - ing the trees well done. DISCUSSION. Mr. Stephens — We have with us Mr. Russell, who has grown large numbers of seedlings for many years and has been very successful. I understand that he raised something like five millions of apple seedlings the past season. Perhaps he would be willing to tell something of his methods for the benefit of these students. Mm. L. M. Russell — I don't know that I can add anything that would be of interest along this line. This seedling growing business is quite a big thing. The manner of preparing the soil as described by Mr. Dunlap is all right; we might differ with him a little in planting, as we plant on a much larger scale and have to get at it in a faster way than he describes. We prefer the French seed, which usually comes the latter part of January or first of February. As soon thereafter as we can work the ground the seed is drilled in. We use a horse drill which seeds four rows at a time. We have been planting from a bus'hel to a bushel and a half to the acre. If we use the American seed we put more on as it is not as good seed as the French. We aim to plant from an inch to an inch and a half deep. Of course that seed must lie on the ground long enough to sprout. The French seed, coming to us in charcoal, is already damp and does not need soaking as the American seed does. We run it through a fanning mill to separate it from the char - coal, and plant it any time during the month of March or the </seg>
            <seg id="p025">17 GROWING APPLE TREES. first half of April. If we can get the seed ready to plant the fore part of March we like that time best; or if planted later, the seed must be soaked say four or five days in barrels of water, changing the water so as not to sour the seed. In that case the seed must be dried just enough so that it will run through the drill, but care should be taken not to dry it too much. Mr. Stephens — We would be glad to know whether you pre - fer the scion-rooted tree, or some other plan of propagation? Mr. L. M. Russell — For hardy trees I prefer the scion-rooted trees; that is. trees that are rooted on their own scions. I sup - posed your idea in calling on me was to get some little descrip - tion of our method of planting the seed. I might say a little more about covering the seed. As I said before, we drill four rows at a time, and we have a follower attached to the drill with two shovels for each row, which throw a ridge up over the row. Then just as these seeds are nearly ready to come through the ground we go through and rake this ridge off by hand. That is the first cultivation. It kills the young weeds which are starting up in the row, and by the time the weeds get started again the little seedlings are up two or three inches and it is easy to keep them ahead of the weeds. Mr. Stephens— I believe you cultivate more than one row at a time? Mr. L. ML Russell — Yes, sir; we cultivate four rows at a time. We have a special horse implement made which culti - vates the same four rows that the drill sows. We just follow the rows the same way the drill ran. Mr. Stephens — How late do you cultivate the seedlings? Mr. L. M. Russell — This year we ran up to the fore part of September before we quit cultivating. Mr. Stephens — You dig in October or November? Mr. L. M. Russell — We usually commence digging from the 10th to the 20th of October; this year it was the 17th. Mr. J. M. Russell — This ridge which is thrown up over the 2 </seg>
            <seg id="p026">18 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTUBAL SOCIETY. » rows not only puts them in good shape to rake, but it prevent a crust from forming over the row. If when you cover the row it is left a little lower than the ground between the rows, heavy crust will form which prevents the seed from coinin through; if it is ridged up a little it never forms a crust. Mr. Camp — In the eastern part of Nebraska I don't want any more budded apple trees. It is so difficult to get the bud to grow just as fast as the stock. The upper part of the tree is almost certain to be larger than the lower part, and they will not stand our heavy winds. To anyone contemplating planting, if he can have his choice. I would advise the root-grafted tree where the union is made below the surface. Kb. Pollard — I think this question of starting a tree is very important one, and I would like to get at the bottom of and see whether we start right or not. It has been clainicM by some that the trouble was in our manner of grafting; th; we must have a whole-root graft. I would say that my expei (•in c has been that it doesn't make a particle of difference, don't care how you graft them; piece-root, whole-root, top u or top down, any way you please; just so you make them gro well, that is all I want. The question comes up on this pier root grafting, and I want to learn whether science agrees wit practice: Does it injure a tree to cut off the tap-root? Th apple tree has a tap-root, and I would like to have the questio answered scientifically as to whether or not it injures the vitalit of a tree to cut off that tap-root; I have demonstrated it i practice to my own satisfaction, but I want to know whetht science agrees with practice. Dr. Bessey — You must remember that a tree as you handle it is not in a perfectly natural condition. Everj apple tree has to be mutilated (I use that word advisedly), because you move it, and in moving you cut off its roots. Whether the tree is on whole-roots to start with or not, when you move the tree \&lt;&gt;u cut its roots. There is no question but that a tree which has not </seg>
            <seg id="p027">19 GROWING APPLE TREES. had its roots cut is (other things equal) better off than one that has been cut. But since in practice all of our trees have their roots cut, I do not set that it is likely to make much, if any, difference whether the cutting be before the grafting or after the grafting. While I am on my feet I want to say another thing: There is a difficulty with trees in the west, or at least we notice it more in the west, resulting from a certain fungus which gets into the tree. Just where it gets in we are in doubt. I am quite suspicious of the places where the roots are cut off; I um suspicious of the lower end of the tree that is rotting away. In some way at least our trees get inside of them that fungus which makes the heart rat, so that a tree sometimes as thick as ones arm will be as brittle as a pipe-stem. This fungus does not get in through the uninjured bark of the tree; I suspect the cut or broken roots. But you can't make a point against piece-root grafting out of this as long as the necessary practice is followed of frequently removing trees in such a way that the roots are more or less injured. I suspect that the breaks or cuts — the wounded surfaces — are responsible for getting a good deal of this fungus inside of the trees, which is so common in the west and which has so much to do with the shortened life of our apple trees. Several years ago, before I had followed the matter as far as I have now, I was inclined to believe that the whole - root would be better; but I know now that with the present practice, that cannot be. Mr. Pollard — You wouldn't state that it injures the vitality of a tree by changing from a tap-root to a surface-root? The box elder and elm do not have any tap-root; the oak, black wal - nut, willow, and some others have a tap-root, but by .Cutting that tap-root and transplanting them we change them very largely to surface-root trees. The apple tree has a tap-root — Mr. Pollard — I think all varieties have unless they are dis turbed. Mr. Youxgers — Some varieties. </seg>
            <seg id="p028">20 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. Mr. Yoongers — Yon may plant a Genet and it will always have a tap-root, while the Wine Sap never has a tap-root. Dr. Bessey — As far as I can make it out it is this way: We have not yet solved the problem of making our apple trees live long. When I was a boy I used to see apple trees as thick through as some of our large members here, and I would like to see that sort of thing in the west. We can't have that sort of thing here if this fungus which makes the rotton-hearted tree keeps on getting in, and it gets in some place. It is possible that we should look into the matter as to whether or not our present methods of propagation are just right. Mr. Youngers — Explain why we never have black-heart in the Duchess or Wealthy in this state when the Wine Sap and some other varieties are affected. If it gets in from the root, why doesn't it get into all varieties? Dr. Bessey — I presume that is just as it is with every other disease. A disease is something that gets a foot-hold or not depending upon the condition of ihe tree. You may catch the grippe and I may not; I may catch something else and you may not; but the exposure to disease, of course, is not a good thing in either case. Mr. Dunlap — Have you ever given attention to the manner in which the trees were ripened up. If winter comes on before the trees are thoroughly ripened the wood will become black. Dr. Bessey — I am not speaking of black-heart; it is the rot at the center of the tree. Mr. Pollard — Can't we overcome that by planting the seed where the tree is to grow? In that case we would disturb no roots at all, but would have the original tree on its own roots. If it is a good tree, all right; if it is not a good tree, it is all right anyway. Dr. Bessey — I think it is a thing that needs to be looked into; of course, I can't pronounce on that. Mr. Harrison — The trouble is right here: Our dry winters </seg>

You go into the east and you will find the roots of the trees in soil that is well soaked up in the fall ; come here in the west, and the ground is frozen up dry. It is all owing to the dry freezing in the winters. Dr. Bessey — I am not speaking of black-heart. I am speak - ing of a rot which is due to the presence of a definitely known fungus. It is just as clear and decided a thing that has gone in there as the case of worms in animals. It is not due to any sort of climatic cause at all, but to something that has worked its way through some break or opening in the tree. Mb. Youngehs — In regard to this tap-root business, we have investigated that, and there is not a variety of apple that has naturally a tap-root but that will re-form one after it is trans - planted, just as in the case of the walnut. We transplanted 10,000 walnut trees on our grounds, and when we undertook to dig them four or five years later we found that we would have to go down four or five feet to find the end of the tap-root. Nature will assert itself. The Ben Davis is naturally a surface feeder; it never has a tap-root, while the Genet will always throw down a tap-root, no matter whether it is budded or grafted, piece-root or whole-root. Mr. Brown — I would like to ask Dr. Bessey if he finds this peculiar fungus in young trees? Dr. Bessey— I have seen it in trees as thick as my finger. Mr. Brown— Did you ever see it in a tree younger than three years old? Dr. Bessey — Idon't know that I have; I don't remember. Mr. Brown — I believe the failure in our orchard trees is due to excessive pruning more than anything else; that together with the suggestion thrown out by Mr. Harrison. There is no question in my mind but that black-heart (I am not speaking of the fungus) is due to excessive cold in dry winters. We never find it in other seasons. </seg>

The President — We have a five-year-old orchard of that kind. It is in fine shape now, but of course it is only five years old. Mr. Jenkins — Hasn't the wind blown the soil away so that a good many of the roots are right on the surface? The President — Yes, sir. Mm. J. M. Russell — What is generally termed a "whole-root" is not really a whole root. In the first place, if the seedling is a tiiot -class seedling the bottom will be cut off in taking it up. In the second place, all that 1 have ever seen of the so-called "whole root'' grafts were cut about eight inches long, — simply a collar graft with the bottom cut off. Mas. Alderman — I think one cause of the short life of our trees is that after they come into bearing they have a double burden; we seed the ground and allow the grass to absorb the moisture and starve them to death. GFot. Furnas — I would like to ask Professor Bessey, as a scientist, if he would enlarge a little more upon the remark which he incidentally dropped a few moments ago in regard to the power of resistance? Dr. Bessey — It is a fact that if you take different varieties of the same species, or different individuals grown from seeds from the same tree, that Nature has put into some a power of re - sistance that is not found in others, and I think in our experi - mental work attention should be given to the selection of those varieties that show in this, or that, or the other thing, this extra power or resistance. We do not know how Nature puts it in there, or why she puts it into the seedling from one seed and not from another; but where you find it, and find that the lesistaiu-e is along a line that you want, the proper course is the selection of those that have that power of resistance. In that way we may slowly build up those varieties that will resist along all lines. But, unfortunately, a variety that will resist </seg>

As I said to Mr. Youngers a few moments ago, he may catch the grippe and I may not; I may catch some disease that he may not. I may resist in one direction and he in another. So out- varieties of trees have the power of resisting in this way and that way, and we must breed to bring these together. We must do here just what is done in breeding stock. The fact is, that, so far as agriculture is concerned, stock breeding is very far in advance of that branch of horticulture which is called fruit growing. The floriculturists approach to the breeders of stock. They make their selections and breed to something. KEl'OKT OF BECBETABY OF THE DOUGLAS COUNTY BORTrCULTUBAL SOCIETY. PHIL MKRGEN, OMAHA. .1//-. I'rr.sidrnt mid Miniberx: Feeling that there was need of an organization representing the fruit interests of Douglas county, a call was issued by Mr. O. W. Hervev. Agricultural Editor of the World Iftntld. and an organization was effected January 4th, 1806. It was practically a reorganization of an old horticultural society which had gone out of existence for want of a little push and energy. The new organization started in with a membership of nine teen, and soon row to thirty-five members. The new year prom ises to double the membership of last year. What Douglas county is capable of was shown by its magnifi - cent display of fruits at the Trans Mississippi under the able management of Mr. E. A. Walker, one of the members of the so - ciety. As to a report of last year's fruit crop in our county, will say that apples were almost a total failure with the exception of </seg>

This was partly due to heavy winds blowing off the fruit when only about one-half grown. The grape crop was the fineBt we have ever had in our section. Small fruit was, I think, not over half a crop. Mb. Harrison — Which grape do you consider the best? Mr. Merges — The Concord. There are only three varieties of grapes which we can grow very successfully in this state. Those are the Concord, Worden, and Moore's Early. The President — We are glad to have with us these students from the short course in the Agricultural School. We also have with us to-day Chancellor MacLean, who will give us a short talk. ADDRESS OF WELCOME Chancellor MacLean — Mr. President and Members of the So - ciety: I thank you for the privilege of saying a word to the so - ciety, and of giving the annual welcome. This society is one that we are always glad to see, and the students are always glad to see the apples. (Laughter.) "When Adam dug and Eve span, Where, then, was the, gentleman?"

There are problems to solve as to what can best be done in this new state, and I give you the good news to-day that to help you in solving these problems we have secured one of the most promising young Nebraskana of whom we know to come here as professor of horticulture. A year ago, very rightly, this society was concerned for fear that the professor of 'horticulture, who had been called to Rhode Island, would leave us. The regents did all they could to per - suade this man to stay except raising his salary. They were unable to do that, as they were in the last year of a biennium of unexpected growth in the University, and did not desire to make a deficit with which to appear before the legislature. Therefore they couldn't raise this man's salary, and Professor Card, as you know, received a call to Rhode Island. Then the regents secured this young graduate from this University; a Nebraskan; a man who knows our climate's changes and difficulties; a man who will not have to be three years in process of initiation be - fore he can understand all that he has to deal with here; a man who was a pupil of Professor Card's and can take up the work just where Professor Card laid it down; a man who has these two years in Washington been studying the horticultural work in all the globe and who will come to us with a full knowledge of the latest that is being done anywhere in the world. So, then, though he is a young man and will especially need your help, he is a man of great promise, we think, for this position, and we solicit your loyal co-operation with him. He will welcome criti - cism and suggestion. I think it is good news that we are to have such a man to take up this great interest here with you. Secondly, I have the good news that the regents have decided to ask the coming legislature for an appropriation with which to build appropriate greenhouses. (Applause.) These here are rotted down, and a greenhouse should certainly be where there is room. They should be upon a farm where you can work oat - side as well as inside the greenhouse, and so it is decided that </seg>
            <seg id="p034">26 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. the new greenhouses — if the legislature grants the request of the regents — shall be placed where they belong, upon the farm, and shall be the most modern possible. We ask again your help with the legislature to see that a new professor may have the best new facilities in ojK-ning up a new era of horticultural work in this University, and, with your help, in the stale. Then, my last word is that with all of our success in horti - culture, we have not come to supreme success unless we can raise the best possible crop of boys and girls in this state lapplnusei: and if you will look over yonder deferring to the horticultural students) you will see that the crop is all right. They are blushing, but some of our best apples have beautiful blushes, as you know, when kissed by the sunshine. These boys know no other kissing as yet; they come in the innocence of their youth, i Applause and laughter.) We ask your help in the further development of this farm and dairy school. It has increased ."»4 jM-r cent in numbers the last year. It is a very young school, but the regents have planned instead of this one - term course to have a course of three terms. They are pushing the agricultural end of the University. You know that some good-natured farmers who do not keep up to date are always suspicious of these schools. They do not understand that the school is not to teach the practical things that the father teaches his boy on the farm, but that the school is to bring to bear the things in modern science as applied to agriculture. The farmer has no laboratory or appliances for teaching these things in - telligently. We ask the former members of this society t&lt;&gt; help us to see that this school, the policy for which it stands, aH the promise there is in it for progressive agriculture in this state, is properly presented to a farmers" legislature on yonder capitol hill. We ask your help to get word to every farmer in the state that there is tliis school where there is free tuition, where the expenses are very light, so that the boys — and we hope soon, also, the girls — can get into the school and be educated not </seg>

By referring to the foregoing outline you will see that there are several great subdivisions.

Under the first, nutrition, we will first consider the subject of absorption. Plants of all kinds are like animals in this, that they absorb their food. A higher animal has a bag inside of its body in which it puts its food and walks around while it allows the food to be absorbed, But a plant has not any such inside </seg>
            <seg id="p038">30 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. bag, or stomach as we call it. A plant is situated so that all its absorption must be made by the organs (corresponding ex - actly to the organs of absorption of the animal) where they are. The root down in the ground has an absorbing surface very much as the lining of the stomach of an animal has an absorbing surface. That which the animal takes as food goes from the stomach through the walls. That is like what takes place when food-matter is absorbed through the covering of the root. But while plants haven't any stomachs they are one better than the animal in this: the animal has only one organ of absorption — its stomach, or the alimentary canal— but plants absorb at different parts of the plant body. We have first the roots wliich absorb certain kinds of food, and these foods ab - sorbed by the roots are always iratcr;/ solution*. A plant never eats any solid matter; simply matter dissolved in water. Ho the root is the absorber of watery solutions, and these are watery solutions of solids. — solids that are dissolved in the water. At the other end of the tree the leaves and young green twigs absorb watery solutions of gases. So your tree — al - though it has no stomach — feeds by its roots from the ground, taking in watery solutions of solid matter, while its leaves up in the air are taking watery solutions of gases from the air. &gt; What is the food-matter absorbed? First, from the ground: The first food (and I put it first because it is so important) is water. Water is as much a food of the plant as it is a food of the animal. We commonly leave it out in our discussions of food; but there is no reason for so doing. It is much more reasonable to regard water as a food, for it certainly is a food, and the whole supply of the apple tree is from the ground; the roots are the water drinkers for the tree. Understand I am speaking just at this moment of water; not of what is in the water, but water itself, pure water, as a food. And while I am at it. I may say that water is not taken in by any ofher part of a plant in sufficient quantity to be worthy of being counted. </seg>
            <seg id="p039">* 31 PHYSIOLOGY OF TH» APPLE TREE. In addition to water from the soil the plant takes in mineral matters. Among these are the nitrates. The nitrates are im - portant because they furnish to the plant a very important food matter, nitroycn. It is that food-matter which furnishes th • strength-giving part of living things. You yourselves have to either beans (if you are vegetarians), or flesh, in order to get nitrogen, and if you do not have nitrogen in your food you will not be strong. It is the muscle builder. Hants ai • much like animals that they must have nitrogenous material, and they get this largely from nitrates of various sorts. Then there is sulphate of lime. Every soil has this in it, and every plant must have sulphur, just as you have to have some sulphur in your makeup. One reason why we are so largely vegetarians is that the plants &lt;fhther so much of this food for us. If we make a proper selection of vegetables we ran easily plan a diet, or a ration, which would supply the same ingredients that we gH when we eat animal food. Then there are the carbon These are of use because carbonic acid is combined with some - thing the plant wants, — lime, perhaps,— in some cases soda, — in some cases magnesia, potash, etc. And last in my short list (I will not make it complete) are the phosphates. .lust as we need phosphate of lime to build up the bones, so the plaut needs phosphates to build up certain parts. It must have ac - to the phosphate*. All these are taken in by the tree through the roots dissolved in the water. The roots are of no value to the tree in furnishing food unless these matters are dissolved in the water. They must be in solution, but they are never in strong solution. I have said many times to my classes in discussing this matter that plants feed on what might be called Mrf thin w;&lt;/&gt;; that is. water with very, very small per - centages of food-matter dissolved in it. These, then, are the things the tree takes from the ground. From the air it takes two things. Just as it takes two kinds of food from the ground, water and mineral matter, from the </seg>
            <seg id="p040">32 NEBRASKA STATE HORTIC I L T L RAL SOCIETY. air it takes two things, both of which are gases. Plants take no solid matters through their leaves, only gaseous matters, and these gaseous matters come in contact with the wet surface of the cells of the inside of the leaves, there become watery so - lutions and are then absorbed again. There are two gases to be considered. First, we have carbon dioxide, which used to be called in the old text books, "carbonic acid gaa," but now we call it simply "carbon dioxide." This is the gas which results from burning. If you light a lamp the gas which escapes from the chimney is very largely carbon dioxide. It is the "choke damp" of old cellars and deep wells. Plants can feed upon that, and they absorb it, unless there is too much of it. The old books used to say that plants and animals were entirely oppo - site, because plants could feed upon this carbon dioxide and ani - mals could not. But if yoH have as much carbon dioxide as would hurt a man, you are pretty apt to have enough to hurt a plant. The plant wants it in small quantities, but if you have a large amount your plant will suffer. The second gas is plain, common oxygen, — the very gas you breathe in every time you draw a breath. You breathe for the sake of oxygen, and the plant needs oxygen also. You can choke a plant if you keep oxygen away from it, just as you can choke a man, or a horse, or a dog by keeping oxygen away from them. The only thing is if you choke a man it is not many minutes before he is dead, that is, if you give him no access to oxygen. If you try to choke a snake it will take a good many more minutes before the absence of oxygen will kill him, and as you go down the scale it takes longer and longer. Plants are a good ways down the scale, and they can stand it longer, but you can choke your plant for want of oxygen just as you can choke a man, or a horse, or a dog. This, then, covers the food-matters taken in by the plant. They aie taken in simply through the root as watery solutions of mineral matters, and through the leaves as watery solutions </seg>
            <seg id="p041">PHYSIOLOGY OF TUB APPLE TREE. 33 of these two gases. When these food-matters pass into the tree, we find that the tree is different in one thing from man, and different from the dog or the horse. When the food-matter passes through the walls of the stomach of an animal there are distinct vessels for picking up this food-matter and carrying it around into the various parts of the body. It is very odd that with all the feeling that there is such a wonderful diffenm . tween plants and animals, when it comes to the question of the carrying the food-matters in plants, the common impression is that plants and animals are alike. That is where we make a great mistake. Plants and animals are alike in many things, but in some things they are not alike. In this matter plants are very much more like the very low animals. We get our ideas of circulation of blood and circulation of food in animals from the higher animals. We dissect a man and find out that there are arteries, veins, and capillaries; we dissect a horse and find the same thing; we dissect a dog and find the same thing. We go on down and dissect birds, snakes, and fishes; but if we go down far enough we finally come to animals where the cir - culatory system has no complete set of tubes. In the lowest animals there are no vessels to propel the food here or there, it is simply a matter of diffusion or dispersion. Plants are more like these lower animals than the higher ones. So when the food is once inside the plant — in the leaf, jn the root — there are no tubes through which these food-matters are taken from one place to another, and we have simply to deal with a kind of slow diffusion of food-matter through that whole mass of water that is in the tree. Everything taken in through the leaf must — some of it, at least — go to the extremes of the roots; and, on the other hand, the things taken in by the roots — some of them, at least — must pass to the mppermoBt parts of the tree. So we have a diffusion of the things which come in through the root upward, and diffusion of the things which come in through the leaf downward. </seg>
            <seg id="p042">34 NEBRASKA 8TATB HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. Finally, under the head of nutrition we come to the subjeo of assimilation; that is the change of food-matter into plant material. The most important of these changes takes place in the leaf, because greatest in amount. When the carbon dioxide is taken into the leaf-cells, if the sun is shining am the temperature high enough ithat is. above ."&gt;() degrees), then the leaf-cells can use the carbon dioxide and out of it makt starch and sugar. Thus vou have here a change of inorganii matter into organic or living matter. This is the most im portant assimilation, and it takes place only in leaves and othe parts that are green in color, and only in the bright light whei the temperature is high enough so that the plant can be active The other assimilations I cannot stop to discuss, but wil simply lay that assimilation of mineral matters seems to taki place wherever the plant needs these matters. If sulphur is needed in the trunk, as the sulphur combinations are dift'usei ■p the trunk from the roots, then and there the cells assimilate sulphur. If phosphates are needed in any part of the plant, it that part the assimilation take- place. Plants are like animals in another thing. When an animal has more carbon matter than it needs, it stores it up in the form of fat. Fat is simply carbon with enough of something else with it to make it storable material. When a plant has carbon matter which it wants to store up, it stores it in the form of starch, because the principal element in starch is car - bon. So the starch of the plant is stored away if it has more than it needs, precisely as the fat of the animal is stored away, and for the same reason: for future u*r. In the apple tree, in the fall of the year, very much of what you call ripening of the twig is in fact the storage of starch in the pith, this becoming sometimes so compact as to make it hard and very difficult to cut. As spring comes on the starch changes to sugar and diffuses throughout the tree. Here you have the storage of starch the season before, and the use of it early the season </seg>
            <seg id="p043">PHY8IOLOGY OF THE APPLE THEE. 35 following. In the case of very many of the common plants the storage is well known, as in the case of the potato. We are out of the raage of the native f potato, but in regions where p&lt;&gt; - tatoes grow naturally, that is what is done. This year the po - tato grows and makes a surplus of starch which it stores up in its tubers underground. Next spring, after a mild winter, this stored up starch in the potato tuber is used for the nourish - ment of the little plants which push up from the eyes or buds. The next topic is growth, which includes a number of ele ments. First, in growth, you have actual formation of new matter, and this is usually accompanied by the formation of new cells, which are always formed by the subdivision of old ones. Every cell in a plant is simply the result of the subdi - vision of some preceding cell. Then we have in growth the swelling up of the cells. If now we have a mass of cells of a certain size the second step is simply the absorption of enough water to swell up the cells to a much greater size. The absorp - tion of water by which every cell swells up is the largest part of growth as we see it. The formation of new cells is important, but we do not see much enlargement when that takes place. When every cell absorbs water and swells up like that fabled ox of old, the result is what you see as growth, and this is why some growths are so very rapid. When you see asparagus stalks pushing up so rapidly in the spring, or the century plant sending up its enormous stalk a good. many inches a day, scarcely any of it is the result of the formation of new cells, but simply the swelling of cell ; every cell drinking jnst as much as it possibly can so as *o swell itself out and distend its bulk. A word or two in regard to particular growth. First, the growth of roots. Roots, as all of the older members of the so - ciety know, grow at their ends. They are "end-growers." you have a root a yard long its growth is all confined to the terminal portion, say the last three or four inches. A root adds to its length by adding to its end; there is practically no elonga- </seg>
            <seg id="p044">36 tion in the other parts. If yon take a living root a yard long and mark it at regular intervals and then look at it again a month hence, yon will find that the marks on the older part of the root have not grown apart, but on the newer part they do grow apart, and often very much. Stems also are end-growers, but they grow also in the parts that are considerably older. The difference between root-growth and stem-growth is mainly one of degree. A stem grows at the end, but each part of the stem keeps on growing for a greater length of time. A root grows at the end. bnt soon stops. Take a certain quarter-inch of root near the end and watch that, part, marking it with ink so as to recognize it, and you will find that it soon gets its whole length and then stops growing. If you mark in the same way a quarter-inch of the end of a stem, you will find that the stem has a longer period of growth. So in the stem you can go back a good many inches from the end and make cross marks an .inch apart, and yon will find that the joints for a considerable distance down wifl elongate. But do not carry it too far. As soon as the apple twig has hardened its wood, it cannot elongate any more than a root can. So it comes to this: A root hardens its wood sooner and stops elongating; a. stem retains the power of elongating for a greater length of time. Perhaps I might digress enough here to insist upon it that the hardened-up portion of a stem never elongates. Quite a number of years ago there was a discussion in the agricultural pages of the New York Tribune over the question as to whether tree trunks ever elongate. The question was gone over very carefully by a good many scientific men. and the result was that it was shown very definitely that a trunk does not elongate one particle. About the same time I made a series of experi - ments on a number of different kinds of trees by very carefully measuring the difference between two taoks which I drove into the tree, marking the distance by cross marks on the heads of the tacks, and after a good many months going back and making </seg>
            <seg id="p045">37 PHYSIOLOGY OP THB APPLE TBEE. the measurements again. I found absolutely no elongation whatever. It is a physical impossibility; there cannot be any elongation. A word in regard to the growth of fruit. The fruit of the apple grows in two ways: first, by the formation of a very large number of minute cells, they being, formed by the subdivision of old cells; and second (probably the latter half of the growth), not by the formation of any more cells bat by each cell swelling itself up to several times its original size. When ripening takes place you have this swelling taking place to such an extent that instead of being square, each cell rounds itself off so that the cells are spherical or approximately so. That simply comes from the over-distention of these cells. Probably the last half of the growth of the apple is simply filling in with enough watery matter so as to swell out all its cells. In regard to the physics of the apple tree, we notice first the relation of heat to the tree. In the study of temperature we find that for every plant in the world there are three important temperatures: the minimum temperature, below which there is no activity, below which the plant stands perfectly still; the maximum temperature, above which there is no activity what - ever; and then between these, not a mean temperature {it is not half way), but some temperature, which is found by experi - ment to be the best temperature. This, in botany, is named the optimum temperature. For the apple tree it has never been determined. I suppose it would have to be determined for each variety of the apple. Let me show you how much these tem - peratures vary. For example, we have been able to test very accurately these several temperatures for germinating seeds of varions kinds. The minimum temperature below which there is no activity in the case of barley is 41 degrees. The minimum temperature for pumpkin seeds is about 56 degrees. Here yon have a difference of 15 degrees between the minimum tempera - tures of those two common seeds. The maximum temperature </seg>

These two maxima, you see, are IB degrees apart. Now the optimum temperature for barley is H degrees, and for the pumpkin 02 degrees, being a difference in their best temperatures of only 9 degrees. I bring these up simply to show you that the temperature problem is rather complex, and I should like very much to see some one who has the time and opportunity take up this matter and by riW of experiments determine the maximum temperature of the apple tree and our other growing plants as well. I sus - that on the plains here we are often very much closer to the maximum than we suppose. Under this same head— the relation of heat to the plant — we may deal with the subject of freezing, which is simply the destruction caused by passing far enough below the minimum. The minimum temperature of a plant is merely the temperature; below which there is no activity, but you generally have to go a good ways below that before you come to the danger point. For barley 41 is the minimum; now you may run down a long way before you come to the freezing point for barley. I don't know where you would have to go, for it will stand almost any - thing. In the case of the apple tree you would not have to go so far, and we Men to have determined the danger point for certain parts of peach trees. When we pass above the maximum temperature, we come very quickly to the danger point. When you pass beyond 115 degrees for the pumpkin, you dare go but very little further before death will result. In the case of the apple tree we have one illustration of the application of this excessive temperature. This matter of sun-scald that you have been talking about I think is referable directly to this very thing that I speak of now. When the temperature runs above this maximum, which is undetermined as yet for the apple tree, that portion of the </seg>
            <seg id="p047">39 PHYSIOLOGY OF THE APPLE TREE. tree which has gone above this maximum temperature is killed simply by the excessive heat. Scientific horticulturists of the east are very, very doubtful about this matter of sun-scald. They think it is referable to all sorts of other things and not at all to the excessive heat with which the sun beats down upon the stem. As I have just said, I hope to see ez{&gt;eriiiients made which will show conclusively what the maximum feempenfofe for the apple tree is, also the temperature reached by stems of trees under the direct rays of the sun. The relation of light, as a physical agent, to the tree may be summed up in this: First, light is absolutely essential to the formation of starch. The green parts of a plant, the leaves and the green twigs, cannot make starch and sugar, and the solid matters which constitute the bulk of 'the dry part of a plant, unless there be light. And so in the west, where we ha\ much sunlight — probably twice as much as they have in the same latitude in the east — we have an especial advantage, and our trees, unless neglected, are usually so grown that the 1' have abundant access to light. It is but rarely that I have seen orchards planted so near together that the leaves are starved for want of light. Let me put that in another way. The leaf must have the sun shining upon it, or it must be in strong diffused light. There is such a thing as diffused daylight which is' almost as bright as sunshine itself. But if you try to grow one plant on this table in the back part of the room and another there in the window, you will find that the plant in the window - will thrive, while in spite of everything you can do the leaves of this one on the table will turn yellow. The fact is these leaves are starved because they cannot make the starch and sugar which they need. Second, light as related to the color of fruit. Our western fruits should be better colored because they have an abundance of light. The light first produces an intense green in the young fruit, and then later this is broken up, and from this green the other colors are made. </seg>
            <seg id="p048">40 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. The third physical condition is of the utmost importance, and that is the humidity of the ai)-; the state of the air with respect to the amount of moisture in it. If a tree grows in a moist air it loses but little water through its leaves. Remember that a leaf is a porous thing; a green, flat organ whose purpose is to lake in gases, and out of these gases to make food-matter for the plant. This is the purpose of the leaf. The leaf must have pores in order that these gases may come in; the leaf must be wet in order that when the gases come into the leaf they may be absorbed by the moisture there. But, unfortunately, if nature punctures the skin of the leaf so that the gases may come in, moisture goes out; and so if the air be dry the leaf is con - stantly leaking out moisture, and this is where the trouble comes. The drier the air the greater the requirement that the tree should have for access to water. If you should put two trees, one in a great bell jar, and one in the open air, you would find that the one in the bell jar would require very much less water than the one in the open air, simply because the leaves in the open air are like a wet handkerchief put out to dry, — the mois - ture goes out. And yet the leaf must not be allowed to lose its proper amount of moisture. If an ounce of water goes out through a bunch of leaves, an ounce must come in from the stem, and ultimately from the roots, to keep the leaves turgid. How much water does a tree lose? I am not going to depend on my own observations here; 111 not ask you to take my word for it. A German by tli&lt;&gt; name of^Pfaff some years ago made a very careful study of the amount of water lost by a small oak tree, a close-topped, round-topped tree about the shape of an apple tree, and about 20 feet high. This was done in Ger - many where the climate is much less dry than here, and of course you know the structure of the oak loaf, it is harder even than the leaf of our ordinary apple tree. So that it is safe to say that the figures he gave for the oak will be exceeded even in Germany by an apple tree of similar size, and much exceeded if brought into Nebraska. He began the 17th of May. The </seg>
            <seg id="p049">PHYSIOLOGY OF THE APPLE TREE. 41 remainder of the month of May that tree evaporated between seven and eight barrels of water. That is, the amount of water that went off through the leaves was between seven and eight barrels. That means that the tree in those fourteen days must have pumped sp from the ground between seven and eight barrels of water. Then in June just about 200 barrels were lost by evaporation through the leaves; in July 250 barrels; in August 17.") barrels; in September 150 barrels; in October a little less than 150 barrels. If you foot these up yen will see that you have between nine hundred and a thousand barrels of water lost by evaporation from the leaves of this tree. I have no doubt but that a common apple tree 20 feet high in Ne - braska in an average season — because our season begins a great deal earlier — will lose close to 1,500 barrels of water through its leaves. The water is streaming out, evaporating, day and night, so that the total loss is something astounding. How does this loss take place? That is, how does your apple tree lose the water? As I have suggested, every leaf has little pores (stomaia) through which gas is taken in. When the tree is active in the sunlight, making its starch and sugar, these pores are open and the moist air streams out, resulting in water loss now under consideration. One difficulty with the growth of many plants on the plains is this excessive water loss, and one thing that we must do if we would prevent that is to cut off the wind. When Mr. Harrison makes a wicker cage around his seedlings he is simply cutting off the dry wind which drives across the plains and sucks up the moisture. Some have the idea that it is a good thing for the tree to have this water loss, but I want to say to you gentlemen, that it is not a good thing for a tree to have to drink so many barrels of water in order to make up what goes off through the leaves. It is much better for the tree if you can prevent this excessive water loss. Now, briefly, let us consider the movements of the apple tree. I bring this topic in, not because it has any practical signifi - cance to you, but I think that if not poets ourselves, we should </seg>
            <seg id="p050">42 NEBRASKA STATB HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. have a little of the poet's instinct in looking at the trees. We should love the trees, instead of looking at them simply as things that ue going to bring us dollars and cents. The apple tree has motion. It is not a thing that just stands up and waits for the winds to bend it this way and that. It moves. It does not move as rapidly as tome of you, but you do not all move with equal rapidity. Sonic of you are "quick as a flash'' and others move very slowly indeed. Just intensify that difference, and you will finally come down to the slowness of motion of the tree. Let me tell you two or three things: When a twig grows it doesn't grow straight up as you migh 4 : push a rod; it sways back and forth as it grows. It is not the wind which bends it, but it bends itself, swinging this way and that way. If you don't believe it. all you have to do is to take a little tree and bring it into the greenhouse where it will be out of the wind. and then fasten a stick so it will be directly over the center &gt;f the tree. You will find that the twig will not remain directly under the utick, but will swing from one side to the other. Then the roots are doing the same thing. The root of an apple tree, instead of pushing along as the plow point pushes through the ground when propelled by the team, acts more like the common fish worm, which goes along bending this way and that. In the same way, only very much more slowly, the roots of the apple tree are. as we might say, ''nosing'" their way through the soil. The root does not push constantly ahead, but bends just a little this way and that, and this bending enables it, when it conn's to an obstacle, to slip round it. The leaves — as everybody knows, but everybody forgets — have a sensitiveness as to light, and change their positions with respect to light. Suppose I am standing here (as I frequently do in the morning at eight o'clock, when I have a class in this room), and the sun comes streaming in through that window, blinding me; I move away because the light is there, and / am sensitive to the light. The leaves of the apple tree also are sensitive to light, and put themselves in definite positions with </seg>
            <seg id="p051">43 PHYSIOLOGY OF THE APfLE TREE. reference to light. You take a twig that is standing in an up right position, and bend it down so that the leaves are upside down, and fasten it there with a string, and go about your business. If you come back next day you will see that the leaves have begun to turn themselves; the day after, you will find 'them turned more, until finally the leaves which were upside down will have bent themselves around so they stand with their proper faces up. As you go along the south side of a tree you will notice that the leaves, arrange thcmsclvi they are all looking towards the sun. As I have looked at such trees it has reminded me of the way the windows look in some places in the south. As you go by a house there well be sixteen or seventeen children all trying to look out of the window to see the stranger passing, and they will all arrange themselves so that each can have a peep. The leaves of a tree do the same thing. When you have a window full of children looking out of the different jtanes, and they have adjusted theniselvi they can all see out, you say they "adjust themselves." You have the same thing in the leaves. They fit themselves in, in some way, so they can all have a peep at the light, and this is done by a movement of the leaves. Irritability, or responsiveness to touch. Of this there is but very little apparent in the apple tree. And yet I dare not say that the apple tree when I touch it does not feel my touch. There are common plants, as you know, that feel your touch. The little sensitive plant when you touch it immediately re - sponds. In other words, it feels your touch. The apple tree apparently has but very little of this sensitiveness to touch. W« now come to the last topic, reproduction. Reproduction in the vegetable kingdom divides itself into two kinds: M* - srxtuil and sexual. Non-sexual reproduction always results in the same kind of thing. When you let a sucker grow up from a root, the sucker will have the characteristics and qualities of that root. If you take a part of the tree, a scion, and use it as a graft it produces the same kind of thing. By careful </seg>
            <seg id="p052">44 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL 8OCIBTT. treatment yon can make a cutting produce roots, but you pro - duce the same kind of tree always. If you take a bud it is nothing but a piece of the tree you had to start with, and it produces exactly the same thing again. These are all nou - sexual methods of reproduction, and the only natural one is simply by sprouting from the root; in the others we have taken advantage of the fact that a tree can be cut up artificially and grafted or budded into other trees. Passing to sexual reproduction. This is the kind of reproduc - tion that brings in variations, and it is to it that the attention of scientific horticulturists should be directed. I am not saying here that every man who is following horticulture for a liveli - hood should become an experimenter in an expensive way; yon can't afford it. Yet as soon as any one of you finds himself in such a position that he can resort to this last method of pro - ducing trees he should do so. Remember that every absolutely new plant comes from a seed. As long as you use cuttings and scions and buds from old trees you are simply propagating what you have. When, however, you make a union of the male cell {pollen) and the female cell (which in these days we are call - ing the egg), you have the beginning of a really new indis-idual, and that new individual will partake of the qualities of the two parents from which the two cells were derived. There is no theory about this; it is a fact well known in science. So if you would study your trees as carefully as Mr. Elmendorf studies his cattle, and would say "this tree has qualities that I like, and that one has qualities that I like,'" and would bring about a union between these two, you would get a definite result in breeding trees, just as you do in the case of breeding between two animals whose qualities you know. This is not "untried theory 1 ' at all. The florists have accomplished a great deal in the developing of new varieties, especially among the orchids and lilies. They may have two orchids that are very beautiful and they wonder what would be the result of bringing them together. One is fertilized with the other and the result is the starting of a new </seg>
            <seg id="p053">45 PHYSIOLOGY OF THB APPLE TREE. kind which is neither this one nor that one, bat a combination of the two. I should like to see this method followed in the breeding of the apple tree, and I wish you men would speak in thunder tones in favor of work of this kind in the experiment stations. I am fully convinced that this kind of work should be done in the stations, rather than continually testing the value of varieties, new or old. It would be folly for me to urge you as men who are using this business for a livelihood to turn aside and see what you can do in this matter, but you are all deeply interested and you can help the station workers. You can help select the parent stock; that is, you say: "This variety of apple has certain qualities in it that we would like to see com - bined with that variety." If you would all help in this matter, not by doing but by thinking, there is no question but that the development of the apple will make as much progress as the development of our fine stock. DISCUSSION. Mr. Camp — I would like to ask the professor if using clover is not the best way of supplying trees with nitrogen? Dr. Bessey — That is a very good way indeed. Mr. Camp — Is it not the best way? Dr. Bessey — I couldn't say about that. It might be a good idea to put some manure on the ground in the orchard, too. Mr. Godfrey — In reading on this subject I read that clover, as this gentleman speaks of, is a good thiii}; because the roots go down deep and draw up water and thus help the orchard. I turn around and take up another scientific document and read that it is th« very worst thing a man can use, because it absorbs the water and injures the orchard. Another thing, in this location it will invite in and support gophers until it will make the head of a young man in infancy turn gray. Alfalfa is the same thing, only worse. Mr. Yodxgers — In reply to the question in regard to clover, I am satisfied that it is an injury to the orchard because it </seg>
            <seg id="p054">46 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. absorbs the water. We have decided on thorough cultivation. I am sj»eaking now of our irrigated orchards where we irrigate three times and cultivate fourteen times during the season. We are right in a good clover country and have plenty of water, and if it were a good thing to do we certainly would seed to clover and save all that cultivation. I am satisfied from our experience that clover or anything else which robs a tree of moisture is an injury to the tree in Nebraska. I don't know so much about the eastern portion of the state, but in the por - tion where I live and in the western portion I think we should take no more moisture from the tree than we can help. Mr. Wiirrriiitn — My experience lias been in the eastern part of the state. I have an old orchard of eight a&lt; i-es that was seeded to clover. My plan was to use the first cutting of clover as a mulch, and allow the second crop to seed and go back into the ground. In that way I had an abundant growth of new clover each spring, and as long as I kept this up the orchard did remarkably well; it was very prolific, bore good fruit and lots of it. But finally I got a little short of pasture and the clover in the orchard was fed down in the fall and the Med was lost so there was no new clover coming on the next Bpring, ronsec|uently the blue grass began coming in a little. Then I busy putting out new orchards, patches of small fruits and such as that, and the old orchard was neglected. And as the clover became mixed with blue grass I could notice that the fruit began to get smaller and smaller as the clover disap peared and the blue grass increased, until finally last year it became completely sodded with blue grass and I had no fruit at all — the first time since that orchard commenced bearing. But the coming spring I intend to get that old orchard back into cultivation again. The only way to get any profit out of that eight acres of old orchard is to destroy that blue grass and get the orchard back into cultivation. i But in order to do that it was necessary to do some very severe pruning. The trees had been allowed to branch near the ground and had </seg>
            <seg id="p055">47 PHYSIOLOGY OF THE APPLE TREE. ■pread out until it was impossible to get anywhere near them with a team and implement. So I went in and trimmed those trees vcrv severely with a view to getting in there the coming spring and breaking up that ground and getting it back into cul - tivation. I would like to inquire if that pruning will seriously injure the trees. Mi:. Yoin&lt;;ei{s — I will say that I saw an on-hard right near Genera that was severely pruned, and that orchard has Beret rerovered. A professional tree butcher canic along and trimmed it according to notions he lyxl from trimming trees back in Vermont, and he trimmed it in true Yankee fashion; he trimmed it to a finish. Mm. Whitford — I believe in what Mr. Youngers has said here in regard to cultivating. That is the reason I pruned that old orchard so as to get in shape that I could cultivate it. I don't believe in a dry season there is anything that equals the earth mulch for trees, plants, or anything. Mi!. Bamako — 1 think the experience of Mr. Whitford is the best kind of an argument against using anything in the orchard. Man is a selfish &lt; feature, and if the orchard grows hay he will take it; if it doesn't make a erop of hay he will turn the hogs in. If you have to cultivafe the orchard to keep the w&lt; down, you will get a crop of fruit and the trees will do well. Mit. IIkni&gt;ki&lt; ks — I would like to ask Mr. Youngers why it is so much more disastrous to prune trees in Nebraska than in the &lt;'astern states. There I have seen trees cut right off; the tops cut off and grafted. Mi:. YoUMSnu — We need every leaf we get here to protect th«: tree from the intense heat. (Ji kstiox — Then you wouldn't advise much pruning? Mi:. Toumnm — No. sir; all the pruning we do is done with a knife. Where the limbs (toss, we remove them with a pruning knife.

I spent three summers in Colorado, traveling over most of the fruit-raising part of the state, and I noticed that the fruit crop is surer and the fruit better as you pass up the valleys until you come almost to the highest point at which fruit will grow at all and ripen in the season. At an elevation of about 6,000 feet apple trees will not bear and ripen fruit; the season is too short. Lower down in the valleys it gets ex - cessively hot in the summer, but as you go up pretty nearly to the height at which fruit will do at all, the fruit will be better and the trees healthier than lower down the valleys. I noticed that in a number of valleys. The choicest portion of a valley for fruit growing is always pretty high up. Mr. Yovngers — Have you noticed any change in the time of ripening up in the higher altitudes? Member — Yes, sir; I have. Mr. Youngeks — The reason I ask is that I have seen Yellow Transparent in perfect condition picked off the tree in Septem - ber; usually they are ripe in August. The Wealthy, grown in that altitude, will keep until Christmas. NEW VARIETIES OF APPLES. The. above is an old subject, retaining its importance to th»; public and to the orchardist, especially to those who expect to plant in the future. . My experience has been too limited to Bpeak with the assurance and confidence that the occasion demand*. On the basis that many littles make greats, I submit in brief as far as I am convinced. Many new varieties have been brought into public notice in the last ten years. In the department of horticulture that I have charge of there are growing two hundred varieties, but few are beginning to fruit. I count one hundred of these as J. P. JACKSON, GLENWOOD, IOWA. </seg>
            <seg id="p057">49 NEW VARIETIES OF Ari'LES. ('Specially new varieties, consequently my knowledge of these is limited. Through information from various noun-en I have opinions, with but few conclusions. In southwestern Iowa we have perhaps :{"&gt; of the Russian varieties, out of which I could not recommend more than four or five for this lection, although- 1 am satisfied that quite a num - ber would prove valuable for the north and west, — Minnesota. Dakota, and Wisconsin. The Yellow Transparent and Tetofsky are of about equal value, both twig-blight more or less, and are not as good as some of our old sorts. The Raspberry apple is a good bearer, but twig-blights, and poor quality. Longfteld is a good bearer, but twig-blights; not extra good in quality. The Wealthy is one of our best fall varieties and a good bearer. Wolf Kiver and I'tter's Red are flue apples, but not profitable; neither of them are prolific, but quality fairly good, especially I'tter's Red. Yet 1 would not recommend them for general planting. Missouri Pippin is utterly valueless, as it blights itself to death in a short time. York Imperial, Mammoth Blank Twig, and the Arkansas Black are three promising varieties. The (Jano is a good apple, but wo near the Hen Davis that I would plant the Hen Davis in preference, as the (lano is smaller and no better in tree or quality of fruit. The Huntsman and Salome are worthy of further test, Pewaukee not profitable. Hatcher is promising, but not sufficiently tested to warrant extensive planting. Babbitt is also promising, but it has in a measure dropped out of sight, yet I believe it worthy of further test. The Peerless from Minnesota, llenifin from Illinois, and Hitill and Smokes (Jarden (lem from New Jersey are promising in tree, seem to be perfectly hardy, and do not blight, yet they are in the experimental stage.

H&lt;&gt;&lt;;(; — Sine*' our friend from Iowa has sat down so hard on the Missouri Pippin I must raise my voice in its defense. If I were planting an orchard today one half of the plant would be Missouri Pippin. I would plant them in rows :{() by 16 feet, and everv other tree would be Missouri Pippin. In 18M I planted an orchard and a few of the trees failed to grow; in replacing in ls'.n I happened to net some Missouri Pippin. I didn't know what they were, had never seen one in my life, but I planted them, and in 1§M I picked a half bushel of apples to the tree from them and since then they have been bearing every year. They are as tine an apple as the Wine Sap and a good keeper. The trees are said to be short-lived and subject to blight. That I don't know; I haven't grown them long enough; but by planting them in alternating rows with other varieties, if they should prove to be short lived they can be cut out and still leave your orchard 30 by :V2 feet. Hut by all means in Nebraska plant the Missouri Pippin; they will pay you for cultivating your orchard while you are waiting on the other trees to come into bearing. Mr. Y(Hm;ers — We know that it isn't a short-lived tree from the fact that Mr. Harris, of Tecumseh, has Missouri Pippin between twenty and twenty -rive years old thai are still in full bearing. That was his report at our last meeting. Jin. Van Kiiek — In planting my orchard I was induced to try the Missouri Pippin. It was said to come into bearing early, and as I was anxious to get some fruit as soon as possible 1 planted UMI trees of them. They were as tine nursery trees as I ever set out. and the first two years they grew finely; I never saw trees do better. The next year they began to look bad; the leaves turned black and dropped off early in the fall, and the next spring some of them showed signs of dying.

I concluded it wouldn't pay to go on with those Missouri Pippins as I would have nothing but a bare spot in their place while the other trees of the orchard were growing up. so I cut them all out. Mr. Yager — I would like to have some one tell me whether the Ben Davis and Gano are the same thing. I would like to hear from those who have grown both varieties in Iowa and on this side; what results have been with the Gano as compared with the Ben Davis. Mr. Raymond — My experience with the Gano covers a period of* perhaps fifteen years. In planting an orchard of Ben Davis there happened to be three or four Gano trees mixed with them.

In recent years, however, there has gradually been developed a </seg>

Comparing the climate of central and western Nebraska with Colorado, the elevation is less, the climate apparently as favorable, water for irrigation more cheaply obtained, and more easily taken out and spread upon the lands. Prior to the use of water in irrigating most orchards planted in the western portions of the state had suffered seriously from the occasional drouths. Orchards planted under irrigation, how - ever, are rapidly coming forward with promise of success and profit. The soil in the valleys in the western portion of the state is very fertile, and railroad facilities excellent in the greater por - tion of the district. The Loup rivers, being fed largely by springs and varying but little in the amount of water carried through the season, furnish a very steady flow of water. In addition to the smaller canals utilizing their waters in the local valleys, companies like the Great Eastern are planning to con - duct the never-failing waters of the Loups, Beaver Creek, Bad others well into the central portion of the state, covering the county north and northwest of Columbus. In the Platte valley the Hershey and Paxton orchard has been very successful. This orchard was planted by two large landowners witty the thought of demonstrating that in addi - tion to growing large crops of farm products fruit could also be grown with certainty and in profitable quantities. In this neighborhood 4he Hostetter orchard, now owned by Mr. Phe - nice, is yielding abundant crops of fruit and small fruits. Stim - ulated by the success of these parties, Mr. W. L. Park, assistant superintendent of the Union Pacific, has planted an apple or - chard of some thirty acres. Mr. Connor, road master of the same system, has a very flourishing orchard, and Mr. H. Otten a large orchard. These have been followed by Mr. Isaac Dillon, I). </seg>

EARLY HEARING. It should be noticed with interest in the behavior of tjiese western orchards growbg under initiation that the apple tree comes into bearing earlier than in the eastern portion of the state. Mr. Lute Wilcox, editor of Field and Farm, of Denver, and author of an excellent work on irrigation, reports that fruit trees come into bearing younger in all irrigated districts and that annual crops of fruit are more likely to be secured under irrigation than in orcharding under natural rainfall. The bright sun and more rapid evaporation incident to the elevated lands of the western portion of the state of Colorado, and of Idaho, whose conditions and climate are somewhat like those of western Nebraska, evidently check the growth of fruit trees in midsummer and en use the development of fruit buds. Rapid evaporation, pinching drouth, and shortage of moisture can be made to occur at any time in any part of the season by withholding water from the soil; hence the checking of the growth of the trees, the development of fruit buds, the ripening of the wood of the tree, are practically under the control of the planter who applies water or withholds it in accord with his judgment. With the use of a judicious amount of water, supplemented by frequent cultivation, which has been aptly described as the very best part of irrigation, trees when young make a very excellent growth and in a comparatively brief time are large enough to yield fruit in commercial quantities. To illustrate: In the orchard of Hershey and Paxton, in Lin - coln county. Hen Davis apple trees, seven years planted, yielded one barrel to the tree. The same trees in the eighth year yielded two barrels to single trees. In the fall of 18M in the orchard of H. Otten, of Lincoln county, apple trees making the fourth season's growth gave a promising show of fruit. In the same </seg>

Results under initiation show that, given a fertile soil and an abundance of water, growth of tree, develojuneiit of fruit buds, production of fruit, ripening of the tree to be in condition to withstand winter, all these processes are under the control of the skillful plaster, and his orchard becomes more like a factory with definite anil positive results than like orcharding under the usual methods in localities depending on natural rainfall. The late Orange Judd accounts for the extreme fertility of the valleys and table lands, of the west by explaining that the pro - s of nature which have been going on for countless ages have developed and stored up very large supplies of plant food, and the arid condition of the country was such that this plant food, stored in the soil, was neither utilized nor leached- awav. but has accumulated in unusual abundance. On this theory he accounts for the growth of &lt;;o bushels of wheat per acre in Montana. These conditions apply with the same force to or - charding in soils that have stored up an abundance of plant food ready for use when proper conditions were supplied to make this plant food available. This doubtless in a measure accounts for the large size and excellent quality of orchard products grown with the help of irrigation on western lands. Toupled with these natural advantages, through lines of rail way with fast freight trains, refrigerator car service already established, give unusually advantageous outlets to markets either east or west. With all these natural and acquired ad - vantage* there is promise that in the near future these dis - tricts under irrigation will be heard from as among the most promising portions of the state for commercial orcharding. While the farmer who desires simply a supply of fruit for family use will doubtless plant his fruit trees conveniently near his home, the commercial orchardist, on the other hand. LOCATION. </seg>

He will avoid soils strong alkaline, seeking for choice deep, rich, loamy soils with an abundant and sure supply of water, or he will select nbirtigated lands which are to be found either side of most streams and rivers. In main places the elevation of valley land above water level is about (J or S to 10 feet. Along the IMatte the river is highest in May and June. The receding waters of July and August, until finally the bed is dry. give increasing depth to water level and insure the proper riiH'ning of orchard trees. In selecting a location for an orchard in the matter of lia - bility to late spring frost, the fact that the IMatte river is in most of its length from half a mile to a mile in width renders the lands on the south side of the channel slightly more immune from frosts than lands a distance away from the river on the north side. In some cases, also, ditches have been led out from rivers and carried along the sides of the valleys or over higher lands, gaining a considerable elevation over the lowest river valley. To illustrate: The Sutherland ditch at the point where it cuts through the ridge is fi."i fed above the river, and orchards located close up under the line of this ditch are likely to be more nearly immune from frost than those located in the cen - ter of the valley. Oft-times a difference in elevation of I'O to 40 feet has been found useful in guarding against late spring freezes. In the selection of locations, the orchard will be much more easily irrigated if on lands nearly level or with a gentle slope. There is less liability to wash and lose control of the water in irrigating. The work of planting an orchard is very much the same as in any other district, save that it is useful as soon as trees are planted and before they are completely tilled in. to conduct a stream of water along each row that the soil may be completely settled and thoroughly moistened. </seg>
            <seg id="p068">60 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. In the early work of irrigating orchards and small fruit plantations methods are sometimes crude, wasteful of water, and the water is often irregularly applied. The method of oj&gt;ening the bank of the lateral with a spade and turning out for the rows a suitable amount is ojk'U to the difficulty that often those channels gutter, too much water runs to certain rows, the soil perhaps is Hooded or washed away, while other rows may not receive enough. To overcome this difficulty Mr. David Hunter, of Sutherland, makes a quantity of boxes long enough to reach through the bank of the lateral, in dimensions 2 or .'{ inches deep by 4 in width inside, with gains on the inside of the sluice boxes admitting the use of a paddle shaped gate which he is able to raise or lower at will and set the flow to just the right amount of water. In this way just the amount needed can be turned in for 50 or 100 rows at a time. A small amount can be turned on and allowed to run all night. With the exception of a very loose soil or gravel, the preferable way seems to be to turn on a small amount, to apply slowly, allow - ing the water to run a considerable period of time and to water by seepage rather than to attempt to lessen the time by turning in a large amount for a few hours. Bj having permanent boxes for each and every row a whole orchard can be irrigated at one time with but little trouble, using absolutely just the right amount of water. Mr. Carsten Truelsen. of Hherman county, has his orchard of 18 acres under a ditch. The main ditch is 11 feet above the level of the prin - cipal fields and house. The ground slopes quickly to the level to the fields and then has an easy, uniform, natural grade. No leveling was necessary. Using sluice boxes of the same char - acter as those used by Mr. Hunter, and boring a J-inch auger hole in the paddle gate, he finds that this amount of water in ;?G hours would seep from end to end of rows GO rods long, and being supplied in this equable, careful manner he secures excellent results. This method of irrigating applied to a corn - field has been found by Mr. Truelsen to cost 60 cents per acre. The average price paid for water is from fl to f 1.25 per acre. </seg>
            <seg id="p069">OBCHABDfNQ UNDER IRRIGATION. 61 A word of caution should be girta in regard to the us*' of too. much water. When too inuch water is used leaves turn from I bright green to a paler hue, then to a yellow color, de - cay begins, and the leaves finally drop from the tree. From the excessive use of water the land becomes soggy, heavy, aeration is prevented, and root-growth hindered. A convenient method of judging whether irrigation is needed is to remove tive or six inches of the soil. If the ground at that depth will pack in the hand, irrigation is not needed. Frequent cultivation with a smaller amount of water gives the best possible results. It is better to irrigate an orchard just planted three times the first season, and with age perhaps the same orchard will not require irrigation more than twice in a season. As soon as the ground is dry enough after irrigating, cultivation should always start, for the reason that weeds start with great vigor. The land also is inclined to bake, to become crusted, and then lose moisture rapidly from evaporation. One of the most successful orchards noticed was watered three times and cultivated thirteen times the first season. The vigor and growth of the trees was phenomenal. Fruit trees for our central and western counties should be trained with low heads to guard against liability to hail and also sunscald. An excellent method of guarding the tree against both hail and sunscald is to use four or five corn - stalks cut to 24 to 90 inches in length and tied top and bottom to the trunk of the tree. This lessens evaporation from the bark of the trunk and guards against rabbits. Trees so pro - tected are found to do much better than those without. With a little looking after and adjusting the strings these stalks should last two years. In the late fall, after farmers are through using water from the streams in the growing of their crops, there is usHally an abundance of water in the ditches. If at this time, that is, in the first half of November, the soil of the orchard is thoroughly saturated, the work can be done when the water is not in de- </seg>

It may be noted with interest that during the season of 185)8 many of our eastern orchards failed to set a paying crop of fruit, in the opinion of most ordiardists due to too much rain - fall at period of blooming In the central and western coun - ties, with the greater elevation, less rainfall, greater Bomber of sunny days, the apple crop was particularly abundant and trees were loaded to the ground.

Tin: PuHDBKT — 1 notice that we can go south until we are practically out of what we call sunscald. which proves to me that it is done in the winter. I also notice that the most dan gerous time is just when the trees are coining into bearing, before they have borne one heavy crop. After the trees have borne a heavy crop the limbs are bent down so as to protect the trunks of the trees from the rays of the sun in winter. That has been my observation in regard to sunscald. Mit.

On an island south of Gibbon there are i&gt;each trees that are still healthy that have been planted nineteen years. been in bearing sixteen years, and produced twelve full crops of fruit daring the sixteen years. There are apple orchards in the same neighborhood doing well, getting their moisture from irrigation. Dr. Bessey — I should like to ask Mr. Stephen! if there has not been great progress made in fruit growing under irrigation in Deuel, Cheyenne, and Beott'i Bluff counties? Mr. Stephens — I am unable to answer the question fully. In Denel county Mr. A. Zufall. a German living about north of Julesburg, has been mining peaches for two years. He has also raised tine plums, probably the Lombard, and his apple orchard is thrifty. A neighlwir of his on the bench lands, also under irrigation, has a very thrifty orchard, his apple Item commenc - ing to bear at the age of two years. His peach orchard is thrifty looking, and everything about it looks as though it would be a success. I think we are going to be mistaken in regard to the capacity of that country. Dr. Bessey — A little over a year ago, on a trip I made for botanical (not horticultural) purposes. I was on the north side of the river from Scott's Bluff eastward some twenty miles, and I saw there a great many apple trees and cherry trees. I did not have time to inquire about them, as I was in a great hurry, but it seems to me that the Society ought to send a missionary up then' to find out who is growing those trees. The trees are fine looking, and I susi&gt;ect that we shall suddenly wake up to the fact that they have there a good apple region at least, and perhaps a good cherry region. I didn't see any peach trees. </seg>
            <seg id="p073">65 THE APPLE IN ITS RELATION TO CLIMATE. THE APrLE IN ITS RELATION TO CLIMATE. The far-reaching influence of climate upon horticulture, while Rlways rmofilfd in its broader effects, is seldom fully appreci - ated in its minute tendencies. Tropical, semi-tropical, and tem - perate zones fix certain poorly -denned but none the less impas - sable limits to the distribution of all fruits. Yet temperature is not the only element which contributes to the limitation of classes of vegetation. Professor Itailey, in discussing the gi - ography of fruit-growing as an introduction to the book entitled "Principles of Fruit-Growing," mentions four determining fac - tors which go to make up the adaptability of a fruit region; these four are temperature, moisture, soil, and parasites. Of these, tenpentwe and moisture are part of the climate and the parasites are greatly influenced by the climate. These fac - tors influence the distribution of plants upon the earth and determine in a measure what groups can be grown in a given region. Some plants are able to adopt themselves to a wide range of conditions, others to a narrow one; the one group be comes widely diffused, the other is confined to a limited field. The apple is a plant of wide distribution in both the tempera t" zones, following civilization wherever it goes. Not only does climate limit the distribution of a given fruit to certain regions of the globe, but it lays a firm and guiding hand on its development in different parts of that region. The horticultural flora is naturally first to respond to this influence and to show its effects in the varieties which are produced and which succeed in any locality. Hence it happens that the his - tory of a given fruit is largely moulded by the influence of climate. This has been remarkably true in the development of American pomology. The European grape refused to cross the Atlantic and make its home on the bleak shores of New PUOFBSSOU FRED W. CARD. </seg>
            <seg id="p074">66 NEBIIASKA STATE HOBTlCXJLTUtlAL SOCIETV. England, and as a result our forefather! were obliged to n^t from the woods the foundation stock upon which the grape industry of the present day is built. The same tiling, in a modified way. was true of the European gooscbcnj, and it is interesting to note that in each of these cases it was the para site factor which caused the immediate failure of the species. The European plum did cross the Atlantic but could not be induced with grace to cross the Mississippi valley and make its hone ujhhi the plains. The European raspberry lost heart and in pining for its old home failed to jjrasp the oppor - tunity laid before it; its American sister, therefore, stepped into the place which would have been accorded to it. Vet all of these fruits seem to have found a congenial home when car - ried to the oceanward slopes of the far west. The apple, unlike the others, sturdily set out to adapt itself to its new surround ings and has followed the tide of immigration across the plains, up the slopes of the Rockies, over their summits and into the valleys beyond, spreading its branches and scattering its fruit wherever it has gone. Hut even with it the influence of climate is none the less manifest, though less radical in its effects. The varieties bronght from the mother country were soon re - placed by seedlings of American origin, and these iu turn gave place to others as planting extended to regions which made different and more exacting demands. These climatic conditions influence not only the distributioi of varieties but the whole iield of practical culture, from tin planting of the tree to the marketing of the crop. These facts are generally recognised by growers in the plains, but recent observations have served to emphasise some of them in niv owi mind in a way not hitherto so fully appreciated. To begii with the matter of planting; experiments made in Rhode Islam during the past year hare shown that, under the conditions o soil -moisture and atmospheric humidity present,' planting In almost any method proved successful. Not only did trees treate&lt; by the "Btringfellow method," in which roots and tops were </seg>

In fact, not a tree was lost by any of the methods used and all made good growth. In Nebraska, on the other hand, both of these methods gave much loss, the latter one jrreater than the former. It may be added that in both places the method which gave best results was the one which left all sound roots intact, just as they came from the nursery, and merely reduced the tops by shortening the branches. Tin* greater evaporation on the plains makes it more essential that the amount of leaf surface, from which moisture can escape, be limited to correspond in a measure with the reduction iu root surface caused by transplanting. Greater care must also be ex ercised to see that every operation is done in the best possible manner. In pruning, the practice upon the plains must again ditTer from that at the sea coast. While iu the east the moist atmos - phere, smaller amount of sunshine, and prevalence of fiiiifji rea - der it essential that the greatest amount of mnlight and air should be admitted to the tree in order that the fruit may at tain color and flavor and better resist the attacks of fugi, on the plains the low humidity, intense ranlight, and comparative absence of funp render pruning less essential and demand that, it should be practiced with more moderation. It may 1m-, loo. that if we better understood the laws which govern the production of fruit buds and the treatment which would best favor their proper development, we should find that here also methods would need to differ. Unfortunately, this is a point upon which we know little. The relation of climate to methods of soil management, and the consequent necessity of frequent surface tillage as a means of mitigating drought, is too well understood to need mention here further than to correlate it as one of the influences of cli - mate upon apple-grow inc. </seg>
            <seg id="p076">68 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. The effect of climate upon the enemies which attack fruits has already been mentioned, vet the importance of this factor in shaping the trait-growing industry of a region is scarcely appreciated. The EurojK'an grape failed in the early pomology of our country, not beOMMK the climate was directly unconge - nial, but because the climatic and other conditions favored the development of the phylloxera and mildew, two of its worst enemies. So, too, the EurojK'an gooseberry fails from no lack of hardiness in our climate, but because conditions favor the development of its arch enemy, the mildew, and i&gt;erhaps tend to weaken its own constitution and render it more susceptible to attack. On Point Judith, in Rhode Island, potato-growing is a hazardous venture, because the nightly fogs contribute so much to the well-being of the rot-fungus that only by the most thorough and vigorous spraying can a crop be carried through to maturity. Likewise, plum-growing is practically banished from many points along the coast because the plum-rot fungus finds such congenial conditions for its development. On the plains the first of these diseases is unknown and the second a practical nonentity, but the apple-blight finds conditions espe - cially suited to its needs. As a result of this many otherwise valuable varieties of apple ■ are banished from the orchards of those who understand their susceptibility to this disease. For the same reason, in part, pear-growing is so unsuccessful in the state of Nebraska. Yet the apple-grower of New England scarcely thinks of the blight as a possible enemy to his trees, much less a dangerous one. Turning to insects, the apple - grower on the plains finds the codling-moth a much more se - rious enemy than does the eastern orchardist, because, owing to congenial summers, the insect is able to multiply once or eves twice more than it is accustomed to in the eastern states. Another instance of the influence of climate on the enemies of the apple-grower may be found in the case of birds, which under some circumstances prove so destructive to apples in the west, though the same species never think of touching apples in eastern orchards. </seg>
            <seg id="p077">THE APPLE IN ITS RELATION TO CLIMATE. 69 The influence exerted on the varieties found in a given region, either directly, owing to fitness or lack of adaptibility, or indi - rectly, owing to the favorable or unfavorable conditions for certain enemies, has already been touched upon but it needs to be emphasized. When criticised for not growing a better apple than the Hen I&gt;avis, the western grower replies tW long as the Hen Davis thrives better than any other and the market takes it at good prices that it is the apple for him to grow, which is merely saying, in effect, that climate has set apart that particular variety for his particular region and com - mitted to him the charge of growing it. But when the eastern grower, inspired by the success of his western brother, attempts to grow the Hen Davis in his locality, designed for a better one, he is missing his calling as completely as he would be in at - tempting to become a lawyer, when designed for a fruitgrower or to become a nurseryman when trained for an editor. That fact was most admirably illustrated on the tables of the Rhode Island Horticultural Society at a recent exhibition. There, among pears which were the embodiment of perfection in a pear and in company with the Rhode Island Greening, the Ualdwin, the Northern Spy, and others which represented the pink of perfection among apples, were ]M&gt;or little Hen Davis specimens so lacking in color and size that any Nebraska grower would have been ashamed to own them and would have scorned the idea of putting them upon exhibition tables. These s|K'cimens said as plainly as applet could say that the Rhode Island grower had no business with them for they did not be - long there. Since species and varieties respond to the demands of climate it is not surprising to find that quality, too, is largely governed by it. The Nebraska grower is slow to admit that the product of his orchard suffers when compared with that from other parts of the country. If told that the skin of the Nebraska apple is thicker and its Mesh drier he will doubtless maintain, with the loyalty of a true Xebraskan, that an apple needs a </seg>

Then he will set the chemist at work to prove that his apple is as good as the other one. which reminds us that the chemist has for years been en - deavoring to convince the cow that the butt of a cornstalk is just as good as many other things which she eats, notwith - standing the fact that the cow persists in showing her own preference. That the inlluence of climate should extend even to the matter of marketing, in such a staple crop as apples, is hardly to be expected, yet such is the case. When the Nebraska man says that an apple needs a thick skin and ought not to be too juicy he is not far from right in describing the apple which meets his demands, and the reason is obvious. He is acciis tomed to do things in a wholesale way. He would much rather grow ten barrels -of apples than live to obtain a given profit if he can do it with the same outlay. So, too, he is accustomed to deal in a wholesale market. He is situated far from the great centers of trade and he must have an apple which will stand rough usage and long shipments and still look showy and at - tractive. Hence the tough skin and leathery texture of his favorite Hen Davis serve him well. As to quality, it is an ftpple, and that is enough for many purchasers as well as grow - ers. Let him then not be envious of the man who can grow fruit of finer quality and secure the trade which demands it. Commercially speaking, he can do neither himself and should not begrudge the man who can. The delicate, thin skinned, fine-textured fruit of the one would no more meet the broad market and wholesale, rough and ready way of doing things of the other than would the coarser, jtoorer fruit of the latter sat isfy the critical market of the former. The all devouring general market which the l.en Davis enters always has existed and doubtless always will exist. Moreover, it probably consumes ten barrels of fruit where the other consumes one. What harm, then, if the Nebraska grower ships his fruit to New York and the New York grower ships part of bis to Nebraska? It is but </seg>

Mit. YomtGBM — I think the reason the Hen Davis doesn't thrive in Rhode Island is because the state is so small. (Laugh - ter.) When the professor says in that paper that the European plan does not adapt itself to Nebraska, he is mistaken. It is overcoming any weakness it might have by coming in contact witli the roagh and ready west. At least I have seen BpecimeM of the (Jreen (Jage. Imperial &lt;Jage, (iernian Prune, and such types roaring from Columbus, and frequently during the expo - sition I had in the neighborhood of 180 or IM baskets of them at a time. I never saw an orchard loaded any heavier than one I visited in Washington county, and 1 have seen them at Mast ings and as far west as Kearney. J think the protessor is not very well informed about the European plum in Nebraska. We also have as tine a lot of Japanese plums as an grows anywhere, and we know that the gooseberry will thrive abundantly under irrigation. I'p at Fort Morgan, and all over the state of Colo rado wherever they have plenty of water, the Industry plants are loaded down, and they grow as tine gooseberries as they grow in England or anywhere else. If the Ben Davis can't adapt itself to that country. I believe that their fruits will adapt them - selves to this country. Tiik Puksipent — I enjoyed Professor Cards paper very much. During his stay of five years in Nebraska I must say he has made many warm friends among horticulturists, and has done seme marked work in his line. His work on Codling Moth has brought new light and created new Iiojm'H of wiping the enemy out. I feel free to say in behalf of the Society that it is with Borrow that we fail to hear his pleasant voice and see his unit - ing countenance in this meeting. However. I think he is and always has been a little prejudiced in favor of the east. — not DISCUSSION </seg>

He reminds me of an uncle of mine who hurried back cast fearing that he would be struck with light - ning if he stayed here, or that he would dry up and the wind would blow him awav. I think I voice the sentiment of this audience when I say that I would not live in a country where I could not grow fruit — and good fruit, too, — yet I live in Nebraska purely from choice. We are not so poor that we cannot get away, like a great many people are in various parts of the United States. As to the plums, the EurojK'an plum ripens up better here than through the average e;ist, and there is not one man in five that deems it necessary to combat curculio or other enemies of the plum; it practically takes care of itself. In addition to the varieties mentioned by Mr. Youngers I have seen Moore's Arctic and Bohemian Prone bending down under loads of fine fruit, also single tree* of ShipjK-rs Pride in Fremont that had three to four bushels of very tine plans. We have the best native plum that I have seen anywhere, and many native varieties have already sprung from it which are not to be despised by anybody, and are already standing abreast in the markets with any for - eign plum that chances to compete with them. We have rea'sons to expect wonders from the plum, especially under the advan - tages of diligent propagation like the Euroj&gt;ean plum has re ceived for centuries. Through the irrigated districts of western Nebraska, the Baldwin, Rhode Island Greening, Yellow Bell - flower, etc., do tine; yet we grow Ben Davis, and shall con - tinue to grow them. The Ben Davis of Nebraska is as fine flavored as the Baldwin of the east, and seems to meet better sale side by side with it. Yet the Ben Davis is not the only apple we grow. Over one hundred varieties are exhibited an - nually at the state fair from single counties, and sometimes from single orchards. Red June, Chenango Strawberry, Fall Wine Bap, Seek-no-further, Grimes' Golden, Jonathan, Minkler. etc., all thrive hctc, and are found in every fruit grower's cellar. I will admit that we grow more bushels of Bon Davis than any </seg>

Those fine quality apples that they talk so much about pro\ be so scarce that they cannot he had in quantities sufficient to feed their own people; then our Hen Davis steps in and supplies the demand, and the principal complaint we hear is for more. In England the apple is without color and flavor because of lack of sunshine. An apple that is highly colored has a better flavor than another of the same variety that is without color. Ne - braska sunshine and pure air gire the highest of color, and likewise flavor, to the ghrca variety. What the professor says about the western mans ambition to do everything on the wholesale plan, no matter if the income is no more, is only too true. More intensive and less extensive farming is what we want. Mr. Hadki.nson — Our old friend, the professor, forged that the valleys of Nebraska are full of all kinds of fruit of p&gt;od quality. Is it not a fact that apples of a higher color grow in our sunny Nebraska than in European or eastern countries and always find ready sale at any season of ripening? Our western apples are freer from fmg] than any other, »wing to the con dition of the climate, as admitted by the professor in his paper. I think the west holds a few points over our eastern friends in this matter. PLANTING THE APPLE ORCHARD. I wish to say in the beginning that while the orchardist will always do some experimenting iu order to keep up with the times, yet all of the older parts of the state of Nebraska have jrone through with enough experience; have learned enough about location, planting, windbreaks, cultivation, pruning, etc., and tested eMMgh different varieties so that an orchard can now be planted with the assurance of a reasonable di success. O. A. MARSHALL, ARLINGTON. </seg>
            <seg id="p082">74 NEBRASKA STATK IIoUTICTI/nitAI. SOCIETY. The first in order is preparation of the •oil, which should be thoroughly plowed (subsoiling preferred), then leveled by har rowing- The easiest accurate way to lay out the rows is with the corn marker or planter, establishing the distance between the tree* by a certain number of rows; then corn, potatoes, or any crop that can be cultivated may be planted, and will always tit the rows. The holes can be dun with the spade, or by plowing deep furrows. They must be large enough, however, to admit the roots in their natural position, and not twisted or pressed together. Before planting I prefer the old puddling plan — dipping the roots in a thin mud mortar. Hoots treated in this way will stand much more exposure before planting than without this mud covering. Plant the tree firmly three to four inches deeper than it stood in the nursery, leaning it slightly towards the southwest. — towards the "two-o'clock sun," — placing the lowest and largest limbs on that side. By this plan the danger of sunscald is much lessened. 1 prefer the tree limbed frooi about two to three feet from the ground. Forked trees are al - most certain to split down sooner or later, therefore a central body with limbs on all sides is better. In trimming always use a knife with a sharp, smooth edge. AIL bruised and unnatural roots should be cut off. Some of our best planters do not trim the top at all, though I prefer catting them back at least one third of the last year's growth. Locality has a great deal to do with the distance of planting. In the eastern and southeastern portions of the state, apple trees should be planted from L'S to :?."&gt; feet apart. The higher eleva tions, eastern and northeastern slopes are the most desirable locations for an orchard, yet the family orchard should be near the house, and if this location is a south dope, plant closer, say K to :&lt;(» feet, and limb lower, say two and one-half feet. Farther west and northwest in Nebraska conditions are different; there is more sunshine and drier atmosphere, consequently the trees will stand closer planting, say L'O to '1T&gt; feet.

In either rase the early bearing sorts which are selected as tillers should be kept from crowding the permanent trees by heading back, and finally by ratting out. In ■electing varieties I thought it well to consult the expe - rienced fruit growers of the state, so sent out a list of direct questions witli blank to fill. The main questions were as fol - lows: "Have you planted this variety?" "Would you plant it for home?" "Would you plant it for commerce?"

On reading the reports as they came in it was observed that the orchardists generally agree in each sec - tion of a district, but do not always agree with other sections of the same district. This would indicate that the fruit dis tricts are a little too large, and when it is convenient the neigh borhood in which an orchard is to be planted should be con suited along with the list.

There is a widespread opinion prevalent, even in adjoining slates, that the apple is nature's forbidden fruit in South Da kota. Inasmuch as we are raising the fruit in quantities on the ojk'ii prairie thirty-six miles north of Yankton, I have been asked to tell the memlwrs of the Nebraska Horticultural So - ciety something of our methods for the benefit of the north Nebraska orchardist. The first essential is to get hardy varie - ties true to name. A very large per cent of the failures in fruit planting in the north is because of the unadaptability of the varieties planted. ' Remember, too, that the label does not in the least affect the hardiness of the tree if it is the only thing true to name as ordered. I know of no other business where it is so essential that your dealer's reputation should be a guar - antee of good faith. Our first step, then, in planting our or - chard was to put ourselves in correspondence with reliable nurserymen and orchardists in northern Iowa and southern Minnesota. We bought from them, and took their advice very largely while our planting was in the experimental stage. Let me caution the prospective plaster in northern Nebraska to plant largely of but few varieties. Plant the Duchess, of course; the Wealthy also, but not on too high ground, — it is more sensitive to drouth than the Duchess. But plant no apple tree on low, flat ground if you have any other land for planting. In years when May freezes decimate our crops we find the fruit least affected where there are still lower levels; where the trees have the advantage of atmospheric drainage. Returning to our varieties, we have held good success with Whitney's No. 20, although its poor keeping qualities render it undesirable to plant in quantities, unless you have a brisk home demand. Tetofsky, too, is a fine harvest apple, hardy with </seg>

Of the crabs. \'ir«;inia, Minnesota, Martha, all are wortliy of a place iii the orchards of this section. For a sweet apple. Briar Sweet is fine for pickling, and very hardy. One of the odd things about this tree is that, with ns, where the nursery trees are tag the sprouts that come up are also Hriar Sweet, indicating that it is so vigorous a grower that it kills out the root on which it j» grafted. Of other varieties that promise well I will meution Iliberlial and (Jood Peasant. The Haas dots fairly well, but the tree is not healthy. Tl»e Snow apple is not at home with us. but its half-dead trees bear and l&gt;ear. The Hen Davis, and all that large class of apples of its degree of hardiness, are use - less for Dakota planting beyond the vicinity and influence of the great river. As to planting and care of orchards, I was much interested in the discussions at the late meeting of your Society relative to the merits and demerits of deep and shallow planting, dost - or wide planting, high or low heading, seeding vertut cultivation of the orchard, etc. My own observation leads me to believe that one cannot learn a few cast iron rules about orcharding and then have no further use for one's head than to rest a hat on. I believe all were right under certain conditions. Take shallow rerun* deep planting, for instance; one must use the soil one has, and in a heavy, rather cold soil. I should not plant a tree nearly so deep as in a loose, warm soil. In ref - erence to distance apart, we find twenty-five feet apart a good distance for the Wealthy, Hriar Sweet, Virginia crab, etc, while the stocky Duchess, Tetofsky. and upright growing Whit - ney do not need their space. By planting, say, thirty feet, you tan plant alternate rows be! wen the regular rows of these trees in quincunx fashion. Then, as to high or low heading, there are so many 'advantages and disadvantages to be urged on both sides that it is difficult to decide. The general rule is that trees assume the bush form more and can be headed lower and planted closer as we approach colder or drier regions i </seg>

One thing, however, is true: The objection urged with reason against the horizontal or willowy branching tree, that its branches, when laden with fruit, Would rest on the ground, would never apply to the stocky, upright growers of which Duchess and Tetofsky are types. We have often had Duchess so full of fruit that much of it would be crowded off. I have had the little stocky Tetofsky about as thickly studded with apples as could find space on the limbs. I have had No. 20 so full of fruit that the trees seemed simply a mass of red color, but I have never had one of them have a limb beat to the ground with its weight of fruit, even though branching not more than a foot from the ground. On the other hand, I have had Wealthy branches bend to the ground with their load of fruit, though headed three and one-half or four feet high. High heading cer - tainly facilitates clean cultivation and makes a fine looking orchard, but I was not sorry that my trees were now headed last fall when a strong wind, which raged for days just as our Wealthy apples were ready for gathering, showered a thousand bushels of them down for us. We kept a force picking them up to prevent the apples from falling on each other, and the fruit WM so little bruised that a week later a car of them shipped to Huron as second class were many of them resold by the pur - chaser as first-class fruit. Low heading and clover or mulch under the trees to receive them made a difference of hundreds of dollars in the loss from that one wind alone. I was much interested in Professor Hartley's great orchard just north of Lincoln. Certainly he is giving it ideal cultivation now. but later, as it comes into full bearing, I think the pro - fessor will find that clean cultivation and the dust mulch have their disadvantages in a big apple harvest. While it is unques - tioned that clean cultivation is the only method of caring for the young orchard, we find the results eminently satisfactory among older trees to seed to clover on the lower lands and cul - tivate with disc and harrow between the rows on the higher ground, mulching 1 all bearing trees — both in clover and culti- </seg>

Be rery sure that no mulch or other litter touches the tree. We always mound slightly with earth at the l&gt;ase of the trunk. Corn soaked in a weak solution of strychnine or arsenic and put in the runways of mice, under cover, is effective in ridding the orchard of them, but do not scatter promiscuously, or great damage may result in killing off the orchardisfs best friends — quails and other birds. A lath screen eacircliag the tree, woven with copper wire, is greatly recommended by many orchardists, as it pro - tects from mm Id, rabbits, and mice. Made to overlap at first, it may be enlarged as the tree grows. I believe the northern Nebraskan will have the best sin in his orchard planting if he puts his faith in those sorts that are succeeding best in northern Iowa, rather than in those that are adapted to the central and southern parts of his own state. Avoid blighting crab varieties like Hyslop and Transcendent. Plant on northern, eastern, or northeastern slopes if possible, and give protection on west or south, but not so near as to sap the vitality of your orchard tree*, or to allow snow banks to form on your young trees. Protect from sunscald either by screen as noted above, or other convenient way. Professor Hartley is protecting his trees headed four feet high perfectly by cleating three laths together and nailing this by the central lath to the southwest side of the tree. Head your tree as low as the variety will warrant, remembering that a low headed tree is less liable to sunscald, less exposed to damage by wind, both to tree and fruit, and the fruit is much easier gathered. Rut remember, also, that the spreading branches of the Wealthy, Virginia crab, etc., would simply rest their lower branches on the ground when loaded with fruit if headed less than three or four feet high. Now, having planted your orchard, being right on varieties, location, etc., do not think your part of it is done and time and nature will do the rest. Trees require fo be loved. At least you must give them those little attentions essential to sue </seg>
            <seg id="p092">84 NEBRASKA STATE HORTHTLTntAL SOCIETY. Keep the sprouts at tlio base of the tree cut off; let no litter or grass at the base of the tree furnish shelter for mice. If corn or potatoes are grows in the young orchard, see that no careless employe bruises the bark with farm machinery. Let no small grain of any kind, except buckwheat, gain admittance to the orchard, neither blue grass nor timothy. We think cultivation should cease by midsummer so as to allow the tree to rijH'n its wood well before winter. Prune but little. If necessary to remove a branch, do it while it is a twig. The tree butchery often practiced is a veritable slaughter of the innocents. If a tree has been neglected and pruning is imperative, do it in the spring or not later than June, covering the wound with wax or paint. And. lastly, enjoy the fruits of your intelligent labor, and sell your surplus to your neighbor who paid a fabulous price for more fabulous fruit trees, believing that they would shower down fruit like unto the overgrown specimens carried in mag - nifying jars for his benefit, basing his belief on the all -sufficient reason that he "saw the man who told him so." and, failing, is firm in the conviction that he does not live in a fruit country. THE PEACH ORCHARD. J. M. RUSSELL, WYMOItE. There has been so much said lately on the subject of peach growing in Nebraska that I hardly know where to begin. Hut if I can say anything that will tend to encourage the planting of orchards for family use 1 shall be satisfied. Many s&lt;&gt;em to think that because so many trees are being planted now. peaches will be so cheap that they can buy cheaper than they can grow them. Well, suppose that commercial or - charding should become unprofitable on account of low prices; it is cheaper to grow your fruit than to run after it, and besides, the family that depends on buying does not have jK-aches fresh </seg>
            <seg id="p093">THE PEACH ORCHARD. 85 from the tree every day from July 1 until October 1. as may be bad from a home on-hard of varieties carefully ■elected! ;is to hardiness and season of ripening. In fact, it will pay to grow your own fruit of any kind, providing it is adapted to your lo - cality. Kather than have no orchard I would plant seedlings, but budded trees are preferable for two reasons: First, the size and quality of the fruit are better; second, the seedlings nearly all ripen about the same time, while, as I have just stated, from budded sorts you can have a continuous supply for three months. I am often asked "How often can we expect a crop?" Well, 1 don't know a better answer than to give our experience in Gage county. In the last twelve years we have had eight crops, and at this date iJanuary 111) have a good prospect for another the coming season. Of course, they may be killed between now and spring, but if they are killed after the middle of January it will be something that has not happened for the last twelve years. They have Iteen partially killed later, but not the entire crop. If I were improving a farm in this locality for a home, and could plant only one orchard, either apple or peach. I should plant peach, provided I had high ground for it. Of course, an apple orchard is longer-lived, but peach trees come into bearing much earlier and bear good crops oftener than apple t; As there have been so many paper! read before this Society on the preparation of land for orchards. I think it is unn&gt; sary for me to say anything on that line. Of course, I would never plant on low land. We often find trees on high land loaded with peaches while those on low or bottom land have none at all. Therefore, plant on the highest land possible, and if you want a wind-break, just plant another row of peach trees, and you will often get as much fruit from the outside row as any other. The greatest mistake that is generally made after planting is lack of thorough cultivation. Another very im portant matter is to keep the trees dear of borers. If they an in the tree you will lad them at, or a little under, the surface of the ground. By scratching the dirt from the tree an inch or </seg>

Whenever you see a gummy substance at the root of the tree, you will find borers in the tree. As to varieties of peaebea that we have fruited here which have proved to be hardy and prolific, I will mention the follow - ing: Alexander, Early Kivers, Hale's Early, Russell No. 1, Cool idge, Champion, Wafer, Hill's Chili, Wright, and Crosbey. This last summer our Elberta trees bore well and the. peaches* were fine, but the trees were late in coming into bearing, as they are now seven years old and this was the first heavy crop from them. We also had a few Triumph. I am inclined to think it will be :i fairly good peach to grow here. It is a yellow-fleshed peach as has been represented, but we do not consider it a perfect free - stone. Bokara No. 3 we have not fruited, but from what I have learned of it from Honorable Silas Wilson, of Atlantic, la., and from &lt;1. A. Marshall, of Arlington, Mho had them on exhibition at the Omaha Exposition, I think they will be a good variety to plant. We had a heavy crop of peaches on our old farm last summer, but from the extreme wet spring and the extreme drouth fol - lowing the quality was not so good as usual. While this or - chard was loaded with fruit (except a part of it which was on rather low land) we have an orchard of forty acres on high land near Wyinore which failed entirely. It is six years old and of the same varieties that are on the farm. The same difference was noticeable in many localities in this and adjoining counties. I suppose the difference was owing to heavier rains in some lo - calities than in others late in the season, which prevented the wood from ripening before cold weather. DISCUSSION. Mr. Youxgers — North of us they had peaches, and they had peaches all up the Republican Valley. With us there was a heavy rain in October which caused the buds to swell; wherever they missed that rain they had peaches. </seg>
            <seg id="p095">87 THE PEACH ORCHARD. Mr. Christy — Isn't it a fact that the peaches are always killed in the fall rather than by the cold weather of winter? Mr. Russell — It is owing a good deal to the way they ripen up. I have them killed at 14 below zero, while in other seasons I have had a crop after 20 below. I have always believed they were killed by the extremely cold nights. Mr. Jenkins — What is your idea in regard to the depth of planting? Mr. Russell — We plant just as we would an apple tree; an inch and a half or so deeper than they stood in the nursery. Mr. Jenkins — Do you plant below the bud? LMr. Russell — We plant so the bud comes just about to the rface or a little above. Mr. Jenkins — What distance apart do you prefer? Mr. Russell — That is a mistake we made in our first planting; we planted too close. Our orchard here near Lincoln is planted 14 by 20, and I think that is close enough, though if planted ( -loser they will do fairly well until the trees get to be four or five years old. We have an orchard near Wymore which is planted 14 by 18, and at six years the growth touched from tree to tree. Mr. Jenkins — Do you raise any crops in your peach orchards? Mr." Russell — We do the first two years; not afterwards. Mr. Jenkins — Do you prune any? Mr. Russell — Yes, sir; we prune some. When the tm-s get old most of our pruning is just so that we can get through. Mr. Stephen-son — Don't you shorten the branches in? Mr. Russell — No; I did when the trees were young, but I have given that up. o </seg>

These markings wen- made at the time the apples were taken from cold storage and show the relative condition of the dif - ferent varieties at the dates named. By examining the table you will notice that the following varieties had retained all of their good qualitieH up to tjie time of the last marketing, No - vember 1: Ben Davis, Wine Sap, (Jenet, Linibertwig, Willow Twig, Little Red Romanite, and Lansingburg. You will also notice that at the time of the second and third marketings the Jonathan and fJ. (!. Pippin had gained in the comparative scale, coming out of storage in very good condition with flavor fully retained, while the Minkler had lost flavor and begun to decay. The English Golden Russet shriveled and lost on scale. The Roman Ktem became mealy and lost flavor. The Sheriff and Walbridge discolored so badly as to render them unfit for show or market, and declined very rapidly in the scale of points. The Fulton shriveled. The Milam, though a good keejx'r, lost color. The Snow retained color, but many bursted, and after ■ few days became mealy. The Yellow Hellflower had decayed so badly at the time of the second marking that we were unable to get a specimen for exhibition. The Missouri Pippin, while re maining sound, lost color, thus reducing the scale. The Salome remained firm upon the table; fruit taken from storage and put upon the tables June 1 retained color and firmness for nearly five weeks. All of this fruit was gathered and placed in cold storage during the fall of 1897, most of it during the month of Octo ber; I think a few went in as late as December. Each apple was wrapjK'd first in a sheet of waxed paper, using f) by 12 inch sheets for small apples and 12 by 12 inch sheets for large ones. Then another covering of common newspaper was added and the apples carefully packed in barrels, filling them up so as to require considerable pressure to get the heads in. They were stored in the cold storage room of Swift &amp; Co., South Omaha, and the temperature did not vary over one degree from M ie - grees from the time they were placed in storage until they were </seg>

While some varieties (such as Walbridge and Sheriff) disappointed us, still 1 am satisfied be - yond doubt that wrapping first in waxed paper, then in any common paper, is the best method of packing apples for cold storage. This double wrapping makes practically an air-tight cell for each apple, thus preventing any spread of decay. In order to test the matter a few barrels were placed in stor - age without any wrapping whatever. The varieties selected for this test were Ben Davis and Wine Sap. They were placed in the same storage room and received exactly the same treatment as the others, yet fully 70 per cent of them were decayed when we took them out June 1. Not only were they decayed, but those remaining in a firm condition were so badly discolored and had lost flavor to such an extent as to render them wholly unfit for either show or market. A few of the same varieties were wrapped simply in newspaper, not using the waxed sheets. Of these about 30 per cent were in very poor condition June 1, while the same varieties, packed and stored at the same time, using the double wrapping of waxed sheets and common paper, remained in almost perfect condition as late as November 1. DISCUSSION Mr. Youngers — There is one thing I wish to mention, ami that is the way some varieties behaved. The Missouri Pippin, for instance, lost color in storage; faded a good deal like the Milam. On the other hand, the Walbridge, instead of beinj: a nicely striped, highly colored apple, came out almost black. Under exactly the same treatment the different varieties be - haved differently. Take the Iowa Blush, for instance; the skin became so bitter in storage as to render them unfit for use. The apples looked all right, but if you would bite one of them the skin would be very bitter. Mr. Kinne — Didn't you find that the lighter colored apple: bleached out more than the dark red ones? </seg>
            <seg id="p099">91 KEEPING QUALITIES OF WINTER APPLES. Mr. Youngers — No; the Missouri Pippin is a dark apple and it faded; the Sheriff is a dark apple and it became black; the Grimes' Golden and Yellow Uellflower are yellow apples and they came out all right; the Ben Davis faded unless it was wrapi&gt;ed; as I say in my paper, those that were put in without wrapping came out so badly faded as to render them unfit for use. Mh. Roberts — Did you keep any pears? Mit. Younoers — We just had a few pears, but didn't sut in keeping them. Mr. Kinxe — What was the cost? Mr. Youxgers — I paid $3 a barrel for the apples wrapped and on board cars. Mr. Kixxe — Were those selects? Mr. Youxgers — Yes, sir; towards the last I paid as high as $4 for a few barrels, but the bulk of them were purchased at $3 a barrel. Mu. Kinnk — Have you had any experience with other methods of storage? Mi;. Youngers — I saw the result of the storage of the Iowa and Illinois people there at the exposition. Their fruit came out in very poor condition as compared with ours. Their waste was very much greater than ours. The Iowa people would have to take out a great number of barrels in order to get any quan - tity of good fruit. I presume they lost an average of 80 per cent of their fruit; that would be my judgment. Mr. Kinne — -Probably it was on account of the qualit}' of the fruit. Me. Youngers — We will admit that Nebraska fruit is better than Iowa fruit; thank you. (Laughter.) Mr. Hartley — Did you try keeping cherries in storage? Mr. Youxgers — Yes, sir; we had cherries on exhibition there until October. Mr. Barnard — What effect did the paper have on other fruits than apples, where they were wrapped? </seg>
            <seg id="p100">92 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. Mu. YocxoBBfl — On graj&gt;es I don't think we sacceeded very well; I think the grapei that were put in with&lt;»ut paper sue eeeded best. Isn't that your recollection, Mr. Marshall? Mb. Marshall — Yes, sir; the grapes that were put in storage were taken out of the baskets and wrapped after they got there, and we thought that injured them to some extent. Mb. Yorxr.ERs — They commenced to rot around the stem, and rattled off the bunch readily when taken out. The cherries were not wrapped — they were put right in in the baskets, and they usually kept for three days after taking out of storage. Dr. Hessey — When you put grapes in cold storage did you dip the ends of the stems in wax? Mb. YOUNGBBS — No, sir; we only put them in storage when we got a surplus on hand. We would buy from different parties and order them shipj&gt;ed at a certain time, but they usually ■hipped when they got ready, and quite frequently three or four of them got ready at once. The result was that we ran our Bar - plus into cold storage and saved them in that way. It was the same way with cherries. Sometimes we would have twenty or twenty five baskets in storage, and along towards the last of the cherry season 1 presume we had as high as one hundred baskets in storage at one time. Mr. Hartley — What are the charges for storage? Mr. YotTHGBBfl — They charged me five cents per package jht month. Mr. Hartley — Doe* that include barrels? Ma. Yen nckks — No; for a barrel they charged fifteen cents per month, but for a basket of grape* or cherries, or a crate of cherries, the charge was five cents per month or fraction thereof. Whenever we got a surplus of plums on hand we put them in storage also. We had Wild (loose, Lombard, Green Gage, and all those varieties of plums on exhibition there right ■p to the very last day of the show. We allowed f- a crate for plums, and we had so many shipped in that we pat them in cold storage and kept them so there never was a break in our plum </seg>

Of course, the storage on the 100 barrels of apples was donated to the Horti - cultural Society by Messrs Swift &amp; Co. PICKING AM) MARKETING Al'l'LES. The chief end of all labor on the commercial apple, from the nursery up, is that the financial results may be satisfactory. Whether the apples are picked with a pole, shook into a canvas, or picked by hand, depends upon the horticulturist's idea of business. The universal aim of all is to get the greatest amount of cash for the least amount of work and produce. Our views differ as to the best means of obtaining these results, yet I think it is the exception when we put too much work on any of our fruit, as I find the majority of our customers willing to pay for a little extra work, if the fruit shows the work has been done. To ship Hummer apples there is but one way to pick them, and that is by hand. Few men can do that properly, as they grip the apple tight enough to pull it froTii the stem, while the stem should be broken witli the thumb or fore finger, otherwise they are sure to show finger prints. Summer apples properlv handled can be shipj&gt;ed to any part of the slate. For picking winter apples we have found the half bushel basket the most satisfactory. Every basket should be supplied with a hook, so that the hands may be free to gather fruit, for no man can boast of being an apple picker unless he can use both hands — whether he is working on the ground, standing on a limb, or on the top of a 20-foot ladder. Few people not making a business of handling fruit realize the care necessary to properly prepare for market. A volume might be written on this subject alone. I'havc known several tine crops of apples practically ruined before they ever reached G. S. CHRISTY. </seg>
            <seg id="p102">94 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL 8OCIETY. the local market, simply through rough handling while picking. Apples intended for distant shipment should be carefully picked and then not allowed to leave the orchard until they are neatly packed in the barrels they are to be shipped in. The difference in Missouri's 4.(10(1 barrels exported in 1S!((» at a loss to the shipper, and the 3,000,000 shipped in is&lt;&gt;7 at a profit, was simply a question of care in handling the fruit. The Missourian had been "sighted."' The difference between knowledge and ignorance in handling apples for the London market amounts to $ 1 per barrel. Before we can hope to get a ]&gt;ernianent hold on the foreign markets we must learn the se - crets of the trade; and remember they appear all along the line, from the selection of your trees at the nursery — and the selec - tion of the nursery, too — location in planting, cultivation, pick - ing, and packing. Too many imagine the whole secret lies in patting all the big apples at the bottom of the barrel and the small oik's on top, and thru turn upside -down to mark. This is the sure road to bankruptcy. MAItKKTIN&lt; Many farmers in our part of the state are afraid of over - production of fruit; and.it is true that for some men, this year, cherries rotted on the tree, fine plums were fed to the hogs, grapes dried up on the vines, and apples wasted under the trees. The fault is not with the fruit, but with the men; as our county, one of tin- oldest settled in the state, still buys over the counters of our grocery stores more than $50,000 worth of dried and canned fruits every year, Off nearly one half as much as our shipments of green fruits amount to. Those that fear overproduction only study one side of the question. The people of Nebraska use a very small per cent of the fruit they should. We will enjoy life better, doctors' bills will be reduced, and civilization will go forward with a more rapid stride when we use more fruit and less '"hog and hominy." At the summer meeting we confined our remarks mostly to </seg>
            <seg id="p103">95 PICKING AND MARKETING AITLES. the sale of No. 1 stuff. So we will now take up more in refer - ence to the sale of No. U's and culls, — for we should be able to get a profit out of everything produced, without imposing on our customers. But first let me give the experience of some of our discontented fruit men. One man, who finds no profits in grapes, brought to Auburn a wagon load of grapes, having a nice basket of Wordens opened up as samples. His customers soon learned that the rest were very i&gt;oor Concords. Well, he is going out of the business, and his customers will l&gt;e very glad when he does. The man that allowed his cherries to rot on the trees, and fed plums to his hogs, treats his customers in the same magnani - mous manner. A neighbor of the latter gentlemen sold his cherries at fl per tree, the purchasers picking the fruit, thus netting flliO per acre, or as much as the same land would have brought had it been sown in wheat for ten years; apples sold at $4, or $200 pet acre; and the fruit of one Sheldon pear tree sold for flii, but as there was not an acre of that tree I could not figure profits by the acre. As fall apples, windfalls, and culls all come into the market at the same time, thus causing a glut of poor stuff, and having a bad influence on the later market, we need to study every pos - sible means of disposing of this class of fruit without shipping as green fruit. This accomplished, it is safe to predict that r.o living man will see an overproduction of apples, as we can use in 1900, 100,0011,000 barrels of first-class fruit. The fruit belt has reached the point when we must have more canneries, evaporators, and cider mills, to use up the refuse that now goes to waste or is branded that which it is not and sold, ruining the sale of good fruit. With properly arranged canning factories, and evaporators combined, it will be possible to use every grade of fruit; even the peeliag and core* from the canning factory and from the evaporated apples can be dried and exported at a profit. In fact the only thing it is impossible to figure a profit on is the worm holes. When we can thus dis- </seg>
            <seg id="p104">96 pose of our poorer grades, the first class apples will bring as much cash as is at present received for the entire crop. Hut it requires considerable cash to build evaporators and factories, bo it will be necessary for horticulturists to form stock coin panies or gel capitalists interested in the scheme. In the mean time main of the housewives, anxious to earn a little pin money, might, as is practiced by their eastern sisters, put up canned frnit, butters, and jellies, to sell on the home market, thus cap - turing a part of the thousands of dollars that are every year sent to other states for canned goods. And then when you go to your grocer to order canned fruit, he says. -These were put up by Mrs. O'Hrien, these by Mrs. Schmidt, and those by Mrs. Luvier." Whether your palate lias been trained to French ga» lie, German sauerkraut, or Irish whiskey, you can order your fruit to suit vour taste. Mit. Camt — Is there any advantage in using the swinging half-bushel basket over using a sack? Mrt. Christy — I think there is; I have used both and I prefer the basket, especially for large trees. It might not make so much difference where the work is all done on the ground, but when you are in the top of a tree there is usually one man working on the ground, and with the basket, when it is full, you can just send it down and go right on picking; if you have a sack you can't let it down. Another objection to the sack is that the weight of the whole amount of apples rests on every apple and they are more liable to be bruised than in a basket. Mm. Dcklaf — What do you consider the average cost per bushel of picking apples? Mm. Christy — I should say it would average about five cgnts a bushel. Very much depends on the trees and the different orchards. I picked one orchard this fall that cost me four cents a bushel; another one I hired picked for two cents. Mr. CAMr — How many apples will an ordinary picker get in a day? DISCUSSION. </seg>
            <seg id="p105">97 CAltE AND CULTURE OP ORCHARDS. &gt; Mit. Christy — About twenty-five to thirty bushels; 1 have picked sixty bushels in a day. Mrs. Aldkrmax — Isn't it true that varieties differ so that no definite rule can be laid down? Mr. Christy — That is true. A man can't buy a lot of or cbards at random and Igmre on picking the apples for four, five, or ten cents a bushel; he must know what the apples are. It takes considerable experience to tell how many apples there are on a tree. I have bought thousands of bushels of applet on the trees and picked them, and I can generally tell now pretty nearly what it will cost to pick a lot of apples when I see them. Mu. Stevenson — What kind of packages do you recommend for shipping summer apples? Mr. Christy — I use barrels altogether. Mr. Hartley — What do the barrels cost you? Mr. Christy — Twenty-four cents is about the least; from that to thirty-one cents, laid down. This year 1 bought barrels at Nebraska City and they were the best barrels I ever got. Mr. Hartley— What size barrel do you use? Mr. Christy — I use the 16^-inch head. CAUK AND CULTURE OF ORCHARDS.

Losses which have been sustained in the Platte Valley east of and near to Kearney have seemed to be due very largely to troubles like those which he describes, and there can be little doubt of success on hardpan soils if the planter will follow the methods outlined by him. There are large areas in the stale where the conditions are very much as those Mr. Leonard describe*, where there is little doubt of success if con - nection can be secured between the surface and the underlying moisture. For hundreds of miles in the Platte valley the un - derlying water is not more than 8 to 12 feet from the surface, and yet between the surface moisture coming from rainfall and the underlying water from the Platte river there is a stratum of very hard soil which, if dag through or bored through in any way to establish connection, is very well suited to the growth of orchards. A portion of the writer's earlier experience was with the drift soils on the divide between the Blue river and the head of Salt creek, having to contend with a great deal of gumbo, this tenacious gumbo often coming very close to the surface. Later experience in contract orchard planting has brought to notice other soils and widely differing conditions. Nebraska is a large state, stretching from east to west nearly -400 miles, north to south about 200 miles, and conditions vary widely. Care and culture must also vary. What would be excellent care in one locality would be unsuited to another. While the orchardists in the eastern counties may grow a corn or vegetable crop in their orchards, and may ultimately without harm seed down to clover, yet in the central and west ern portions of the state, where a sufficient degree of moisture is the first consideration, it is not admissible to raise any crop in the young orchard nor to seed down at any period during the life of the orchard. The ease and certainty with which an apple orchard is grown in the eastern and southeastern por - tions of the state is such that a planter can hardly go astray. He has a deep, loose, loess soil and subsoil, reasonably sure to </seg>
            <seg id="p107">99 CARE AND CULTURE OF ORCHARDS. retain the needed moisture, and the native fertility of the soil is such that he need not fear depleting it in growing a crop that shall help bear the expense, and he may safely plant a farm crop, either corn or some hoed crop or vines, that will help bear the expense of establishing the orchard. While the lands in the central and western portions of the state are not lacking in fertility, they are liable to periods of extreme drouth, and it becomes a matter of the utmost consequence to so care for and cultivate the orchard that it may during the most try - ing years have an abundant store of moisture to tide over the occasional very dry seasons. It is quite practicable by a pre - vious year's summer fallow without any crop to store up the major portion of the moisture of that season and thus insure an abundant store of moisture in the early spring to start the trees with safety and carry them forward until the May or June rains. Very rarely, however, is this extreme precaution necessary. Usually the frost and snows of winter leave in the soil moisture enough for early spring planting, and if this moisture is very carefully husbanded it will last until the late spring and sum - -nu*r rains. These in turn, if carefully conserved, give sufficient moisture for the entire season. This frequent, careful surface culture, carried forward from year to year, increases the avail - able supply of moisture to such an extent that after three years of such cultivation on our driest western tables the soil auger shows that moisture has penetrated to a depth of 10 to 13 feet in the subsoil. One of the difficulties under which orcharding labors, particu - larly in the central and wester* portions of the state and even in the Blue river district, is the late spring frost to which we are sometimes liable. Following a warm, early spring a norther may come down from the cold northwest, reaching us in May after trees are in bloom, or the fruit may be set. Colorado and southern California have this same difficulty. In the orange and lemon groves of southern California guarding against the late frost is a regular portion of the work.

Pegs two feel in height rapport wire screens on which is piled wet straw, trash, or litter, with the intent that the smoke passing through this wet material will become damp and therefore heavy and hang low in the orchard. Experience shows that an orchard in bloom or with young fruit will ofttimes sustain the effect of a wave 4 to &lt;! degrees below freezing point without serious harm. Care fully recorded observations show that a dense smoke, by re - tarding the radiation of heat from the earth's surface, lessens the frost to the extent of 3 to 4 degrees. Adding this and the ability of the fruit to withstand 4 to (i degrees below freezing |K)int, the danger is ofttimes averted. In portions of Europe, work of this character is compelled on the part of all vineyardists and orchardists and is under gov - ernment control. Material is prepared in advance, the signal service foretells liability to frost, at the proper time bells art - rung, and the entire community engages in the work of pro - ducing all possible smoke. In our own experience, when the thermometer at 9 o'clock ranges as low as 40 degrees we have regarded it as important to have our men in readiness, have some one continue to watch the thermometer while the others sleep, and usually from 1 to 2 in the morning to make as much smoke as possible from ma - terial previously prepared. It should be borne in mind that tire or heat is not what is desheil, but the utmost possible amount of smoke, and this is gained from the slow combustion of damp material. We believe this should be kept up until the sun is at least an hour above the horizon, for the reason that frozen bloom or frozen fruit thawed gradually by a slowly rising temperature often escape* harm. A great number of incidents have been noted in the last three yean showing that those who have water at their command, either from ditches of lowing water or from reservoirs or ele - vated tanks, have at their command a means of very materially </seg>

Apparently this is gained from two causes: First, the raising of the dew point by the increased humidity of the atmosphere; secondly, the tea - jM'iature of the water being much above freezing point set free a considerable amount of latent heat. Another point should be mentioned in this connection, and that is, elevation. In 1894 we lost the apple crop in the or chard on the Blue river bottom; elevation of this orchard above the river 2."&gt; to M feet. At the same time the orchard on top of the divide between P.lue river and Salt creek, probably at an elevation above the river of 126 to 140 feet, escaped all harm and gave that season the largest crop in its history. WIXD-RItEAKS. The exiK'iience of many orchardists seems to indicate that a heavy south wind break to lessen the force and aridity of our summer and early fall winds is decidedly beneticial, and for the same reason it should also lit- to the westward of the or chard. Feeling that the ability to counteract the effects of the occasional late spring frosts was a matter of great importance, the writer firmly believes in the value of lofty east wind breaks which intercept the early rays of the morning sun. Those who have gathered wild fruit in the canyons notice that the fruit, iu the seasons when a late frost has prevailed, is found on the "shady side of the canyon where the rays of the sun strike very late in the morning, and not on the sunny side. I believe this subject well worthy of continued observation and close study. Concerning a wind break on the north. In Saline county we have but-little wind-break to the north of our larger orchards. </seg>
            <seg id="p110">102 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. and jet observation in the central and western portions of the state leads to doubt. Where there is no question but that orchards closely shut in by heavy wind-breaks are more liable to blight, yet in case of the driving hail storms sometimes coming in our western counties we havcDbserved that the or - chards sheltered by a lofty north wind-break suffer less. We notice also that under the protection of a lofty north wind-break the force of a north wind driving a cold wave down upon the orchard in the month of May was so checked and interrupted that apparently the warm air was not all driven out of the en - closure, and under such conditions the fruit escaped 'harm, when the neighboring orchards without any protection at all lost the crop. Standing against incidents like this, the orchard of Edward Krick, of Kearney county, is situated on an elevated knoll without a windbreak in any direction. This orchard is now fourteen years old and is the healthiest and most pro - ductive orchard in the neighborhood. Incidents like this show that this subject also requires more study and the gathering together of observations covering thousands of orchards rather than a smaller number, before any absolute rule can be laid down concerning this question. CULTIVATION. One of our most successful orchards was cultivated twelve times the first season after planting, and although planted be - tween the 10th and 15th of May, this frequent regular culture gave such a degree of aeration of soil and moisture that a vig - orous growth was secured and not a tree lost in a planting of BML In the dry year of 1804 this frequent shallow culture in this same orchard was so effective in retaining moisture that in the last days of August, after six weeks of drouth, the soil from three inches under the surface would ball in the hand. This orchard in that season produced the largest crop of apples in its history, twenty bushels by measure from single trees. Whenever the orchard is on elevated table land or on lands </seg>
            <seg id="p111">103 CARE AND CULTURE OF ORCHARDS. any way subject to drouth, we would regard frequent shallow culture from May to mid-August as of the utmost importance. On the other hand, in the case of orchards on the Blue river bottom with a very fertile soil and a great amount of moisture, continued frequent culture gave very rapid growth, developed such an excess of wood growth that the trees did not come early into bearing, and blight was also induced, so that this orchard suffered woefully from blight. We then seeded to red clover. This checked the excessive wood growth, enabled the orchard to orcrcome the blight, threw it into bearing, and a crop of about 400 bushels jmt acre was secured. BLIGHT. At this time thousands of orchardists in the state of Ne braska are querying what can be done for blight. The writer, coming to Nebraska in lsll, determined to plait a commercial orchard on the east side of the Blue river, a portion of it on bottom land and a portion on high table-land between the Blue and Salt creek. Wishing to learn all he conld from the older oicliardists of the state, he went to Brownville and was there advised to plant quite freely of Siberians as probably being hardy enough for the ex]&gt;erimeiit of planting an orchard way out on the Blue river. He was advised at the time that it ought to be commercially profitable to plant Siberians and hybrids, for the reason that in the district in which he had located other apples would be comparatively scarce, and in default of the larger and better, people would no doubt buy the hybrids. In an orchard of 6,000 tree«. 1,080 Siberians and hybrids wctc planted, and as the writer planted a great many kinds for ex perhnental purposes he was ultimately compelled to chop out 2,000 trees 1mm ause the varieties blighted badly to their own destruction, and also showered myriads of blighted spores on other varieties which might otherwise have remained healthy. All over the central and western portions of the state, when a traveling salesman approaches a planter and urges the plant </seg>

He fears he is in a trying climate unsuited to the growing of the largest and finest apples. The lilciim says no doubt he could grow Siberians and hybrids. They are very, very hardy, and sure to withstand the climate, because they are perfectly hardy in Minnesota or Wisconsin or other northern regions. The planting of Siberians and many varieties of Russian apples has proved detrimental in very many orchards and gardens for the reason that varieties which were well suited to far northern climes are unsuited to our high temperature and occasional great humidity, as following a summer shower, found in our central and western counties. These varieties blight badly. They shower countless spores on other trees which might otherwise remain healthy, and the planter is greatly dis couraged from the ravages of blight. Apparently the only remedy is to guard against blight by not planting varieties having a strong liability to blight; by confining the list to those which experience has shown to be the most nearly immune. Our report for 1SU4 gives a list show - ing the varieties most nearly immune, and those most subject to blight. This list will be found useful as a partial guide, though it might be widely extended. While the orchard is small enough so it is practicable to go over it occasionally, twigs of blight can be removed and burned and thus lessen the spread of the spores. With age this is im - practicable. Closely shut in orchards, a confined humid atmos phere with high temperature, conduces to the rapid develop - ment and spread of the spores. Orchards closely shut in by wind-breaks and without air drainage suffer more severely than orchards with perf&lt;&gt;ct circulation and such elevation as gives good air drainage. In orchards liable to blight the tendency to blight may be increased by high or perhaps overcultivation, and yet great care must be exercised not to fall back to the other extreme. </seg>

Apparently the orchards of the state are not yet seriously affected by the fungus diseases so troublesome and destructive ill the orchards of the eastern and middle states. These dis - eases, whenever they do come, should he combated as in the east, by spraying with what is termed the Hordeaux mixture, composed of copper sulphate (blue vitriol) six pounds, quicklime four pounds, water fifty gallons. IMssolve the copj&gt;er sulphate by putting it in a bag of coarse cloth, hanging this in a vessel containing four to six gallons of water. Use an earthenware or wooden vessel. After the eoppct sulphate is dissolved, dilute with water to twenty-live gallons. Slake the lime and add twenty-five gallons of water. In slaking the lime take the pre - caution to do this some little time beforehand, so that particles of lime which may not be fully dissolved may settle in the bottom of the tub and not impede a free flow through the spray - ing nozzle. Mix the two and keep thoroughly agitated while using. The tirst application should be early in the spring before the buds open, the second application before bloom, the third soon after the blossoms fall, and the fourth ten to fifteen days after the third. CODLINU-MOTH The researches and observations of Professor Card have given us a great deal of information on the life and habits of the cod ling-moth. These are very clearly set forth in our Horticultural Society's rejHjrt for L8M, and also in a bulletin published by the State University. Since our report of L8M is now out of print and nearly all the volumes already distributed, that these suggestions may be preserved for the readers of the report of ls&lt;ti» we have thought best to present the last two and a half pages of Professor Card's report.

Spray with Paris greea, as generally recommended, about one week after the blossoms fall, or in time to get the calyx cups well filled with the poison so that they may close over and hold it there.

Spray again with Paris green and Bordeaux mixture com - bined, or with kerosene emulsion, about June 1, or, better, ob - serve carefully and apply this when the eggs are being laid in abundance on the leaves, which at Lincoln occurs at about this date (about the first week in June). Laboratory experiments in - dicate that kerosene emulsion will be more effective than Paris green at this time. "3. Scrape the bark and place paper bands around the tree about the last of June, when the larva' are beginning to leave the apple to pupate. Examine these two or three times, a week apart, and destroy the insects found beneath them. "4. If these methods are not wholly effective owing to the proximity of neglected orchards, or from an unusual abundance of moths, later spraying with either Paris green and Bordeaux mixture, or kerosene emulsion, may do some good, but appar - ently cannot be expected to be wholly effective. Late spraying with arsenite is much more likely to injure the foliage thau earlier applications, and if the other methods are thoroughly followed it will probably be necessary. "«j.

It does not follow the instructions laid down for it by entomologists and horticulturists in the literature of the past. It does not la}- its eggs in the calyx cup at the time the trees are in bloom, where the young larvse can feed on the poison prepared for it and dutifully pass away as a well-behaved worm should do. Apple trees are generally in full bloom here about the first of May. By the 15th or 20th the calyx i« tightly closed. During this time the codling-moth sleeps in its winter quarters. When the mists of the spraying machine have cleared away it emerges and carefully scatters its eggs upon the Bpper surface of the leaves. This occurs at Lincoln about the first week in June. Eight to ten days later, or in less time when the weather is warm, the egg hatches and the young larva scuds for a hiding place — generally within the calyx cup. A few eat a little of the leaf before doing this. It lives in the apple some ten to fourteen days, grows fat, leaves it, finds a hiding place, spins its cocoon, changes to a pupa, and comes forth as a moth about a month after the egg was laid. The hustlers, which emerge early in spring, may pass through four generations in a season; the lag gards get through but two; the majority, three. "The codling-moth should be banished. This is not easy. Spraying alone, as generally recommended, will not do it The moth is not easily poisoned. Lights in the orchard do not at - tract it. Sticky tly paper will not hold the larvae. Only four - fifths of the larvae enter at the calyx. Late spraying with Paris green alone is not effective. Spraying before the calyx closes does much good. Three sprayings at Gibbon saved 80 per cent of the fruit. In laboratory trials, kerosene emulsion, sprayed while unhatched eggs are on the leaves, is effective. Late spraying with Paris green and Bordeaux mixture combined with whale-oil soap or with lead acetate and sodium arson ite is safe and does some good. Scraping the bark and tacking paper bands </seg>

EXPENSE OF THIS WORK. Mr. William Nutter, of (Jibbon, reports that in his orchard two men sprayed 166 trees in one day. Youngers ft Co., of (Jeneva. find the cost of spraying 1,066 trees planted in 1886 7 B, was fU0.N.-&gt;, or a fraction over 2 cents per tree. This work was done with hand-pumps used on barrel sprayers. In our own orchards, using horse power pump on a l'00-gallon tank, the exjK-nse of spraying is lessened. Mr. J. \Y. Walker, who has been in charge of this orchard for fourteen years, reports the expense of spraying so acres at about -111 cents per acre for each time. This includes labor and cost of material. It should be borne in mind that the several sprayings which are repeated for the destruction of the codling-moth also serve to destroy most other insect enemies.

Those who have not done this should coat the bark of the trunk with some offensive mixture, applied with I swab. Those who can get a sufficient quantity of blood need nothing better. With us, hav - ing the nursery to protect as well as the orchard, we have found it useful to secure a few pounds of tobacco stems, waste from a cigar factory. To this we add for each kerosene barrel of the mixture five pounds of soap; a bucket or two of blood, if we can get it; a pint of crude carbolic acid, costing about lli cents; sometimes we have used red pepper. We use a little flour to make it slightly adhesive and apply with a swab. This usually remains on the entire winter and washes off with the rains in spring. With us it has been found effective. Avoid using grease of any kind. In 1S72 the writer raised a block of trees by coating them with rancid grease. We notice in lS'JS serious harm from the use of axle grease. One gentle - man near Kearney, applying axle grease to an orchard of some 1,200 trees, suffered considerable loss and found he was likely to sustain more loss if he did not wash it off. In spite of ■parial effort to remove all the axle grease with alkaline washes he lost over fifty trees, apparently as the direct result of the appli ration of axle grease. The heat of the sun seems to drive any form of grease into the bark in such a way as to be destructive to the tree. The topic of care and culture of the orchard is such a broad question when we come to consider the varying soils and con ditions of our state, that we fear we have been uiiublc to do it justice even in this extended article. </seg>

Tin- proper met hod of growing the apple, embracing as it does the whole range of intelligent thought and labor pertain - ing thereto, from the planting of the tree to the gathering of the matured fruit, has been discussed so fully and clearly, time and again, that any one with ordinary intelligent judgment may succeed, in a suitable soil and favorable season, in growing a crop of apples, and with a good cellar or cave provided, the object of the planter might be almost attained; for thus, with reasonable care and well selected varieties, the supply for the family may be maintained through the winter; and as an or - chardist the planter would in too many instances retire from the field and rest upon the laurels he has already won, and at the very time when he, with the knowledge and experience gained, might reap a rich reward by entering the field of com mercial orcharding. How to secure the best returns in market - ing the crop from a commercial orchard is one of the most seri - ous problems which presents itself to the grower. With an abundant crop on hand, an unsatisfactory market. and often no market at all, and without adequate storage for his fruit, what is to be done? Through force of circumstances he falls an easy victim to the tender mercy of the buyer, whea juices are the very lowest. If the crop was a moderate one, or confined to a limited section of country and buyers were plenty, then a market may be secured at some fairly remunerative price, and the supply is quickly exhausted and a rapid advance in price immediately follows; but the grower who had plenty to sell at thirty centB per bushel a month before has none to sell at sixty cents per bushel now.

The ques - tion of prices seems thus to he very largely governed by the time at which sales are made. Instead, then, of Belling at ruinous prices in the fall, how can we manage to keep our winter fruit for the better market which is almost sure to come later in the season? And while cellars and caret are in a measure utilized for the storage of a family supply, or a limited quantity by a retailer, yet they are inadequate and unsatisfactory for large quantities of fruit. Many patent cooling rooms, refrigerators, and underground receptacle* have been desired for the purpose of storing fruit with a greater or less degree of success, but all objectionable in some resects. During my own experience as a packer and shipper of domestic fruit, mostly apples, I came to the conclusion that the long - practiced method of storing apples underground, either in pits, caves, or cellars, was a '•delusion and a snare," and I soon learned that even if customers were unable to distinguish be - tween a good variety and a poor one in point of quality, they were not slow to detect the difference between an apple ripened underground and one ripened as nature intended it should be. I think if it had been designed by the Creator that apples, etc., should have been ripened or matured in damp, moist places or underground, they would have grown on the roots of the trees, instead of on the branches. The building in which I successfully stored my fruit, while engaged in that line of busi - ness, was one story high, entirely above ground, and situated on the north side of an enbankment; it was built of rough one-inch pine boards, placed perpendicularly, cracks covered with half - inch pine batting and lined with heavy paper inside. A toler - ably even temi&gt;erature of about 30° to 40° was obtained by sup - plying the necessary heat from the inside of the building. We never found anv lack of ventilation.

As we always guaranteed our stock to customers, it became necessary to repack, which was done immediately be - fore shipment, and the difference between the amount of fruit received and that sold and shipped tor the loss) averaged about 10 per cent. Of course I do not regard the house alluded to above as a model storehouse, because it was not ; but yet it ma\ be regarded as a pointer in the right direction. As a general rule I think it unprofitable to keep winter apples later than the time named above, as the appearance of berries and other fruit from southern localities lessens the demand for them, and re daces the price as well. My own experience has led to the fol lowing conclusions: First — Winter fruit should be kept in a frost-proof, properly ventilated house, and above ground. Second — The tMnjH'rature should be maintained as eveiily as possible at a point ranging from 35° to 40° above zero. Third — Fruit should not be marketed indiscriminately, but as each variety in the process of ripening nears the highest poin of development, it should be put upon the market at once. New clean, tight flour barrels, holding three bushels of fruit each will be found the most convenient and profitable packages fo packing, storing, and marketing winter apples Some year ago my attention was directed to a paper read before the Michi gan State Horticultural Society by S.

To illustrate: Were we to enter our fruit room on a line winter day. when the outside temperature indicates L'(» below freezing, while the ther nioineter indoors indicates 19° above or a difference of :{()°, if you desired to keep the room as near as possible at 35° above, you would at once open the valve above in the ventilating pipe for the escape of the warm air in the apper part of the room. and at the same time open all the Hues at the base of the build - ing to admit cold air, to fill its plate. Thus in a few hours you would reduce the temperature to the jM&gt;int desired, when the flues should all be closed. On the contrary, should you find the fruit room cooler than the mean temperature outside, you would let it remain dosed for the present and await a more favorable opportunity, the object in view being to hold the cold air inside, when it is warm outside. When very cold outside, admit just enough to obtain the desired temperature and no more. You will be very agreeably surprised to learn how easy a matter it will be to keep such a room for months within a very few de - crees of the desirable temjterature. without other artilicial means. "On referring to my memoranda I find that one year ago we were able to hold niv house for five months within 3° of freez - ing; also when the atmospheric temperature rapidly changed (fi()° in twenty-four hours) the change in the fruit room was almost imperceptible, too slight to note. Again, in .January, 1881, the temperature fell for five days in succession, from 6° to I'd 0 below zero, yet in our fruit room in those five days the temperature changed scarcely one degree. And here again is a fact worthy of notice: The larger the fruit room and the greater the bulk of fruit in storage, the less liable will it be </seg>

By a careful review of the Chicago markets for a term of years I have ascertained that an average of the highest prices is al&gt;out the 20th of May; and from that time on winter apples are not so eagerly sought for. My last car the past season was shipped about the middle of May to filii l|» and although prices were low all through, yet 1 realized :J(M) pet cent for seven months' storage." At the conclusion of Mr. Dorr's paper a number of questions were submitted by members of the society. "Hy Mr. Heal — How much will such a house as you describe hold? ■•Mr. Dorr — It has a capacity of about ."&gt;,000 bushels. "Ity Mr. Seal — A1 what I I pi aw was yours erected? "Jiy Mr. S. B. Mann — Have you any secret in its construction, or any patents on your method? "Mr. Dorr — No; 1 apprehend the method of preserving fruit by uniform low temperature is too eld to be patented, and what I have learned is free to others. A great many people have vis - ited inv building, and I shall be glad to give you all the 'free - dom of the house.' "Ky Secretary (iarfield — How does your fruit stand up when ■exposed to the air, on the market? "Mr. Dorr — I can only answer by saving that last May my fruit sold over "&gt;(» per cent better to the dealers in Chicago than refrigerator fruit, simply because it would resist decay longer. "Hy Mr. B. W. Steerc — How much waste is them* in the fruit you store by rotting or specking? "Mr. Dorr — That d.ej»ends entirely on the variety.

"President Lyon— Certainly when apples begin to fall they should be gathered." In conclusion I will say that my object in presenting this paper to the Society is to preserve a record (easy of access) of i he results, thought, and experiments of our co-worker in a sisier society in the nope that some one may. some time, devise on the lines herein suggested an inexpensive, but at the same time a reliable storehouse as an aid to the orchardist in ob - taining a more profitable return for his persevering and patient labor. Spraying the orchard is one of the duties that the orchardist cannot neglect without loss of fruit or having his orchard de - stroyed by scab. Many insects that infest the orchard here in Nebraska, such as the tarnish plant bug. buffalo hopper, tent caterpillar, canker-worm, web-worm, leaf-roller, carcnlie, and worst of all, the codling moth, all of these pests can be kept in check or banished altogether by spraying at the right time. Such has been my experience. Nine or ten years ago the tarnish SPRAYING. J. A. Hu&lt;;c;, BHBLTOX. </seg>
            <seg id="p125">117 SPRAYING. plant bugs were so numerous in my orchard t hat they killed nearly all of the buds and bloom on my crabs and early apples for two or three years. When the trees would bloom, the bloom would die and drop off. The trees would have the appearance of having been through a tire, and I got no apples. I tirst laid it to frost or hot winds, but upon close examination I found the cause. I bought a spray pump and some London purple. I watched the trees in the spring when the buds began to open. The bugs would come in swarms all over the trees. Then 1 ■prayed with London purple added to the Bordeaux mixture. I cleaned the orchard of them, or so nearly so that I don't see any damage done by them for several years. I have sprayed my orchard every year since for the codling moth, and have sue ceeded in keeping it pretty clean of insects. I have saved sit per cent of my apples, while other orchards in this vicinity have gotten so infested that they don't get any fruit but that is more or less damaged. Mr. Win. Nutter, near (Jibbon, has a large orchard that has become so infested with the codling moth that he has thousands of bushels of apples every year that are worth - less. In 18'JG he had a large crop of apples. Kigiity per cent of them were worthless. In ls'.»7, under Professor Card's jtersua - sion and direction, he sprayed his orchard, and 88 pet cent were saved. Will give part of Mr. Nutters report to Professor Card. He says: "In storing away the apples this year we find that M per cent are sound, while in half of the remaining :iu per cent the damage is so slight that they would pass unnoticed. Last year, when the trees were uusprayed, only 20 per cent of the apples were salable. I thank you very much for inducing me to spray. Without your inducements I should probably never have done so. I think I see my way dear now to getting rid of the worms, or at least nearly so." In 1898 Mr. Nutter got hurt by a tree falling on him so that he was obliged to hire inexperienced help to spray, and not being able to oversee it the work was poor)] done, and as it was showery at the time, the 'result was that he did not have anv </seg>

Bpraying m**4 be done at the right time and done well to be of benetit. The tree must be thoroughly wet all over. I have one of Btahl'l No. 4 spray pumps fastened on to an oil barrel. In spraying young trees we can wet the tree all over by driving along, hut when we come to a large tree, we have to stop the team in order to get the tree thoroughly wet. Some have an idea that if they drive along and throw the spray over the tree, it is all that is needed; but work half done is worse than if not done at all. We go down one side of the row and back on the other. The time to spray for the scab is before the bud opens and the tree is free from foliage and the branches can be thoroughly wet, using the Bordeaux mixture. Spray for the codling moth just as soon as the bloom falls. Some of the varieties must be sprayed before others are done blooming. The calyx cup on some of the varieties closes up in a very few days after the bloom falls. It is necessary that the poison is gotton into the cup before it closes. I waited last spring until most of the bloom had fallen off the (Jenet trees (April 28) before we btgaa to spray. I found the calyx cup on the Wealthy and several other varieties completely closed so that no water could yet into the cup. The first spraying is the most important of all to get poiaon enough on the tree in the right place to catch the first brood. All of the observations that I have made show that at least !»&lt;) per cent of moth from the first crop enter the apple in the calyx, so that it is very important to get the poison in ahead of the moth before it closes. There are no eggs laid by moth for several days after the bloom falls and the apple has formed. The moth when it hatches does not try to enter the apple until it gets under cover in the calyx or under a leaf. If we can destroy the first brood, the work is practically done for that season. If any have been missed by the poison, by going oxer the trees and picking off all the apples that show worm dust on them in July before the moth leaves the apple, there </seg>

I use foarteea pounds of Paris frees and one pound strychnine to a barrel of fifty gallons of water. The lime holds the poison so that it doesn't wash off. We found the lime on the leaves in the fall that was then* all summer, l'rofessor Card in his report for 1808 gives dates for the times to spray two, three, and four times. The time to spray for the canker or web - worm is when you see them make their first appearance. In my paper at the summer meeting I told you what I had done in the spring: to check the codling-nwttt. I found after I went home that I had not completed the work. I used an outdoor cellar for storage room. All the windfalls and small apples are taken there to sort from and make into cider vinegar. The moth from there went to the orchard. I was surprised to tind moth on some trees that I had examined carefully in April and could not find a moth on them. It was a puzzle then until I found out afterwards. When the boys went over the orchard in July and picked off the wormy apple*, they put three or four bushels of Duchess in the cellar to let them ripen up. They were for - gotten until most of them ratted, and the moths hatched out. I have a water tank about four rods from the cellar. When the moths came out the tank was covered with hundreds of them for three or four mornings. Later in the fall I repaired the cellar. Kvery crack or crevice where a moth could hide was full of the empty shells where the moth had been. I found where the moths had come from to the orchard. It is n sary that we have screen doors on our storage rooms and keep all the moths that are gathered in with fall and winter apples and destroy them. If they act out they are very lively, fy fast, and en a kwg ways to an apple tree. .Mr. Nutter says the side of his orchard next to the storage rooms has the most moths, and on two rows along the edge of the orchard all the spraying that he did on them did not seem to have any effect, the moths were so numerous. While we are benefited by spraying it is necessary that we use other means to assist in keeping them from spreading. </seg>

Tliis plant louse, which appears in two forms, has become quite plentiful in portkMM of the state within the past few years. One of these forms iFig. li works upon the roots of the tree from one to several inches below the surface, where it does much injury. It is especially destructive to nursery stock where ii is permitted to multiply from year to year. The presence ot this root form is readily detected l»y the wart-like swellings which its attacks produce upon the roots; also by the "moldy" appearance of the root and Mtrounding earth. The lice insert their beaks into the bark of the roots and extract the juices which would otherwise go to nourish the tree. When they arc very nunieroils their injuries cause the roots to jrradually decay; and if they continue in their attacks the tr&lt; es eventually die. If upon examination you should discover these irregularities upon the finer roots of your apple trees, and at the same time notice the moldy looking spots, you inav lie sure that this loose is pivsent. and needs looking after. A closer examination will reveal the small pale-yellow lice, which sit concealed beneath their flaky covering in the crevices of the root deformities which their attacks have produced. These are also frequently acconi jianied by winged individuals of larger size.

"The apple-root plant louse is believed by some entomologists to Ik- a native insect, while others hold to the opinion that it has been imported from Euro]»e. It is nourished by sucking the juices of the tree, pierc - ing the tender roots with its proboscis. In the very young lice this instrument, when at rest and folded under the abdomen, is longer than the body, but in the mature specimens it is only about two-thirds the length of the body. While it usually con fines itself to the roots of trees,- it is sometimes found on the suckers that spring up around them, and sometimes also about the stump of an amputated branch, but in every instance it may be recognized by the bluish white cottony matter with which its body is covered.

This wo&lt;»]lv louse is very common in Europe, especially in Germany, the north of Fiance, and England, where it is more destructive than in this country, and. although generally known there under the name of the 'American blight,' it is believed to be indigenous to Europe, and to have been originally brought from Europe to America. It appears to thrive only in comparatively cold cli - mates, and in this country occurs in this [above ground] form most abundantly in the New England states."

Sometimes an entire tree will be thus modified. It is needless to state that this practically destroys the trees for bearing. Some of this work is shown upon two twigs in the accom - panying illustration. (Fig. 8.) This attack was observed only on the islands near the mouth of the River Plate. "Inder each of the little patches of down there is usually found one large female with her young.

The fore wings are large and about twice as long as the narrower hind wings. Late in the autumn the females deposit eggs for another generation the following spring, a fact which should induce fruit growers to take particular pains to destroy these lice wherever found, for the colony that is per - mitted to establish itself upon some worthless tree, or on the shoots or suckers at its base, will furnish the parents of count - hosts that may establish themselves next year on the choicest trees in the orchard. The insects are extremely hardy and will endure a considerable amount of frost, and it is quite probable that some of them survive the winter in the perfect Btate in the cracks of the bark of the ti "The eggs are so small that they require a magnifying glass to enable one to see them, and are deposited in the crevices •! the bark at or near the surface of the ground, especially about the base of suckers, where such are permitted to grow. "The young, when first hatched, are covered with very tine down, and appear in the spring of the year like little specks of mold on the trees. As the season advances, and the insect in - creases in size, its cottony coating becomes more distinct, the fibers increasing in length and apparently issuing from all the pores of the skin of the abdomen. This coating is very easily re moved, adhering to the fingers when touched. Hoth young and old derive their nourishment from the sap of the tree, and the constant punctures they make give rise to warts and excres cences on the bark, and openings in it, and. where very nu - merous, the limbs attacked become sickly, the leaves turn yellow and drop off, and sometimes the tree di&lt; This louse was noticed as earlv as 1848, at which time it was </seg>

If (he trees are to remain in the soil, the roots may be laid bare, and (he water used nearly boiling without injury; but where they have been taken up for the purpose of transplanting, and are to be dipped in the hot water, the (ein|&gt;eratiire should not exceed 156 F.ihr. ; under these circumstances, from ll'tl to UUP would suflice for the purpose.

As the season advances, some of the lice acquire wings, and, dispersing, found new colonies on other trees. When cold weather approaches, males as well as females are produced, and the season closes with the deposit of a stock of eggs for the continuance of the species another year." The habits of this aphis are very similar to that of the l.ox - elder Plant-louse, mentioned in the report for 1SS',»; and it is usually kept within bounds by the same insect enemies that attack that and other plant lice. ltEMEDIES. The kerosene emulsion, if sprayed over the trees at the time of hatching or afterwards, will kill all the lice that it reaches. If strong soap-suds is sprayed upon the trees at the time the buds are opening, or if weak lye or tobacco water be used in - stead, many of the young lice will be destroyed. Saumlers says "A frost occurring after a few days of warm weather will kill millions of them; in the egg state the insects can endure any amount of frost, but the young aphides qaieklj perish when are shown in Figs. 3 to S and also Figs. 13 and 14.

Like all other scale insects that habitually live beneath a seal* or shell-like covering, the young are active for only a few hours. after which they settle down and attach themselves by means of their long and slender beak to some portion of the plant upon which they are located. Here they soon become covered by a waxy Male, under which they continue to develop to maturity. The males obtain wings (we Fig. 10) and fly about, while the females always remain beneath their scales giving ffirth to living voting. This production of young continues for a period </seg>

The insect certainly does bear a striking likeness to the ani inal for which it is named. (See Figs. 22, a, and 23, d.) The insect may be known by the following brief description: The insect is green in color, is hunchbacked, about one-fourth to one-third of an inch in length, and is a great jumper. In its movements it is very active, and at the ap]tearance of an enemy will very quickly dart around to the opposite side of the twig upon which it is perched. Like all the representativ. the order to which it belongs, it is a sucker, i. e., it takes its nourishment by means of a beak which it inserts into the stems of tender and growing plants. The injury inflicted by this and other tree-hoppers when feeding is sometimes very great; but in this particular case the greatest damage is occasioned by the female in the deposition of its eggs.

The insect which is shown herewith in Fig. 'H\ quite frequently becomes very numerous during fall and spring and then gathers upon young trees in the nursery, where it does much injury by sucking the sap and killing the new growths.

It is known as the "Pear tree l'svlla" because it is more frequently found as an enemy of that tree than of the apple. In describing this insect Saumlers uses the following language:* * lusccts Jujurious to Fruits, by WiumSaiiiuI'-r*. .1. B. Lippincott «v &lt; ,, (Psylla pijricola Foerst.) </seg>

Flies and ants gather around in crowds to sip the sweets, and by their busy hustle draw attention to the mis - chief progressing. With a magnifying lens the authors of the injury may be observed immersed in the sap about the axils of the leaves." The insect is "a small, yellow, jumping creature, flattened in form and provided with short legs, a broad head, and sharp beak." Like the Aphidida? this insect lives upon the sap of the tree and when numerous rauses it to wither and droop. REMEDY.

This is the dark slate colored bag,, with red border and median line of same color, that is so common about houses and oat-buildings during fall, when it frequently becomes a nuisance on account of its habit of crawling over and into different things left standing about the house. In form it is somewhat flattened, about one third as broad as long. Its length, as will be - -Tile Box t-ldi-r But seen bj the hair line at the right of the figure.

Aside from the box elder tree, it also frequently gathers ujK&gt;n apples and other fruit, which it punctures with its beak and renders unpalatable, if it d&lt;xs not destroy them. ItEMEDY. On account of its habit of gathering into great clusters, it is not difficult to wage war against this bug. When thus gathered upon the ground. OB walls of buildings, or upon the trunks of trees, it can readily be destroyed by the use of kerosene or boil - ing water. Birds and other insect ivorous animals are not very partial to it. nor to any of the members of the order to which it belongs, all of which are very "odoriferous," and presumably not especially delightful to the taste.

In the case of the girdler (Fig. ;io&gt;, it appear! that the larva must feed upon dead wood, and that this dead wood must be in a special condition. To this end the female beetle punc - tures the twigs and lays her eggs as shown in the illustration at 6. She then proceeds to gnaw a groove around the branch below the point where the egg was deposited. The branch dies and the borer has dead wood upon which to feed.

A reference to figures 42 and 43 will show the readers of this paper the appearance and method of attack of another group of boring beetka that occasionally do much harm to trees of various kinds. These insects not only work on trees grown 42.— Ttmiaa ateogmplui».—[Uux.] for shade and ornamental purposes, but also upon those in the orchard and forests. While these insects usually attack dead or dying trees, they sometimes do considerable injury to living trees also.

It also gnaws into the bases of twigs and causes them to fall, as well as eats oft* tin- leaves later in the season. Be - sides all this, it has the habit of devouring the tender shoots or new growths. Like the Imbricated Snout Beetle, this k I weoril is gray. Saunders, in speaking of this insect, in his work entitled "'Insects In- jurious to Fruits.' says. -The beetle is said * to be more active at night than in day, and seems to show a preference for the tender, (y succulent shoots of the apple, although it I &amp; makes quite free with those of the peach, pear, plum, and cherry. Sometimes it oc- r&gt; k 6 &amp;SLn &lt;miis '" swarms i" nurseries, when it seri- JM ously injures the young trees.

The female, when about to deposit her eug, first gnaws a slit in the twig, as shown at a in the figure. This egg soon hatches, and the larva works in the stem. It is a rather large, yellowish, lleshy, footless grub. REMEDIES.

In most localities apple trees are attacked by one or BM&gt;re species of Tery small caterpillars that are known as '"bud - worms"' because of their methods of attack. These insects begin their work very early in the season by eating into the unopened buds. Where very numerous it is evident that much injury cm result to the trees. Three species of these insects are moderately common, viz.. the Eye spotted I '.ml moth [TmcUnrra orcUanm. and the "Apple-bad Worm" {Eccopxix malatun, and the Fringe wing Apple bad Moth iXothris .' malii/ciitilhn. The two former of these belong to the "leaf-rollers" or family Tortrieidre amonjj the moths, and as caterpillars protect themselves in some way by tjfmg the new or dead leaves with silk, and the last to the Tineidas or "leaf-miners." Tints last secies has been quite de structive in the adjoining states of Missouri and Kansas during late years; but up to the present has not been detected within Nebraska.* REMEDIES. Although the caterpillars begin their work quite early in spring, they continue to feed until after the fruit has formed and spraying has begun. They can usually be kept within bounds by the application of London purple or Paris green when used against the Codling moth and leaf-feeding caterpillars. MOTH WOOD-BORERS. (Co88idw and Scsiidce.) Nime of our most destructive borers that attack fruit and other trees are those belonging to the order Lcpidoptcm. Of these moth-borers there are two well-detined families, Scxiidw and Cosxidw. The &lt; ossids are all large-bodied insects, and their larvae are correspondingly large.

Al - though an exceedingly small insect for a moth, it makes up in numbers, as will be seen from the following quotation from the annual report of the I'. S. Entomologist for the year Is7!»: • • "The first brood was quite numerous, but when the .»' ■&gt; -ond brood be^an to make their cases, about the end of Sep - tember, the apple trees were a sorry si^ht to the orchardist. I have frequently counted from twenty -five to thirty separate mines in a single leaf, from which one can see what a great drain this insect must have caused upon the vitality of the plant. In early October, when permanent hibernating quarters had been taken up. the tree trunks and larger branches were fairly covered with the clustering cases. I have counted forty - n on a spot of bark not larger than a dime. In the crotches of the limbs, in the crevices of knots, and in similar places, they were particularly abundant. They were also to be found upon the &lt;nass and sticks at the base of the tree."

Tin- • (Fig. .")(!, b\ somewhat resemble in miniature those of u hen and are deposited in irregular masses, usually conceded beneath loose bark and similar objects. They hatch about the time that the apple tree unfolds its leaves in the spring, the date varying with the locality and season, from the middle of April to the latter par! of May. The young canker worms eat greedily and grow rapidly, usually attaining their full size in from three to four weeks from the time of issuing from the eggs. They then enter the ground to a depth of from two to the inches, ac - cording to the character of the soil. Here each one forms ;i small cell, which it lines with a few strands of silk, and shortly afterward transforms to the chrysalis, in which condition it remains until the following winter or early spring, wheii the change to the adult takes place. "Only one generation is produced each year.' REMEDIES. During ordinary years when everything is in a normal condi - tion the natural enemies of these canker worms keep them in cheek. These natural enemies are first of all the various kinds of birds that habitually frequent orchards and other places where these insects appear. Some beetles devour them, as do certain wasps which provision their nests with them. Some of the ich - neumon tlies and tachina tlies lay their eggs upon or within the bodies of canker worms and in that manner assist in keeping down their numbers. Besides these there are also chalcids which lay their eggs within those of the moths and in that man ner finding food for their young and destroying the host's eggs. Occasionally these natural enemies fail to do the work and it becomes necessary to protect our trees by mechanical or other means. A good spraying with Paris green or London purple (156 gallons of water to a pound of the poison) will do the work. The earlier this is done the better, since the quite young cater- </seg>

(Ay rot is, Mamestra, etc.) The cut worms are moderately large, fleshy worms tapering gentlj towards both ends. When full grows they average from one and one fourth to one and one-half inches in length, are dull yellowish white or gray, sometimes inclining to greenish, and clouded and striped or variously marked with dull black or smoky brown; sometimes, though rarely, with deep black and pare white.

Cut-worms are the young of a certain group of ••Owlet' ninths, which are also nocturnal in their habits. Hoth the larva' and mature insects are. as a rule, inconspicuous in color, being usually dull gray, brown, or black, or have these colors combined. There are upward of three hundred distinct •peciea of «ut - worms found within the limits of the United States; and perhaps fully one-third that number occur within our state. REMEDIES. The very best remedy that has thus far been suggested and tried against cut -worms is the use of poisoned grasses, cabbage leaves or clover. This is done by taking these substances and tying them into loose bunches, and then sprinkling them with a solution of Paris green, or London purple, say a tablespoonful to a bucket of water. Then in the evening scatter these poisoned baits over the Held between the rows of beets, cabbage, etc.. and about the bases of trees. The worms will be attracted to them, eat, and die. These baits should be renewed several times, at intervals of two to four days, according to the state of the weather and the abundance of the worms. All of these cut - worms are attacked by several kinds of parasites, both hy - inenopterous and dipterous. They are also devoured by a num - ber of predaceous beetles, while birds of many kinds an pecially fond of them. THE LEAF CRUMPLER. (Phycis indigcnclla Zeller.) This is an insect that causes much more injury to the apple and allied trees than is usually admitted by those who suffer loss from its ravages. Much has been written concerning the insect, which was first described in this country by Mr. Walsh. Later, Professor Eiley gave a very full account of it along with </seg>

The tube in which it spends most of its time is an excellent protection against birds and other natural enemies, while the crumpled leaves surrounding it serve to deceive the urchardist and induce him not to trouble it. The larva pupates within the tube, and hence remains protected on the tree. The moth issues, and the eggs for the coming genera - tions are laid during the summer. The eggs hatch shortly after being laid, and the worms begin feeding, and also the construc - tion of a tube for their shelter.

REMEDIES. ••It is obvious that the insect can be destroyed by collecting the bunches of crumpled leaves during the winter when thej are conspicuous, but probably the remedy that would prove most satisfactory now would be the use of London purple or Paris green ■prayed early in the spring, as soon as the worms begin their work. For this purpose it might be well to spray before the trees blossom. Where spraying is generally practiced for the Codling moth and other insect pests this is not at all likely to become troublesome, as the worms will, for the most part, I think, be killed by the later sprayings, and consequently few adults will appear to deposit eggs in summer.

LIFE-HISTOKY. The life-history of these beetles, although differing slightly among themselves, may be summed up practically as follows. Shortly after pairing, the female beetles creep into the earth, es - pecially wherever the soil is rough and loose and more or less covered by vegetation, and after depositing their eggs to the number of forty or fifty, die. These eggs hatch in from three to five weeks, and produce grubs that feed upon the roots of various plants and grow slowly for a little upwards of two years, when they change to the pupa stage within cells in the ground which they construct for themselves. Within these cells the beetles remain during the remainder of the summer, fall, and winter into the following spring, when they crawl to the surface and are ready to take active part in the destruction of all kinds of tree foliage and to prepare for the propagation of future generations. On account of their underground life the lame or grubs of the May beetle are very difficult to reach and destroy. They are art not without their natural ene- AW (§y inies, both vertebrate and in vertebrate, and by far the greater majority of them are thus destroyed between the time of hatching from the eggs Kic x?.— White Grub 1'arasite: «. im»i!o; b, head of larva: c, larva; &lt;(, cocoon.

All kinds of domestic fowls ml them greedily, while hogs industriously search for them by rooting over the ground where they occur in abundance. Mice, shrews, moles, ground squirrels, and skunks are also remarkably fond of both the grubs and bee - tles. Among their insect enemies the wasp known as Ti/thia inomatn Say is the greatest. This insect is shown in its several stages at Fig. 87. The larva of this Mack or bluish-black wasp attacks and destroys the grubs, after which it spins a pale brown elongate silken cocoon of the kind so frequently dug up when working the ground, and transforms to the pupa state, and later to the perfect Hy.

Kan.i by its atlacks daring May and June upon the apple tree, the leaves being the portions injured. In orchard trees the lower branches only, near the ground, have suffered, and these but slight. The greatest injury has been done in the nursery, where the beetle has often completely defoliated the spring set root-grafts, and the yearling trees, and has seriously injured even two-year-old tree*. The insect* are most active in bright, warm weather, and are then attracted to the trees in gi'eat abundance, where they feed upon the parenchyma [green pulp between the veins] of the leaf iFig. 89), avoiding the veins and midrib, these being sometimes all that remains after a few days preseuce of the tie. It is on the young shoots of the root-grafts that their work is the most injurious. In these they keep the new growth cut so dose that the graft sometimes fails to recover.

These last larre usually hi - bernate as such, especially northward — some in the orchard, others in storerooms, barns, cellars, and barrels, where they have been carried in the fruit from the orchards, this being the chief manner in which the insect has become so widely dis- seminated over the civilized world.

On account of the miscellaneous food habits of the Codling moth, there is no single remedy that will suffice to keep in ebeck and prevent its injuries to our apple crop. We must, therefore. adapt our remedies to the habits of the insect by 'Meeting it on all sides, and at different seasons of the year. The best remedy now known, and the only one by which the first brood is killed and a huge per cent of the fruit saved from their ravages. i« the use of one or the other of the arsenical sprays, composed of London purple or Paris green, with water. These are to*be ap plied just after the fruit has "sit" and before it has become heavy enough to droop or the calyx end to close up and turn downward. One or two thorough sprayings at this time will, it has been proved save at least seventy pec cent of the loss other - wise experienced. The ratio of these poisons best adapted for the purpose has not been definitely ascertained, since this varies with conditions of climate, latitude, etc. About four ouuci the l'aris green and three of the London purple to the barrel of water will probably be sufficiently strong to kill the worms and at the same time not injure or kill the foliage during or - dinary weather at this time of year. Stack other remedies as the gathering of '•wind-falls," and destroying them, or turning hogs and sheep into the orchard to either feed upon or trample upon the creeping worms; the jarring or picking of infested fruit from the trees; the gathering and destruction of the cocoons containing larva? and chrysalids from the trunks and branches of trees; the killing of moths in various ways; and the trapping of the larvae by using bandages, shingles, etc.; all of these remedies, with which every fruit grower is more or less familiar, through personal experience, do of course come in play as the opportunities permit during the year, and combined, do much good. Like all other injurious insects, the Codling moth is preyed upon by certain of the birds, and also has certain true parasites that destroy many of the worms, which otherwise would be per </seg>

Mr. President: At the close of the exposition the Nebraska &lt; ommission asked me, together with all of the other superin - tendents, to submit a report of the work done in my department during the exposition. When this topic was assigned me by the society, I prepared a paper covering practically the same ground. I have just recently received a copy of the report of the Be - braska Commission to the governor, containing my report in full, and after looking the matter over I concluded that that re port was better suited to the purpose than the paper I had pro pared for this meeting. I will, therefore, read that report, m&gt; that it may be preserved in our reports and in preparing for any future expositions we may know what was done by Nebraska at the Trans Mississippi. To William NtvUk, Prmiimi Xrbraska Commission, Trans-Mis sissippi Exposition, Omaha, \~&lt;h Cikntlemex: I respectfully submit to your Board the follow ing report of work done in my department since its organization to date: At the time of appointment, August 23, the Board had apart no certain amount to make an exhibit, and the work at this time was to a large extent preliminary and finding out what material could be had to make an exhibit. Upon looking the ground over it was found that a good exhibit could be se - «uml. At a later meeting the Board secured 1.21)0 square feet of space in the Horticultural Building for use of this depart - ment, and space around the Nebraska Building for parking pur poses, and at a later meeting in March set apart fl.000 for use in tins department, and appointed Mr. A. W. Shickley, of Geneva, assistant superintendent. </seg>
            <seg id="p222">214 NEBRASKA STATE HORTieCI.TlRAL SOCIETY. We commenced active work at this time, laid out spai «■ around the Nebraska building for flower beds, and sodded in - tervening space with blue grass sod. These beds were planted with blooming plants, and the exhibits of flowering plants were confined to this space, as it was the most economical way to make an exhibit of dowering plants on account of their perish able nature. (Ireat credit was due the following florists for plants to make this exhibit: Paul Paulson, L. H. Henderson. R. H. Davey. Paul B. Flotli. Peterson Kios.. and Chapia Bros. A luge variety of plants was exhibited, among which were 11 varieties of geraniums. 71 of cactii, IS of roses, li ( of cannas. 5 of alternant hera. 'SA of colcus. i&gt; of salvias. besides many others sudi as heliotrope, verbenas, etc Youngera A Co.. Bunerymen of Genera, who exhibited a Ine group of evergreens , consisting of tine specimens of the fol - lowing: Picea pungens. Douglas spruce. Abies concolor. lilai k Hill spruce and other commoner kinds. Marshall l'.ros. of Ar lington also had a tine group of the following: Black Hill spruce, white pine, arbor vit;e, silver spruce, and cedars. These gentlemen deserve great credit, as no charge was made for theme exhibits. Some of these were especially fine specimens and peo - ple are just beginning to see that evergreens can be grown sue - fill 1 x in Nebraska. The exhibit in the Nebraska building consisted of the foun - tain, which was especially tine during the hot weather, as the cool, running water seemed very refreshing. This fountain waa kept decorated with palms and llowers, and palms were had on all occasions to decorate the Nebraska building. The display of vases was placed on the steps at the entrances and at the east side consisting of both iron and rustic vases, also a display of hanging baskets in the Nebraska building. The exhibit proper in the Horticultural building was in place on June 1st aad was ready for the opening. This was a very valuable exhibit. The collection of palms consisted of forty four varieties, one of which (Cvcas circinalisi was of the value of </seg>

In this collection there were especially tine varieties shown, such as Pandanus veitchii ami Fleas variegata. Of cactii 104 varieties, nearly the entire list, was shown, all native cactii ind many from other states and Mexico. Especial mention is made of a large AgaTe americana. probably the larg - est in the United States, valued at f 1,000. Collection of ferns, thirty-seven varieties. All of the above was in the nature of a competitive exhibit, and was entered in the name of the state of Nebraska and se - cured a gold medal and diploma. The exhibit has attracted very favorable comment, and at the time of the National Florists' Convention florists from the east were very agreeably surprised at the exhibit shown and the work done in the floral line. It has been an object lesson to all, es pecially as we are a young state and many supposed that Ne - braska had nothing worth showing to the floral world and 1 believe has increased to a large extent the desire of our own people to go and do likewise, as it has shown them that plants, (lowers, shrubs, and trees can be successfully grown and used to beautify the house and grounds. We commenced our display of cut flowers at the time of the Florists" National Convention which met here. Our display at that time consisted principally of vases and jardinieres tilled .with roses, carnations, petunias, tube roses, asters, and glad - ioli. This display was renewed each day and was supplied by Chapin Bros, of Lincoln and was awarded a gold medal and diploma. On September 12 to Hi, during the exhibit of the State Hor - ticultural Society a special display of cut flowers and designs was exhibited, among which were large designs made up of roses, ferns, carnations, and smilax; also baskets and vases of choice cut flowers which were among the principal attractions </seg>

This display was entered in the name of the state and secured a silver medal and diploma. Great credit is due W. J. Hesser, the palm grower of Platts - mouth, for his valuable collection of palms, ferns, and cactii. His collection was entered for an award and secured a gold medal and diploma. S. B. Stewart, of Omaha, made a display of bulbs during the months of September and October, consisting of lilies, hyu cinths, tulips, crocus, snowdrops, and many others. This exhibit secured a gold medal and diploma. Credit is also due to the following florists and private per - sons who kindly aided us in every possible way. Dr. George Roberts, of Creighton, Neb. ; Frey &amp; Frey and Chapin Bros., of Lincoln, Neb.; Paul Paulson, A. Donahue, Jr., L. Henderson, Peterson Bros., S. D. Stewart, and Paul Floth, of Omaha; also to the State University. I have returned to the owners all plants and material loaned my department and hold their receipt therefor. I also append l&gt;elow a list of state property used in my department and hold a receipt of the custodian appointed by Land Commissioner Wolfe that same has all been returned in good condition; also an itemized list of the expenditures of my department. In closing this report I wish to especially thank yourself and the members of the Nebraska Commission. You have at all times done all in your power to assist me in making this de - partment a success and our relations have been most pleasant. Your selection and appointment of Mr. A. W. Shickley, of Gen - eva, Neb., as assistant superintendent was especially wise, as to him is due in a large measure the success of this department. He has been an especially faithful workman and an obliging gentleman. Again thanking you, I am yours truly, L. C. Chapin, Superintendent Floriculture. ♦■ </seg>

I also wish to say to the florists that as this is the first exposition we have had, they have seen what has been accomplished by all taking hold and doing their part. I hope in the future they will take hold Ei this Horticultural Society and by their united efforts show s what can be done for the development of floriculture in the tate. DISCUSSION. Dr. Bessey — I should like to ask whether Mr. Chapin's sum - mer has enabled him to answer this question: Those of us who study plants rather critically from the standpoint of the botan - st find that in a dry climate like this the native plants lose much of their delicacy. As you pass from the east to the west, ilants of the same species become harder and more coarse here on the plains. It was a matter of a great deal of interest to ne to know what the outcome would be when the plants and flowers gathered from the florists on the plains were brought iu competition with those brought in from other regions. Did other florists bring in flowers from other places? Mr. Chapix — They were brought in from almost everywhere; New York, New Jersey, Ohio, California, and all around. Dr. Bessey — What was the outcome when you made the com - parisons? Mr. Chapix — We didn't need to be ashamed of our efforts. Dr. Bessey — How do you account for it? Mr. Chapix — I account for it by the fact that we here in Ne - braska live in a little bit better place and are a little bit better people than anybody else. Dr. Bessey — I am talking science Mr. Chapix — Yes, sir; so am I. I was greatly astonished many times during the summer. Take it when the florists had their convention there; we have always held those eastern men in awe in regard to their abilities, both in a business way and </seg>
            <seg id="p226">218 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. as to what they know, and I tell you that we don't need to worry about that at all. I think it is a fait that in some way living out here on the plains broadens us out. while they run along in the same old rut. They may go pretty fast in that nit. but get them out of that into the bogs aod they are soon swainjied. I found the same thing to be true of their plants ;it the exposition. In sunn- way the plants which they sent out. and plants of the same kind which had been grown here in Ne braska. when placed side by side, showed quite a marked con - trast in favor of the Nebraska grown product. Dit. Besset — Apparently the Nebraska grown plant ha« adapted itself so that it is able to withstand the Omaha climate better than a plant of the sain.- kind brought from the east. Mk. Thai-in— That is it exactly. Dr. Bessey — That is one potat, and it is rerj inn-resting and very practical. The other is. how do the cut flawed brought from the »-ast and those brought from our own climate stand side by side? Mk. &lt;'n.vri\ — There were very few cut flowers brought in. Of course, there were a few during the warm weather, but that in our favor because we were at home and they had to conn - from a distance, and their flowers drooped quicker. That would be no indication, however, that our flowers were hettef than theirs, for cut flowers are in a little different light than ai most anything else. After they are cut the substance comes from the water in the vases, and as they were all greenhouse grown, there wonld be very little difference in their keeping qualities under exactly the same conditions. Dr. Bessey — Did yon have an opportunity of comparing plant.* grown out of doors here and those grown out of doors elsewhere? Mr. Chapin — To a certain extent, but not entirely, of ttmwat the plants sent in from the east, after they got here, came right under our climatic conditions, and received the same treat men' as plants from the west. Dr. Bessey — I was hoping that out of it would eeme - </seg>

I thiii}; as to the effect of the climate on tin- Uoaaoming of plants in Me &lt;-limato and another, of coins*', when \v&lt;- &lt; ompaif j:i house plants, climate is not a factor. We know, for example, that we cannot grow roses out of doors bete as an ordinary thin&lt;i. There are places where you can jjrow roses as easily as we grow tomatoes: and I was in hopes that there would !»•• something to show whether there was a different- between tin - home grows lower out of doors and one of the same kind •Mown in the ea- Mi!. Chapu — I am glad you s|M&gt;ke of that. Allow me to a word in regard to a matter of quite a little importance. Dur - ing this exposition, from oejrinniii}: to end. we had as tine plants and as fine sod as you eoald find anywhere in this whole hroad T'nited States. Even pansies set out in April were in as fine i-ondition in September as any 1 ere* saw anywhere, and they were rifrht out in the opea where they go( no ■hade at all. In fact, the best bed of pansi«s we had there was on the south side of tlie Horticultural baildiag, right in the open. From tfci gjaaiag to the end of the exposition all of the plants, the 'annas, Aerbenas. gtadioH, and the vines we had gTWWteg over the colon - nades, were as fine as could be had; a very rank growth, and al - ways in bloom. Dr. Bessey — How did you manage it? Mr:. &lt;"hai'in — Simply by giving them attention. Our clin od eaoagh; that has beta proven there. Both in regard u&gt; the s&lt;k1 and the flowering plants the climate is all ri&gt;:ht. Why. when Mr. Hadkinson took hold of that work in Manh the ground was ju&gt;t ;is bare ;i~ one of the streets of Lincoln, and had miii'li the same appearun&lt;-e; yet by the tirsr day of June be as velvety a sod there as you could see anywhere, and it waa kept so to the very rlose of the eXpOMtiOB. We 1 i lie a lawn there as you coald s&lt;-e in any of the eaattw with their boasted climate, and it was simply bccaaae it I the j rojK-r care. We eaa'1 expect to have these lowcn and tine lawns u: giTe them attention, and I r jx-opi </seg>

Of course those flowers and shrubs on the exposition grounds were planted carefully and then watered; they had plenty of water at all times, and it seems to me that flowers and shrubs couldn't have done better anywhere. C.overxor Fcrxas — If Professor Bessey will permit me I should like to make an inquiry. Twenty-five years ago when we first took our fruits from here to Boston, Richmond, and other j&gt;hii-»'s, the coloring and size of our fruits, among other charac - teristic*, attracted the attention of pomologists. Dr. Warder examined some of our Ben Davis, and from their size and color was in doubt as to whether they were Ben Davis apples or not until he cut them. This matter which you have been talking about, the superior coloring of our flowers and fruits in this climate, has been seen and acknowledged everywhere. You, as a scientist, can probably tell us more in particular how that oc - curs, and I ask you that question now: Whether it is the ex - cessive sunshine, or absence of shade, or what it is that causes that superiority in the size and coloring of our fruits, and in the coloring of our flowers? Dr. Bessey — It is all in the sunlight. Sunlight means color, and, as brought out by Mr. Cliapin. water means growth. Put those two things together and you get what you want. (lovF.KNoii Furxas — Your explanation corresponds with my theory in regard to the coloring, yet I think there is something in the soil of this country here which gives a superior growth and strength to vegetation. The President — Before leaving this ■object I would like to ask Professor Bessey another question. I noticed at the expo - sition that the evergreens brought in there from this state ied to be a little more stocky and compact than the ever - greena brought from the east. I also noticed that the trees from our own state commenced growing quicker and put on a better growth than the eastern trees did. My idea of that was that our trees had been taken from a poor pasture and put in a better </seg>
            <seg id="p229">221 NEBRASKA PLOBICCLTUBB. one, while those from the east had been brought from a better to a poorer pasture. Would that make the difference? When I sji.v pasture I mean care, attention, etc. Dr. Bessey— I think the difference is referable to that same unlight question. F\ei\body knows that if you grow two ilants, one on more light than the other, the plant that grows 11 more light is always more stocky. If you grow plants in a reenhoOM and have the glass somewhat shaded, the plants are Irawn. If you have two pines, one in Nebraska where there is unlight almost all of the time, and another in the east where irobably half of the daylight is cloudy, your tree in the east vill be a more slender tree. I think there is no question but hat your plant becomes more slender because of that. I desire to ask a question, but will make my statement first: Last fall, in going east as far as Cleveland. Ohio, I noticed as 1 sat on my mother's porch and looked at the maple trees, that the foliage was much less dense than the foliage of maples in Nebraska, the same kind of trcd standing in the same positions. I had not thought of it before, bat from that time 1 took more particular notice, and as 1 came back from the east it seemed to me that I was able to make out this: That the foliage of the same kinds of trees is denser as you come to regions in the west where there is more sunlight. The statement of the president with regard to the evergreens corroborate! my own conclusions. I had intended to keep qniet about this and say nothing about it until I had investigated it further, but since the subject has been brought up I want to ask whether the members of this so - ciety have made that observation, or whether now from their recollection they can indicate whether that is true. Goreraor Furnas, what has been your observation? Governor Furxas — My observation is that the foliage in the west is more dense and of a deeper color. Dr. Bessey — I would like to know, Mr. President, if that is the general observation of members of this society. Mr. Harrison — I have spent several seasons east as well us </seg>
            <seg id="p230">222 NEBRASKA STATE IIOKTK I I/ITItAI. SOCIETY. west. In regard to the evergreen*, I think perhaps the stock condition of the western trees may have been due to the fa&lt; that they were oftener transplanted here than in the east. I comparing the different ones on the grounds, I thought ]&gt;erha| the difference might be owing to that fact At the east the have a system of frequent transplanting to make a tree stock.\ and if a tree is neglected, of coarse it will spindle up, thoug I do think shade ma^kes a good deal of difference. I went dow east expecting to live there, but to my astonishment, and per haps to yours. I got back here again. I think last year down east the sun shone about one hour in ten. I don't wonde that trees struggle desperately to get up where there is a littl light. Mr. Yotngf.rs — The evergreen trees that we find in the moun tains, where they do not grow in thick patches, grow very stock\ although they have never been transplanted. Take the Pice* pungens up in the mountains, and my observation is that the\ are a very stocky tree. Mb. Lokosdorf — I have noticed the same thing referred to by (Jovernor Furnas and others in regard to the foliage in the west being denser and the leaves appearing to l&gt;e thicker on tIn - same varieties of trees than in the east. It always seemed to me that it was nature adapting itself to the different conditions. I think the trees need to be protected to a certain extent from the rays of the very same sun that causes the high coloring of the fruit, and the leaves thicken just as the fruit changes accord - ing to the conditions under which it is grown. That has al ways been my idea: that it was simply nature adapting itself to the surrounding conditions. Mb. YdTNCKus — I have also noticed a difference in the bark. Take. say. a soft maple grown in Illinois, one in Nebraska, and one in Colorado, and there will be as much difference as there is between day and night. The bark of the Colorado tree will be almost perfectly white; the Nebraska tree will be darker: while the one in Illinois will be almost black. The first lime </seg>

I saw the maples in the streets of Dearer I thought they had been painted or whitewashed, but it is simply the natural color there caused by the effects of the sun. W. J. IIKSSEH, I'LATTSMOUTH, XKB. The wonderful growth of this branch of floriculture in the last quarter of a century is almost incredible. If seems but a few years ago thai it was generally ■opposed that palms and ferns could only be grown in conservatories or greenhoasea by the wealthy, and that they could not be grown in a common living room. lint how changed to-day, where you will see a few j alms and ferns in most every house where plants are kept, and often you will tind some very Hue specimens grown in a tiring room. Of course, ihe prices are very different to-day from twenty nve years ago. Well do I remember the trai two small ] alms I bought, over twenty jean ago. for which in Philadel - phia I paid $2 each, and to day I sell as good of the same variety and size for ten cents, and sell hundreds of them. Palms and ferns are not so difficult to grow as many think. With constant care they can be successfully grown where a gcraninni can. yet they will thrive in a window where they do not gel direct ranlight. One of the great serrets of success is constant care and watch - fulness. In watering, so many people think if they water their plants once a day that is all that is required. While in the main that would be sufficient, many times twice a day at least would not be enough. Plants should never be allowed to get so dry that the foliage wilts or the tender roots perish. Often if s-t in or near an open window where a strong wind strikes them, they might perish if watered twice a day. while on a cloudy or damp day they might not need water for two or three days. There can be no set time for watering plants. Water when dry or TIIK &lt;;K&lt;&gt;\\ - 1 X&lt; ; OF PALMS AND FERNS IJV AMATEIRS </seg>

Many think plants should not be watered while the sun i shining. That is all right so far as spraying the foliage, becaust if sprayed or sprinkled while the sun was shining bright, es pecially under glass, the foliage would likely be burnt o blistered in spots, but when the soil begins to get dry, wate them, sun or no sun. Plants set near radiators in winter might dry out many that a day, and if the "once a day rule" was adhered to, you wouh soon have some sick plants. The tender roots would be dea&lt; Then the grower often tries to make up for lost time by keepin them constantly soaked with water, which is sure to haste the death or prolong the sickness of the plants. You migl just as well give a sick prison a large mess of rich, strong too to help them become stout at once. It would surely be the n verse with persons and plants. The water is taken up by th tender roots and evaporated through the foliage. If the root have jK'rished by being too dry, they cannot take up as muc water as when they have plenty of roots. If the foliage is gon or a large portion of it, the plant does not evaporate as muc water as if it was full of foliage and vigor. When the roots or foliage are injured or gone, overwatering is easily done; still the plants should have water before the] dust-dry. Overwatering is equally as injurious if persisted in, but is not so likely to occur except in real cloudy, cold, moist weather. The foliage should often be syringed or sprayed. Where thi cannot be doue in a living room, then use a sponge to keep then clean. They do not require direct sunlight, yet must not be kep in a dark room long at a time. They should have plenty o light, and in dwellings there is but little danger of burning b\ setting them in a south window if kept from getting dry, es pecially in any season except midsummer. An east window i perferable. In midsummer a north window is all right, but do </seg>
            <seg id="p233">GROWING OF PALMS AND FERNS BY AMATEURS. 225 not try to grow a palm or fern entirely away from some window or light. They will live, but cannot make a good growth if long kept from direct li^lit. • The soil I use for potting is rotted sods, cut as for sodding and turned upside down in a pile until well rotted or the grass is dead. Then break it up — not too fine, unless for very small pots. Mix with one fifth sharp sand and as near as much well - rotted manure. Cow manure preferable, though I often use old hot-bed manure. I have mixed it with the sod when I put it up. Later, chop up with spade, then add sand as I use it. This is possibly the best way for amateurs. Every grower of plants should keep a pile of such soil in some out-of-the-way corner, so as it will be ready for use at any time. In potting palms and ferns I mainly use drainage in the bottom of the pot, such as broken pots, coal cinders, charcoal, or anything to keep the soil from packing in bottom of the pot, to prevent an overamount of water remaining in the pot; but be sure the soil is always soaked through and through. Whenever you water them wait until sufficiently dry to need water again. I am often asked, which is the best variety of palms to grow? This, in some respects, would be difficult to answer. There are several good varieties, equally easy of culture. Some fancy one variety and some another. I tind in my business that the Latauia Borbonica (the real Chinese fan palm; is called for more than any other variety. It is a good grower and does well in a living room; also it is very attractive as a decorative plant. Probably Areca Lutescens is next most called for. It is an elegant genus, with pinnated, arching leaves. The stem and sheathing petioles are perfectly smooth, yellow in color, mottled with black. It does best in shaded places. It is a native of Mascareen. It branches at the roots and throws up many suck era. Areca Rubra is a very pretty graceful palm from Mauritius. It has reddish-brown pinnated leaves. It is not as hardy as the Lutescens, but worthy of a place in every collection. </seg>

It is hardy and very decorative, even when small, though more expensive than most other palms, hut is always in demand. Kenlia Fosteriana is similar to K. Helmoreana. with heavier foliage and more robust growth. It is a grand decorative palm. Roth Kentias are natives of the Lord Howe Islands. Next in demand is the Phoenix Heclinata. which is one of tin - best I'luenixes for culture. The drooping pinnated leaves arc of a dark green. This also makes a beautiful decorative palm. Phoenix Kyi vest ris. the wild date, is very similar to the la*t mentioned. I*. Tennis is more upright and has a more slender growth. It is a good grower and is admired by all. V. (anarieiisis is another slender variety. With me it has been subject to rust, otherwise it is of a very desirable sort. Chaina'iops Kxcelsia has fan shaped leaves. Bather upright in growth and quite hardy. ChamaTops Humilis (anarieiisis is a deep and tine cut leaf variety. Corypha Australia is similar to Chamserops Excelsia, except the leaf stems have short sharp spines. Seaforthia Elegans is a good grower, rather frail, but on ac count of its rapid growth and beauty for decorations it is often tailed for. Oreodoxia Begia, or Royal palm, is similar to the above, only much more slender. It has long, slender, pinnated leaves, but never more than three to four leaves at a time. It is often called for. Rhapis Flahelliformis is a very hardy and ornamental .Jap anese palm, with many slender steins and leaves tlabellate, upon short foot stalks and of a dark green color.

The leaves are very peniateat, so that a plant with a stem of six feet may frequently he seen with perfect leaves down to the very bottom. Khapis Hinnilis is very similar. Tlie steins are more slender and foliage lighter. I had a large plant of this specimen at the exposition which was admired by many thousand people. Cycas Kevoluta. or Bago palm, is always in demand and is admired by every one.

In appearance inncli resemble a large ostrich feather. Itut unfortunately this one is rather tender for winter culture, but seems to want to rest, but in summer is a real beauty all the time and is worthy a place where a collec - tion is kept. Every one who sees it admires it very much. Xephrolcpsis I&gt;a\ allioides Furcans is a good decorative fern with the ends of the leaflets curiously cut out and divided. Pteris Treiiiula is possibly the best of its class. It is a native of New Zealand, grows two feet in height. The leaves are finely pinnated, from six to ten indies broad. Pteris Argyrea (sometimes called silver fern). Fronds beau tifully variegated with white, is a very pretty variety, and reasonably easy of culture. Pteris Cretica Allo Lineata is a beautiful dwarf fern and very suitable for jardinieres and fern dishes. Pteris Serruletta and Serruletta Crestata are good hardy feraa for baskets and jardinieres. P. Longifolia has leaves from twelve to eighteen inches long and four to six inches wide. Leaves pinnated. Adiantum Capillus Yeneris. the common maiden hair fern, is rather a dwarf. It is a hardy pot fern. A. Cuneatum is one of the best all around Adiantums. I much for cutting. A good one for baskets or fern dishes. A. Farleyense is the finest maidenhair fern grown. Bather delicate for house culture, yet with care it can be grown fairly well, but must have heat and moisture. A. Consinatum Latinii is a tall, upright growing variety and is a desirable one. Alsophilla Australis is one of the finest and largest of the Australian tree ferns, and is very desirable plant, while small for house plant, later when large a grower for greenhouse. </seg>

OUTDOOR ROSES. W. R. ADAMS, OMAHA. In writing on this subject I shall begin by mentioning tin countries from which we principally have drawn our supplies of this most popular flower: America, the Hritish Isles, Frame Cermany, Persia, Syria. -Japan, and China. Some of the vane ties are the Province, Damask, Noisette, Ayrshire. I.oursault Hanksia. Multiflora. etc. From these we have derived, by hv bridization and crosses, the few varieties, out of some l'.."&gt;«Mi which are in general use for outdoor cultivation. The propagation of the outdoor rose is done by division, by cutting, grafting, and by budding. ctl.TlVATlON. It has been found that a rich loamy soil is requisite for the </seg>

Where manure is added to the soil it should be well rotted, and thor - oughly mixed therewith before planting is done. In heavy clay or other tenacious soil the addition of some sharp sand will be necessary to make it sufficiently pliable. Planting should not be done in a wet or spongy soil; you will have to underdrain with those conditions. Deep digging is one of the reqnkrit&lt; the successful cultivation of the &lt;|'ieen of lowers. In making a new rose bonier, or bed. subsoil to the depth of two or two and one half feet. The most approved method of doing this is to make a trench the required depth, and say two feet wide, carrying the soil removed to the other end of your l&gt;ed. then commence digging your top spit into the bottom of the trench, following on in rotation till the end is reached, when you re - turn the soil hist removed.

These will be pruned only in such a manner as to preserve the desired form. Climbing roses are pruned so as to give a length of cane com mensurate with the height of trellis, porch, or wall, to which they may be attached, undesirable wood is removed, and laterals are cut back to a few buds. PLANTS OF EASY CULTURE. W.M. H. ELLSWORTH. I have been asked to write a paper on the subject of "Plants of Easy Culture." It Might be supposed that this would be an easy matter, but after some thought on the subject I find i anything but easy. The first question is, "What are the varie ties of plants that are easily cultivated?" First, I will saj those that grow outside all the year round, and of these wil write first. We will arrange them in groups. The first and per haps the most inipoi-innt group consists of campanulas, delphin iums, iris, paeonies, platycodon, perennial phlox, veronicas, an&lt; others. We do not pay enough attention to this class of plants Visitors to the Omaha parks are surprised to find so fine a dis play of them, and more are planted every year. These plant can be bought in Omaha, Council Bluffs, and other places. Bu, them near your home if you can. Large plants can be moved a short distance better than from places five hundred or a thou sand miles away. This class of plants must be planted early in the spring before the plants begin to grow, say April 1. I hav set out plants of this group and had them flower the first season The essentials to success are these: First dig the ground on foot deep; use cow manure enough to cover the ground three inches deep; destroy all insects. Plant your plants in th </seg>
            <seg id="p241">233 PLANTS OF EASY CULTURE. ground, not on top. When perennial phlox are planted and the ground fixed around them I would rather have them in the center of a depression than on a bill. They will be above ground enough in a year or two. Do not plant too close. Aquelegras, phlox, pseonies, and campanulas, three feet apart each way; half that distance for veronica. In the Omaha parks phlox are planted in borders with roses. The effect is grand, especially late in the season when the phlox are best. Then Paul Neyron roses have some long growths capped with large pink roses six inches in diameter. Visitors will say. "Where can we buy these things?"' We answer, "In Nebraska if you wish; in Council Bluffs, la., Omaha or Geneva, Neb." Do not forget to water your plants well. The next group to be considered consists of pansies, verbenas, petunias, lobelias. These can be grown from the seed, but plants ltought from the florists will bloom in the early season. Those sown late in the spring will bloom late in the season. Some years what we call the late season is so very short. The burn - ing dry hot weather continues almost until time for frost. Therefore, gardeners like to have this second group of plants planted early and rely upon geraniums, etc., for blooming in the middle season. Of pansies, try to have some plants for early and some for late blooming. For the third class we will include ageratums, verbenas, be - gonias, geraniums, heliotrope, carnations, petunias (double), salvias, and coleus. The ageratum iblue) will make a fine border plant for salmon-colored geraniums. Begonias (white) will make a border for Salvia splendens. Scarlet geraniums planted in a bed bordered with coleus, or what is better, a yellow leaf geranium, as coleus are often injured by first cold snaps. Ver - benas are fine when many kinds are planted together in a large bed. Some plants of each kind of the above group may be taken up and potted in early fall and placed in a shady place until established. These plants will be almost as good for winter blooming window plants as those kept in pots all summer. </seg>

Practical floriculture, the subject assigned inc. is certainlj MM tlmt means a great deal, and linich more tlian I am able t&lt; tell you. In the first place, the word "practical" means tha which reduces our knowledge or theories to actual use. whicl is derived from practice or experience, as practical skill 01 knowledge. "P"loriculture" means the cultivation or culture o flowers, or flowering plants, and the two words together cer tainh give us a great field to work in, and with the sharp coin petition we now have, we must learn to go at our labors in : practical way. We can all learn a great deal every day of on lives, if we give our attention to our labor as we should. If \v» wish to prosper, we must give up fogyism. The same method practiced a few years ago will not do to day. as the same qnallt; of a rose or carnation that would sell a few years ago at a goo&lt; price will hardly sell to-day at any juice. Therefore, we ar compelled to grow a better quality of stock, and in order to do that we must adopt different methods. I am sure we all make mistakes, and often go to unnecessar expense, where we could have saved it, had we given it th proper thought and attention. For instance, we change ou soil in the benches every year for our roses and carnations, have tried two large houses of carnations, two different yean by leaving the soil in. and giving it about two inches of wel rotted manure, and I find that I have had just as good result from those as I had from Ihe ones where we changed the soi and I think, as I have just said, that we all make a great man mistakes by going on in the same way we did a few years age doing a great many things that we think is necessary, when, i fact, they are not, and at the same time, we overlook otlx J.

Therefore, the more perfect we ran them, the more we may ezped to disuse of, as it is their beauty for which they are bought, for tiowers and plants add a charm to any home surroundings. They do more. Their presence is a pleasure through influence* that appeal to our highest sense of taste and refinement. Therefore, we must keep quality a con - stant aim. be up to date in our ideas and actions, and adopt methods, if possible, so as to be able to sell at moderate prices, and at the same time make a profit that will be encouraging to ourselves. The experience of many is certainly more valuable than the experience of a few. That In'ing a fact, let us all be more liberal toward one another in expressing our ideas, so that we may improve, as much as possible, the cultivation and qual it v of flowers, which will, I trust, DC appreciated by the public, and at the same time beneficial to us all. l'AKKS AND FORKSTS. REV. C S. HARRISON. YORK. It has been my privilege to visit many of the noted parks of the east belonging to the public and to individuals. I note that most of the grounds of the millionaires are planned for my eye as well as for theirs, and they are really public resorts kept at private expense. The rich man is not necessarily selfish. He plans and plants and builds for his neighbors as well as himself. Sitting with a friend one day on the porch of his tine residence in P&gt;rooklyn, we looked over the way to the rare collection of flowers and plants kept by his wealthy neighbors. He said, "Those are all mine; I get the full benefit of them without" a cent of expense." </seg>
            <seg id="p244">236 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. The grounds of H. H. Hunnewell at Wellesley, Mass., are worthy of note. In the spring there is a paradise of beauty, es - jtecially when the azaleas and rhododendrons are in bloom. There is a feast for the eye and soul such as never greets us in the west. There is a splendid collection of deciduous trees and shrubs, also of conifers gathered from different lands. Chief MMBg them and the pride of the owner are the Picea pungens and Abies concolor of the Rockies. The last of these was im - ported from England at great expense under an impressive name, but is nothing more nor less than a beautiful type of our own silver fir. The grounds are tastefully laid out and reach down to the charming lake near the college where the girls have their boating clubs. These grounds add great attraction to the college. Teachers and students get the benefit without the expense of maintaining then). The grand old man is the silent professor of esthetics and beauty, giving that army of young ladies some of the best instruction possible without the payment of a dollar. The grounds of Mr. Nevins, of South Framingham, are very fine. The contour of the land is such that the plans of the designer are shown to the best advantage. The park lies near a body of water which enhances the effect. The owner has passed away but his impress is left. His work and vast outlay are for the benefit of his neighbors. The chief attractions are t In- Rocky Mountain trees, which in that congenial climate put on their fairest garments, their silvery sheen absolutely flashing in the sunlight. C. H. Curry, of Methnen. Mass., has newed rare skill in laying out his ample grounds. His gardener is a Scotchman, rugged as his own native hills, but with a brain stored with hard sense, with skill and taste and love of the beautiful which makes him a king in his profession. When the grounds were being im - proved a noted designer was employed, but his plans received the severest censure from the old man. "Why don't you lay them out yourself?" asked the owner. ''All right; nothing </seg>
            <seg id="p245">237 I'ARKS AMI I i. Ill would suit me better, as I am to care for them." And the result is ;i constant surprise of beauty. The house on an eminence giving a charming view of the whole country; the lawn about the house lias now and then a tree, but nothing to obstruct the view. Then from the house the scene opens on a most tasteful arrangement of some of the finest trees on the continent, stand - ing as on dress parade. There in one view is the finest pungeiis in the world, probably, the joy of the old gardener and the pride of the owner. It was several times transplanted to make it stocky, and now it rises in compact pyramidal form, surroundeil by neighbor trees from the Rockies. The effect of the grouping is the finest that could be devised. In most of the parks are the unique and variegated .Japan maples. They are dwarfs, but are exceedingly rich in foliage. Then there is the large family of Japan Ketnisporas and other evergreens with their rich and delicate foliage. These will not succeed with us unless we scr.-en them, but we have some things which they cannot have. The brave and grand ponderosa will nor thrive near the coast, and the most beautiful pine in all the world, esi&gt;ecially of the (ilauca type, the tlaxilis. does not succeed in the east. In Nebraska, however, it is all we can wish for. As we come to public parks, the Arnold Arboretum, in the • are of Harvard University, is very attractive. It has over three thousand varieties and species of trees, shrubs, and plants. The superintendent. .Jackson Dawson. wields the wand of a magician. He is probably the best propagator in America, lie has the finest l'hiladelphias 1 e\er saw which he has raised from seed. I sent out some conifer seed one spring and received a good deal of abuse because they wouldn't grow. I sent Mr. Daw - son the same seed a year after and he reported M per cent of them growing. He has wonderful success in hybridizing n I saw a dozen kinds of his propagating on exhibition in the Massachusetts horticultural show. He put a trailing juniper on a red cedar and made an evergreen umbrella of it and sold </seg>

He has the whole family of primitive apple— half a dozen kinds brought from different parti of the world, the fruit ranging from the size of a earraal up to our plums. There is also a tine thrifty tree, supposed to be the primitive pear with fruit abont the size of a sugar coated pill. .Most noted in his collection of 120 lilacs are the two giant or tree lilacs of China and Japan. These grow to be large tree*. Their leading charm is that they bloom in June long after the others. They are tilled with greal spikes of snowy white (lowers. Mr. Huwsiiii has a Japan lilac he raised from seed. It is about twentv yean old. I'assing by it one day I said to him. "Thai tree is two feet around." Me thought not. I measured it and it was thirty inches in circumference three feet from the ground. Both these giant lilacs do well in Nebraska. One ha~&lt; been growing and blooming in Franklin, endaring three years of drought amid killing neglect. There is a pinetum in this park, containing all the conifers of the world that will thrive in that climate. There is an im - mense family both of the upright and creeping honeysuckles. The llalleana is allowed to cover the ground in many places and till the air with its fragrance. Beaatifal roads and walks are laid out in this park. In one section there is a grove of hemlocks so thick that a weed cannot grow in their shade. The ground is carpeted with needles and the place seems as quiet and ■acred as some grand cathedral. Where it is possible the native features of the ground are preserved. About 140 acres were originally set aside, and more land lias recently been added. Franklin park has about 806 acres and is connected with the arboretum by a fine boulevard. This park is gradually being brought into shape. The aaperintendent told me the expense already incurred, if I mistake not. was flli.OOK.OOD. This is owned by the public, including the poorest of the poor. Five cents gives an rating such as we western people could not secure rtt any price. </seg>
            <seg id="p247">239 PARKS AMI FOB! At present there is ■ fad in park making which we hope will be transient, for it is exceedingly provincial and narrow. It seems like defrauding the public. It is a fad which the future will look back upon with a sense of wrong. It strikes us that a park should be a collection of the most beautiful flowers, pints, and trees that can be made to grow. It should afford the finest collection of grace and beauty, and should also be an education. It costs but little more to broaden than to narrow ii. AsMBg main park superintendents and landscape garde* eis there is a tendency to copy simply the trees and shrubs which the vicinity affords. I have asked the cause of this, and the reply is, "We don't want to copy the arboretum or the pri - vate pack." Hut it is better to get the best than to copy ten thousand thing! you see wild in all the east. Now there is a great demand for oaks, (live us oaks, red oaks, black oaks, white oaks, yellow oaks, and all the native trees. They are mov - ing beautiful pongena out of Franklin park to giye place faff Simon-pare natives. The Yankee is a capital fellow and I like him, but he would be better if he was broadened. If he was the •am total of supreme excellence, he might afford to be ex - clusive; but he isn't. There are other evergreen! fully as beau - tiful, if not more so. than the savin, hemlock, and pine. In fact, they look to me l&gt;esides the Orientalis. Xovalis Froser tir, Alconquinia spruce, and the graad tret's of the Rockies anil Sierras. So with deciduous trees. A Russian olive thrown in with the deep green of the natives would add to the effect. The result of this narrowing process will be this: l'eople will see other parks with their splendid collections gathered from the wide world of shrubs, trees, and flowers, and will then ask, "Why has not our park these things? For twenty five cents we can fO out and see all these things on a far grander scale. If we are to have only natives. Mother Nature has furnished all this in millions of acres. Why not use our art, taste, and wealth to advantage and not have this everlasting taineness and monotony?" As well rule out all products and foods, and </seg>

What a fix Nebraska would be in if we should adopt this plan. Our flora touches both the cast and the west and we could show quite a collection, but we can enhance th beauty of our landscape four-fold by reaching out at the sam expense. We have our state pride and plenty of it. We hav our siroccos and blizzards, our glorious days and starlit nights and the richness of our soil, but if we confine ourselves to ou native products we would be poor indeed. What sort of a tirta; could we get out of sunflower seeds (ou principal cropi, wile plums, and choke-cherries? We had to import wheat, corn beans, and potatoes, and by taking care of these we astonish th natives. Actual test shows that we can have a very rich addition t( our trees. Many of the Kocky Mountain trees flourish hen for the conditions are much the same — dry weather and ho suns. The Austrian pine is proving itself a jewel. I have Kei it flourishing under the fiery sun of wind swept Oklahoma. A few years ago I saw a fine Alcontjuiuia spruce on Mr. Stephen! grounds at Crete. It ill very thrifty. Most of the spireas &lt;1&lt; well here — chief among them the Van Ilouteii, a mound o snowy lowers. Eleagnus longipcs is a charming shrub, hard; and wonderful in bloom and fruitage. I picked twelve quart of fruit from one bush last summer. It is of Japan origin am seems a cross between the berberry, the currant, and the goose berry. The fruit is fine for jams and jellies. Some of the flow ering crabs do well with us; among them the Bechtel crab wil doubtless be a success. It is filled with flowers like double rose in springtime. Taking all in all, for ornamental planting w have a splendid collection which will endure our climate, an&lt; many things of a finer nature can be raised under screens These can be made of lath in artistic designs which will not cos much. Every village and city should have a park. One of the old residents of Worcester, Mass., took me around among the parks of that city. That man, Hon. O. B. Hadroin, </seg>

The city has ten fine parks; one of them is on the crest a hill that overlooks the entire country. Hartford, Conn., i an excellent park system. A Mr. Keney left six hundred •es and an endowment to care for it. This is under the care Mr. Parker, an old friend of mine who used to be gardener of s old colony K. K. One in visiting these scenes of beauty is impressed with the great work to be done in our own state. Nebraska should have a forestry association and a state board of park and for - estry commissioners. We should have several sections of land under high cultivation in different parts of our great state. We need not waste much in experiments. A good many of us have paid out hundreds of dollars in finding out what we could not do. We will give our experience for nothing. The country west of the 100th meridian should not be left to desola tion. The state should take the matter in hand. We have ex - perimental grounds at Lincoln aided by the Tinted States gov - ernment, but that is but a drop in the bucket. Sites should be selected near some stream where nurseries can be maintained. I know the wilderness can be made to blossom as the rose. A plantation can be made as far west as MeOeok and even west of there. I know a section of land could be covered with de ciduous trees and hardy evergreens such as have already stood three years of drought in succession in the worst of neglect without one dying. It is absolutely necessary to have a nursery in connection with the plantation. Some springs you cannot handle evergreens; they may be shipped to you in a dry and windy time when it is not safe to handle them. If you have a nursery you can choose your time when the ground is wet and 9 </seg>

A few days decide 11k- fate of a young evergreen; if the conditions are right you arc sure to succeed. We need to organize a forestry and park asso&lt; -iation. the ob - ject of which shall be to induce the state to take hold of this matter, and to induce the United States government to aid us, as doubtless they will. While in Washington last spring I was delighted with the deep interest manifested in both the forestry and pomological departments in the west. W*e get but little of the vast government appropriations that go into river and harbor improvements, but we are entitled to our share and we ought not to be modest in our appeals. We can say to Uncle Samuel, "We don't think it will pay to dredge the Platte. and we can get along without a harbor for our ironclads at Omaha. We trill take ours in trees." Again, we want to run this matter independent of politics. A man may be a first class pop and yet lack tree gumption; he may be an old line democrat and know all about the tariff and not know how to plant a forest: he may know how to hybridize parties and he a good fusionisi, and not know a thing about hybridizing trees; he may be ; straight republican and a horticultural idiot. A man in one o our Colorado cities was appointed tree inspector. I think hi got $4 a day for being a fool. He brought me in triumph one day a root — a peach root that had a peach borer in it. It seems that nearly a car load of shrubbery had been brought in for planting a park, and said he. &gt;4 1 found some of these fellows in the roots and 1 had the whole thing destroyed according to law." The flowering almonds had been budded on peach and now and then a borer was found in the roots, and so the whole family of shrubs — spircas. syringas. and all — had to go because the stock was infected (outran/ to lair. We want none of this non - sense. Promote a man for what he knows and not for what he don't know. It would be a grand tiling if horticulturists could work on non partisan lines.

Some earth must be dug away from one side of the plant so the roots will allow the ranea to bend without breaking. Several years ago I tried covering | art of my raspberries with mulching and earth, and would have covered all of them in November had not cold weather prevented. I was surprised in the spring to find that all 1 had covered were dead to the ground, white those not covered were in good condition. Since that experience I have not tried to cover any more of them. It was a dry, mild winter, WINTKKINCS SMALL FRF ITS. </seg>

Perhaps beading the case* over without beading the roots may have injured the circulation of sap. All. small or large, were killed, however. The drvness of our winter atmosphere makes a difference, so that a method of treating plants that will succeed in Minnesota or Wisconsin, where they have an abundance of snow or rain, will not always succeed here. The MUlwiBg of raspberry plants in the winter time is very beneficial. If blackberries and raspberries begin and go through the winter with moist roots, they are in good condition in the spring. In IMS or 1893 the thermometer went down to :{S degrees below zero, but blackberries and raspberries came out in the spring plump and sound to the tip. Moist roots and a mulching of six inches of snow saved them. I h-irbrrrirx should be covered with a mulching of hay or straw. They are easily protected. This mulching should be placed under the vines in the spring until after fruiting, or tie the vines to a trellis and cultivate the ground. Currant*, (iooxefxrriex. and ./iiiichnrics can be protected to some extent from injury in winter by mulching with manure. Moderate snowdrifts are very beneficial. Very heavy, deep drifts which melt away slowly are often very injurious to trees and plants by breaking them as the drifts settle. Sometimes these drifts become solid ice and smother even strawberry plants beneath them. StrairiHrr/i I'laiitx. — I commence covering strawberry plants about the middle of October and aim to finish November 1. It is not necessary to wait for the ground to freeze over. The mulching of straw or hay should have some earth sprinkled on it in places two or three feet apart to prevent it being blown off the plants. Slough grass, if fret* from seeds, is the best mulching I have tried. Wheat straw is next best. Avoid oat straw, as it always contains light grains that will grow and give trouble before the berries are picked. It will require three or four large loads of mulching for one acre; more might be used safely. This should be raked off into the furrow between the rows about </seg>

If plants have been allowed to cover the ground the mulching will have to be removed entirely. It would be better to cut out one-third of the plants in such cases and make paths for the pickers to walk in, covering the paths with the mulching to hold moisture and keep down weeds. Irrigation of Plants. — If fall rains have not been sufficient, and it is convenient to irrigate vines and plants, I would recommend irrigating all the small fruits in the fall or from September to November 1. Fall drouths and dry winters are the greatest hindrances in this country to success with small fruits, and especially to the successful wintering of them. DISCUSSION. The President — Will strawberry plants freeze to death here? Mr. Stevenson — Yes. sir; or perhaps they do not freeze to death, but the ice will kill them. Two years ago I had quite a number killed bj - the ice remaining on them. The President — If you" had had a mulch under that ice would it have done any good? Mr. Stevenson — No, I don't think it would. Mr. Dtnlap — Tell us what advantages you expect to gain by covering your strawberries. Mr. Stevenson — It isn't so much to prevent them from freez - ing as it is to prevent them from thawing out every time it turns warm in winter. The mulch protects the crowns from being injured by thawing during the day and freezing at night, thus heaving the roots out. Mr. Dunlap — What time of year do you take the mulching off? Mr. Stevenson — I usually leave it on late in order to hold the plants" back. I rake it off the rows into the furrows about the first of April, or as soon as the plants begin to grow. Qikstion — Do you mulch before the ground freezes? Mil. Stevenson — Yes, sir; I don't wait for that. I commence sometimes as earlv as the first of November. </seg>
            <seg id="p254">246 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. Mr. Barnard — One advantage of mulching after tin- ground ttttMtM is that it doesn't cut the beds up as it docs where von mulch earlier — that is. where you haul it with a wagon. Mr. Stevenson — We find no trouble from that source; we drive astride the rows. Mn. Jenkins — The great advantage of mulching early is that you then have something to weight the mulch down with; if you wait until later you have to use boards. Mn. Stevenson :--I use a little earth sprinkled along to hold the mulch down. Mits. Ai.HKitMAN — You speak of mulching graj»es; how do you prevent their being eaten by mice? Mm. Stevenson — I have never had any trouble in that way. Mhs. Ai.iikuman — We have had them entirely eaten up by mice. Mn. .Jenkins — I have obtained the best results by using earth for covering graphs. Mhs. Ai.hekman — We use earth with a slight covering of mulch. THE CHERRY ORCHARD. W. F. JENKINS, ARCADIA. What I say I wish to say for the benetit of those living in the central-west and northwest part of the state. In planting a cherry orchard, of course, the first thing to take into consideration is locality, and. as Mr. Kussell said in regard to pmcaca, &lt;/&gt;t on Mfl ftmmd. If I were locating a cherry or chard I should select the highest table-land I could find any where near market. In the preparation of the soil I would plow just as deep as 1 coukl. In preparing the ground for my own cherry orchard in U8 I used five heavy horses and mules and could only get over one acre a day. The next thing, of course, is buying the trees. </seg>
            <seg id="p255">247 THE (.'IIERHY ORCHARD. And I want to say here, as I have said before in these meetings, thai I have had all the experience I want, and seen my neigh - bors have all the experience they can afford, with traveling tree men. They have done our country more injury than Doc. Mid - dleton, the great horse thief, ever did, or than hail storms ever did. I know some nurserymen will take exceptions to that, but what I say in regard to this matter I wish to have go into the report, for I know what I am talking about. I would buy direct from the nursery, and from those whom I knew by experience, or the experience of others, could be depended upon. There are plenty of reliable nurserymen in Nebraska; we don't need to buy of traveling tree men. Next as to varieties: I am not growing a great many varieties for commercial purposes. I am experimenting with a number of varieties that were sent me by the state, but for commercial purposes I am growing the Early Richmond for an early cherry and the English Morello for a shipping cherry, which I believe is the best we have. I have shipped them as far as Chicago to see how they would go there, and have seen them here in Lin - coln, after they had been on the market three or four days, that were apparently as fresh as when they left the orchard. The Ostheim is the best cherry I have tested in the state. It is as good a cherry to eat on the table as we have in Nebraska, and the tree is fully as hardy as the English Morello. I got my first lot of Ostheim trees in with a lot of Early Richmond and English Morello that I bought; there were ten or fifteen Ostheim in the lot. and I am very glad of it now. for they are the best cherry for home use that I am growing. The season is a little earlier than the English Morello. and the fruit is not quite as large as either the Richmond or Morello. Mb. Hartley — Does it come straggling along ripening its crop? Mit. Jenkins — Yes. sir; it does. (Continuing.) I have made a practice of planting the second size trevs. Mr. Stephens has scolded me a little about that, thinking I would do better to </seg>
            <seg id="p256">248 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. plant the first size. I don't know as to that; I have always planted the second size two-year-old trees, and have always had good success, so I am buying the same grade of trees this year. I wouldn't buy anything older than two years; I would rather pay wholesale price for two-year-old trees than to have three - year-old trees for nothing. My main cherry orchard, which is fruiting now, is located where the rays of the sun cannot strike it until the sun has been up at least half an hour, and I think that has a tendency to spare the bloom a little in case of frost. In '94 I didn't grow a cherry, but only half a mile from me there was a cherry orchard on a piece of land, j»erhaps 106 feet above the level of my cherry or - chard, and that orchard produced a pretty good crop. A few years ago I was asked to write ■ paj&gt;er on "How to Plant an Orchard." I stated in that paper that I would plant six or eight inches deeper than the trees stood in the nursery row. I was then a young member of the society, and after I got down here I talked to a few of the older members on this subject and found that I was recommending planting so much deeper than any one else that I cut it down about one-third before I read the paper. If I had it to do again I should leave it just as I had it at first. Mr. Tms — Why do you plant that deep? Mr. Jenkins — I have planted that deep for the last eight or ten years and have had exceptionally good success. I plant the cherry tree from three to six inches below where the bud is. I wouldn't fill it up full the first season, but when the ground is level I want the bud from three to six iuches below the surface. Mr. Browx — Don't your trees sucker? Mr. Jenkins — No, sir. Mr. Brown — They would with us. Mr. Jenkins — I am talking for the benefit of people farther west. Mr. Titi's — What is your object? Is it to avoid the effects of the wind? </seg>
            <seg id="p257">249 THE CHERRY ORCHARD Mr. Jenkins — That is one thing; another thing is low heading; to get the head right down to the ground. Mr. Loxgsdorf — In leafing out in the spring don't they come out later than trees planted shallower? Mr. Jenkins — They do the first year. Mr. Titts — Your object in planting deep is to get low heads? Mr. Jenkins — Not entirely; one object is to protect the roots of the tree. Mr. Christy — Your ground is drier than ours. If we should plant as deep as you advise our trees would sucker. Mr. Titus — In Nemaha county we have to be very careful in planting our cherry trees to keep them from suckering. \W probably plant an inch deeper than where they are budded. Mr. Jenkins — I haven't had any trouble at all the last eight or ten years; I have less trouble than at first. Fifteen years ago I tried to save these suckers and grow them, but I soon learned that it was no use to do that. Of late years I didn't have any to save if I wished to. Mr. Titus — Didn't your suckers do well . Mr. Jenkins — I didn't have any success with them at all. I consider this question of deep planting a very important one. Some one was speaking yesterday about sending men around to cover the roots of their apple trees; I want the roots down so deep that they don't have to be covered. In regard to cultivation I would advise cultivating just about as Mr. Russell cultivates his peach orchard. The better we cul - tivate the better success we will have. We should also manure very heavily for the best results. Plant the trees 20 feet apart each way, and one year go through and manure between the rows one way as deep as it can be plowed under handily, plowing five or six inches deep, and the next year go through the other way and manure as heavily as it can be plowed under. Whether this is too much manure or not I don't know, but I have had no bad results from it so far. As to pruning, I don't prune at all. Where there is a limb </seg>

It makes a tine place for the boys; they can run right under those tew trees and I can pass right by them and not see them. I find just as fine cherries — or if anything the finest cherries — on the lower limbs, and I don't propose to cut them off. No weeds grow under those low limbs; they protect the ground so it is not necessary to cultivate under the tr&lt; As to picking, in the first place I allowed my friends to pick on shares, but 1 soon quit that. No matter how much you would like to favor your friends, you cant afford to let them pick on shares. Then I undertook to hire my picking done by the quart, but found I couldn't do that. My idea has been to grow the finest cherries of a given variety that could be grown in Ne - braska, and to put them on the market in the finest shape possi - ble, and hi hiring by the quart I can't gH them picked satisfac - torily. Once in a while I find a picker who will not do just as I tell him, and the first tiling I know he gets in some baskets that hurt my trade more than the fruit is worth. I am hiring entirely by the week now, and I hire girls altogether. I don't want a boy in the orchard at all. I hire girls old enough to at - tend to business; say from 18 to 20 years old. I have no trouble in getting all the pickers I want at $2.50 per week and board. Mr. Titus — Do you only aim to go over your trees once? Mr. Jenkins — Some of them we go over twice. We eouKBce picking as early as possible, and the first ones we have to go over twica. If a girl picks 100 quart! ■ day as I want them picked — suitable for the best market — that is all I exj&gt;ect of her. Mb. Stevenson — When your trees get large so you will have to use heavy ladders, what will your girls do? Mr. Hartley — My pickers prefer ladders; they can pick faster from the top of the tree than on the ground. Mr. Jenkins — As to marketing, we use our local papers to let people know what we are doing, and try to sell as many as possible right at home. People come forty and fifty miles to my </seg>

In that way I sell the largest part of my Early Richmond. The later ones are better shipper* and I can handle them better. Mb. Hartley — Do you stem the later ones? Mil. Jenkins — No, sir: I eaa'1 get pickers by the quart to be careful enough. I tell those picking by the week that when one comes off the stem they shall throw it away. Mb. Tins — Are you troubled with cherry rot? Mm. Jenkins — No. sir; not a particle. I have mentioned only three varieties. I have some other varieties that are doing well, and some that are worthless. The 1'niversity sent me some varieties in ? 91 to test; I shipped one basket from one of those trees to the exposition this year, and they were pronounced the finest basket of light colored cherries they received there during the season. I don't know what the variety is; jnuhaps Mr. Mar - shall or Mr. Youngers can tell. The 1'kksii&gt;knt — As I remember it was a Russian cherry; thi llessarabia. Mit. Ym N«;i:ns — Speaking of the Russian cherries. I find there is a very great mixture of varieties. There seem to have been four or the varieties sent out from the Iowa Experiment Sta - tion under the same name. I have had cherries sent me for name by one party, while another party would send me a cherry which he got under the same name, which would bear no resem - blance to the first. I had some of the Iowa experts name a cer - tain one which was sent out for Orel 27. and they called it some thing else. If I were going to plant Orel 27 I should want to see the tree bear and know if was Orel 27 before I planted it. Question — Did anyone ever see Orel 27 in bearing? Mm. Yoinckhs — I had Orel 27 sent in from different parts of the state. It is a very fine cherry, but what its bearing quali - re I don't know. </seg>

I do not consider myself capable to instruct nurserymen, but what little I say may be of some help to farmers and planters. In my opinion there is no evergreen so well adapted to the use of the farmer for wind-breaks and hedges as red cedar. It adapts itself to almost any locality and is found almost univer - sally. There is no evergreen, to my knowledge, that grows faster while young. It will make a wind-break or hedge quicker than any other evergreen. If property planted and cared for, they will average a growth of about eighteen inches a year after one year old. This refers to IMatte Valley red cedar. If prop - erly planted, they will grow very dense from the ground up, but they must be kept clean the first few years. I would not reconi mend trying to raise them from seed, as the most experienced men are often baffled. There are too many enemies of the tree to contend with. I would recommend to get them of the near - est nurseryman. One or two-year old trees I ivgard as best. The tret's, when received, should not have roots exposed. They must be kept damp, as the finest roots are the ones that supply the tree. These roots contain rosin, which if dry will not dis - solve in water: therefore, if the roots dry the tree will die. Whn small bundles or packages of trees arrive, the roots should be dipjM'd in water before unpacking, but keep the tops toy, then they can be kept till ready to plant. Keep in a cellar or shady place. In planting a wind break. 1 would suggest that a distance of about five feet be observed between the trees, if two rows are planted. One row three feet apart will make a good wind- r. H. BHUXING, KENT, IA. </seg>

In transplant - ing I use a candy bucket half tilled with water. Take one bun - dle at a time and put the roots in the water and take out one tree at a time and plant it. The roots should be planted deep, so that nothing but the tops be above ground. Never pour water in the hole after planting. If the roots are wet. the dry earth will adhere to them at once. With us it is not net -essarv to shade transplanted trees. In the west it might be. if planted on the south side of a hedge or building — then the sun nun be too hot. About ten years ago I planted pines and cedar together in the nursery row. There is only one pine that is taller than the cedars. The adaptability of the red cedar to almost any cli - mate and soil makes it the most valuable. Mr. Jackson — What is the best time of year to plant cedars? Mr. Brining — They can be planted almost any time of year when the grouud can be worked, but I prefer the spring of the year; about corn planting time. Mr. Jackson — I have heard people advocate planting them in June. Mm. HutxiNc — That is all right if the season is damp; if it is drv thev will nearlv alwavs die. Mr. Duhlap — Have you tried the silver cedar? Mit. Hium.no — Yes. sir. Mm. Dinlai" — How do they grow &lt;i un pa red with the red cedar? Mr. Bscnihg — Very well. Mm.

Brining — If I were only planting a few for wind-break or something like that. I should prefer the t wo year-old trees. Mft. Marshall — How tall do they usually get at two years from the seed? Mr. Brining — If they are not transplanted, about twent y-fiuir inches. If you transplant yearlings that are about six or eight inches high in the spring, by fall, if it is anything like a fair sea - son, they will be about twenty inch Mr. Dunlap — How high do they get in one year from the wed?

The President — We have with us Mr. (Jano, representing the Missouri Stale Horticultural Society, and I am sure we would all be glad to hear from him. Mit. (iano — I don't know that I can say anything that would be of any interest to you any more than to give you a little account of what our society is doing. I can say that we are in a very flourishing condition as a horticultural society. During the last fifteen years we have made great progress, which has been largely due to our energetic officers, such as the Nebraska society is now blessed with. Our secretary has made the society what it is. We have jiersistently appealed to our legislature until we got them to appreciate something of our work, and we have made it a grand success. There is scarcely a county but that has from one to as high as three local societies, except along the eastern and southeastern borders, where no efforts have been made. The officers are mostly on the western border, where the fruit industry has l»een more industriously pushed. A Voice — Tell us about the Gano apple. Mb. Gang — So far as the G«M apple is concerned, I was sur - prised to find that it had been disseminated so far north and </seg>
            <seg id="p270">262 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL BOCIBTT. west as Nebraska. There are a great many of them in Kansas. While I have no interest in the apple in the world, it was named for me, principally, I think, on account of my name being so short. At the time the apple was brought out for a name the society in providing names was cutting off all super fluous names, and my name being so short they said it would be a good name for the apple. I never made a cent out of it; I just turned it over to our state society and scions were sent out all over the country so as to keep it from being nonopoliaed by any one nursery. Some nurserymen trot hold of a number of trees and got them into bearing and pushed it. Those have reaped a good reward. I can say that wherever the Hen Davis will succeed you will have a good variety in the Gano. You have everything in tree that you have in the lien Davis, and that is a great deal. With us we have no tree that is superior to the Ben Davis. The fruit is not quite so large as the Ben Davis, though it is of very fair size and very uniform; more like the Jonathan or a little larger. While we have no particular advantage in the flavor of the apple, we think there is quite an advantage in the color, it being solid red. The apple originated near me, but not on my farm. It was an accident, and we cannot trace any botanical history of it. The iirst orchard planted there was planted with seedlings brought from one of the older counties. After those seedlings had been planted out a number of years some nurseryman from New York came through there selling Ben Davis under the name of New York Pippin. This old gentleman bought a few New York Pippin trees. I think he paid a dollar apiece for them, but he only got four or five trees to grow. In his seedling orchard, wherever a tree would be very thorny he would saw off the trunk, sometimes near the ground, sometimes three or four feet up. and sometimes in the limbs, and graft it with these New York Pippin scions. In that orchard, after it got to bearing, we found quite a number of promising new seedlings. The (Jen. Lyon originated there, also the Lawver. In 1870 Blair Brothers advocated the idea of cut </seg>
            <seg id="p271">263 rUOCF.EDINCS OF ANNUAL MEETING. ting scions from bearing orchard trees rather than from the nursery, and those men came there to cut Hen Davis scions. After cuttiag from the orchards near this old seedling orchard they came tliere and cut from those trees that had been grafted with the few trees bought from tin* nursery. Of course they had to use their own judgment as to which trees to cut from, and I have no doubt but that they cut from this (Jano tree. It was propagated as Hen Davis, for those scions were grafted in the nursery and then afterwards disposed of, being sent out to Nebraska. Missouri, and Kansas. When the American Hor ticultural Society met at Kansas City — I had frequently years before sent this apple to Downing and Warder thinking it was some old variety that had been lost sight in the east, but they invariably wrote back that it was no apple that had ever beat propagated in the east, and after years of controversy the society took the matter up and gave the apple its present name. These apples came in from those scions cut from that orchard. We traced them back to the old Blair Nursery, and they traced them back to that lot of scions, which, we think, is the cause of its being distributed over the country before we knew where it came from. We have no knowledge of it, any more than we think it originated in this lot of seedlings.

            <seg id="p276">268 NEBRASKA STATE HOKTHTI.Tt UAL SOCIETY SECRETARY'S REPORT. Officers and Members of the Nebraska Ftatc Horticultural Society: The year just closed has not been one of very great financial success to the fruit growers, the fruit crop being short in quan - tity and_ below normal in quality. Yet, with all, we have been able to make such a show for our state at the Trans-Mississippi Exposition as to receive the highest award for continuous fruit exhibit, besides numerous gold, silver, and bronze medals for individual exhibits. The exposition just closed has shown what can be done in making a fruit show in an off year, and shows the great possibilities of our state as a fruit-growing state. To the officers in charge of the horticultural exhibit great credit is due for untiring and unselfish efforts to benefit the whole state by the best possible exhibit with the resources at hand. By direction of the board of directors, the secretary's office has been moved to the rooms of the State Historical Society, and shelving fitted up for surplus reports. The old shelving has been cleaned and painted so as to present a more neat ap - pearance. The need of permanent quarters is more apparent each year, that we may not be objects of charity, or simply have a home during the pleasure of our friends or until our room is needed for other purposes. The officers of this society have taken action looking to an in - creased appropriation, and we hope to have the law governing our society so amended as to make the appropriation available in part for incidental expenses. so. 4 Peter Yowgera f 25 00 B G A.

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Society: I have not prepared an elaborate report, and have no special recommendations to make. However, in way of report as to fruit crop and prospect - ive conditions, I wish to say: The heavy apple crop of ls'.»4, ls!ir ( , and 1896, followed by an extremely heavy one in 1897, left the trees in rather poor condition for a crop in L8M. This con - dition, followed by a wet, unfavorable spring for apples, resulted in the poorest apple crop that Nebraska has ever seen. Cherries bloomed just before the wet weather set in and we were Met with a bountiful crop. Plums did fairly well. Raspberries. blackberries, and strawberries yielded very satisfactory. The grape crop was very large and quality good. The outlook is fair for a good fruit crop generally in 1899. Oct. 2t&gt;. &lt; 'harles Nownes, life 3 00 </seg>
            <seg id="p278">270 NEBRASKA STATE IloRTHTLTfRAL BOCIBTT. The treasurer has given you a report of the small amount of money received from the state by this society and what it has been spirit for. In regard to the work of the society, I might say that we have been taking up a special line of work in each report for a number of years past, devoting the most of our attention to the apple in one report, to the plum and eherry in another, and thus getting out a set of special reports. The first special re - port of this kind was gotten out in 18!)4. This year we take up the apple again and shall devote most of our report to that fruit. Last year, at our annual meeting, we made preparations for an exhibit at the Trans -Mississippi, and recommended to the board of Nebraska commissioners that Peter Youngers. -Jr., be appointed superintendent of the Nebraska fruit exhibit. Knowing him to be a man of wide experience in horticultural work and in close touch with the fruit growers of the state generally, we believed he would be a good man to represent tin - state at the great exposition. The board of commissioners agreed with us in that opinion and appointed Mr. Youngers superintendent of horticulture for Nebraska. The result was that he placed a large quantity of apples in cold storage, of which he will tell you in his paper later on. At the opening of the exposition in June he brought out a display of some sixty varieties of apples, and kept the display up all summer, the society working in harmony with him, and the medals which you see on exhibition here will show the results of his work. The society has good reason to feel proud of the results, and Mr. Youngers himself is satisfied, although it was a losing game to him financially. I think we succeeded in advertising the state pretty thoroughly in a horticultural way. The exposition being right at our doors, of course we had a chance to exhibit hun dreds of varieties of small fruits that we could not have done at a distance. As to the work which I think the society ought to take up, </seg>
            <seg id="p279">PBKBIDMNT'fl AKMtKSS 271 1 will mention. Hist, the institute work. I think the society ought to foster the institute work in the state generally; it is one of the best opportunities we have of increasing the inter - est in horticulture. I find that in the older parts of the state or rather in the older institutes, that horticulture is one of the main topics, one in which the fanners are taking as much in - terest as in any other branch of agriculture that is beiag dis - cussed at these institutes. I think we ought to remember this and encourage the institute work as much as possible. We have no money to do experteeata] work with, although there is great need for work of that kind. Stations should be established in different parts of the state where experimental work could be carried on without exiwnse to the general planter. With all this in view, and with the very small amount of money with which we are provided by the state. I feel it very im - portant that we ask for a larger appropriation. While we ought to have at least $3,000 a year in order to do the work that the state needs, yet I think we would try ami get along on 92,500 until we get organized and prepared to do more work. Through correspondence with parties in Iowa, Missouri. Illinois, Kansas, Colorado, and Minnesota. I lind that we receive a much less appropriation than any of our neighboring states. Iowa gets 12,600 per year, and in addition to that they have $:J00 or a little over for incidental expenses, and do not have to pay any - thing out in premiums. I do not remember just what Illinois gets, except that $1,000 goes for experimental work. Kansas fares even better than Iowa, and I guess fully as well as Missouri, which gets $3,SIMI. Colorado gets JfL'.oOO a year, secre - tary's salary if 1 .000) and expenses and mileage added. In Xe - braska we do not get one cent from the state with which to carry on this work. The money which is generally supposed to come to us is simply paid out in premiums at a fruit show which we have already made. We have to make the show, pay the pie niiums, and take the receipts to the state house before we can draw one cent of money from the state. We have nothing to </seg>

We have paid as high as f 1,300 in pre - miums and drawn back fl,000 from the state. The Agricultu - ral Society has been kind enough, to pay us f 1,000 for making a fruit show on their grounds. The past year the exhibitors donated back to the society $300 from the premiums paid, or I don't know how we would have gotten through. As you know, the Agricultural Society did not hold a fair this year; thus it was not in position to give us anything. REPORT OF PETER YOUNGERS, JR., SUPERINTENDENT OF HORTICULTURE FOR NEBRASKA AT TRANS MISSISSIPPI EXPOSITION. To the Honorable Members of the Xcbraxkn Commission , Traiis- Mississippi and International EBfotiiim, Omaha, Nek.: Gentlemen: In compliance with the request of your assistant secretary, Mr. Campbell, I herewith submit report of work done in my department: On August 12th, 1897, I was notified of my appointment by your honorable body as superintendent of horticulture for Ne braska, and on September 8th was instructed to commence gath - ering apples for exhibit at the opening of the exposition. Dur - ing the fall I succeeded in securing 161 barrels of apples contain - ing sixty-three varieties which were placed in cold storage at Swift &amp; Co.'s warehouse, South Omaha. This firm kindly do - nated the storage charges to the Horticultural Department. The storage was perfect in every particular. Apples placed iu their cold storage room in October, 1897, taken out October 17th, 1898, were found to be in perfect condition, many varieties re - maining upon the tables in good condition until the close of the Exposition. On May 31st last we commenced to fill our tables with the fruit stored during the winter, and the opening day, June 1st, </seg>

All of the trans-Mississippi states were in vited to join, but as no other state responded to the call it fell upon Nebraska to furnish all of the peaches. Hetween twelve and fourteen thousand people partook of the hospitality of Ne - braska on that day; about eighty thousand peaches being dis - tributed. September 17 was set apart and known as "Nebraska drape Day." On this day grapes were distributed in two-pound sacks to fully twelve thousand visitors. At one time seventeen persons were engaged in sacking and distributing the grapes. The day following (September 18) being Children's Day, the school chil dren of Omaha and Council Bluffs were invited to sample the products of Nebraska orchards and vineyards. Each child that passed through the building was given a sack of grapes and two peaches. The children were highly pleased with the treat and Nebraska received much credit for her liberality. Again on October 19 we had what was known as "Nebraska Apple Day." We commenced distributing apples at 1 o'clock and continued until dark, having some ten persons employed in handing out the fruit. The apples given away wen* of the finest quality that Nebraska orchards produce, consisting mainly of Jonathan, Grimes' Golden Pippin, Northern Spy, and Snow, all of excellent eating quality. The object in distributing the fruit — peaefcea, grapes, and apples — was to convince visitors to the exposition that the qual ity of Nebraska fruit is equal, if not superior, to that of any other state in the Union, and many of the visitors, eapeetellj those from the eastern states, expressed great surprise at (he quality of the fruit. The Nebraska apple has also demonst rated its su - perior keeping qualities over apples exhibited by the other trans Mississippi states. For instance, apples taken out of cold storage remained upon the table in perfect condition for a period of from two to three weeks, and in one or two instances apples that had been in cold storage for seven months remained ■pon the tables in perfect condition for five weeks. At the close of </seg>
