            <seg id="p003">Hon. Ezra P. Savage, Governor. Sir: — In compliance with a duty, imposed by the Statutes, the sixteenth biennial report of the Nebraska Hospital for the Insane, at Lincoln, for the period beginning December i, 1900, and ending November 30, 1902, is herein respectfully sub - mitted. CHANGE IN MANAGEMENT Cng the biennial period there has been an entire change in sonnel of the resident officers. On February 1, 1901, the succeeded Dr. Charles £. Coffin as superintendent, and on the same date Dr. William D. Shields succeeded Dr. Howard M. Casebeer as first assistant physician. One month later Miss Cora L. Damrow became matron. On May 15, 1901, Mr. Albert D. Gilmore, who had served this institution in a like capacity during 1893, 1894 and 1895, became its steward. On August 16, 1901, Dr. Mabel Dunn succeeded Dr. Minerva M. Newbecker as second assistant physician. January 1, 1902, the increased number of patients caused the Board of Public Lands and Buildings to provide, by resolution, for an additional physi - cian, Dr. George A. Young being selected and designated pathologist. Dr. William D. Shields resigned July 15, 1902, and was succeeded by Dr. John T. Hay, who had previously Erved this hospital for many years as physician and superin - adent. NUMBER OF PATIENTS TREATED. P: the beginning of the biennial period there were present patients (170 males and 195 females.) There have been admitted and returned from parol during the period 848 patients (males, 485; females, 363,) making a total of 1,213 patients </seg>
            <seg id="p004">78 under treatment for the two years. At the close of business November 30, 1902, there are present 516 (males, 194; females, 322.) The greatest number present was 668, on November Pe large increase in the number of patients received and ;d at this hospital during the past two years, as compared all former periods, is due to the loss of the Norfolk hos - pital by fire, which occurred September 23, 1901. On the fol - lowing day, the Board of Public Lands and Buildings trans - ferred, from that hospital to this one, forty men and thirty-eight women, a total of seventy-eight, and directed the management here to receive patients from all the counties of the state. At a later date, December 6, 1901, the Norfolk hospital was finally closed and there was received here from that institution, fifty patients, (twenty-one men; twenty-nine women.) Since the fire at Norfolk hospital, this hospital has continued to receive patients from the entire state. In no instance was there a delay of a single day in receiving all who asked admis - sion and who had complied with the law, until November 2, 1902, when there were 667 patients in the institution. It then became necessary to discriminate as provided for in the Reference to the reports of preceding superintendents will show the consensus of opinion to be that 340 was the full capacity of the hospital before the completion of the new wing for female patients. That building will accommodate 150 only, making the present capacity of the hospital 490 only. When it is considered that there has been present one hundred more than the normal capacity for more than a year, and that for several months the institution has housed and cared for 170 more patients than its capacity warrants, the diffi - culties encountered must be apparent to all who have had experience in the management of a large hospital for the insane. That this over-crowded condition has not resulted in accidents of a serious nature, or in the development of epidemic disease is most fortunate indeed. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">79 GENERAL HEALTH. Daring the first six months of the period for which this report is made, three months of which was under the present manage - ment, erysipilas was practically constantly present. This being an ailment that is epidemic, virulently contagious, and withal, dangerous in the extreme to life, especially to the life of those whose vital tone is reduced by other diseases, its presence was a source of constant worriment and a menace to all. Immediate - ly after the present management took charge, a protracted effort, based upon a scientific knowledge of its cause, was instituted with a view to its extermination. The hospital is now, and has been for many months, entirely free from this ailment. During the period there has been eight cases of enteric fever. One death resulted from this cause, the case being a male patient far advanced in organic brain disease. In this connection, attention is particularly called to the fac that since new plumbing was placed in the male wards in the fall of 1901, no case of infectious disease has developed among the male patients, but that in the female wards, in the old build - ing, where the plumbing is in a wretched condition of dilapida - tion and insanitary to the last degree, enteric fever and other infectious diseases of a milder nature continue to develop. Th« constant presence of smallpox throughout the entire state, during the pant two winters, and its presence in the adja - cent city was a source of uneasiness, and caused extra care in vac - cination, which was done in all cases when needed. The insti - tution has fortunately escaped. C r ith the foregoing exceptions, the health of all detained here been better than could reasonably have been expected under the crowded condition. The death rate has been the lowest in the history of the institution. DIETARY. E: preparation and distribution of food to the various wards id special consideration, and an effort has been made to this part of the service to a higher standard of excellence 1a* heretofore prevailed. The chief consideration, after </seg>
            <seg id="p006">80 providing a sufficient quantity and proper quality of general food supplies, has been to insist upon absolute cleanliness in its storage, and preparation for the table. The manner of serving has been changed, until now food is served here as it is upon the table of the average home in Nebraska. Table linen of good quality, and always faultlessly clean, is kept upon all tables except upon those used by particularly untidy and destructive patients. There has been no restriction whatever placed upon the amount of food allowed; yet an inflexible rule that there should be no waste has been constantly enforced, In purchasing food supplies, the question has been not "how cheap" but "how good?" The best grade of dairy butter has been provided when it could be had upon the market. When that failed first grade creamery butter has been used. The farm and the surrounding country has provided cattle for our beef sup - ply, in the main, the slaughtering being done upon the premises, after careful inspection of each animal to determine its healthful- Es. When the local supply has failed, beef has been purchas - from packers, none but the first grade offered at this market ng accepted. The farm and garden have produced an abundance of fresh vegetables, which have been freely used. Fresh fruits, espec - ially apples, have been abundantly provided, and all have been urged to reduce the quantity of meats consumed and to increase the consumption of vegetables and fruits. The preparation of special diet for the infirm, aged and physi - cally ill has received special attention and personal supervision from the medical staff. A special diet cook is now employed, who gives her entire time to this branch of the service. NEW BUILDING FOR FEMALES. The legislature of 1899 appropriated forty thousand dollars for a new building for female patients, and provided that it should be of fire proof construction. After much delay, on account of scarcity of skilled labor and inability to procure material, the con - tractors delivered 1 the building to the Board of Public Lands and Buildings early in February. 1001. The appropriation made </seg>
            <seg id="p007">81 by the legislature of 1899 having been exhausted, and the build - ing being incomplete in some minor details, the legislature of 1901 appropriated twelve hundred dollars for its completion. The remaining work was done under the direction of the man - agement here. This is a red brick structure, with handsome exterior, of three stories and a rather low basement, connected with the main building by an arcade of artistic construction, it is built upon modern lines, and is what is known as the day room and dormi - tory plan. The building accommodates 150 patients upon its three floors, while the basement provides dining room space It is to be- regretted*that the legislature which appropriated money for "this building was not more liberal. The meager amount allowed made it necessary to curtail the expenditures for finishing, and resulted in a building painfully plain and inornate in interior finish. Plumbing, which when originally done with cheap material is always burdensomely expensive to keep in re - pair, was, in this case, by reason of the meager appropriation, not the best, and although the workmanship was first-class, infer - ior material is already giving way and causing constant expense for repairs. The legislature of 1901 appropriated four thousand dollars for furnishings, and although the greatest care was used, all the articles being purchased by competitive bids, it was found that the amount available for this purpose provided only for bare necessities, nothing whatever remaining for ornamentation. However, Mrs. Savage and some of her friends kindly donated pictures for the decoration of the walls of one ward, for which act of kindness, in thus rendering this one ward home-like, they have earned the gratitude of more than a hundred homesick women who have since then occupied this convalescent ward, while slowly struggling back to reason. The materials used in furnishing this building were all of the very best quality. The beds are white enameled iron with woven wire springs and all provided with hair mattresses. In furnish - ing the day rooms, a radical departure was made from the usual </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 2 plan in insane hospital furnishing, in that the constantly used bench or settee was discarded, and each person provided with a wide, low and comfortable rocking chair. No accident has re - sulted from this change, and none are likely, while the comfort cannot be estimated. The dining room in the basement was furnished with tables, each seating fourteen. These were made by the carpenter em - ployed here and are strong and durable. A good grade of bleached table linen was provided, and in sufficient quantity to keep the tables always dressed with linen that is faultlessly clean. All of the female patients who are physically able to go to a dining room for meals are taken here at one time, whereas they were formerly provided with dining-roorrti on each ward. This bringing together of the quiet and disturbed patients for half an hour three times each day has a most wholesome influence upon the latter, and has resulted in no accident, but has rather improved the general condition or orderliness, and is a most wholesome diversion. Bie serving and dish washing rooms have been provided with covered tables that, being impervious to moisture, are sani- The dish washing tubs and drain boards have recently been lined and covered with heavy polished copper, and thus made, not only are durable, but clean, and consequently sanitary. REPAIRS AND IMPROVEMENTS. During the two years many substantial and permanent improvements have been made. Immediately after the present management took charge it was found that, though the season for storing ice for the year was at hand, no provision whatever had been made to replace the ice-house that had been destroyed by a wind storm the previous fall. After filling the cold storage building, sufficient ice was cut and stored in a pile, without cov - ering except straw, and though the weather was very cold, an ice-house of sufficient size was constructed and the store of ice safely housed. As soon as the weather would permit the process of repairing </seg>
            <seg id="p009">83 of the general kitchen was so far decayed as to render it unfit for repairs. It was, therefore, replaced with new material. The roofs of the chapel and laundry building, the engine room, the infirmary building, bakery and carpenter shop, all of metal, and the metal part of the roof of the main building were found to be leaking and devoid of paint. All were put in first-class con - dition and then given two coats of mineral paint ground in oil. During the past summer all metal work has been retouched, where needed, with fresh paint. Late this fall the hog-house, a two-story frame building that had been considered beyond repair for years by reason of hav - ing been badly racked by wind, was straightened, braced and given a new roof, all thoroughly painted. At this time all build - ings and metal exposed to weather are thoroughly protected by recently applied paint. The general kitchen being found wholly inadequate for the needs of the rapidly increasing population, and also insanitary to the last degree, was enlarged and made modern during the summer of 1901. An addition, 36x19 feet, built of brick, one story and coverd with metal was first constructed. This room was provided with cement floor so arranged as to drain to one point, where it is connected with a proper drain and trap with sewer system, thus making it possible to use large amounts of water for scrubbing, and yet be easily dried. The walls to a height of four feet were plastered with the best grade of Port - land cement, which, joining the floor in a water tight joint, ren - ders the whole perfectly clean and sanitary. Into this room all of the apparatus using steam in cooking has been placed. The two large and one small rooms that had heretofore served as kitchen had floors of wood and ordinary stone flagging laid in sand, the walls being coated with the steam and smoke of years. Each room was in turn given a floor and wainscoting of cement, each room being provided with a modern drain and trap. The plastering being thoroughly repaired, much of it requiring to be replaced, walls and ceilings were painted with the best lead and oil in colors that were both </seg>
            <seg id="p010">8 4 pleasing and neat. Just as this report is being written the entire kitchen has received another coat of paint. Much of the plastering in the various parts of the main build - ing being in need of repair, material was purchased and compe - tent plasterers employed to go over the entire plant. This work occupied many weeks, and required the expenditure of nearly live hundred dollars. When finished all the plastering was in perfect repair. The painter, regularly employed, has painted with two coats all of the side rooms and halls of the male wards One, Two and Six; also female ward Four. The back halls at each end of the main building have been painted with enamel paint in pleasing colors, as have also the serving and dish washing rooms in the new building for female patients. Five wards in the main build - ing are yet in need of paint. This work alone would occupy a painter, with two patients to assist, for at least fifteen months. In all the work done in painting the very best material has been used. Inside work thus put on should last and look well for at least ten years. Up to this time no provision has been made in this hospital for a room in which modern surgical principles can be carried out. There is now in process of construction a room in which all modern conceptions of an aseptic operating room are being E bodied. When complete there will be no better in the state, I no good reason can be advanced why the state should not the best. During the winter of iooi-'o2 the four bathrooms in the male wards of the old building were remodeled and plumbing of new material was placed in all of them. The material for this work was purchased in the open market, and the labor paid for by the hour. The work was planned and performed under the immediate supervision of the management here. The materials used were the very best that could be purchased, and though the job consists of sixteen stools, four bath-tubs, four slop sinks ttixteen wash basins, all connected with one soil pipe, no jipe or wipe-joints were used, all piping being the best </seg>
            <seg id="p011">85 grade of galvanized iron, and the joints made of threaded-screw fittings. Ifl remodeling these bath-rooms, the plan used in the kitchen was followed. Each room has a water-tight floor and wainscoting made from the best grade of Portland cement, and each floor has a properly constructed drain and trap. There are no con - cealed pipes or traps in the entire job. Plugged T's and "clean - outs" have been so arranged that it would be impossible for any pipe to become so stopped that it could not be readily cleared without damage, or tearing out material. During ten months' ser - vice nothing has been expended for repairs, and the entire plant is in perfect order. The amount of hot water available from the plant in use hav - ing been found to be wholly inadequate after the new wing for female patients was opened, and the old heater being worn beyond repair, a new one of sufficient capacity to provide a thousand patients was ordered constructed, and when finished was placed in position and connected by the chief engineer and his assistants. This is now giving perfect service and is large enough to supply hot water during the entire night, though its steam supply is cut off when the engines are stopped at 10 o'clock. One new brass washing machine, one band ironer and a gas machine have been added to the laundry equipment. These additional machines, made necessary by the increased number of patients, proved too great a load for the small engine in use in the laundry. It was therefore replaced by a modern auto - matic engine of sufficient size to meet additional requirements for years. The small engine removed from the laundry will be used to furnish power for a feed mill. The Amusement Hall was built twelve years ago, at which time only a rough floor was provided, it being intended to lay one of polished wood at a later date. Each succeeding man - agement had deferred this needed improvement from year to year. Material for this work was purchased during the month of February, 1901, which, after having been thoroughly dried, </seg>
            <seg id="p012">86 \ was laid during August of that year, thus completing a building commenced twelve years ago. During the session of the legislature of 1901 an effort was made to secure an appropriation of $1,000.00 to purchase and erect a pair of track scales. The appropriation was not made. The opinion of the management that it was poor business policy to purchase from six to eight thousand dollars worth of coal each year, accepting mine weights for the same, was not changed, and an effort was made to provide the funds from some other source. At the end of the first year it was found that a surplus of sufficient amount existed in the fund for fuel and lights to make this purchase. Plans and specifications being drawn and approved by the Board of Public Lands and Buildings, proposals for the work were taken in the form of sealed bids. The contract was awarded the H. N. Strait Manu - facturing Co., of Kansas City, who complied with their agree - ment in every way. The scales are forty-five feet in length and of a capacity of one hundred and three tons, the net cost to the state being $807.00. This is considered the most valuable improvement made during the present biennial period. Early in the present administration, it was determined to im - prove the premises in the rear of the main building, and sur - rounding the rear buildings, until they should be as attractive and well kept as the front lawn. With this end in view, fences that were built twenty years ago and found in complete dilapi - dation were removed, and when needed, replaced with new material. The stone flagging taken from the floor of the general kitchen was used to construct walks, and when that material was exhausted, the work was continued with hard paving brick until walks were provided between the main and all the rear buildings. Soil in sufficient quantity to fill an established grade was hauled from the fields. Part of this surface was sodded, but much of it was sown with a reliable mixture of lawn grass, and, as the sea - son proved favorable, a large part of the premises in the rear of the main building are now in as good condition and are as well kept as the best private lawn. One car load of of stone curbing from the Quarries at Lyons, Colorado, has been purchased and </seg>
            <seg id="p013">87 used to curb the borders of drives and walks about the rear and south of the main building. There being no small fruit upon the place, an effort was made in the spring of 1901 to start a cherry orchard. The weather conditions of that year were so unfavorable that all the trees died. A renewed effort this year was rewarded with success. There are now growing, and in a thriving condition, about one hundred cherry trees, one hundred and twenty- five peach trees and ten Sudduth pear trees. If these are given proper care in the future, an abundant supply of small fruit will be produced within a few years. THE FARM AND STOCK. Pe yield from the farm last year was small, owing to the nged drouth and hot summer. The institution was, in con - :nce, forced to buy feed for a large amount of stock ; and ables, which are ordinarily furnished by the hospital gar - were wholly wanting. This year there has been an abun - yield, and the institution is fully provided with vegetables and feed of all kinds, except oats, the entire crop of that cereal having been destroyed in the barn fire. Thirty acres were sown to alfalfa this spring, and, though the wet season damaged it somewhal, there is a fairly good stand, which will be improved by resowing in the coming spring. This will be a very valuable addition to the farm product and will certainly increase the efficiency of the dairy. The first crop of winter wheat to be raised upon the farm was harvested this year. Unfortunately, the entire crop wad stored in the large barn and was so badly damaged by the fire that it is now being used for hog feed. Another crop was sown this fall. P. custom that has prevailed here for years, that of selling all young calves, was discontinued immediately after the pres - management took charge. As a result, there are one hun - dred and five head of young stock on the place, all of which were kept upon the institution's land this year, and for which sufficient feed has been provided for the coming winter. Their </seg>
            <seg id="p014">88 tue is net gain, as the labor to care for them has been per - med by the regular employees and patient help. THE BARN FIRE. At 3:45 A. M., September 24th of this year, the outside night watch discovered the large barn to be on fire. A general alarm was promptly given, to which all, whose duty thus directed, responded at once. The first effort of part of the force was directed to saving the live stock, while others laid a line of hose to save adjoining buildings. Of the twenty-five horses in the building when the fire started, nineteen were saved and six lost. Of those lost, the state owned four, two being private property. Besides the loss of animal life, all the vehicles of every nature, belonging to the state, except farm wagons, were destroyed. All of the harness, robes, blankets and many other necessary articles always found about a well equipped barn of large pro - portions, were destroyed. The entire crop of wheat and oats produced this year were stored in the building, and though given special attention by being kept constantly wet during the pro - gress of the fire, were so damaged as to be unfit for anything except hog feed. At the time the fire was discovered, it was beyond control of our fire department, and effort was directed to saving adjoining property. To those who were on the premises, it was evident that the fire was of incendiary origin. Before the burning tim - bers had ceased falling, a well directed effort was on foot to locate the guilty party. The effort was rewarded when at 5:30, a patient of the hospital who had escaped three days before was returned to the hospital and made a full confession of his guilt. This man has been a state charge for many years, having been cared for in turn at the Industrial School for Boys at Kearney ; The Institute for Feeble Minded Youth, at Beatrice; and at this hospital. When this administration took charge, he was away from the hospital, having escaped July 17th, 1900. On April 22nd, 1 901, he was returned, and remained until November 24th, 1901, when he again escaped, but was apprehended and returned two days later. Except that he has some tendency to steal, he </seg>
            <seg id="p015">89 was not considered a dangerous patient. In setting this fire, he evidently acted in response to an impulse which his undeveloped will- was unable to control. As soon as the walls were cool, the work of clearing away the debris was commenced, and a plan for making temporary repairs of the ruin was formulated. The building has been so repaired and arranged as to provide shelter for all the stock for the com - ing winter, and except that there is no room for feed, will be quite comfortable. A substantial brick building, 19 x 17 feet, with cement floor, has been erected near the barn. This will furnish shelter and warm quarters for the men who must be on duty there all of the time, and will also remove fire from the barn at all times. The plan for rebuilding will be considered in another paragraph of this report. FINANCIAL STATEMENT. The legislature of 1001 appropriated $156,675.00 to pay sal - aries, maintain and improve this hospital for the period begin - ning April 1st, 1901 and ending March 31st, 1903. The amounts thus appropriated were estimated upon the number of patients likely to be present. At the time the matter was considered by the Ways and Means Committee of the house and the Finance Committee of the Senate, it was concluded that 450 patients would be the maximum number for the first year, and 400 for the second year. At the end of the first six months of the per - iod, there were present 497. The number increased steadily until November 14th, 1902, when there were 668 patients under care and treatment here. The average number for the bien - nium being five hundred and fifty-six and one-half (556 yi ) which was fifty-six and one half (56 %) greater than the esti - mated maximum of the last year for which the appropriation was The following table shows the condition of the various funds at the close of business, November 30th, 1902. The balance in the various funds is supposed to provide for the institution's wants for the four remaining months, or until April 1st, 1903. </seg>

Effort to do so has, however, not been abandoned. PER CAPITA COST.

            <seg id="p017">91 Copies of the semi-annual reports now on file at this Hospital made by the Superintendent to the Governor, the same bearing his signature made under oath, shows the cost to have been as follows : First semi-annual period $105.04 Second semi-annual period 95-53 Third semi-annual period 93 O2 Fourth semi-annual period 9 2 -36 The per capita cost for the immediately preceding bien - nial period was, therefore $385 95 For this biennial period, the cost lias been for the First semi-annual period $ 95-8i Second semi-annual period 87.91 Third semi-annual period 73- 2 4 Fourth semi-annual period 66.05 $323.01 The per capita cost for this period has been $323.01 The saving per capita being $ 62 94 The amount ($62.94) multiplied by 556.5, the average daily number of patients present during the two years, shows the net saving to the state to be $35,026.00. IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED. FIRE PROTECTION. Attention is particularly called to the fact that the state has a large amount of property here, all of which, with the exception of the new wing for female patients, was erected with no attempt to make it fire-proof, or to so arrange the buildings as to render it difficult for fire in one to communicate with others. The fire at the barn demonstrated that the thing most needed to control a fire, namely, a large amount of water under high pressure, cannot be furnished or delivered with the facilities now provided. It is recommended and urged that a reservoir of sufficient size to store at least 1,000,000 gallons of water be constructed at the earliest possible moment, and that a pump of sufficient size and </seg>
            <seg id="p018">9 2 power to deliver at least six i *4-inch streams under a pressure of 150 pounds to the square inch, be purchased and installed immediately after the completion of the reservoir. This reser - voir, pump, and the necessary mains and hydrants, together with a sufficient amount of hose, would cost, approximately $10,000.00, It would, however, provide means to combat a fire of any pro - portion, and in time would be the means of saving more than it costs. Business prudence demands that this improvement be made at once. NEW BOILERS AND DYNAMOS. The boilers now in use at this Hospital were installed during the summer of 1889, and were all new at that time. An entire new heating, power and light plant was constructed at one time, for the reason that on February 5 of that year, that part of the institution was wholly destroyed by an explosion of the boilers. During the summer of 1895, all of these boilers were re-set and furnished with new flues, since which time no repairs have been made. Fourteen years of constant use has rendered them unsafe. The dynamos have been in use the same length of time, and owing to the increased capacity of the hospital, are no longer adequate to the demands made upon them. It is recommended that one 200-horse power, internally fired, Morrison tvpe, marine boiler, with a guaranteed working pres - sure of 125 pounds, together with one direct connected engine and dynamo, of a capacity of 1,000 16-candle power lights, be provided. This improvement would cost $7,000.00. THE BARN. An appropriation of $6,000 will restore the barn to its former condition. It is impossible to conduct so large a farm without this improvement, except at the cost of constant waste, which would amount to more than the interest upon the investment each year. THE GREEN HOUSE. Extensive repairs will be required during the coming biennium upon the green house. It is estimated that $1,000.00 will be </seg>
            <seg id="p019">State Hospital for Insane. 93 LAUNDRY, CHAPEL AND BAKERY. This laundry and chapel building, con&amp;u ucicd when the hos - pital had 350 patients, is now too small. Twenty-five hundred dollars will be required to erect the needed addition. The bak - ery must be enlarged to meet the demands. This would cost about $500.00. PLUMBING. The insanitary condition of the plumbing in the female wards and center building has been mentioned. It is in such a condi - tion as to be a constant menace to life. Next to fire protection, an appropriation for new plumbing is most needed. It is thought that $3,250.00 will be required. Estimates for ordinary running expenses cannot be made at this time, it being necessary to first learn the intention of the legislature concerning future provisions for the care of the insane. Should the Norfolk. Hospital be rebuilt, conditions here would be entirely different to what they would otherwise be. CONCLUSION. A series of tables, of interest to those who wish to compare this with former periods, follows. The Steward's Report con - tains a statement in detail of all the funds received and expended during the period covered by this report. Vouchers, properly executed and approved, for each item of expenditure are on file at the Hospital. i^he lasting gratitude of all the officers of this Hospital is due r excellency and the Board of Public Lands and Buildings valuable advice and aid at all times, and for the constant evi - ce of confidence you have shown the management; also for privilege of having administered its affairs untrammeled by spoils system of politics. Respectfully submitted, Jamrs L. Greene, Superintendent. Asylum, Nebraska, Nov. 30, 1902. </seg>
