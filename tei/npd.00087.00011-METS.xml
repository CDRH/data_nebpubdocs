         <seg id="p003">Trees, Shrubs, and Vines at the North Platte Experimental Substation : . H. A. McComb . NEBRASKA has been called the tree-planting state. Since its early be - ginnings, and from the passage of the Tree Claim act in 1872 and the inauguration of Arbor day in 1872 to the present time, tree planting has been an important factor in the establishment of homes. Naturally, sue - ' cesses have been fewer and failures more frequent as planting progressed V westward. In spite of many failures, however, some successful plantings may now be found in practically all parts of the state. These successful plantings in the midst of numerous failures impress the necessity for the use of hardy adapted stock, the use of special planting and cultural meth - i ods, and the choosing of favorable sites. ¦&gt;;¦¦ It is the purpose of this bulletin to report the results of trials of num- ¦ erous trees and shrubs at the North Platte Experimental Substation and to ; .;.'] discuss their adaptations or limitations. . ;• In cooperation with the United States Forest Service, two plantings of ¦:"?! deciduous forest trees comprising 15 species were made on about 20 acres al the North Platte Substation in 1907 and 1908. One of these was on :|'|- bench land where the water table is 30 to 40 feet below the surface. The ;; other was on table land where the water table is about 250 feet below the &amp;:[¦ surface. Numerous plantings have been made from time to time during '¦¦•? the 30 years since the Substation was established. Trials of trees and shrubs ,/i. have included most of the varieties listed by nurserymen, and many intro - v I ductions from various parts of the United States and from foreign lands. Many of these have been grown both on dry land and under irrigation. «! Some early plantings of conifers, beginning in 1908, were made on cul - tivated land and on rough, unbroken areas in the canyons, with commercial stock and stock from the United States Forestry Nursery at Halsey. Be - ;:. ginning in 1923 the canyon and hillside plantings have been extended and ¦ ' ;•' continued up to the present. For most of these, seedling stock produced at the Substation has been used. .... - -::. i. . •¦ In presenting the results of these trials, no attempt has been made to "";. ~::': give exact growth or survival records, but'rather to discuss each species and '. to give its general growth habits, adaptation, purpose for which it is best .•:¦,:. suited, and comparative value for the region. ¦.;¦', / CLIMATIC AND S(ML FACTORS . -, .jl Predmtation.—The limited rainfall and its uncertain distribution are ••; '¦" • the chic/limiting factors in the establishing and maintaining of trees and shrabsm central and western Nebraska. The average rainfall varies from -' i about 24 inches in the eastern part of the region to about 16 inches in the •' I I extreme west. At the North Platte Substation the 30-year average rainfall 'I ]- is 18.82 inches. The rainfall of the wettest year was 34.85 inches and of the -"if -. ¦- . - ¦ ¦ ...

Available moisture stored in the soil during periods of normal or excess rainfall may be completely exhausted during long periods of limited rainfall. Snow is variable, but usually not heavy. Because of the dry atmosphere, injury from ice or snow coating the trees is infrequent but at times severe. Hail is often severe, limiting the use of easily injured varieties. Many trees or shrubs with a large water requirement may be severely in - jured unless supplemental water is supplied. Others have developed adapta - tions such as restriction of growth and going into what may be called a scmidormant condition. They are popularly listed as drouth resistant. The well-established, deep-rooted, drouth-resistant tree or shrub is able to sur - vive for a longer period of time without serious injury. Temperature.—Mean temperatures decrease, but variations in tempera - ture, both daily and seasonal, increase from east to west in the state Sum - mer temperatures above 100° F. and winter temperatures ranging from 20 to JO below zero are common. Alternate thawing and freezing in winter are often the cause of what is termed sunscald. The early fall freeze may occur before seasonal growth is stopped or a late spring freeze after spring growth has started, causing severe killing back. During 30 years at the North Platte Substation, the average length of the growing season has been 151 days-from May 7to October 5 The extremes have been 121 for the shortest and 171 days for the longest'season. Late-spring freezes ranged from April 19 to May 28 and first fall freezes . from September 1/ to October 20. Zero or lower temperature has occurred as late as March 2 and as early as November 11. rJ^rl* Prevalence of hi Sh winds is one of the factors that in - crease the difficulty in growing trees. Wind increases evaporation. and causes heavy losses of moisture directly from the soil. It also increases trans - pirauon and in this way increases the water requirement of the plant Wind direction is an important consideration in determining the location of windbreaks and shelterbelts. In this region the general direction of the wind in winter is from the northwest to the southeast and the reverse dur - mg the summer months. Late-winter and early-spring winds are often high S? iL~Th J e 1 S0'Ijin1 j in th" region consists of two main types, usually desm- i N« lv aSal afe sutw 7^'f ¥** "* ** I nSItJ m " I obt J " \B^ing of plants, although better ! land n^ k °'f amed '" s°me C3Ses b Y the use °f fertilizers.

         <seg id="p005">i Trees, Shrubs, and Vines, North Platte Substation | Chlorosis or yellows.—Throughout most of this region the loss of the I natural green color and consequent yellowing of some species frequently ' : occurs. This condition is known as chlorosis and varies considerably in ¦'. severity from year to year. The most common cause in central and western : ¦ Nebraska is a lack of readily available iron. UsuaUy there is an abundance ', of iron in the soil, but frequently it is in a form which the plants cannot : , make use of in sufficient quantities to supply their needs. This condition is due to the rather high lime content of the soils. An excessive amount of lime makes the iron insoluble and unavailable to the plants. Complete con - ' trol of this condition over any considerable area is physically and economic - ally impossible at present. 1 v . Probably the best advice at present is to plant more of the species which ¦ do not seem to be so readily affected by this condition and then not give '% them excessive amounts of water. Some shrubs such as the spirea yellow badly almost every season where they receive an abundance of water, but I when grown under dry-land conditions, they are very little affected except in very wet seasons. THE WINDBREAK There is a definite need for windbreaks in western Nebraska. On the ¦ south, protection is needed for the home, plants, orchard, and landscape planting, against the hot, drying winds. It is needed on the north as a pro - -;' tection for the home and stock from the cold winter winds. v Experience has shown that windbreak plantings may vary from three to • severalrbwsof trees, according to the space available. A desirable plan is to ; plant larger growing trees in the center rows and smaller trees or large ': shrubs in the outside rows. Spacings varying from 12x12 to 24x24 or inter - ' mediate combinations should be considered, depending on the species " ; planted and the kind of location. Trees planted in the diamond will be ;; effective sooner than those planted in the square. The windbreak tree needs Cf careful pruning. The canopy or head is started near the ground. Narrow };•-¦ crotches should be cut out, and strong, well spaced branches selected. ''§ The spread of both top and roots of a tree is limited by the nearness |; of its neighbors. Trees that are widely spaced have larger areas of soil from . I which to draw moisture, and in drouth years have consequently a better $'(..¦¦ chance to survive. Branching throughout the height of the tree is pro - \ 'There arc some things that may be done on a small scale that seem to hive some value - : - !• Sulphuric, acid applied to the Mil in rather large amounu seems to be beneficial but i, cipcniivc ' '. and cannot be vied rear growing plants.

This may be done by boring holes into the ; V trunk and pultinu the copperas into them.

Trees that are planted closely have a tend- : ency to prune themselves. The lower branches die, leaving poles with i live branches near the top. The western yellow pines shown on the cover j illustration were spaced 4xB and show this tendency toward self-pruning. At North Platte, a Chinese elm plantation further illustrates the results of l close spacing without artificial pruning. In 1917, 100 of these trees were planted at distances of 4xB feet. They were permitted to grow as they I would, and in 1937 the distance to the lowest live branch was approximate- j ly 20 feet. .

Pints especially are not tolerant of shade. ; For the dryland wintlhrcakl deciduous trees may also be used. The Chinese elm is rapid growingland fairly drouth-resistant, and is prob - ably the best tree lor the center row or rows of the windbreak.

Background plantings of trees are not only attractive but serve as wind - breaks. Around the farm house, foundation plantings (those near the foundation of the house) can be grown. Shrubs are attractive in angles or at corners and along the sides of the house, preferably with some variation in species and type. Both deciduous shrubs and conifers are available for this pur - pose, in addition to perennial flowers. • The border planting is located at the edge of the lawn. The outer edges may be a screen planting with a windbreak used in the background. Groups of deciduous shrubs, conifers, and perennials are used, but a large number of kinds are not necessary. Attention should be given especially to the amount and location of the supply of irrigation water and also to the slopes and the arrangement of plantings. A pleasing and easily managed plantation should be the aim. </seg>
         <seg id="p008">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 310 WOOD LOT On many farms it is profitable to establish a wood lot. Sites selected may be on good farm land, but the wood lot is more often used as a crop on land not so well adapted to farming. Trie canyons, steep hillsides, sandy lands, and low river lands suggest ideal sites. In some situations wood lots ,ire useful in soil-erosion control. When older, they may furnish wood and poles. Lumber has been sawed from cottonwoods. Stock find comfort in the shade. The wood lot on the table land will not attain great size, and at North Platte reaches its limit of growth due to insufficient water supply when the trees are quite young. CULTURAL METHODS Cultivation.—Trees and shrubs respond to good cultural methods. Cul - tivation is necessary to conserve the moisture, and in dry-land plantings cul - tivation means the difference between a reasonable hope for success and failure. In the irrigated plantings it is not necessary to apply water so fre - quently when good cultivation is given. Good cultivation means weed con - trol, and gives the planting a neat appearance. Windbreaks may be spaced so that ordinary farm cultivators may be used. Hand tools must be used in the border, foundation, and (lower-garden plantings. Landscape plantings should lie edged frequently to prevent the lawn grass from spreading into ¦ the planted area. j Irrigation.—ln irrigated sections it is easy to provide water for the ! plants except when the grade arounil the liuilding site is higher than the level of the ditch water. Water may then be piped from the well. In dry - land sections, i&lt; is important to provide some water from the well for stress times. It is often necessary to reduce the size of the landscape plantings and the size of the lawn within range of the water supply. Outside this range, planting should he limited to the most drouth-resistant varieties. Watering at planting time is especially important in assuring a good sur- ; vival. Heavy waterings are desirable so that the soil around the roots will maintain the plant in a growing condition for a considerable time. A good i method to use is to dig trenches around trees and allow a small stream of . )• water to flow into the trench until water has penetrated to an adequate depth. After the surface becomes somewhat dry. the trench may he filled and the soil worked to limit evaporation. Another method for use where water is very limited is to sink near the plant one or more large tile uprights so that the bottom is near the level of trie roots. This filled with water frequently will supply the needs of the plant and limit loss from surface evaporation. Daily light waterings do not penetrate deep enough to reach the roots and in dry weather most of the water is lost by evaporation. Pruning the growing tree.—Often trees are two to three years old and are branched when planted. Some cutting back and thinning of surplus branches may be necessary to balance the root system. After the larger trees have become established and have attained suffici - ent height, the main branches should be selected. Narrow V-shaped crotches I </seg>
         <seg id="p009">Trees, Shrubs; and Vines, North Pu\tte Substation are weak and weave back and forth in the wind and start a split. They should not be allowed-to develop. Many have difficulty in cutting out one of the branches forming these narrow crotches when on the main leader, because often the two branches are nearly equal in size and the cutting of one may weaken the other. A very safe way is to select the stronger one, or one growing nearer the right direction. The other branch may be cut back. After this it will not grow so fast and may be cut the following year or later. A wide canopy should be encouraged. HARDINESS Hardiness is the measure of a plant's ability to thrive under adverse con - ditions of climate, soil, and moisture supply, with consideration given to cul - ture and protection. The selection of hardy varieties for the windbreak and landscape plant - ings requires careful consideration.

         <seg id="p011">Trees, Shrubs, and Vines, North Platte Substation, ability of seed selection from drouth-resistant strains for dry-land plant - ings. Most of the hackberry at the Substation are an early lot planted in 1908, and their seedlings. The hackberry makes a very satisfactory growth when given plenty of water, but on dry land is much slower. Its ability to live through stress years after becoming well established makes it one of the best trees throughout the region. The, tree does not grow as tall as the American elm, but forms naturally a wide canopy, making it an excelllent shade tree. It may be used as the slower-growing tree in the windbreak. . w - *mm KM I Fig. 4.—Chinese Elm No, 3, bordering drive in front of Substation office. The hackberry is not troubled with borers. A disease causing witches' - broom branching occasionally appears but has not proved serious here, and is seldom found on native trees. The similarity of the fruit stones of the present hackberry to the fossil hackberry stones found in abundance in the rock outcroppings in western Nebraska and several neighboring states in - dicates a close relationship between present and ancient forms and justifies the conclusion that hackberries much like those nov/ grown were com - mon many centuries ago. 2. Chinese Elm (Ulmtis piimib).—The Chinese elm has become popu - lar as a shade and street tree, and is very-valuable in the windbreak. Be - cause of rapid growth, shade trees may be produced or an effective wind - break established quicker than with any of the other trees except the cot - tonwood. The foliage is comparatively dense; leaves appear early in the spring and are dropped late in the fall. This habit of early and late, growth makes it somewhat susceptible to injury from early-fall and late-spring low temperatures. Considerable injury resulted to the bark and some of the </seg>

Silver or White Poplar {Populus alba—hon. var.).—This tree grows to large size rapidly. It has about the same hardiness as the common cotton - wood and may be used for the same purposes. It has not been popular, lie - cause it sprouts from the roots freely. H. Willow species.—The Substation dry-land plantations are not ideal for willows, because they are better adapted to subirrigated or irrigated soils. The black willow (Salix mgra) is native and hardy, and is adapted to low, wet soil. A few trees on dry land made a rapid early growth, but were short lived.

Honey locust is especially valuable in the southern and eastern parts of the district and in the more favorable sites somewhat farther north and west. 10. Kentucky Coffee Tree (Gymnodadus dioica).— -The station planting consists of three trees planted in 1915. These trees, have, been in dense shade but are alive after 20 years. In North Platte a group of Kentucky cof - fee trees were very thrifty and attractive for over 40 years until removed to clear the land for a business building. Probably this tree could be used more extensively for shade or as an ornamental tree on bottom lands in this territory. </seg>
         <seg id="p016">Nebraska Acriclltitral Experiment Station Bulletin 310 11. Black Locust (Robinia pseudocu:acia).—lht tree is hardy and rapid in growth, but has been so badly injured by borers that it is of no value for ordinary uses. However, since it is drouth resistant and jsprouts readily from the root to form clumps, it may be used to advantage to control ero - sion in certain locations such as canyon heads. 12. Siberian Pea Tree (Caragana arborescent).—This is|a low-growing bushy tree, quite hardy, and will withstand considerable drouth. It is use - ful in the screen planting or as a tall shrub in the border planting. It is covered with beautiful yellow flowers in the spring. . THE OLEASTER FAMILY (Elaeagnaceac) I 13.

It is not very satisfactory as a shade or street tree and re- | quires considerable pruning to obtain a sufficiently high head to keep the irunk free from young, thorny branches. The Russian olive has proved | hardy but easily injured by hail. It has lived fully as long on dry land as under irrigation at North Platte. 5 14. Buffalo Berry (Shepherdia argentea).— The buiJalo berry is native throughout this region, growing on canyon banks and along rivers. Its sil- ¦ vercolorcd foliage gives a rather pleasing effect if used in the background. </seg>
         <seg id="p017">Trees, Shrubs, and Vines, North Platte Substation It makes a good low windbreak tree. The branches break easily, limiting its usefulness. The fruit is edible and highly prized for jelly. : THE BEECH FAMILY \Fagaceae) 15.i Bur Oak (Quercus macrocarpa).— -The bur oak is a slow-growing tiee, adapted to the valley land under irrigation or where its roots can reach underground water. Trees on the table land have lived but made little growth. They are beautiful, sturdy trees, and are valuable as a part of the landscape planting where they can be grown. On the Substation grounds they have been hardy, have made a good growth and have been free from disease and insect injury. Fie. 10.—Twenty-nine-year-old bur oak—9 years on dry land and 20 years on substation lawn. THE MULBERRY FAMILY (Moraceac) 16. Russian Mulberry (Morus alba tatarica).—The mulberry has been hardy in the dry-land plantings where given plenty of room but does better under more favorable locations where it may be planted for screens or part o£ the windbreak or used as a trimmed hedge. The fruit may be used and is attractive to birds. It is adapted to the southern part of the region and somewhat farther north in the more favorable locations. </seg>
         <seg id="p018">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 310 THE OLIVE FAMILY (Olcaccac) 17. Green Ash (Fraxinus lanceolata). —The green ash trees in the Sub - station dry-land plantings have shown an ability to live but have not made much growth. They have been severely injured by borers. The ash is bet - ter adapted for valley plantings and under irrigation. It may be used as a part of the landscape planting in more favorable places. It is hardy, to low temperatures. Some of the green ash on old tree claims, planted on dry land, are still alive, having died back and sprouted up from the roots. Green ash may be used as the low part of the windbreak plantings, because of the ability of the roots to live and renew growth after being killed back. THE LINDEN FAMILY (Tiliaccac) 18. American Linden {Tilia americana).—The American linden or Iv.sswood has proved hardy on the station plantings, and is native farther north. The basswood planted singly and pruned high sunscalds easily and this limits its use as a street or shade tree unless effort is made to protect it .ijjainst the sun. It is at its best in groups with trees set close enough to give each other protection and may be successfully used on dry land in wind - 1-reaks when headed low. The European linden (Tilia europea) has survived and is apparently hardy. There are some good trees in North Platte. It is worthy of, trial as a shade or ornamental tree. THE MAPLE FAMILY (Aceracrae) 14. Box Elder (Acer negunrfo).—The box elder has been thrifty in the Substation plantings, except that, when it was trimmed with a high head in the forest plantations on both table and bench land, sunscald resulted. It is at its best headed near the ground and used in the windbreak or wood lot. It is hardy throughout most of this region. There are numerous good dry-land plantings but it is best in valley lands. 20. Silver or Soft Maple (Acer dasycarpum).—Thc silver or soft maple has not been a thrifty tree in the plantings, although a number of trees on the dry-land bench planting are still alive and attractive at 25 years of age. These trees have suffered considerable limb breakage, and many sprouts have grown on the roots and trunks. Over most of the area it should be classed as a short-lived tree. However, there are a few small, protected areas within the district where it makes a beautiful, thrifty tree. THE BUCKTHORN FAMILY (Klmmnaccac) 21. Buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartics—The buckthorn is a strong, vig - orous, closely branched small tree that has been valuable in dry-land plant - ings. It is useful in the taller hedges, in the screen planting, or the lower part of the windbreak. The buckthorn, however, is a host of the crown rust of oats and should not be planted in sections where this trouble exists. Rust infection has not been observed on buckthorn in this region but it has been shown to be of economic importance in lowa and some other states. </seg>
         <seg id="p019">Trees, Shrubs, and Vines, North Platte Substation The buckthorn is adapted throughout the state and at the Substation has proved satisfactory in dry-land plantings on the bench land.... THE WALNUT FAMILY Unghndaceae) . 22. Black Walnut (Juglans nigra). —The black walnut does well on the valley land that is subirrigated or irrigated. The loss has been heavy in the bcnchland plantation 40 feet above underground water. It should not be used as a part of the mixed yard planting but rather in the background or in isolated groups, because other plants do not scan to thrive in association with it. The nut crop alone makes it worth while, and the tree has an ulti - mate stumpage value. The walnut can be grown in the southern part of this area and much farther north if care is given to selection of the hardiest strains. THE ROSE FAMILY {Roiaccae) 23. Plum (Primus americana). —The native wild plum may be used in the background, and is a good dry-land tree. It is hardy and produces a crop of edible fruit. It sprouts freely from the roots and if left will soon form a thicket. It is often used as shade for poultry. Many horticultural varieties of the American plum are hardy and may be used instead of the wild plum, but as these are budded trees, they are often on roots that do not sprout. The Wyant trees have been the longest lived in Substation plant - ings. ¦ ._;•; !v; ¦ . '.. .' ;:' ¦ .-. - ¦¦¦:. .;.'¦ ".¦ /¦ ¦ ; ••¦¦;¦•. ... 24. Chokecherry (Prunus virginiana and P. demissa melanocarpa).— The common chokecherry {Prunus virginiana) is native and grows well anywhere in this region. It may be planted wherever there is need for a small tree. The fruit is edible and attractive to birds. The chokecherry sprouts freely from the roots, forming thickets, and should have plenty of room. It is a valuable tree for the low part of the windbreak. The Rocky Mountain chokecherry (Prunus demissa melanocarpa) is also native and has the same uses as the common.chokecherry. i 25. Bechtel Crab (Mains ioensis plena-hort. var.).—The Bechtel crab produces a heavy crop of double blossoms, but no fruit. The tree is hardy and should be planted as individual trees or in-groups spaced far enough apart to give room to develop. 26. Hawthorn (Cratacgus species).— Several species, such as C. suc - culenta, tomentosa, crusgalli, and coccinea, have been tried as ornamental trees, several of which have been hardy. Some of the best results have been from species native in the eastern part of the state and lowa. The tree is useful in groups or as individual trees. The ripe red or yellow fruits add to the fall effect and are popular with children. ¦'¦ 27. Fruit trees.— r Fruit trees are sometimes suitable for a limited use in ornamental purposes. Many of the fruit trees are ornamental and some are quite hardy. Especially in dry-land.regions with a limited water supply, the use of a few fruit trees may be made a part of the plantings in the back - ground. •;' </seg>
         <seg id="p020">Nebraska Acriclltiral Experiment Station Bulletin 310 The Duchess apple is one of the best of the upright type. It is also one of the hardiest. The Wealthy may be used where a larger, spreading type is desired. It is the best apple in the Substation plantings and is probably the best apple for most of this section. The Florence crab apple is very hardy and is attractive in blossom and when the fruit is ripe. The fruit is of good quality. The Dolga crab apple is attractive in both blossom and fruit. It has not had as extensive a trial, but is very promising. The Whitney crab is fairly hardy, somewhat more subject to disease, but worth planting. Crab apples are excellent for home use and are always a favorite with children. A number of pears are hardy and drouth resistant, but should be plant - ed on well drained ground. The table-land planting has stood up well. At least two or three varieties should be used if fruit is desired. The Flemish Beauty has been the most productive. It is somewhat spreading in type. The Bartlett and Clapp's Favorite are more upright. The Kieffer has not been satisfactory. Cherry trees are ornamental when young. The Montmorency is the best. For a long fruiting period, however, it is well to plant the Early Richmond for the early and the F.nglish Morello for late use. The English Morello is a shorter-lived tree. The apricot is attractive in blossom, foliage, and fruit, and has proved hardy in station plantings. Blossoms come early and are usually killed. Substation trees have had two good crops on trees twenty years old. The Superb is the only variety that has been on extensive trial. THE BIRCH FAMILY (Bctulaceac) 28. Birch (Betula species).—Several species of birch have been tried. Most of them seem hardy to low temperatures but do not stand alternate thawing and freezing in winter or hot summer winds. The canoe or paper birch (Betuh papyrifcra) is a native in limited quantities in the northern part ot the state but many have died in Substation plantings after mild winters followed by late freezing. Betula platyphylla, F. P. I. No. 65918. an imported birch, has been growing a few years. It has so far been better than the canoe birch and is worthy of further trial. European weeping birch (B. alba pendula) has been as hardy as others. In this region, all birch should have protection from the south. CONIFERS OR EVERGREENS This group contains resinous trees or shrubs with persistent evergreen foliage. The fruit is a cone or sometimes a berry. The stock that has been used in planting windbreaks or groves has usually consisted of seedlings or trees transplanted at least once. In planting for ornamental purposes, it is usually better to obtain larger specimens. The larger evergreens should al - ways be moved with a ball of earth. This method is designated by nursery - men as "B &amp; B" meaning balled and burlapped. Moving in the winter time with a ball of frozen earth has been very satisfactory. </seg>

Western Yellow (Pinus fonderosa).—The. western yellow or bull pine is native in the western and northwestern parts of this district and has been very satisfactory in the dry-land plantings. Young trees are often in- </seg>
         <seg id="p022">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 310 iured by the larvae of the pine tip moth, but the moth does not fly high to lay its eggs and there is little damage to the larger trees. The foliage of western yellow pine is light green. It has the capacity to become a large tree and can be used in an evergreen windbreak where ultimately height is desired. It is useful for ornamental purposes, in groups, or as specimen t rees. 2. Austrian Pine (Pinus nigra).— The Austrian pine is an introduced tree. Some strains have not been satisfactory, but other strains have proved hardy and are probably adapted to most of this region except the more severe locations. The foli - . age is a dark green and jjJl^ toes not change color in ikS^^m.Jl winter. It is probably the ii^flU ''Cit 'ar"c '"'"c '"r orna' jJuJjB mental purposes.

It is useful in ornamental plantings and may be used in the windbreak. The young trees are more attractive than o!der ones. It changes color somewhat in winter. The Scotch pine makes ;i faster early growth than the western yellow. 4. Mugho Pine (Pinus montuna mughus).— The mugho pine is a dwarf, useful only for ornamental purposes. It is hardy and may be used in the border or foundation plantings or in trimmed beds. If used in groups, it is better to use an open location where it will not become shaded. In prun - ing, the longer branches may be cut back to the desired form, after which the shape may be maintained or held back to the desired size by breaking out terminal buds on branches in early spring. 5. Umber Pine (Pinus flexitis). -The limber pine is being given a trial for ornamental purposes. It has a silvery color, and is very promising and worthy of trial. b </seg>
         <seg id="p023">Trees, Shrubs, and Vines, North Platte Substation 6. Jack Pine (Pints banfoiana).— The jack pine has not been satisfac - tory in any of the Substation plantings. It does not respond to the soil in the hard lands, and its roots are shallow but may live a few years. It has done well farther north in the sandy regions. The tree is not adapted for ornamental purposes other than use in the windbreak or grove. It does not make a well-shaped tree, and the foliage does not have an attractive color. THE JUNIPERS The junipers include a large number of species. The leaves are short and scale-like and do not have a stem. Some of the junipers are the host plant for therust affecting apples (Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae Schw.). Ordinarily this may be controlled in this region by picking off the rust balls from the cedar trees. Two species commonly called red cedar are native in this region. Both are hardy and are well adapted to dry-land plantings, especially in dry-land windbreaks. They respond to irrigation, and are often used in the ornamental plantings in groups or as individual trees. They vary much in form and color of foliage, and for this reason there are many strains on the market grown from cuttings of selected trees. These red cedars stand pruning well and are often pruned in a narrow coni - cal shape and used in foundation plantings. 7. Red Cedar (Juniperus virginiana).— This is the eastern species, native as far west as North Platte. It may be planted, any where in the district. Many of the selected strains such as /. v. glauca and /. v. cannarti are from this specks. Locally this has been called the Platte River cedar. It is sus - ceptible to the cedar rust. It matures seed in one year.. ¦ 8. Colorado Juniper or Rocky Mountain Cedar {juniperus scopuhrum). —This cedar is very similar to the preceding and difficult to distinguish from it. The chief difference is that it requires two years to mature seed. It is used for the same purpose as the common red cedar and apparently it is not so susceptible to cedar rust. The species includes a large number of trees with silvery foliage, pyramidal in form, which are probably more, desirable, especially in the western parts. 9. Chinese Juniper (Juniperus chinensis).— This cedar has proved very good in trials. There is variation in the color of foliage and many selections for form and color are propagated by cutting. The needles are very sharp. This juniper has improved in appearance as it has grown older. ' ¦ 10. Savin Juniper (Juniperus sabina). —The Savin juniper is a dwarf and is used in foundation plantings or groups. It has proved hardy and may be kept small enough by pruning for a planting in the foreground. It makes an excellent border to larger evergreen trees and deserves a trial throughout the district in evergreen plantings where dwarfs are desired. 11. Pfitzer Juniper (Juniperus fhinensis pfitzeriana).—'The Pfitzer juniper;is wide-spreading and grows larger than the Savin. It may be staked up and is very hardy and useful in ornamental evergreen plantings. 12. Koster Juniper (Juniperus virginiana fosteri—hart, var.)—-The Koster juniper is a dwarf form of the common red cedar. Its habits of </seg>

Colorado Spruce (Picea pungens).—Tiie foliage varies in color from a dark green to the popular blue shades. Only a small percentage of seed - lings are blue.

It does best where protected, especially from the south, al - though a few of the Substation trees have done well in the open. It is a de - sirable evergreen for ornamental purposes when properly protected.

White or Concolor Fir (Abies concolor).—This is a beautifully col - ored rir and may be planted in the more favorable sites. It is better adapt - ed to the western and northern part of the district. 19. Balsam Fir (Abies balsamea).— This fir has limited use similar to that of the concolor, and has been as hardy in plantings at the Substation. THE ARBORVTTAES 20. Arborvitae.—The arborvitaes have frond-like foliage, leaves small and scale-like, arranged opposite, causing the twigs to appear flattened. Numerous horticultural varieties have been tried and most of them have not been entirely hardy. The Oriental (Thuja orientalis) or, as it is some - times called, the Chinese arborvitae, has been quite hardy and able to with - stand more heat and dry weather than other kinds. It makes a beautiful summer evergreen, but changes color in winter months. The American ( Thuja ocadentalis) should be planted sparingly. It often lives a number of years, only to be killed by unfavorable weather conditions. The Pyramid - al arborvitae has survived longer than some other kinds. Plants in found - ation plantings have survived through the recent severe years without injury. DECIDUOUS SHRUBS This Ust includes all the hardy kinds that have proved satisfactory at the North Platte Substation, and in addition a few that are valuable in certain situations or under certain methods of treatment. Because of the small variety of dwarf shrubs available, a few semihardy ones have been included. These dwarf kinds and a few larger ones have tender tops but hardy roots and, even though the tops die back, make good shrubs by early summer. A few dwarfs for trial are also included. Because of their hardy parentage, and successful short trials, these may have a better chance than some of the varieties known to be semihardy. For ready reference, varieties are listed alphabetically in Table 3 with brief descriptions. Further descriptions follow in paragraphs 'having num - bers that correspond to the reference numbers. 1. Spireas {Smraea species).—The genus Spiraea includes numerous species and varieties with attractive bushes and blossoms. All the kinds tried have Seen affected by chlorosis or yellowing when planted in locations where this is common, especially under heavy irrigation. Several kinds, however, have not been affected in dry-land plantings or where irrigation V limited. r The Spiraea vanhouttei lias proved the best all-purpose spirea and is one of the best all-purpose shrubs for this region except in spots subject to chlorosis. It is a pretty, graceful bush at all times. It has been used in the foundation or border plantings, and it makes a graceful untrimmed hedge. The Garland spirea (Spiraea arguta) is similar to the Vanhoutte. The blossoms are earlier, it is fairly hardy, and may be used in about the same way. Several dwarf spireas have been semihardy, and valuable for a temporary planting. Spiraea froebeli (hort. var.) has been the hardiest. It has lasted several years, and if it dies back, makes new growth quickly. </seg>

Bush Honeysuckle.—Several varieties of bush honeysuckle have been grown. They vary in shape and size and in color of blossom. All the varieties tried have been hardy, except in 1931. The severe late freezes of that spring, occurring after the new growth had started, caused severe in - jury. This is the only severe injury noted during the 30 years that this shrub has been grown here. ¦ : The Tatarian varieties (Loniceratatarica) are upright in growth with blossoms ranging from a dark pink to white. These rank first in beauty of blossom among the honeysuckles grown here.

H.—Taurian bush honeysuckle and iris on the Substation, grounds. v Lilac (Syringa species).—The common lilac (Syringa vttlgaris) is hardy and has proved very satisfactory both on dry land and under irriga- : lion. Plants of the common lilac that were set soon after the Substation was started are strong and vigorous, blossoming nearly every spring. The shrub is large and is valuable as a screen or low windbreak as well as in an ornamental group. The common white lilac grows taller and is not so free in producing blossoms as the common purple lilac. Both are slow in com - ing into bloom. Some of the named varieties begin blossoming when quite young. Only a few of these, mostly unidentified, have been tried. All of these, however, have been hardy. The Chinese Lilac (5. chinensis) is smaller than the common lilac and more like the Persian. The blossom clusters are not so large as those of the common but are so abundant as to nearly cover the bush. There is a wide range of color. It may be used in any situation requiring rather large shrubs. </seg>

Cotoneaster {Cotoneaster acutifolia). —The Peking cotoneaster is much like the Vanhoutte spirea in form and has not yellowed so badly in ¦ places subject to chlorosis. The blossoms are not so showy but there is a ¦ heavy crop of berries in the-fall that are attractive. The cotoneaster may be ! used for die same purposes as the Vanhoutte spirea and in addition may be . used in a low, trimmed hedge. It has proved hardy, and several hundred seedlings have been grown for further trial. ; Fig. 15.—Chinese lilac foreground, western yellow pine at the back. . . 5. Flowering Currant or Slender Golden Currant (Kibes aureum). — ! The flowering currant is a native shrub with very fragrant yellow blossoms : appearing quite early in the spring. It makes a very effective low, unprun- . ed hedge and may be used in many places to advantage. The fruit is edible. : 6. Wahoo (Eiionymus atropurpureus). —The wahoo is an upright - growing shrub characterized by a dense growth of rather heavy leaves which V turn to a beautiful reddish color in the fall and remain on the bush until rather late. The bush is especially pretty when covered with its seed cap- &#132; sules. This shrub is quite hardy and valuable because of its brilliant color \ at a time when color effects are not common. 1 7. Elder (Sambucus species).—The Golden American Elder {Sambucus ' canadensis aurea —hort. var.) is hardy. It is adapted for group plantings or j mixtures where the yellowish color of its foliage is desired. It is a large ! shrub. The fruit is edible; . i 8. Dogwood (Cornus stolonijera). —The dogwood should be used in the I shady, moist places. Its chief beauty lies in the red color of its canes in the i late fall and winter. Some strains of the Cornus siolonijera have more high - ly colored canes arid foliage than the native species. The native, however, ) has been somewhat hardier. . j '. ; v" - ..¦•¦¦¦ ¦; ¦¦¦¦ ;¦ .'' :. '" ' : r :'¦'¦". ' ":;'.. "¦¦¦' i </seg>
         <seg id="p030">Nebraska Acriclttl-ral Experiment Station Bulletin 310 9. Mock Orange (Philadelphus species).—The Sweet Mock Orange ; (Philadelphus coronariut) grows into a rather tall, narrow bush and pro- ! (luces an annual crop of white blossoms. There has been some killing back ; ol immature wood, indicating the possibility of winter injury under severe climatic conditions. It is probably the best bush of its type available. Virginal or Double Mock Orange (Philadelphus virgtnales—hon. var.) is not so tall as the Sweet and is fairly hardy but may occasionally kill back and quickly recover. The blossoms are double white. There is usually a smaller crop of blossoms in the fall. The dwarf horticultural varieties of mock orange, Lemoine and Mont Wane, are semihariiy. The blossoms are often killed by frost, and if the canes arc killed back, they may be cut back and the new growth soon makes an attractive shrub. ID. Juneberry (Amdanchier canadensis and other species).—The June- Ix-rry in the Substation plantings grows more like a large shrub than a i tree. One kind under I•.

The blossoms and young twigs are useful in bouquets. 12. Caragana (Caragana species).—The Caragana or Siberian pea tree (Caragana arborescens) is one of the better dry-land small trees or large shrubs. It makes a good windbreak tree. It is better for that purpose if al - lowed to send up several stems from near the ground. A few other very promising species are under trial. The dwarf Caragana {Caragana pygmaea) is a new kind that has had very limited trial in this region. It is dwarf in habit of growth and seems to be hardy at Cheyenne, Wyoming, station. It is worthy of trial. ¦ . 13. Snowball (Viburnum opulus sterile).—The snowball is one of the best shrubs. The blossoms are large and beautiful, but are often injured by wind. The viburnums that have been tried are all rather large shrubs, and do best when they have plenty of moisture. 14. High-bush Cranberry .(Viburnum opuhis).— The high-bush cran - berry (the parent of the snowball) has the same type of bush. The blossoms are not so beautiful but there is a beautiful crop of red seeds that last until late fall. A closely related species (Viburnum americanum) is very similar. Selections for type are now being made and offered on the market. 15. Lantana or Wayfaring Tree (Viburnum lantaiia).— This shrub has spreading growth habits and is rather large and coarse. The leaves are crinkled, with a reddish tinge, and the blossoms are fairly showy. There are large clusters of red seeds that become purple, and remain on the bush for a long time in the fall. This shrub is valuable where fairly large shrubs are needed. . :. i 16. Arrowwood (Viburnum dentatum).— This species had had a limit - ed trial, and is worthy of further trial.' •:. 17. Sumac—The cut-leaf sumac (Rhustyphina laciniatd) is valuable in a group or a border. The wild native variety (Rhus glabra) does not grow so large, but has some uses. Both spread by root but are easily held in : control. ;.- . . . ' . : : . . '¦"¦'¦¦' 18. Ninebark (Physocarpus opulijoUus').— The ninebark is a rather coarse shrub. It is hardy but has been short-lived in the station plantings. It may be used in groups in the background. The dwarf ninebark (Physocar - pus monogynus) is a promising dwarf for trial. • • 19. Buckbush or ConAbetiy (Symphoricarpos).— Three species of buck - bush are native and all are hardy dwarf shrubs. They spread badly from the roots but make good low shrubs if controlled. They are good soil bind - ers in steep banks. Various common names are applied. Coralberry (S. vul - ¦'. garis) is native along river banks and dry-land sites, especially hillsides or in canyons. The berries are red. It is sometimes called Indian Currant. Others (S. racemosus, S. occidentalis), sometimes called snbwberry, wax - berry, wolf berry, and,, other names, are native. They have been used as dwarf shrubs. The berries are white. " ¦ 20. False Indigo (Amorpha (rulicosa),— -This shrub is also known as river locust and indigo plant, and belongs to the same genus as the shoe - string, or lead plant; It is native in the valley, especially along the rivers, </seg>
         <seg id="p032">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 310 and is hardy and very attractive. It grows four to five feet tall, and is listed by many nurserymen. 21. Lead Plant (Amorpha species).—Two dwarf shrubs belonging to die genus Amorpha are found growing native in dry situations in this region. Both are hardy and often offered by nurserymen. The lead plant or shoe - string (Amorpha canescens) is very abundant. Its foliage is a leaden hue, which suggests the name. The root system is woody and stringy and difficult to cut with the plow. It is easier to purchase nursery-grown plants or grow them from seed than to dig them in the prairies. The dwarf false indigo p!ant (Amorpha microphylla) is not so common. It is smaller in size, seldom being more than one foot in height. It may be used in the rock garden. 22. Sand Cherry {Primus besseyi).— -The sand cherry is a native dry - land plant and has ornamental value under cultivation. The fruit is edible. 23. Tree of Heaven ( Ailanthtis glandiilosa).— This tree goes under a number of local names. Farther east it becomes a good-sized tree. In our plantings it dies back but may be used as a shrub by following the practice of cutting back near the ground. New stems develop so quickly that a very pieasing effect is attained. The pinnate leaves are often two to three feet long. The tree spreads by seed and suckers badly from the roots. Tt is not adapted even as a shrub in most severe locations. 24. Privet (Ligustnim species).—Among the numerous privets tried, none has been found uniformly hardy for hedge purposes. A variety intro - duced 191*5 by the federal Bureau of Plant Introduction under the num - ber 26767 has proved far hardier than any other kind so far tried. 25. Flowering Almond (Amygdalus species).—The flowering almond often lives for a few years and produces good crops of blossoms, but it has not been reliable and plants have been short lived. 26. Saltbush (Halimodendron, F. P. I. No. 60341).—The saltbush may prove especially valuable tor preventing erosion. It spreads rapidly by root - stocks and may become a pest. It is apparently hardy and adapted to dry - land conditions, where it grows from three to four feet high. It is quite thorny. If used in ornamental plantings, it should be grafted stock. 27. Sorbaria (Sorbaria sorbifolia and S. auurgens, F. P. 7. No. 76117) — The Sorbarias die back, but sprout from the ground and give a good sum - mer crop of flowers. They may be considered as perennials 28. Japanese Barberry (Berberis thunbergi).- This shrub has not been satisfactory for general planting. A few have done well for a time but have died back. The new red-leaf barberry has been a failure. Both catch much trash that is difficult to remove on account of thorns 29. Hop Tree (Pteiea ,rifo/iata).-Tht hop trees in the Substation planting have been growing in the hackberry row under a heavy canopy and have done very well in this location. They probably are one of the better plants tor planting in the shade. They have attained only the size ot large shrubs. 30. Roses.-On the whole, roses have not been especially satisfactory. Occasionally for a year or two, they have given excellent results. The Rosa rugosa has not done well because it is susceptible to chlorosis, but some of </seg>
         <seg id="p033">Trees, Shrubs, and Vines, North Platte Substation its hybrids have lived several years. The most hardy one was purchased under the name Amelia Gravereau. Most R. rugosa hybrids blossom heav - ily in the spring and lightly throughout the season, but the Grootendorst is an especially heavy and continuous bloomer. 1 ; The hybrid perpetuals have been planted from time to time. Occasionally they last for several years but usually for only a very few. The heavy crop of blossoms comes just at the time the rose chafer is active. There have been very few later blossoms. : The hybrid tea roses will bloom the first season if good two-year-old plants are set. Some of them will live over if given winter protection. The vacant places should be filled each season. This method may be rather ex - pensive but it will yield roses where they will seldom be obtained in any otherway. ; _"-'.'. L No practical results have been obtained with climbing roses, possibly be - cause they were not given special care. They will give a fair reward for skill - ed and devoted care. The American Pillar, a large, single, pink rose, is among the most hardy and vigorous. The Harrison yellow rose is hardy. The Hugonis (Rosa hugonis) has died back each year. The Petontaka, a large single pink rose, and some of the wild species are hardy and give some fine single blossoms. Several species of wild roses are being grown under cultivation. They make a very attractive showing at blossoming time, but many spread badly by underground rootstocks. . </seg>

Climbing Honeysuckles.—These vines are comparatively free from worms and Imps, and bloom throughout the summer. The flowers are suitable lor (able decoration. The Cora) honeysuckle (Lonicera semper - :¦ &gt;ens) has reddish-colored flowers and Hall Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera halliana—hon. var.) has yellow flowers. Both kinds are quite hardy. 5. Wild Grape (Vitis species).—This native grape vine is hardy, grows fairly fast, and is of special use in covering an arbor. It gives a quite dense shade, but may be troubled with leaf hoppers. The fruit is valuable for idly. The Beta grape, a named variety, is a hardy, rapid-growing grape, that may be used in arbors or on fences. It has the advantage of producing a larger fruit than the wild grape and is valuable in jellies and butters. The leaf hopper is its worst enemy. 6. Clematis (Clematis species).—The Clematis missouriensis is native in canyons in western Nebraska and is useful for trellises. 7. Matrimony Vine ( Lycium chineme) .—This vine has grown as a bush ;n the open plantings, but has vined on trees. It is difficult to eradicate. Other Climbers—rhe Wisteria (Wisteria sinensis) and Trumpet Creep - er (Bignoma radicans) have died back. They are not generally satisfactory.

         <seg id="p035">Trees, Shrubs, and Vines, North Platte Substation REFERENCE LISTS OF TREES, SHRUBS, AND VINES THAT HAVE BEEN TRIED AT NORTH PLATTE In the following section deciduous trees, conifers, and shrubs that have been tried at the North Platte Substation are listed in order to provide a record. Those marked with star (•) are more fully described in earlier sections of this bulletin. Definitions of terms used: Hardy is used in describing kinds that have been successful for five or more years. Semihardy is used for kinds that are not adapted for general planting, but have been hardy in protected locations. Not hardy is used for kinds that have been killed back continuously. Failure is used when they made a good start and died within the first few years. On trial is used when the trial has been less than five years, but were alive in the 1936 count. Several of these are native in Nebraska or adjoin - ing states, and are probably hardy within our region. Others may prove hardy or semihardy. Promising refers to a few that have been very good in at least five years' : trial. The kinds that have been received from the Office of Plant Intro - duction, U. S.
